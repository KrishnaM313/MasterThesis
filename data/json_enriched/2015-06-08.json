Friday of this week marks the 30th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Accession of Spain and Portugal to the European Union. This was an important step 30 years ago, because two nations that had suffered decades of dictatorships entered the democratic international community of Europe. Thirty years later, not every promise and desire has been fulfilled. But democracy in these countries has certainly been strengthened and stabilised, and the struggle against the forces of dictatorship and the backward-looking have been won. We are certainly confronted these days – especially when it comes to Spain and Portugal – with doubts about the promises that the European Union makes that prosperity must be combined with welfare for many and not with wealth for the few. I believe that, across all political lines, it is the common will of all Members in this House, beyond all political lines, to ensure, 30 years after this accession, that precisely this promise that the european union's internal market, the political and economic strength of our community – especially after the great sacrifices that the people of Spain and Portugal have made – leads to greater prosperity for many and, above all, to work for young people. , is held by us together.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2, "date": "2015-06-08.json", "name": "Martin SCHULZ", "mepid": "1911", "text": "   The minutes of the meeting of 27 May 2015 have been approved.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 3, "date": "2015-06-08.json", "name": "Emmanouil GLEZOS", "mepid": "1654", "text": "  GUE/NGL).

This is the so-called financial discipline mechanism that was foreseen in the Horizontal Regulation of December 2013 as part of the recent reform of the common agricultural policy. Its main objective is to establish a crisis reserve to support the agricultural sector in the event of major crises affecting agricultural production or the distribution of agricultural products. The total amount of the crisis reserve for the period of the 2014-2020 financial perspective was set at EUR 2.8 billion, which amounts to EUR 400 million per year in 2011 prices. The application of financial discipline to direct payments in 2015 is part of the preparation of the Union budget for 2016, in which the Commission included EUR 441.6 million in current prices in the draft crisis reserve. Following preliminary estimates of direct payments and expenditure related to the agricultural market, the European Commission assumed that an adjustment of direct payments of less than 1.4 per cent would be sufficient.  It should be emphasised here that this reduction will apply only to farmers receiving more than EUR 2 000 in payments per year. Furthermore, due to the investigation of full payments in Bulgaria, Croatia and Romania, financial discipline will not apply to these countries.  According to the Regulation, the weighting should be adopted within the framework of the codecision of the Council and Parliament by 30 June. Therefore, as soon as we received a request from the European Commission in our Committee on Agriculture in Parliament, we decided to apply the simplified and accelerated procedure provided for in Article 50 of the Rules of Procedure, according to which, as chairman of the committee responsible, I drafted the report without amendments after my report was adopted without amendments in the Committee on Agriculture and no amendments were tabled for this plenary session. I hope that in tomorrow's vote we will be able to finally adopt the European Commission's proposal unchanged. With a clear declaration by the Council, which also confirmed in writing its willingness to accept the Commission's proposal without amendments, this will mean that we will be able to reach an agreement at first reading within the time limit set by the regulation. Recent disturbances in Europe's agricultural markets due to the Russian embargo or the expiry of milk quotas show the importance of this crisis reserve. Its importance is further enhanced by the reduction of intervention mechanisms in the reform of the last common agricultural policy, or by the growing influence of external factors, such as the progressive liberalisation of world trade in the context of the profitability of European agriculture and European farmers.  I think that no one in this House needs to be convinced that agriculture is a very sensitive sector, highly dependent on weather, climate conditions, the price situation on world markets, speculation or international events. Therefore, in view of last year's controversy surrounding the agricultural budget, I would like to stress that the agricultural resources that flow back into the agricultural budget should remain there in order to be used to combat the effects of the crisis. I would like to emphasise that this reserve is created from measures that are in the common agricultural policy, farmers freeze them in a sense. We are taking part of the payments so that there are funds for the crisis reserve. If this reserve is not used, then these funds will go back to the farmers, so it can be said that farmers themselves create a reserve.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 28, "date": "2015-06-08.json", "name": "Phil Hogan", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, my brief intervention will not take long.

Currently, the rate of adjustment of direct payments is 1.39 % and approves payments for amounts in more than EUR 2 000 per farmer. According to the European executive, that adjustment aims to set up a financing reserve of around EUR 441 million compared to EUR 433 million in the previous year, which can be used in the event of a crisis in the agricultural sector.

The setting of this coefficient, as well as the crisis reserve for the financial year 2016 at EUR 441.6 million in current prices, means that this reserve can be used for agricultural crises.

Although the creation of a correction factor and the creation of a crisis reserve means that the envelopes for national direct payments per EU country are adequately scaled down, we believe that it is appropriate and necessary to create this reserve in such precarious agricultural management conditions. Indeed, the Russian embargo on food products originating in EU countries is ongoing, the situation on many agricultural markets – even on the milk market – is falling the buying-in prices of many agricultural crops, and finally the opening up of EU markets to food imports from third countries is progressing by reducing EU tariffs.

The aim of the creation of this instrument is to have funds to deal with the market crisis where significant. However, this reserve is set at EUR 442 million; it is an added effort for European producers, who see their direct aid reduced to cover market eventualities which could often be covered by using the budgetary margin - as long as we do not continue to scratch funds from that margin to finance projects outside of strict agricultural spending. The reserve has not been used until now and, in the future, it must be avoided to deal with critical situations caused by causes outside the agricultural sector. This was the case with the embargo decreed by Russia, since 7 August last year. The Commission's immediate reaction was to take over the reserve, but fortunately the majority response was contrary to that measure, which would have made our farmers and ranchers 'head of The Turk' of a political decision for which they had no responsibility.

That is why I welcome the concern of the Commission in general and Commissioner Phil Hogan in particular to always refer to the realities on the ground designed to provide an opportunity to take the best measures for the agricultural sector. In this respect, the adjustment rate should be offered to apply only to the amount of direct payments for which aid applications were submitted in 2015, without taking into account the time when payments were made to farmers, precisely as Member States have the possibility to make late payments after that payment period within a certain time limit. However, I would like to draw attention to the inadmissible differences between direct payments between Member States today, with all the responsibility and all due respect to the European institutions, to the inadmissible differences between direct payments between Member States, which creates major imbalances. Never can a subsidy of EUR 150 received by a Romanian farmer be equal to a subsidy of EUR 700-800 as a farmer from another State receives on the same unit of measure, which seems to me to be profoundly incorrect. The Commission must therefore ensure, in the future, that the differences between farmers in the European Union are eliminated, ensuring equal treatment, with the obligation, however, to take account of the particularities of each area as a consequence of membership of the single European area. Last but not least, the Commission must continue to be concerned about the need to strike, on the one hand, a balance between supporting the performance achieved by farmers and, on the other hand, affordable and cheap food for all the inhabitants of the European Union and beyond.

I have already highlighted this aspect in the report for opinion on the 2016 budget, which I drafted under the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. In the course of 2016, in the event of a major crisis, the ceiling margins available in heading 2 should be used as a priority in terms of commitment appropriations for the 2016 budget.

Eu financial support has therefore been of great importance in the past year for many family farms, but also for related sectors. Because it's hard to keep your head above water. Nevertheless, most of the money has gone to the fruit and vegetable sector - that is good - and to the dairy sector, but we also have other sectors. The pig farming sector has certainly been hit very hard by the boycott in the Netherlands. Crisis funds should benefit all sectors and it should also be clarified how these crisis funds can be used. Smaller sectors often have a lot of difficulty with this.  I also call for the use of all the resources available in the future from the crisis pot. After all, we all know that the unused funds flow back to arable land and dairy farmers. There's nothing wrong with that, but people still need the money.

I welcome the Commission's proposal, as it safeguards small producers by exempting direct payments below EUR 2 000 from the application of the fee. Already last year this occurred and at the end of the year we were debating what to do with the surplus in the heading related to agriculture, with very strong positions on both sides, in which some wanted it to be absorbed into the Commission's overall budget and many argued that it should be reinvested in the sector. We cannot continue to pass this message on to our producers, because if there is some kind of financial surplus in the sector it should be used to avoid cutting direct payments to farmers in the following year. Commissioner, although this measure is included in the CAP regulation, extraordinary situations require extraordinary decisions. European farmers are exposed to a number of risk factors that jeopardise their activity and income. I am talking about the Russian embargo which, despite the commission's timely and timely interventions, has caused a serious crisis in the sector, which we are still feeling. I am talking about the impact of the end of dairy quotas; we are still in an adjustment phase, but the loss of income in certain regions, such as the outermost regions, has been accentuated.  The Russian embargo is an example of how a political and diplomatic decision was a direct economic sanction to our agricultural producers. As this crisis did not originate in the sector, I believe that all commission interventions to continue to mitigate the negative impacts of this situation do not go away from this heading. I also believe that part of this money should be allocated to the Milk Observatory, with more and better skills and instruments for market intervention and regulation, so that it can effectively intervene in the milk market, which runs through many European regions, such as the outermost regions, a serious crisis that needs to mitigate.

A better, more flexible and more liberal CAP, which allows farmers to be globally competitive, is the answer to crises and will stop them having an effect in the future. However, my real problem with this is the unfairness of the funding measures. A threshold of EUR 2 000 means that Member States with the largest farms will contribute the most.

I see the situation somewhat differently from Mr Dalton. I believe that the Russia embargo was by no means caused by the farmers and that we have the task of intervening in this area. And I believe that this embargo also shows how important the crisis reserve in the agricultural sector is. Across Europe, for example, these special measures have really significantly relieved the fruit and vegetable market. For Austria, for example, this means additional funds of EUR 100 000 for export measures to third countries, which do indeed relieve the markets very much and thus also help farmers. And I think that these are important measures in times of crisis. However, and I would like to make this very clear, we are still very much in need of more work to be done here. Communication, for example in the case of immediate measures, needs to be significantly improved. Above all, we need a lean and efficient settlement system. Aid in times of crisis must not become a skewering run for farmers and more bureaucracy. I would really like to ask the Commission to present a comprehensive evaluation of the extraordinary special measures.

Our group will vote in favour of mr Siekierski's draft report, which we approved in the Committee on Agriculture under the simplified procedure. However, this debate gives us the opportunity to emphasise that the mechanism of financial discipline is the result of a reduction in the agricultural budget decided with the 2014-2020 Financial Perspective, which have left the agricultural budget with no room to respond to crises. But crises, as has been said, are becoming more and more frequent – and as demonstrated by the russian embargo – and, in addition, prices are suffering from increasing volatility. It is the farmers themselves, through the reduction of the first pillar of the CAP, who have to pay for these crises. From a long-term perspective, Commissioner, we must therefore rethink the crisis management instruments, new and stronger instruments that can represent a safety net for farmers and thus make them compete without fear in the global market. Finally, Commissioner, in the last parliamentary term, Parliament argued that financial discipline should only apply to farmers receiving more than EUR 5 000, in order to be able to provide greater protection for small farmers. Unfortunately, in the final agreement, the threshold was then set at EUR 2 000.

The planning of the agricultural budget for 2016 under the Multiannual Financial Framework, which is one of the most complex mechanisms of the European Union, regulated on the basis of the Common Agricultural Policy, requires planning and adequate reserves for cases of major crises in the sector.

But I can make a suggestion here, and I see Commissioner Hogan is turning round to have a look at me – well, I am rather flattered: thank you very much. British farmers are sustaining a 15% pay cut due to the weakness of the euro. Why is the euro so weak? Because it is being used by countries which never should have been allowed to join a single currency in the first place. This may not constitute an act of God, which is what the fund should be used for, but it is an act of the Commission – an institution that has assumed the mantle of deity and can accordingly be included in this definition. This fund could therefore be used as a replacement for what used to be called the ‘green pound’. This would help to offset the sharp drop in direct payments to British farmers and go a small way to compensating for loss of export opportunities and the undercutting of their domestic price by cheap eurozone imports. This is not an argument for the UK itself to join the euro, and I am sure that is what you will try and convince us to do, Commissioner – but, had we done so, British taxpayers would be impoverished to the extent that they would struggle to finance the CAP at all. It is convenient for Member States to forget that the UK is a massive net contributor to the CAP, and our taxpayers should have the comfort of knowing that their money is at least being used to support domestic agriculture and local food, as opposed to propping up a failed economic project.

I want to commend the last common agricultural policy reform, and the people associated with approving it, for providing a crisis reserve without requiring additional finance to be provided for agriculture. This, in essence, shows the solidarity of the European Union with the farming community at times of crisis. I welcome the support shown here today for the proposal which will establish this reserve for 2015 for the benefit of farmers in particular difficulties. The crisis reserve is solidarity in action. After all, as I said, it is funded from the existing resources of the farming community. Many Members raised the Russian ban and its consequences for European farmers. I want to remind you that, last October, the Commission had a proposal which would have utilised the crisis reserve of EUR 433 million for that particular foreign policy decision. In November the new Commission was in a position to reverse that decision and to provide from other sources the resources necessary to show solidarity with the farming community at times of difficulty, arising from the Russian ban. If fully drawn down, these measures will cost EUR 350 million, without reference to the crisis reserve. Members like Mr Dantin who made considerable representations on these matters will, of course, recall these particular measures very well. But I know that many Members have forgotten these particular decisions that were made in November in order to counter the concerns of many members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development (AGRI) at that time. I wish to thank Budget Commissioner Georgieva for being very sympathetic to providing that positive outcome for European farmers at a difficult time. I would say to Ms Schreijer-Pierik, in relation to pigmeat, that I opened Aids to Private Storage in order to recognise the difficulties for pigmeat producers in many Member States. This scheme was open for about 10 weeks. It provided a withdrawal from the market of a significant tonnage from the pigmeat sector, and it has certainly stabilised incomes for many pigmeat producers. I also provided an opportunity for additional promotion measures for the pigmeat sector to replace some of the market share that was going to Russia, particularly in countries like the Philippines in the Far East, which now account for 73% of the products in the pigmeat sector that had been going to Russia. So the market-orientated policy that you have voted for and supported is working in action in relation to how we are dealing with the pigmeat sector. In terms of the application of financial discipline adjustment, it is important to remind ourselves that small farmers throughout the EU are exempted by the application of the EUR 2000 threshold, below which the adjustment rate does not apply. I know that when Mr Ashworth said earlier that, because of their farm structure, a lot of farmers in the UK – and indeed in other Member States – would not have to pay this particular contribution, he was certainly reflecting the reality of the fact that larger and medium-sized producers are the ones in a better position to pay for this particular instrument. Mr Agnew made another very valuable contribution with regard to the UK staying in Europe, because he will know better than anybody that looking for EUR 25 billion – which is the amount of money that the European Union is subsidising British farmers at the moment – will be very difficult when you are competing with the public services around the Cabinet table of a UK government. The EU is quite generous to British farmers – and rightly so – in addition to all of the other farmers in the Union. I would subscribe to the view that the EU will always be more supportive of agriculture and rural development measures in the UK than its own government is. I want to conclude by repeating my welcome for the proposal, and I look forward to a positive vote tomorrow.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 64, "date": "2015-06-08.json", "name": "Czesław Adam SIEKIERSKI", "mepid": "23787", "text": "   Rapporteur. – This report is formal and technical and the discussion was very substantive, which I would like to emphasise and thank you for. The accelerated procedure for the adoption of this document means a high degree of agreement between the Council, Parliament and the Commission, which is worth highlighting in these responses to needs or in difficult situations. There was talk of solidarity, because in fact almost everyone, with the exception of the smallest ones, is consisting of almost everyone, and these farmers, who are affected by a difficult crisis, are benefiting from this aid. This solidarity is therefore extremely important. Let us remember that agriculture has its own peculiarities: it depends on climatic, weather, external conditions. At the moment, there is still a very clear dependence on the international situation. Hence the need for certain instruments that are not always able to generate a free market.  The free market requires some support to address these agricultural emergencies. Let us also remember that the great weakness of the reform of the common agricultural policy, which we are implementing at the moment, is precisely the reduction in forms of intervention on agricultural markets. I have spoken about the advisability of these interventions, and in this limitation we have gone too far. That is why it is important to manage the market well – because we have less money at the moment for the CAP at the moment, less money for agricultural matters. I think we cannot say such things that the CAP is leading to a crisis. The CAP supports agriculture and supports consumers – because this means that support for agriculture is cheaper for food and therefore consumers pay less for the products they buy.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report, which is a very important one. Before I would like to say a few words about the EU's strategy for equality between women and men after 2015, I would like to express my sincere thanks to all those who have helped to launch a good, balanced strategy. This thanks go very well to the shadow rapporteurs and their teams, as well as to the numerous associations and experts. A heartfelt thank you also to the secretariat of the committee – the cooperation was truly exemplary. The strategy has a major objective: to move gender equality in Europe in the right direction. This equality is already enshrined in the first European Treaties, but unfortunately everyday life in Europe is different. That is why we now finally need a strategy that shows a way forward in a targeted and powerful way and, above all, proposes concrete solutions. I see four specific objectives at the heart of this. In Europe, 500 million people live in very different life situations: young and older people in families and as singles, with and without disabilities, with European citizenship and without. An important objective of our strategy must be to take account of this diversity and to keep an eye on everyone, really everyone. A second point: good equality policy can be recognised by the fact that issues must not be considered in isolation and individually, but must always be interdependent. It is therefore an important objective of the strategy to disclose the relationships between the thematic areas and to develop an overall strategy. Growth and employment are important issues, but they must not obscure other issues: issues such as violence, health, media, work, time, finance and so on. In addition, the EU must always stand up for the values of equality in its external relations. A third point: effective equality policy must always be measured against four points – an honest analysis of the situation, the recognition of progress, the identification of problems and then the display of very concrete solutions. One of the aims of my report is to make realistic proposals and suggestions by taking an honest look at the reality of life. Fourthly, responsible equality policy does not promise rapid success. Settings changes take time. A very important objective of my report is to recognise subsidiarity and to present what is politically possible in a very differentiated and clear way. Best practice models are particularly important here in order to inspire Member States and to support them on their own path. Ladies and gentlemen, together with the shadow rapporteurs, we have managed to enshrine all these objectives in the report. There are many suggestions, ideas and ideas of European citizens. Europe is a community of values. With the adoption of the strategy for gender equality, we are taking a step in the right direction. And we go it together, with all the women and with all the men in Europe.

The Commission’s commitment in this respect is as strong as ever. Equality between women and men is a fundamental value, an objective of the European Union and also a driver for economic growth. It is the Commission’s firm intention to continue to promote equality in all EU activities, internal and external, as required by the Treaty. My staff have started a consultative process with major stakeholders and the broader public, as all their views and experience are very important in terms of shaping our future activity. I would like to thank Parliament, and in particular the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, for its contribution to the Forum on the Future of Gender Equality in the European Union, organised in April this year. We are also cooperating closely with the Member States and other important stakeholders such as the social partners and civil society. We are interested in an inclusive process, taking advantage of the expertise of others. Let me highlight the areas where I believe we need, together, to step up our efforts: achieving economic independence in equality; the eradication of gender-based violence; and the defence and promotion of women’s rights and gender equality at global level. These correspond to a large extent to the priorities identified in your report. If we want women to be economically independent, we need to address the existing gender gaps, be they in pay, participation or pensions. As said in your report, we must also not ignore the high number of women living in poverty and social exclusion. Our tools are the monitoring of the situation in the context of the Europe 2020 Strategy and the possibility of proposing Country Specific Recommendations; the implementation and enforcement of the EU legislation; and the exchange of good practices and mutual learning. We should reflect on a new approach to tackling work-life balance. Both women and men should be able to participate fully in the labour market while not giving up on their family life. The challenges are to improve the accessibility of care facilities and the effective provision of family leave and flexible working arrangements, paying particular attention to the participation of men. Also, we still need more women in decision-making positions, be it in companies, in the economy or in politics. Negotiations on our directive, setting a 40% target for the under-represented sex on company boards, are an absolute priority for us, and we need to conclude this proposal. Our approach is merit-based, putting the focus on a fair and transparent selection process, which will bring about significant change. As to violence against women, one in three women in the EU has experienced violence. We have to find policy responses that bring about a real improvement in the lives of women and girls in Europe. This includes looking into the possibility of the EU acceding to the Istanbul Convention. I strongly believe that this Council of Europe convention is a powerful common framework for combating violence against women. When addressing violence against women we need to combine the internal and the external perspective. I will work closely with colleagues Mogherini and Mimica to tackle the phenomenon of female genital mutilation (FGM), including beyond the EU. We will look at all available means of ensuring gender equality: legislation and its effective implementation, funding of projects and campaigns, and gender mainstreaming with specific measures. We also need a monitoring system with clear indicators so as to make ourselves accountable to EU citizens. I count on your support in working together to achieve equality between women and men.

Making full use of women's qualifications, education and talents brings real profits to businesses and the economy. The presence of women on boards, the presence of women in positions is associated with the company's profits. The presence of women in the labour market has a significant impact on the level of their pensions and is the first reason that can help close the pension gap – the 39% pension gap in Europe is a great shame, this pension gap should be the first starting point and reference for building equality policies, and we know well that to do this we need crèches, kindergartens, care services and the possibility of reconciling work and family life.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 74, "date": "2015-06-08.json", "name": "Ildikó GÁLL-PELCZ", "mepid": "102886", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Commissioner, honourable Report-making Woman, I would like to thank you for your support.

To my colleague from the EPP Group, since he came up with an alternative proposal, I would like to say that the EPP group is not ambitious. It is not committed, it does not show funding, it does not show a legislative position.  I find it a real pity on the part of this Parliament not to be able to send a clear message even though the strategies of the past tell us that more needs to be done. Even today, there are discriminations in employment and employment rates that are not favourable to women. Discrimination in wages and pensions, as well as ethical discrimination, continues to exist. Women are victims of violence in Europe today. They do not have access to sexual and reproductive health everywhere.  We must ensure that these discriminations are abolished in our system in Europe, but not only in Europe. We also want Europe to be a driving force in external relations so that it can promote this equality in the world.  Europe has the opportunity to do so and it must have the ambition to do so. This Parliament must make that commitment.  As you have said, Commissioner, you need a clear message from this Parliament and Mrs Noichl's report goes in that direction.

Such an ideal strategy should be a field of cooperation between women and men and be based on access to equal opportunities in a way that respects and appreciates the natural differences between them. However, the report that is being discussed with the actual idea of equality has nothing to do with it. Promotes abortion as one of reproductive rights, interferes with education by implementing a gender perspective at every level of education, calls for the adoption of a directive establishing gender quotas on company supervisory boards, undermines the natural identity of the family, promotes LGBT parenting, and points to the duty to combat stereotypes and traditional perceptions of the roles of women and men, and calls for the involvement of the Commission and the Member States in the in vitro procedure. The provisions of the report interfere with the competences of the Member States and are incompatible with national rules. This report is a set of different solutions: good and bad, but unfortunately the bad ones will open the door to social dismantling and under-balancing the institutions of the family. It is these threats that are at the heart of it. This report must not be accepted, which is why I will support Amendment 1 tomorrow, which respects the division of competences between the Union and the Member States and takes into account the norms of international and EU law in the field of health and family policy.

Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank the Commissioner for her excellent work and for the work she has done. First of all, I would like to thank my colleague Maria Noichl in the first form for the truly excellent work she has done here. The report we voted for in committee criticises the growing stalemate in gender equality and calls on the Commission to develop a new EU strategy for women's rights and equality between women and men after 2015. I am pleased that I have been able to contribute to a report that sets the political course for equality between women and men for the next five years and which contains concrete proposals for improvement on many important issues. We have managed to develop a holistic package of measures that deal with disadvantages in different areas of life. Violence against women, the difficult role of women in the labour market and the issue of reproductive health are just a few examples of the issues raised by this report. And only by making holistic and comprehensive proposals to the Commission can we manage to improve the situation of women in Europe and make equality between women and men a priority for the EU. Unfortunately, as we have just heard, however, there are Colleagues who oppose this report, hiding behind the protective cloak of subsidiarity. I would like to remind these very members that we will not be voting on a legislative report tomorrow, and more importantly, that we are talking here about measures that will achieve our European values, as the previous speakers and, above all, the Commissioner have already stressed – namely those common and universal values, which are clearly enshrined in Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union. Furthermore, Article 23 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights explicitly provides for the adoption of measures to strengthen the under-represented sex. Therefore, I do not think that we can speak of a lack of a legal basis in this case. I hope that, in tomorrow's vote, we will be able to send a strong signal for a new strategy for gender equality, thereby proving that Europe takes its responsibility towards women seriously. We must not lose sight of one thing: the real problem is that we are writing 2015 and that there is not a single country in this whole world where women are equal to men. I very much hope that we will be able to find a clear answer in this House in this regard.

Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating Mr First of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Noichl, and the other colleagues in the Committee on Gender Equality for their work together. For us in the GUE/NGL, gender equality and feminism are absolutely central to the societies in which we want to build and live. It is fundamental to fairer societies, to a future that values equality, that sees that our democracies today are not democratic enough and that sees that our economies must integrate both production and reproduction. It takes quite a lot of changes to make up with hundreds, not to say perhaps thousands, of years of patriarchal dominion. So the dream of a society on an equal footing is a big dream, and women's struggle for justice and equality has been paved with difficulties and resistance – everything from the right to vote, the right to work, the right to inherit, the right to abortion and contraception. I am proud and grateful for the sisters who went before me, before us sitting here tonight. But they will also be our yardstick, and it is surprising how much resistance is actually left.  We who work on these issues do not always share the same feminist strategies, but most of us are actually genuinely interested in building societies that are more equal, where girls and boys, women and men have the same opportunities and rights, and that we are entering the future. It is about the struggle for financial independence, the struggle for a life that is not limited by violence and the threat of violence, a society in which we expand the lives of girls and women, where girls are allowed to grow up in firm belief that the right to their own body and their own sexuality is theirs, not just on paper in a legal clause, but really, for real.  Young women do not want to live in the Europe of old men. They want an assembly here that is taking new steps and it is a long time since the EU actually did anything to create a more equal society. In fact, legislation for a few hundred women in the board of directors is not enough. This report on which we are going to vote tomorrow is not perfect, but it is ambitious, as some colleagues have said. It takes a holistic approach and it has been supported and wet in the Committee on Gender Equality, and civil society has had its say.  This is not about subsidiarity, it is about whether we support women's rights and gender equality or whether we continue to be part of the old conservative resistance.

Without full access for women to economic independence, without equal representation of women in our decision-making structures, without women having power over their own bodies, we will not reach full equality. The European Parliament cannot merely claim this; we need to act and to propose legislation to really implement this equality, including basic rights such as sexual and reproductive rights. When we say ‘my body, my choice’ this statement means much more than just deciding in relation to our reproductive organs. It means empowerment for all women, reclaiming the power over their own bodies, reclaiming a power and a right that we hold, but that have been taken away from us in the last hundreds of years – a right that is so simple and so clear that it makes me sad that we still have to fight for it today. To those on the right of the House, I would say this: it is simply untrue constantly to claim that asking for sexual and reproductive rights is promoting abortion. The exact opposite is true. Asking for sexual and reproductive rights means giving women back the power over their own bodies. It means fighting against the fact that, still today, 68 000 women die in unsafe and illegal abortions each year. I tell you here and now that if you want to fight against abortion, do not fight us – do not fight the women asking to have control over their bodies. Fight for the empowerment of women; fight for sex education; fight for free access to contraception; fight for a society where women can make choices; fight for sexual and reproductive rights – because abortions, especially in illegal and unsafe surroundings, are much more frequent in countries with very restrictive laws on abortion, where women do not hold the right over their own body and where they do not have access to contraception. So colleagues, please vote in favour of the initial report as proposed by Ms Noichl, and empower women to have a right over their own bodies. When we talk about women, we need to see the whole picture. Without acknowledging the diversity of our struggles, we will never reach full emancipation. Lesbian women, women of colour, trans women, women with disabilities, poor women, young and old women – all must have their needs and demands reflected in this joint strategy for gender equality post 2015. And yes, we will also need male allies, because this struggle is not only the cherry on the cake: as I said, it is a struggle that will change our entire societies for all of us, making them more just, more inclusive and more resilient.

Indeed, while we must support and praise the attention that is being paid to issues such as discrimination in the workplace, pay diversity or the fight against violence against women, with yet another call for ratification of the Istanbul Convention for the various Member States that have not yet done so, there are, on the other hand– some aspects in this report that are perplexing. We are witnessing yet another attempt to include issues which are supposed to be the responsibility of the European Union and which are and should remain the responsibility of the Member States.  In fact, if you read the title of this report, you expect a certain type of content, namely measures to promote equality between men and women – and instead we are faced with the imposition of issues that have nothing or little to do with this subject. I would like the reports of the Committee on Women's Rights not to be used periodically to become the receptacle from time to time where interference by one or more lobbies, which should not interfere with issues of equality between men and women, can be brought together. I would also have liked to see, in addition to the call for a gender-conscious pedagogical training campaign for teachers, so that they can convey the values of gender equality, there should also be an explicit reference to education and feelings towards young people. Why is that? Because a boy who grows up with an awareness of respect for the woman, understanding what it really means to love her, will become a man unable to abuse a future companion with psychological and physical violence. On the other hand, if we read the statistics, in the vast majority of cases feminicides take place at the hands of their partner.  From now on, I call for the individual aspects included in the reports not to obscure the many positive elements on which we must focus our attention and on which we must work.

We all know that the economic crisis and austerity measures have not treated men and women equally. Women left at a disadvantage and this disadvantage increased during the crisis. We have seen a regression in the progress made towards gender equality and we must be able to give a sensitive and firm response to gender issues in an attempt to reverse this trend. The adoption of this report will be a very important step in this direction. I would remind you that in most countries affected by the economic crisis, we are seeing an increasing feminisation of poverty. The main beneficiaries of food banks are women and with at least one child. In Europe, there are on average seven times more single-parent families headed by women than men. Many women's reception centres who are victims of violence have been forced to close due to budget cuts. Poor or at-risk women are more likely to do poor, precarious and unusual work, and also face the risk of exploitation and trafficking in human beings. Freezing pensions in the context of austerity puts older women at greater risk of poverty. And finally, women depend more than men in terms of tax benefits.  These and many other warnings come to us from everywhere and we insist on ignoring them. Many European governments have actually implemented austerity measures that aggravate the negative effect of the economic crisis on women. It is therefore essential to be in mind that constraints on women's economic autonomy constitute obstacles to the protection of basic rights and human dignity itself.

Schools are the exclusive responsibility of the Member States and no one else, especially the EU Commission! And then, of course, it's about sex education. Should this be done according to the standards of sex education in Europe, by the World Health Organisation, the Regional Office for Europe, framework for educational institutions?

Why are we talking about strategy for equality between men and women? Because it's a goal, because it's a goal, because we haven't made it.  The ongoing evaluations of the current strategy show that we have achieved some of the objectives, but progress has been slow and uneven, and we still have many challenges to overcome. Unfortunately, in the European Union we have several examples of Member States that are regressing on equality.  The beneficial effects of gender equality on society as a whole and in all areas – economic, social and political – are more than proven, and above all because it is the greatest guarantee of an egalitarian society that rests on fundamental rights that give meaning to our value system.  The European Union recognises in the Treaties equality between women and men as a fundamental courage and objective. That is why this report is of crucial importance: it sets out the strategy for the Union's work programme for the next five years.  The European Parliament needs to send a strong and determined political message on progress on gender equality, and also to international actors who, like the United Nations, are waiting for us to send a clear and firm signal to support their work on gender equality, a key part of the 2015-2030 development goals. Mrs Jourová, the Commission's 2015-2020 equality strategy will be the first major work of the first police station which specifically includes gender equality in its portfolio. Let us take note of the mistakes made in the 2010-2015 Strategy so as not to repeat them: their implementation has been hampered by a lack of resources and limited capacities, but the necessary resources must be allocated for the investment to bear fruit and to link explicit actions, objectives, deadlines and responsibilities.  From Parliament's Committee on Women's Rights, we have taken note of these problems and made a balanced proposal, which seeks to respond to all areas where inequality exists.

And I think, anyway, I'm surprised that others find it excessive and even dangerous. At any rate, I find it prudent and in some respects even self-limiting. We're certainly going to give him determined support. Here too, also in the field of gender equality, we need Europe more and better, not to replace member states, but to add, to complement, to help countries and regions complete their own path with this common objective of gender equality.  Let me talk about three very specific issues: education, economic crisis and market and social roles. In education—not said so far—the role of early childhood education must be emphasized. It is more than proven: early incorporation into education has great effects in the field of gender equality and in the field of long-term personal independence. The positive correlation between the two issues is fully proven. And, second educational topic, the initial training of teachers and educators is essential if we are to achieve success in this field.  Second, economic crisis and new migrations. In recent years Europe has lost, it has gone backwards in this field. The economic crisis has produced havoc, very clear damage to gender equality. It seems to me that we have been victims of the supposed virtues of the free market and we have then been punished for austerity policies, for budget cuts. In addition, new internal migrations add the complexity derived from cultural and religious diversity, very often in contrast to and contradiction with the European references so far, which seemed consolidated. That is why specific policies must be adopted. The European Union cannot be limited to a monitoring or measurement role. It needs to take a proactive attitude of promotion, support and accompaniment to each country, including the definition of objectives, the programming of appropriate policies and resources and the shared monitoring of their compliance. And finally: market and social roles. We have lived on the absolute imposition of the free market, the incitement to unlimited consumption, the maximum exploitation of male and female roles, precisely. These are features associated with the economic model of financial deregulation and globalization of exchanges that, for thirty years, he has wanted to define us. We will not move forward on gender equality without a clear rectification of that course. It makes no sense that all public policies, all educational efforts are negatively compensated by social and economic behavior that, day after day, confirms and expands stereotypes, roles and functions awarded to each gender. And you have to change them both: the feminine one, no doubt; but also the masculine one, which reproduces habits of exercise of power or domination, and which entails female subordination and dependence.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "Verts/ALE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 98, "date": "2015-06-08.json", "name": "Louise BOURS", "mepid": "124964", "text": "   – Mr President, the resolution urges the adoption of a directive for the balanced representation of men and women on boards. This is a piece of EU legislation that allows for sanctions such as the dissolution of a company just because it has not succeeded in reaching the arbitrary target imposed by the European Union. You do not fight discrimination with discrimination. Bringing in quotas is demeaning for women – the women who have worked hard and made it to the top of their professions. It should not matter what gender you are or what your ethnic background or religion is: if you are the best-qualified person for that job, you should get it. But with the instigation of these policies, people could look around the boardroom and question whether a colleague is the best person for the job, or if they simply obtained their position because their gender ticked the right boxes on the EU checklist. Paragraph 56 calls for the Commission to create best-practice models for sex and relationship education for young people. Paragraph 60 urges the Commission to implement sex education programmes in schools and ensure counselling and access to contraception. It is outrageous, absolutely outrageous, that the EU seeks to interfere with the Member States’ education systems, especially with regard to sex education. And, to top things off, in the explanatory statement you even say who should be doing the housework. If I can quote directly from it: ‘men will have to devote more time to the housework’. What kind of organisation interferes to this extent in the private lives of people, their marriages and their partnerships? It is up to adults in the privacy of their own homes to decide who does what. It is not the place of any government, and it certainly is not the place of EU bureaucrats to decide who does and who does not do the dishes.

Unfortunately, the report does not focus on what is really important and what we can help. After all, we know that women's salaries have not been increased, that there is indeed still a 16% difference in the European Union, that there is still a pension gap, 39% between women and men, that although there is a large proportion of women in universities, this does not correspond to the number in which women are represented in business leaders, political positions or universities. I think that this report simply does not respond to what is essential. Why is this the case? Why are women less paid, why do they have more trouble asserting themselves? This is natural, because women simply have one more crucial role in which they are not substitutable, and that is their role as a mother. This, of course, makes them handicapped in some way when pursuing their professional careers. The result of insufficient support measures is that most European nations are dying out. Europe has no problem with women not having access to abortion and reproductive care, abortion is a lot in Europe, but women are not sufficiently valued and supported in their reconciliation of maternal and parental function. That is why the European People's Party is coming up with its opinion, which highlights what really needs to be done, i.e. to support women in flexible working hours through public policies, incentives for businesses, the need to ensure a reduction in the pay gap and women's pensions.

The general pay gap in the EU is currently 16.4% – women earn 16.4% less than men despite having the same job and doing the same tasks. This injustice is due to a number of factors.  It comes from the fact that men have almost always been housed in decision-making positions and thus had control over wage setting. It comes from the fact that we women have long been seen as merely a means of reproduction, which means that the female worker is far more unreliable than her male colleague because she is expected to have children. The different treatment of men and women is not just a problem at the moment – it also poses enormous problems for the future, such as the 39% pension gap in the EU, which puts women in an unsustainable situation throughout their lives.  Women make up more than half of Europe's population, but only 18.6% of eu board members are women and only 5% of eu-executive directors are women.  It is therefore time that, as a first step, we seriously reviewed what measures are needed to ensure that women have the same opportunities as men to lead companies and companies. At the same time, we must also dare to break the standard that values men more when it comes to wage setting.

Sadly in force, because we have not managed to solve any: no economic independence for women; nor equal pay; nor equality in decision-making places; nor are we done with sexist violence; nor have we applied the gender perspective in our foreign policy.  The post-2015 strategy is therefore an urgency and a vital need for this craving for equality to come, and equality is the only way to truly ensure compliance with human rights in the European Union.  We cannot therefore adopt a weak strategy that does not have specific and measurable measures. In this regard, with the nuances of our amendments, this report is welcome and I would like to thank the rapporteur for her work.  We must send the European Commission a very clear message. Equality policy is not a secondary issue, it is not an element that we must face because feminist groups are very persistent: it is a vital element.  I have traveled all over the world reporting on the situation of women in Africa, in India: women subjected to forced marriages, mutilation, systematic violence. And I am saddened that in Europe, an oasis amid the terrible situation of women, there are still voices who do not want a strategy that is strongly saddened by equality and which are shocked when we talk about demanding the gender perspective in all political areas. Because here we also have problems, terrible problems, some colleague has indicated this before: one in three European women has experienced sexist violence. We call on the European Commission to be strong, to require member countries that have not yet done so to sign the Istanbul Convention. We ask you to openly push for a European directive against gender-based violence and to clearly point out the legislation of those countries that hide, with formulas such as crime of passion, the brutality of sexist violence.  I am surprised by the statements of a certain part of this House on the imposition of Europe with these strategies in matters such as education or sexual and reproductive rights, or quotas on the board of directors: of course Europe has to have an opinion and demand action in these matters! It is that equality between all citizens of the European Union is a fundamental objective. Have we forgotten about this? It's in all the Treaties! The parties that are represented here mostly agree with these Treaties: in the countries where they govern, they support them. Why do they say when they come here that Europe is getting into national or state issues?  And the only way to ensure this equality is to intervene in education as well. Sexist stereotypes are maintained and even reinforced in European youth.  The future is not very promising. If Europe makes any sense, it is to join forces to improve the lives of citizens, beyond the states, where states do not arrive. And in the fight for equality, the reports are clear: they don't come.

Eighty percent of victims of trafficking in the EU are women, and most of them, as we know, are trafficked for the purposes of sexual exploitation. We really must do everything that we can to end what is, in effect, modern slavery. We all know there is a directive on human trafficking, but the problem with this has been its implementation. In her report, Maria Noichl calls on Member States to fully implement the Anti-Trafficking Directive. We must do everything that we can in our own Member States to make sure that this is happening, because this is one of the areas where the EU has huge competence. It is the only organisation that can deal with it, because human trafficking is something which has to be done across borders, across countries and across nationalities. We know that our citizens want this, and I know it as a representative of London, which is one of the destinations for trafficked women. Therefore I think we have a particular responsibility, not only in terms of gender equality in itself but particularly in human trafficking. I would say that human trafficking is important for gender equality because the women involved are poor and vulnerable.

Fortunately, we no longer have such conditions in Europe. But that's why we're not all right. As long as it is not self-evident in the European Union that men and women have equal access to all areas – and I stress that men and women – we have not yet achieved equality and we must write gender reports. It is true that this access is not yet there. We know that men and women are different. In private life, this complements each other quite well and we also deal with each other naturally. In business and politics, however, this is by no means the case. Precisely because men and women are different and have such different qualities, we should also share them. We have seen that an economy can work better if you have mixed teams. Why don't we do that? Why do we still have too few women in politics? As long as that is the case, we really need to see that we can be more successful and do more. A pay gap – that is, unequal pay for equal work – is improbably unfair, and there must be no such thing at all. We must definitely combat this.

I certainly support and congratulate the rapporteur on the European Union strategy for equality between women and men after 2015. It is a report that is ambitious, which actually draws attention to things that have been going on for many years, and I think it is a good thing that we are also talking about this subject today, because, in fact, gender equality is one of the basic values in the European Union, which has already been recognised in the Treaties and in the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Although the European Union is working on strengthening gender equality, unfortunately at times it seems that this is a process that is far from over, and even more so that this process has even slowed down slightly in recent years, perhaps also because the previous Commission's strategy was somewhat too weak. Therefore, the new strategy will have to give new impetus and lead to concrete measures to strengthen women's rights and promote gender equality.  I do not think that, of course, in these times, we can remain tied to unhelpful and also environmentally unsustainable economic models based on the outdated division of work on the basis of sex. Of course, the economic crisis also contributed, when, as my colleague before me said, it forced many women into these pre-erumatic relationships and, in fact, deepened poverty in some areas.  Therefore, of course, it is also the task of the European Union to come up with appropriate economic and financial incentives to reduce gender inequalities, in addition to reports and strategies, because this is one of the key issues if we are to move these differences forward. Of course, we can talk at the declaratory level about equality, but if, as in the employment of young people, we do the same in the area of gender equality, that is to say, economic incentives, we will, of course, talk about the same problem next year. So I think there needs to be a more decisive step here, and also what my colleagues say, that this is, of course, a matter of subsidity, that this is, of course, also a matter for families, that this is an internal issue, not true. Of course, this is an issue that needs to be brought to the attention, and in fact, most violence against women takes place right within the closed circle, within the families, and it is, of course, for us to draw attention to these things. And subsidiarity is, of course, also a subject on which there will certainly be a debate in the future, but I think that the European Union's task here is very clear, and that is why I support this report.

For far too long we have been hearing fine words and promises about ending discrimination against women, particularly in the labour market. But too little has happened. The alternative proposal for what the Conservative Members are planning to do also seems to me to be purely cosmetic. In reality, it still decides whether you are a man or a woman, whether you have a good job, whether you are in a managerial position, whether you have a precarious job and what you earn. Women are neither stupid nor less educated than men, and if you include family work, women work much more. In the past, it was the EU level that has repeatedly promoted positive initiatives for equality between women in the Member States. But that commitment has diminished significantly. Especially now in the economic crisis, it is women who are losing their jobs, who have lower-paid jobs, who are involuntarily working part-time. Europe must tackle these problems actively, as it does in other policy areas, such as the fight against youth unemployment. Measures to reduce the so-called gender pay gap have fallen victim to the crisis – or even to competitiveness? Women are above average affected by old-age poverty, they have lower earnings, they have poorer career opportunities. The incompatibility of work and childcare or care also has something to do with the fact that women are really worse off in the labour market.

And it is important that the large political groups here remember when they have consensus on great macroeconomic options, remember when the European Union, for example, supports cuts in public services, which are the women who suffer the most. When the European Union supports cuts in pensions and widow's pensions, it is also women who suffer the most; when it supports wage cuts, it is women who lower their already low wages.

It is not the heritage of any political party: neither of the right, nor of the left, nor of the center. We are all committed to the values of the European Union, and the maximum value is the value of equality between all and that of non-discrimination. It is true that the Strategy we had raised in 2010-2015 now ends and a new strategy is needed, because there is a long way to go. Above all, in order to end discrimination and, above all, to address the main labour challenges. There is still, for work of equal value, an average wage discrimination of 16.5%. This is also a grievance in pensions and also assumes that women are not occupying managerial positions, but are basically co-orfied by the male gender. It also means that you have to work to break stereotypes and educate on equality, which means co-educate. It means educating in values and betting on inclusive education. We must also bet on ending gender-based violence. It is the greatest attack on human rights, and a consequence of inequality. Any type of gender-based violence — whether physical, psychic, material, sexual... of any kind—it is undoubtedly a consequence of the lack of educating on that equality, and that is why we will have to work hard and we will have to do everything in our power to prevent, to be able to work when there is gender-based violence, to be announced, to leave the private sphere and to be persecuted relentlessly.

In the labour market they still earn less than men on average. In most places they are under-represented at the top of the career ladder and over-represented in the less prestigious sectors of the economy. A woman’s potential is limited by the unequal distribution of household labour. However, I would like to single out the widespread problem of domestic violence. A major problem for the investigation of domestic violence cases is the reluctance of victims to report such cases to the authorities. Often the reluctance to report is linked to a lack of faith in the ability of law enforcement to deal with these issues. A lack of shelters, and financial dependence on offenders, is a further problem. The persistence of stereotypes concerning the roles and responsibilities of women and men in the family and in society is another challenge. In some countries, obstacles to dealing with cases of domestic violence may be related to the fact that they are cases for private prosecution. Many Member States have no specific criminal provisions on domestic violence and marital rape, and rape is prosecuted within the framework of a private prosecution. Abolishing private prosecution in cases of domestic violence and rape may contribute to better protection of victims of crime. Estonia, my own country, is a good example in this context. We need a comprehensive fight against domestic violence at EU level.

There has been a lack of resources, as always: the European Union is never sufficiently budgeted for the great ambitions that its citizens demand of us. Impact capacity was also limited, as there were no deadlines, fewer objectives or more concrete indicators. Even the European road safety strategy is most effective in setting its objectives and mechanisms for achieving this. We are not able to do so, starting with the elimination of sexist violence against women from daily life - which reduces wages and prevents motherhood from being raised or not in a totally free way - to the extremes of human trafficking and enslavement in prostitution or femicides that we do not even know or can encrypt because the European Union has not yet managed to give an homologable and comparable definition in order to be able to address and avoid them.

I find it inadmissible that this Parliament has another report on the agenda that encroaches on the competence of member states, undermines a family based on marriage between a man and a woman, and directly promotes abortion as a human right. According to the definition of sexual and reproductive rights of the Beijing platform celebrating the twentieth anniversary, in no case can abortion be promoted as a method of family planning. It is scandalous that this report encourages the European Union to use development aid money to fund abortions and sterilisation of women in poor countries around the world, rather than provide them with education and self-employment. The report promotes gender ideology and encourages the adoption of regulations that will lead to discrimination against private entrepreneurs, especially those in the service sector, which is unacceptable.  This report is irreparable. Therefore, the European People's Party Group has submitted an alternative resolution calling for ensuring equality between men and women in the field of labour and social rights, access to education and the labour market, ensuring access to health and promoting women's participation in responsible decision-making positions.

As a result of that, in next year’s elections, parties will have to have 30% females among their candidates. On the other hand, here in Brussels and Strasbourg, six of our eleven MEPs are women, and indeed, 12 of the 14 in the island of Ireland are women. So things are improving in some respects and not in others. At the same time, some of the most powerful positions in Ireland are held by women: Tánaiste (Deputy Prime Minister), Minister for Justice, Attorney General, Chief Justice, Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) and Garda Commissioner. The European Ombudsman, Emily O’Reilly, is an Irishwoman and two of our last three Presidents,  Mary McAleese and Mary Robinson, were excellent Presidents. That shows that, if women are given the opportunity, they can do the job. So that is something we need to work on. However, one area which we are not happy about is that, perhaps because of the recession, the pay gap between men and women has widened in Ireland to 14.4%.

No one can convince while one in three women has been subjected to violence, and we continue to argue about exactly what year to devote to fighting violence. No one can convince, while women get much lower wages, much lower pensions, much less are at work. No strategy will work as we turn a blind eye to the fact that more and more women are working in the black, in the informal economy, without contracts and elementary protection. No one will believe us if we talk about sovereignty and subsidiarity, but in fact we deny women rights.  Today, efforts are focused on rescue operations for the thousands of refugees at the European Union's external borders.  But there have been increased reports of thousands of female refugees working for miserable pay to save their families. Reports of secondary trafficking of women and girls already on European territory have also increased. If we don't have adequate solutions today, it'il be too late tomorrow.

These are men's violence against women, domestic violence, sexual exploitation, honour killings and much more.  It is time for European legislation that criminalises, prevents and combats these terrible crimes to be complied with.

Member States should also focus on increasing women's access to work without discrimination in order to erase the pay gap, which is still wide. It is jobs and economic independence that are the way to independence, not least for migrant women. Several women are going to work, several women will dare to start their own business. It is crucial for europe's economy. We must also make it easier for women to promote shared responsibility for children, so that women and men have the same opportunity to combine family and career.

All women should have safe access to sexual and reproductive health and rights. I regret that some Greens have kidnapped the issue of gender equality.

It is shameful. In the UK women make up under 30% of the information and communications technology workforce, comprising around 20% of computing graduates and 10% of app developers. There is forecast to be a labour shortage of STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) jobs of around 7 million by 2025, and women only make up 24% of science and engineering professionals. We know this is because women drop out of STEM and IT subjects very early in the education process. Female participation in IT apprenticeship programmes and computer science degrees is only 21% and 19% respectively. In secondary education, where girls choose their own subjects, only 8% of girls in the UK choose computer studies. So the EU has a social, moral and economic duty to ensure a gender focus and equal gender participation in STEM sectors. More women in science and technology is good for the economy. It is good for society and, above all, it is the right thing to do because it gives women and girls a choice about how they want to lead their lives.

We MEPs are obliged to take decisions that have a very concrete positive impact on the lives of all citizens, rather than the kind of proposals that we know in advance will be a dead letter on paper. The alternative proposal is nothing more than a bureaucratic document that neither harms nor benefits, and does not include some of the most important dimensions of the fight for gender equality such as reducing violence against women, taking into account groups facing double discrimination, e.g. the disabled, Roma women, migrant women, etc. Furthermore, this proposal completely ignores the fact that the European Union should be an example in the world with its value system, from which news of horrific crimes against girls and women comes every day. As a shadow rapporteur for the budget, I am particularly saddened that the European People's Party has not recognised the importance of budget planning or in reference to binding legislative acts. That leaves everything an empty story. Here we determine the position of women in the next five-year period and that is why I support colleague Noichl's proposal.

In my speech, I will focus on a very important area for me, which I believe is not yet fully achieved, and it is also one of those areas where we could make progress relatively quickly. It is about women's participation in entrepreneurship and it is about women taking up leadership positions in the economy.  It is unacceptable that there are still huge differences in the involvement of men and women when it comes to meeting those really highest, most important places where the most important decisions are made. The fact is that Europeans have a higher level of education compared to their male counterparts. And also various studies show that a balance between women and men in leadership positions can lead to an improvement in European competitiveness and, of course, to a better position in international markets. But why doesn't that happen? If we really want to make progress, we need to make shifts in the education system itself. It is the education system that must be focused on promoting entrepreneurship and, in general, breaking down the stereotype of so-called male bosses.  Stereotypical leadership still prevails in the business world, in politics and in our society as a whole. And I believe that both the European Commission and the European Parliament have done a great deal, and I hope that the Council will also find an appropriate solution and continue negotiations on the Women on board directive.

You all know that gender equality is one of the fundamental values of the European Union.

Although the principle of subsidiarity can be invoked, these remain European problems, the problems of European societies.  We need a forward-looking report, not one that tries to hide social problems behind pathetic anachronisms. We must face up to the fact that discrimination against women particularly severely affects those who are marginalised, who live in poverty, who not only suffer discrimination against women, but are also discriminated against, for example, in relation to their ethnicity. I am thinking, for example, of Roma women, of women in poor queues who are under-qualified, who do not have adequate qualifications and therefore have little or no access to work, or, if they get a job, in humiliating conditions.  I think we need a new strategy, a new way of thinking. There is a need to pay particular attention to women with disabilities, older women, migrant women, LGBT communities, Roma. In this area, the European Commission should strive to create new education and inclusion programmes. Only in this way can discrimination against women of all kinds be eliminated within the European Union. It is not possible to forget people who live in difficult situations and poverty. There is therefore a need for quality education, access to child-rearing and other social support systems, and specific special programmes. Without it, we won't be able to bring order.

It is, in fact, regrettable.  Nevertheless, while I recognise that the report we are discussing is ambitious, I believe that it goes out of its objectives and calls into question the principle of subsidiarity, which has to be taken into account in the final vote.  Commissioner, while I recognise the Union's progress on gender equality, and the proof of this is that we both have the opportunity to be here in this Parliament to discuss this issue, there is still a long way to go.  I do not think we should treat as equal what is different because it is not by giving the same to everyone that we are being fair, but by adapting to the needs of each one. This, in my view, is the new paradigm of gender equity. I therefore argue that men and women have the same basic rights, such as access to work with fair pay, equal work-equal income, access to political life, work-life balance, among other aspects.  But allow me, Commissioner, to highlight what, in my view, is the key to all this, to allow the annulment of these inequalities. I'm obviously talking about education. Knowledge is power and, therefore, I believe that the European Union has a duty to create all the conditions of access to education, training and information for all women and men, so that stereotypes and prejudices that become, throughout its life, the rightto be castters of the integral development of the human person, which enhance abuses of the most varied order. By endeaunion of young people with these tools, we will be contributing to an equitable society.  It is in this sense that I believe that all the instruments available to the Union and the Member States must be put into practice, such as the Istanbul Convention, because physical, verbal, psychological, religious, financial violence, among others, is still a sad reality.

We need a new gender equality strategy that aims forward to the future and the values that we in Europe should stand for. Then we are not talking about legitimised discrimination on the grounds of sex, as we have been doing all along, because that is exactly what is going on: legitimising discrimination on the basis of sex. If we do not want it, if we want to talk about equality, then we should also talk about discrimination on the basis of gender.  I think the report is very good and Would like to thank you for that. It therefore contains an understanding of gender equality that does not lock itself into dealing with women and men, but focuses on the relationships that create inequality between women and men and those that do not fit into any of these categories. It is important that there should be a strategy for women's rights and gender equality in Europe.  I am pleased that the report highlights the fact that successful gender equality work must be based on the living conditions of different groups of women. The aim of the new gender equality strategy must be gender equality for all women, at all levels, and men in Europe, including women with disabilities, women with a migration background, LGBTQ women, Roma women, minorities and people in exclusion.  I think that the report puts the work on gender equality in a broader mri perspective. That is what they are about, it is about human rights. What one spoke of earlier: a true policy on equality, while denying the woman the right to abortion, the right to decide over her own body, it is appalling.

The European Union has a leading role in achieving this humanist objective. At the same time, however, we must deal with the inequalities that prevail in the Member States themselves. This also applies to inequalities and even discrimination against women. Firstly, I think that we will not be able to cope with all sorts of inequalities between women and men without strengthening education. Education and education should therefore be the strongest tools for combating prejudice, stereotypes, but also the consequences of perceiving this issue through the lens of a false tradition or religion. Secondly, however, politicians face the most important challenge. Indeed, if conservative forces block civilisational change, we will not achieve optimal results for equality between women and men, especially in the short term. It is therefore up to the politicians, especially in the individual Member States, to take this task on their own shoulders. The third and final issue in this synthetic speech – the area where radical changes should take place – is the labour market: employment, including women's wages, and flexibility in working time. There will be no equality if women cannot self-pursue themselves in a 21st century society to the same extent as men. I therefore think that this strategy for equality between women and men, in most of its provisions, is well addressing the challenges I have identified.

That is what the situation of women in the European Union is today. Abortion, LDCs for all couples, sex education, maternity leave reform are all advanced solutions to fight inequality and prejudice! In this, Maria Noichl's text is a progressive text. A little too progressive for some, perhaps, since an alternative resolution is tabled by the EPP Group and this resolution looks back on fundamental advances for women: no reference to gender equality, no budgetary commitment, no reference to abortion. In short, these are all setbacks for women, even on one of the most identified issues: women's employment and working conditions. Conservatives who deny women full control of their sexual and reproductive rights, maneuver and misinform. They use the pretext of LDC and abortion to justify their refusal to improve the status of women and their integration into the professional world.  While they are increasingly present in the labour market, inequalities remain numerous: wages are lower than men's, jobs are less skilled, women have fewer responsibilities and more part-time work. To this, it should be added that women's unemployment remains higher than that of men, especially when they have dependent children. Even as a couple, access to work remains the best bulwark against poverty. Finally, women in the world of work are more likely to experience disqualification than men because, even with a high degree, many of them are in jobs that do not correspond to their training. That is why a European Union strategy on equality is needed and that is why it is desirable and happy that this report proposes the introduction of more flexible forms of work, so that men and women can better balance work and family life.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, counterfeit products are harmful to consumers and are detrimental to the economy, to quality production and to research. That is why we believe it is crucial to have a strategy for the enhancement and protection of intellectual property rights that is at the same time able to be attentive to the possible impact on the accessibility of certain sensitive products such as medicines and that does not restrict individual rights. These are the principles on which we based the own-initiative reports on the strategy for the protection and strengthening of intellectual property rights in third countries, voted on in the Committee on International Trade on 14 April. The report responds to the Commission's communication of July 2014 which sought, for the first time, to propose new action in this area, following the failure of ACTA. Intellectual property rights have undergone extraordinary evolution over the last ten years, due to the impressive speed with which technological innovations have spread, even in emerging countries. For this reason, a strategy that wants to be effective must first take account of these developments and propose coherent actions. It is estimated that at present 39% of the total economic activity of the European Union and 26% of employment, i.e. 56 million jobs, are generated by companies that invest and make use of intellectual property rights.  In the report we are presenting today for Parliament's vote, we first of all welcome the approach taken by the Commission, especially since it takes into account in a balanced way divergent interests, those of intellectual property rights holders on the one hand and those of consumers on the other. In general, there is no legislation that works well unless the involvement of all the actors concerned is stimulated and guaranteed. All the more so, in this context, it is essential that all citizens, even in the smallest daily gestures, are aware and responsible, so that all forms of counterfeiting of physical goods and piracy of digital goods are eliminated. Counterfeit products are no longer just luxury goods, but also everyday products such as toys, medicines, cosmetics and food products, which therefore pose a risk to consumer health. That is also why we call on the Commission in its report to ensure that there is a constant commitment to the involvement, transparency, communication and coordination of all actions. Going into more detail, the main points of our report concern: the need to differentiate between physical counterfeiting of trademarks and patents and copyright infringements; the call for closer cooperation between regulators and customs; the establishment of a constructive dialogue involving the various stakeholders; the strengthening of the European Observatory on infringement of intellectual property rights with total management independence; the need to adapt the price of generic medicines to the situation in the individual countries where they are marketed in order to allow anyone access to the products; the need to emphasise that geographical indications are just as important as other types of intellectual property, inso far as they ensure product traceability for the benefit of consumers and safeguard the skills of producers; a greater presence of help-desks on intellectual property rights in developing countries.  In conclusion, in our opinion, the communication is an excellent first step, but it must necessarily be followed up. It is also crucial for the European Union to have a coherent internal regulatory framework in this area, which would ensure not only greater effectiveness, but also greater negotiating strength, both in bilateral relations and in multilateral discussions.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 209, "date": "2015-06-08.json", "name": "Doru-Claudian FRUNZULICĂ", "mepid": "124790", "text": "   – Mr President, considering the significant changes that have taken place in the area of IPR over the past decade, I believe that protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights is indeed a very important issue to tackle in order to fight the threat that infringement poses to EU creative industries, jobs and growth.

In particular, with regard to pharmaceutical companies, which, by abusing their dominant position, have turned the marketing of medicines into an obscene over-profit-accumulation operation at the expense of third countries, the prices of medicines must be accessible to the poor peoples of Europe and third countries, because health is a public good and not a commodity.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 211, "date": "2015-06-08.json", "name": "Ivan JAKOVČIĆ", "mepid": "124754", "text": "   \"Mr. President, there is no doubt that globalization has done a lot of good on our planet.

The report underlines the high importance of protecting and enforcing intellectual property rights around the globe for our stakeholders. It also stresses the need for the Commission to not only continue but also go beyond the efforts it has been making in this regard. The Commission shares this vision. The Commission welcomes the appreciation shown for the approach that the strategy for the protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights in third countries takes in aiming to achieve a balance between divergent interests. It is certainly true that the debate about achieving a fair balance between right-holders’ interests and end-users’ interests is extremely complex, with economic interests on all sides. It is a concern to us all to see infringements of intellectual property rights (IPR) multiplying in recent years and taking away European knowledge and jobs. The Commission certainly welcomes the report’s call for further work to tackle this problem. Indeed there are many points expressed in the report that the Commission fully agrees with, such as, for example, the need for the following: wider informed stakeholder involvement in the debate on IPR; more consumer awareness about the consequences of infringements; and improved coherence between IPR protection and enforcement and other policies. It is also important to reaffirm that the relationship between IPR and universal access to affordable medicines is indeed complex and multi-faceted, a point which is often lost. Moreover, we must continue to ensure that appropriate attention is given to chapters on IPR in our free trade agreements. We also agree with the rapporteur that better, appropriately-harmonised, internal IPR-related EU policies could be helpful in the effort to improve the standard of protection and enforcement of IPR globally. Further assistance should be considered for developing countries wishing to improve their IPR systems. The Commission will be taking careful note of the recommendations made in the report during the implementation of the strategy for the protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights in third countries.

As I have said several times, I am particularly glad that the Committee on Legal Affairs as a whole has accepted my approach, which was to focus on the report on the Commission's action plan and not to engage in other related topics. I think there is a general consensus that intellectual property rights make a significant contribution to the economic growth of the European Union and its cultural diversity. For this reason, we therefore welcome the Commission's efforts to focus on improving tools for the enforcement of intellectual property rights.  I welcome the Commission's efforts to come up with instruments based on an understanding of the state of play in this area, based on verified facts and based on the consensus of all stakeholders. I believe that it is this consensus, this understanding of the widest possible range of stakeholders, that can ultimately contribute most to an effective system of enforcement of intellectual property rights. For this reason too, I believe that a precisely targeted information campaign can be both a means and an objective of an action plan. I think it does not hurt to mention how important the issue of fundamental rights can play. I certainly do not suspect the Commission of not respecting these principles, I just think that, from the point of view of public acceptance, the exclusion of any doubts in this area is essential and we should therefore treat the issue of fundamental rights with the utmost care.  Personally, I would like to support the Commission's follow the money approach. I think there is a general consensus that we want to put our efforts towards those who harm intellectual property rights holders in an organised way for profit, not for individual users. Personally, I would also like to support the Commission's proposals to help SMEs. I do not see these steps as examples of 'special treatment' precisely in the area of the enforcement of intellectual property rights, but only as one of a number of measures in the various areas in which we are interested in improving the position of SMEs.  I believe that an effective system for the enforcement of intellectual property rights is indeed essential for the future prosperity of the European Union, and I hope that the European Commission will make a major contribution to this. I believe that the enforcement of the Action Plan must be pursued without a hurry, a flexible response to a rapidly changing environment, concentrating only on effective and justified steps that will actually affect the better position of rightholders, because that is the purpose of all these measures, to strengthen the position of rightholders.

The European Parliament has made an important contribution to what must be a joint effort to promote and protect creativity and innovation in the EU. Along with its action in renovating the legislative framework in some key areas of intellectual property rights (IPR), the Commission has decided to take targeted action to enforce these rights in the internal market. We are faced with a very difficult and complex reality: commercial-scale IPR-infringing activities have become more frequent and therefore very harmful to the EU economy, and in particular to the individuals and companies who are supposed to benefit from these rights. Commercial-scale IPR-infringing activities are a deterrent to investment in innovation and creativity. They result directly in lost revenue to legitimate businesses, lost tax revenue, lost jobs and high enforcement costs. Therefore, it is of the utmost importance to implement adequate measures against activities of this type. The Action Plan adopted by the Commission in July 2014 comprises various non-legislative measures, all of which aim to boost and secure European businesses’ innovation and creativity in order to preserve their competitiveness in trade at global level. As is reflected in Mr Svoboda’s report, the Commission’s efforts in the area of IPR enforcement should remain focused on several important points, such as the protection of consumers against harmful counterfeit goods; stronger support for SMEs; clarifying the role of intermediaries, especially in the digital environment; promoting the implementation of due diligence mechanisms in global supply chains, and so on. Under the leadership of Vice-President Ansip and Commissioner Bieńkowska, we are now moving forward and have been working directly with national authorities and industry stakeholders on each of these issues. Parliament’s support will be crucial throughout the process. But I also want to bring your attention to the fact that, despite the good faith of various voluntary initiatives envisaged in the 2014 Action Plan, the enforcement of IPR may also require legislative change. The recently-presented Digital Single Market Strategy calls for smarter enforcement for copyright. This does not mean, of course, that less importance should be given to other intellectual property rights, the infringement of which is very harmful to the EU economy. In view of that, over the coming months, the Commission will carry out an evaluation of the overall functioning of the current legal framework for IPR enforcement. If the evaluation shows a need for amendment, this will be an important focus of the Commission’s work in the future. To conclude, I would like to thank Parliament once again for its positive consideration of the Action Plan, which I recommend to the plenary vote tomorrow. I truly hope that Parliament’s cooperation with the Commission in the area of IPR enforcement will continue, in the interests of enhancing innovation, creativity and jobs growth for EU businesses and citizens.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 226, "date": "2015-06-08.json", "name": "Ioan Mircea PAŞCU", "mepid": "33984", "text": "   The debate has been closed.

I therefore welcome the EU Action Plan on the Enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights, in particular by paying due attention to a targeted information campaign and enforcement of rights through a 'follow the money' approach, ensuring that the perpetrators of serious fraud in this area are punished by profiting from this illegal practice.  Nevertheless, it will be necessary to align the Commission's action on the enforcement of intellectual property rights with the development of the Digital Single Market, which is becoming the site of the main trade in counterfeit goods. In this context, online platform owners should be involved in enforcement issues and in efforts to exclude those responsible for infringements in the online trade in goods.
