However, I would like to be clear from the outset that a debate on the euro summit is premature. While fully respecting Parliament's assessments and the considerations that honourable Members wish to make, I would like to make it clear that the euro summit has not been formally convened and no agenda has been drawn up. A more detailed discussion on this issue could take place in October, when preparations for the European Council will be considered at a broader level. I would like to add that the preparations for the euro summits are primarily the responsibility of the President of the Euro Summit, Mr Van Rompuy, in cooperation with the President of the Commission and on the basis of the work of the Eurogroup, rather than the Italian Presidency in this case. In the light of these considerations, and I do not wish to prejudge the content of a possible agenda, I will be extremely brief. In general terms, I believe that the euro area can usefully assess the causes of the recent loss of growth momentum in a low inflation environment. It is essential that this assessment takes place at the highest level.  We must be absolutely certain that our strategy to entrench the start of the eurozone's recovery remains perfectly calibrated in order to generate growth and employment in the whole area. This must remain our main priority at every level and that is what the citizens of Europe expect and deserve. In my opinion, this means making sure that the correct policy combination is implemented in all Member States that share the single currency. We must stimulate our structural reform programme to improve our competitiveness in the global market. We need to bring our public finances back to sustainable levels in a growth-conducive manner and we need to restore confidence in the financial sector, so that it can support the real economy and facilitate investment.  Measures in all these areas are well under way in all member states of the euro area. The Italian Presidency is working hard to ensure progress in legislative activity at EU level. Many initiatives have been taken by the Eurogroup and its President, and the European Central Bank has also recently announced a package of measures in response to the wider macroeconomic environment.  When many activities are under way, it is important to take stock of the progress made on a regular basis, it is essential if we are to be sure that the road map and the strategies established remain results-oriented and forward-looking, it is essential that they continue to be adapted to the challenges we face, in particular to combat the scourge of unemployment. I am convinced that the strategy adopted for the growth of the euro area is the right one, but I also believe that room for improvement is always possible. In this budget, honourable Members' views on how best to achieve our objectives of increasing growth and employment levels are and will be very important. I am ready to listen to all your views and to take advantage of the suggestions and competence that this Parliament will always be able to express.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "NI"}, {"id": 3, "date": "2014-09-17.json", "name": "Jyrki Katainen", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "  Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, honourable Members, thank you for giving me the opportunity today to present to you the position of the Commission on the preparation of the euro area summit to take place on 24 October 2014 on the occasion of the European Council. The preparations for the summit are still at an early stage. As such, I very much look forward to hearing your views here today on how we can work together to deliver sustainable growth, create jobs and secure the welfare of our citizens. We are currently facing formidable challenges that only serve to underline that we have to do whatever it takes to deliver robust, sustainable growth and jobs in Europe. The Commission sees three main priorities for economic policy this autumn. At the informal Ecofin Council last weekend in Milan, we had a very fruitful discussion with finance ministers on a number of key issues. Going forward will, however, require a joint commitment from the Commission, the Member States, you in Parliament and other partners regarding our shared objectives. The first priority this autumn is supporting investment. Europe has a lot to offer in terms of innovation, a skilled labour force and entrepreneurship. In order for all of this to translate into new start-ups around Europe, we need to promote investments from both public and private sources and at both national and European level. We are working on a comprehensive plan that addresses both sides of the coin. This must be a joint effort. At national level, countries with large current account surpluses should commit to investing more. In addition, all countries should prioritise investment in research and development and key infrastructures within their public spending mix. At European level, European resources, such as the European budget and the EIB, should be used in particular to leverage private investment. We need a stable and robust banking sector and well-functioning capital markets to provide accessible credit to the real economy. The second priority is stepping up reforms that unlock growth potential. Without effectively-implemented reforms, we will not have sustainable growth and job creation. It is not about choosing between supply and demand-side measures: both are needed and are complementary. Reforms are also needed to secure the sustainability of our welfare societies and ability to protect the vulnerable. No country is immune from the need to reform, although some have more pressing needs. We should use the existing economic governance framework more effectively to support the adoption of the implementation of structural reforms. Our fiscal rules do not prevent countries from reforming – far from it. There are many examples of countries that have adopted important reforms in parallel with major fiscal adjustment. Nonetheless, there is scope to use our existing economic governance framework more effectively to support countries in their reform efforts. Thirdly, we need to continue ensuring sustainable fiscal policies for the sake of confidence and future generations. Interest rates will surely not stay at record lows forever. Once they rise, public debt will become more costly, again crowding out more valuable public spending and undermining the market confidence we have all worked so hard to regain. The more vulnerable countries would unfortunately be the hardest hit by any new financial market instability. Wise choices are therefore required. The pace of fiscal consolidation has slowed significantly since the peak of the sovereign debt crisis. Now it is essential to improve the quality of public spending. When money is tight, there is little choice but to make savings, but there is always a choice as to how to make those savings. Reducing expenditure rather than raising taxes and cutting inefficient current expenditure rather than future-oriented investments can ensure that consolidation is growth-friendly, fair and supportive of growth creation. A more efficient and citizen-oriented public administration can especially benefit those in need of social support but also promote job creation by enabling a better investment climate. As stated by the Euro Group last weekend, more efforts are needed to reduce the tax burden on labour. At the same time, we need to ask ourselves what is holding back private investment in Europe. We need to ensure that the business climate, our internal market and the regulatory environment are favourable to companies investing in the future: innovating, developing new markets and creating jobs. This ties in with my report on reforms. There is plenty of growth potential in Europe that is today held back by rigidities and vested interests. In some Member States, starting a business means weeks of cumbersome bureaucratic hurdles. Overly-complex tax systems in some Member States have contributed to a sizeable grey economy. Reforms are needed to deal with these obstacles. This inevitably means changes that require not only thinking outside the box but also stepping out of our comfort zone. Europe continues to face great challenges. While there is no silver bullet, I am confident that we can find new sources for growth and to enable us to work together in a spirit of mutual trust. Major joint efforts are needed to deliver sustainable economic growth. At the end of the day, we all share the same objective.

As the European People's Party, we naturally warmly welcome this commitment.  Some Member States are now calling for flexibility. I think that this is also possible, but it is limited to the existing rules. In other words, flexibility can only be granted in exceptional circumstances. Wherever flexibility is built into the Treaties, it is always conditional, namely structural reforms that need to be actively promoted, and not just promises of reform, the implementation of which is slow. This applies to both large and small Member States. The Member States cannot turn a blind eye to the need for further reform efforts. The country-specific recommendations of the Commission and the Council of Ministers build on a comprehensive analysis of what needs to be done urgently, and these recommendations need to be implemented. Reforms are the basis for investment falling on fertile ground and sustainable growth at the end of the day. The consistent application of the six-pack and the two-pack is an integral part of a policy that stands for accountability towards our citizens and, above all, towards future generations. Economic history has proven to us on several occasions that growth on the pump cannot be successful in the long term. The mistakes of the past must therefore not be repeated. Because growth is different.  As the European People's Party, we do not want a grip on the debt coffers. Rather, we are committed to an overall package of measures based on efficient use of funds, reducing investment hurdles, strengthening the competitiveness of our industry and our businesses in Europe and giving our citizens an economically viable future. As the European Parliament, we, as co-legislators, will certainly shape these European initiatives forcefully in the future. Europe has a role to play in maintaining stability and, above all, for greater growth and sustainability.

I would like to remind you that the euro area has come into crisis because, as interest rates in the southern European countries have fallen after the introduction of the euro, the public authorities and private entrepreneurs have felt compelled to make investments on far too large scale, to make investments that were not profitable to make investments that did not yield any returns.  Today, interest rates are many times lower. If private investors are now shying away from investing, they do so because it seems that the earnings prospects for these investments are not there. If private entrepreneurs do not invest because they do not see the returns guaranteed, then we have to ask about the causes. And it was explicitly stated in the opening statement that these issues should be decided at the highest level. The highest level, I would like to say, should be set up professionally.

On Monday you will have noticed that the OECD changed its forecast for the eurozone, cutting the growth forecast for this year to less than one percentage point – to just 0.8% – and we have seen countries in the eurozone having to implement incredibly difficult austerity measures, for example Ireland, Greece and Portugal. The effect of the measures on citizens in these countries is all too plain to see. There have been worrying developments lately in some larger eurozone economies, with France and Italy pushing for more flexibility in their fiscal rules and for their economies as their economies get into difficulty. Therefore, I would like to ask: is it the case that the EU fiscal rules are to be followed strictly by relatively small economies whereas they can suddenly be interpreted in a more flexible way when larger countries threaten to flout them, or will the Commission interpret the rules strictly no matter which countries are involved? To my mind, it is also crucial for the eurozone’s credibility among non-eurozone countries that the same clear rules apply to all eurozone Member States. It is clear too that eurozone decisions inevitably have an impact on non-eurozone countries. My question therefore is: how will you make sure that the eurozone does not act as an isolated bloc? How can you ensure that the eurozone Member States consider the consequences of their decisions on non-euro countries?", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 12, "date": "2014-09-17.json", "name": "Marisa MATIAS", "mepid": "96820", "text": "  gue/NGL Group. \" Mr President, everything must change so that everything is as it is.

Here we talk about investment, job creation, growth, but what do they actually propose as an alternative? Alternatively, more austerity and structural reforms are proposed. But now they decide to give it a new name: it's growth-friendly fiscal consolidation or job-friendly fiscal consolidation.

Mr President, the first thing that strikes me, Gentlemen of the Council and the Commission, is a kind of lack of sense of urgency.  We have 27 or 28 million unemployed, we have a quarter of our population that is on or below poverty or social exclusion and it is not yet clear whether this summit will meet. It is not yet clear with which agenda... I sometimes wonder if we live in the same world. So there is an urgency and what I hear from you, Mr Katainen, is essentially a speech that I have been hearing for two, three, four years, namely structural reforms, structural reforms, structural reforms... And by that, you mean, essentially, reducing public spending and reducing the cost of labour.  I will not tell you anything by telling you that these structural reforms have the direct impact of reaching the most fragile in the population rather than the well-off. We Greens are in favour of fundamental structural reforms but not the same as yours! Not the same as yours because, for us, we share your desire to invest but, for us, we must invest to make Europe the most energy-efficient continent, the most resource-efficient and this is a complete transformation of our economy.  So you're going to ask me how do we mobilize investment? There are ways. There are simple ways but you have to give yourself the will to use them.  First way: these are rules, binding targets. You will have to debate in the Commission and the Council binding targets on climate, energy efficiency and resource efficiency. It is by setting binding targets that things move. It is not only the Greens who say that, it is the companies that work in that sector that say so. No binding targets, no investments. It's as simple as that. The second way is that if there is a structural reform to be done, it is to overhaul our tax systems. You will tell me that it is for the Member States. No, we have to do it together. Today, our tax systems are socially unjust, economically counterproductive and environmentally destructive. It is an overhaul of our taxation that needs to be done, and now I know there is the unanimity rule, but we cannot go on like this. If you want a tax system that encourages investment, you have to change it profoundly. Last thing I want to tell you is that as long as the \"casino economy\" business remains open, don't expect the liquidity that all the central banks in the world put into the financial system to end up in the economy. The Bank of England has been flooding the UK with liquidity for years, with the European Central Bank with a little less enthusiasm. Where is that cash today? They finance bubbles on the price of assets, whether it is real estate assets, whether they are personal assets. This liquidity is not invested in the economy. Because obviously as long as it is easy to make a profit without working, by speculating, you, as so-called financial investors, are not going to invest in the real economy because it is difficult, because it involves taking risks, risks that will not be carried by the taxpayer. These are the structural reforms we want. We are a proponent of structural reforms, but not the ones you are proposing.

It will not escape you, as Mr Katainen said, that an investment-based economy is one that creates more prosperity than an economy based on mere consumption. Quite simply, because when you invest, when you try to position yourself at the forefront of innovation, and here in particular in the energy field, well you put yourself in a position to create added value but also competitively you are ahead of other parts of the planet.

Mr. Schaffhauser, the question you are asking is a well-founded question. To some extent, what we are seeing is already a more modest form of quantitative easing in continental Europe than we see in the United Kingdom. That cash must be made available, yes, but remember that these are loans that will have to be repaid. Of course, investments have to be profitable. What I am observing is that, in reality, Europe does not suffer from a lack of available capital. The problem is a problem of allocating that capital. This capital is not invested where it should be invested. In other words, it goes more into speculation, especially real estate - you see it in Paris, London, Brussels and elsewhere - and in equity markets.  In our view, therefore, it would be more a matter of redirecting available liquidity where it can be invested productively rather than always adding additional liquidity. So, obviously how much? That's to be examined. But let us ask ourselves the question of the allocation of resources before we always want to create additional resources.

In recent years we have been doing the operation through the ECB of long-term refinancing, we have given a lot of billions, but no loan constraints from the real economy.  Now they have been announced by the ECB – I am sorry there is no Draghi here to talk about this – about possible transactions with a target on these long-term refinancing operations.

I believe that the euro will succeed and that what is essential at this particular time is to do two things for the eurozone economy, and especially for the 28 Member States of the European Union. We must stick to the targets we have set in terms of stabilising the eurozone system, and it is crucially important that we continue to reduce deficits no matter where they are across the system. I come from a country that has seen enormous reductions in the amount of available expenditure and increases in tax because of the financial crisis, yet in Ireland the GDP growth is at one of the highest levels across the eurozone system. So even countries that go through enormous adjustments can actually have a much more competitive and productive model of economic growth into the future, if that is pursued.  We need to do three things. Firstly, I believe it is crucially important that we continue to reduce tax on work within the European Union. It is a madness policy. If you have 11% unemployment and you continue to tax people out of existence, that makes no sense. Secondly, we need to get business lending going again. It is crucially important – in a situation in which investment has been reduced by 20% in Europe in the last five years, according to Mario Draghi – that we get business investment going again. In Ireland in the last quarter, 50% of businesses were declined business lending opportunity from banks. That has to change. Thirdly, I very much agree with the Commission proposal in terms of capital market unity right the way across Europe. It is very important that we get on with that task, Commissioner, ensuring that new funding opportunities are provided in non-bank ways.  I shall leave with one more remark. 60% of the new jobs created in the USA since the start of this crisis came from businesses that had not even been created before 2008.

The Commission tells us that it does not have a silver bullet. We know that, but you have told us many times. Commissioner, having no silver bullet does not explain why you are shooting in the wrong direction for more than five years. The Commission must tell us how it intends to deal with what is general economic expertise. In an internal market, in a monetary union, the more the Member States involved move in the same direction, the stronger the economic response. That is a general finding. Now you have explained to us for five years how to cut budgets together. When do you start explaining to us how to invest together? It is right to talk about investment today. Finally, the Commission has arrived that Europe has an investment gap. But when do you tell the Member States what a straight forward movement might look like so that we can achieve European added value in investment as a whole?  These are the important issues. Nobody understands us. The United States does not understand us, the Chinese do not understand us, the Latin Americans do not understand what we are doing, not even Frankfurt, the ECB, understands us.

And it was not the right thing to do, because the model you used, namely austerity and deflation, had negative results: Europe was full of unemployed people. Secondly, the competitiveness model that you are promoting is a model based on the euro pact. In other words, the reduction in wages, i.e. competitiveness linked to the 'Chinese' wage in Europe. The opposite must be done! Investments need to be made! Investment must be made in technology, in the economy and, above all, in education.  But you cannot do that, because when you have a tough fiscal policy, it is essentially forbidden. And you are creating huge problems, especially in the countries of the South, such as Greece, where your policy is disastrous: 1.5 million unemployed, thousands of poor Greeks, thousands of closed shops, and all this as a result of your own policy, the Troika policy which has destroyed the Greek economy.

This means that we have seen over the summer that the ECB has jumped back into the breach; it has taken measures to try to prevent further disintegration. But for the past two years we have had the proposals of the four Presidents for better governance of the euro area, for greater integration, for democratic legitimacy, and also for the coordination of the various policy areas. I have not heard of this here. Instead, we have a logic of shift on the agenda.  We had a summit immediately after the summer, when we talked about personnel and foreign policy.

Lower interest rates, the bond market, government subsidies and capital tax exemptions will not address unemployment, they will not benefit workers but only capitalist profits. Because this growth is based precisely on unemployment, poverty, the demolition of labour conquests, social security, health and education rights. The crumb measures on extreme poverty, which are being wiped out by wildly unpopular taxation, not only do not solve but, in fact, push the general level of wages and pensions into a general poverty line by abolishing collective labour agreements.

In this respect, I welcome the fact that Commissioner Katainen has recognised that reforms are needed, but also investment, and that there is a deficit in competitiveness, but also in aggregate demand. But words are not enough, of course. In order to be credible, we must quickly define concrete responses that are consistent with this analysis, and that is why we will monitor and be particularly rigorous on investment.

Why is this happening? Because we have turned the European economy into a chronically ill person.

I would just like to make a couple of comments. Mr Balz recalled reforms in order to strengthen growth potential. This is a very important issue, because in many of our Member States the potential for growth is at a low level. This is why we need various reforms. It depends on the country. We do not need the same reforms in every country, but it depends on the local situation. It is very easy to agree with Ms Rodrigues, who said that we have to emphasise safeguarding the European social model. She also recalled the need for reforms to strengthen innovation, for instance. This is very important. There are various ways to organise innovation financing in different Member States, and we could perhaps copy the best practices from different countries. This is something which could renew Europe, and this kind of reform brings us forward. There are many strengths in Europe but also some shortages and weaknesses. I personally believe in research and development and innovation. Innovation usually means that there must be strong fundamental research and entrepreneurship. So it is not only a question of money but also of how to organise and use public resources better than we are doing at the moment. It is also very important to find a more efficient way to use the EIB. Mr Lucke – if I understood correctly – said that, if we want investment, it does not make sense to consolidate. For me this is not a black and white question, because investment means demand and that there must be a good level of confidence. That is why we have to combine healthy reforms. We need more demand and some consolidation in order to strengthen confidence, and we need European efforts. The Commissioners-designate are trying to define this at the moment.

The prospects for young people to enter the world of work are of particular concern and are one of our top priorities. We are all aware of the seriousness of the situation, the continuing context of slow growth will continue to hold back employment prospects.  The economic recovery in the first half of 2014 was fragile, uneven – we discussed it earlier, you discussed it earlier – and has not had a real effect on job creation so far. The youth unemployment rate in the European Union remains high, currently two and a half times higher than that of adults, affecting more than five million young people under the age of twenty-five in Europe. Youth unemployment rates are still uncceptably high in many Member States. We all know that unemployment and youth inactivity have high costs. These costs are not only a short-term social factor, there will be a considerable economic price to pay in the long term. EU leaders are well aware of the seriousness of the situation. Over the past two years, they have provided significant political impetus at numerous European Council meetings. Last year in particular, they agreed, firstly, to provide additional funding of EUR 6 billion for the youth employment initiative and to bring it forward over the next two years. This will be particularly important as it will make it possible to implement effectively the measures provided for in the Youth Guarantee and, secondly, to call on the Member States benefiting from the Youth Employment Initiative to commit themselves to adopting concrete plans for the implementation of the Youth Guarantee. Allow me to briefly outline some points in the youth guarantee system which, as you know, was adopted in April last year. In accordance with the Council recommendation, Member States should ensure that young people receive a qualitatively viable offer of work, continuation of studies, apprenticeship or traineeships within a period of four months of leaving the formal education system or starting unemployment. All Member States have submitted their plans for the implementation of the Youth Guarantee. They have been assisted by the Commission, which assesses the measures taken by the Member States and provides feedback on them.  We are pleased to say that the first evaluations indicate a high level of commitment on the part of national administrations and good progress in implementation. The efforts made by the Member States to devise and develop these plans are proof of their commitment. I would like to take this opportunity to highlight the work carried out by the Employment Committee, which has helped to promote a better understanding of the policies and programmes implemented by the Member States.  The Council has also followed closely the implementation of all these measures. In recent discussions, ministers have reported on the experience gained in implementing youth guarantees and youth employment initiatives. They stressed, however, that more needs to be done. The Council is closely following Parliament's important contributions to these debates. We fully share the view expressed in the resolution of 17 July this year that strong measures are needed to combat youth unemployment. There is a specific challenge to address the structural causes of youth unemployment.  We support your call for systematic and structured actions in the context of the reform of apprenticeship systems or vocational education and training, or in the context of vocational guidance and support, the development of skills and their correspondence, or early intervention to prevent early school leaving. There is no alternative, Europe must ensure that young people can find work or that they are reintroduced into education and training. We must continue to invest in the younger generation. It is essential that The Member States decide on concrete measures, which increase the employability of young people, improve their prospects of entering the labour market and facilitate the transition from education to work. We need to focus on adapting national education systems to the needs of the labour market. Similarly, on the demand side, more needs to be done to facilitate access for small and medium-sized enterprises to finance – we discussed this earlier, you discussed it earlier – so that they can create jobs. Vocational training and apprenticeship are of particular importance and the European Union has recently taken a number of initiatives in this field, such as the European Alliance for Apprenticeship and the Quality Framework for Traineeships.  Of course it is essential for young people to enter the labour market, but it is up to the individual Member States to choose the right policies and take effective measures. At EU level, Member States receive financial assistance and support, but a solution that applies to everyone is not adequate. Each Member State faces different challenges, and in this respect it should also be noted that the current economic situation does not facilitate the tasks that lie ahead. Today, many of the challenges are not necessarily structural but cyclical, depending on economic conditions. It is therefore essential to get our economies back on the path to employment-leading growth. To this end, it is necessary for all actors to unite their efforts towards achieving this common objective.  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Italian Presidency will continue to put improving the situation of our young people at the top of the list. The last European Council welcomed our intention to hold a summit on employment, especially youth employment. This high-level event will follow up on the conferences that were held last year in Berlin and Paris. However, we have been forced to postpone the event, which unfortunately will not take place on the scheduled date.  In conclusion, allow me to express our hope in the constant commitment with which the new European Commission will face with strength and conviction the challenges of high youth unemployment.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "NI"}, {"id": 62, "date": "2014-09-17.json", "name": "László Andor", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "  Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I would like to thank the European Parliament for its support for the Commission’s efforts in developing and implementing the Youth Guarantee. The Youth Guarantee is one of the most important and ambitious reforms proposed by this Commission. As you know very well in this House, the Youth Guarantee is a fundamentally new approach based on the best existing models within the European Union, namely those of Austria and Finland. It is a key structural reform that requires in-depth changes to education, training and job search systems in order to facilitate and accelerate the transition from education to employment. The concept of the Youth Guarantee has been endorsed by the G20 employment Ministers meeting last week in Melbourne. We have been working very hard with the Member States to implement the Youth Guarantee. A few months ago, all Member States submitted comprehensive implementation plans to the Commission. Since then, they have passed new laws, established innovative working methods, and upgraded the support provided by the public employment services. Pilot projects are also running in a number of Member States. So implementation of the Youth Guarantee is well on track and is already bringing results. Compared to other structural reforms in Europe, the Youth Guarantee is probably the one being most rapidly implemented. As President Schulz highlighted a few day ago at the Cohesion Forum, significant EU funding dedicated to implementing the Youth Guarantee has been made available to the Member States, including through the frontloading of the EU budget.  Let me inform you of the state of play of the dedicated youth employment initiative resources with the latest data. The Commission has received all 34 operational programmes which include resources from the initiative. 26 out of 34 will be adopted in 2014, covering about 85% of the total amount of the youth employment initiative. As regards financial allocations, we can therefore ensure on the basis of the submitted operational programmes, that all the EUR 6.4 billion of the Youth Employment Initiative will be committed in 2014 and 2015. In addition, on the basis of the draft operational programmes submitted by the Member States, we can foresee that over EUR 4 billion of additional European Social Fund resources will be committed to supporting youth employment. In other words, the Member States have – at this stage – approximately EUR 10 billion to support young people. What about the actual action on the ground? Some Member States have already stated that they are making use of the early eligibility date, i.e. 1 September 2013, and they are funding measures on the ground that can be reimbursed from the initiative and ESF resources. I have asked national authorities to provide us with concrete information on the estimated number of young people who benefit from these measures and on the types of measures financed by the Member States in 2014. I expect to receive this information from the Member States by the end of this month. The level of unemployment has been decreasing in Europe in the last year, but it is still very high, and there are still more than 5 million young people among the unemployed. I believe the Youth Guarantee will help to make an economic recovery job-rich, and it will make a systematic and decisive improvement to school-to-work transitions. However, we should not forget that, in the absence of overall economic growth, it would be impossible for any labour market reform to solve and economic crisis of such a magnitude as we have experienced in Europe. In other words the Youth Guarantee will deliver much more when it will be accompanied by adequate and more supportive macroeconomic instruments, and I very much count on the Italian Presidency to keep all this high on the political agenda.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 63, "date": "2014-09-17.json", "name": "David CASA", "mepid": "28122", "text": "  F'isem the PPE group. – Sa minn meta faqgťet il-kriżi ekonomika, l-Istati Members qed ikunu milquta minn levels mhux aèʻettabbli ta' qgťad.

So, no one-size-fits-all EU blueprint. But the Commission has a great role to play in helping to share the ideas and best practice that it finds across the Member States. I am very pleased that in my own country – the UK – youth unemployment fell by 206 000 in the last year. That is the largest fall since records began over 30 years ago, so I am pleased that we are going in the right direction. I am also very pleased that, to use another example from the UK, the UK Government is abolishing employers’ national insurance contributions for the under-21s, thus encouraging businesses – and especially small businesses, where the burden falls heavily – to take on young people, because 80% of new jobs come from SMEs. So it is those companies that need to be helped and encouraged to take on young people.

The differences between the member countries with the lowest and, on the contrary, the highest youth unemployment remain extremely high, and it is good that the European Commission and the Italian Presidency are focusing their attention on regions with high unemployment.  In the Czech Republic, for example, youth unemployment for under-25s is almost three times the national unemployment rate, and this ranks the Czech Republic in the better average of the Countries of the European Union. Two things must not be neglected in solving the problem: firstly, it is the potential for European labour mobility, which, in my opinion, remains untapped. About 216 million people make up the European Union's workforce, but only 7.5 million of them work abroad within the European Union. At the same time, it is young people who are the ones who are most willing to move to work. The second problem to address is that European businesses are being forced to secure skilled forces directly, by recruiting in schools and retraining on their own, and at their own expense, because they cannot rely on a functioning system. I welcome the efforts of businesses and schools across Europe to restore prestige to crafts and technical education. Vocational training, in line with market needs, is a way to provide firms with a skilled workforce in the future, while at the same time providing young people with the knowledge that the labour market requires.  My intention is to help connect successful companies with young people who are interested in education and actively take care of their future careers. I will not support passive support schemes and the across-the-board payment of social benefits without incentives.

But at least now we have a programme which is specifically designed to respond positively to youth unemployment. 6 billion plus for a Youth Guarantee over 28 Member States is not enough – not nearly enough; the ILO has said we need 21 billion. But at least we are encouraging Member States to frontload and to spend that money in 2014 and 2015. So I suppose the question is: are we making progress? We have a document from the Commission: a first-findings report which looks at a number of pilot projects that have the potential to make positive changes, particularly in the way school-to-work transition is managed and how youth employment services are delivered to young people. These programmes are providing short-term relief in many cases, and core to the approach is the partnership approach, where the schools, the NGOs, the employers, the government services and the young people themselves are included. Indeed, we have one of these pilot programmes in Ireland, in Ballymun in Dublin, where a local partnership has been set up under the umbrella of a national partnership.

We have been quoting worrying figures on youth unemployment for years and nothing is changing. It is becoming increasingly clear that we are dealing with a lost generation in which people without sufficient work experience and without the chance of a decent retirement will dominate. Today's youth unemployment will put member states' budgetary problems in the future and will definitely prevent us from maintaining the new European social model. It is surprising that the government has resisted or neglected to use the instruments of the European Youth Initiative. Only 11 beneficiary countries have so far prepared the operational programmes necessary to make use of the available funds, and only two have benefited from them. It is therefore very clear that the problem is not the low budget, but the intuition of most countries. So, first of all, we should discuss the causes of the existing stagnation. We can criticise individual governments for their disrespectful attitude towards this programme, but this will not improve the situation of young people. It will be more effective to look for ways to remove existing blockades and to motivate countries to reach for available funds, especially as the current EUR 10 billion is available under the initiative as early as today in 2014 and 2015, rather than as is the case with other multiannual programmes.  Yesterday's debate on reducing funding for the best of the best Horizon 2020 programmes and today's debate on the complete ignorance of the Member States towards the European Youth Initiative programme, which already has 100% funding, shows how bad decisions we are making here in the European Parliament, often under pressure from Member States, which later disregard these decisions.

The success of programmes and initiatives to help young people depends above all on the ability of Member States to fulfil these resolutions with real content, and this depends on the implementation capacity of the States. Unfortunately, the countries that need aid most often have the lowest and are improving only in a limited way.  Labour offices that have been given the task of helping young people are often unable to provide personalised and quality services. They thus tend to help where it is easiest, resigning to help the long-term unemployed and benefiting those who have the least problem with employment. For example, it is preferable to subsidise youth places, but the long-term sustainability of positions thus created is often secondary.

It is important that we ask that countries that have to be exemplary in the implementation of a program like this, such as Spain, be not only well supervised, but are required to be a reference.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 96, "date": "2014-09-17.json", "name": "Jeroen LENAERS", "mepid": "95074", "text": "   I would like to join all the previous speakers who also believe that the 20% youth unemployment rate we have in Europe is unacceptable.

I am surprised that when the resolution was adopted last July, several groups in the House immediately took the reflex of imposing a legal framework from Europe with minimum standards for the youth guarantee. We must set our goals in Europe, we must support Member States in their measures, but let us also allow the Member States to tailor their own measures for their own situation. If we really want to work seriously towards creating more jobs for young people in the long term, then we need to implement structural reforms.

Two considerations in this context. The first, on the youth guarantee, is that we have to see what is being done and the Commission must be serious in the assessment, that there are no drifts, as has been seen in some countries. The second element, then, is that the funds of the 6 billion that are now allocated must be mobilised in all countries.

That is essential in ensuring the success of the Youth Guarantee scheme. Without employers’ input we are not providing young people with the skills that they need to gain meaningful employment. I think this is critical and I would ask the Commissioner, as I have asked him previously in such a debate, to focus on that aspect in order to ensure that the necessary reforms are in place. In 1995 in Europe, 21% of our youth were unemployed, and since then we have had pretty high youth unemployment of around 10-15%. So the problem is not just related to the recent financial crisis: it is also related to the fact that our education provision does not sufficiently match the needs of industry or provide young people with the skills that they need to gain employment. That is a critical issue right across Europe, and in my own country especially. We can speak to employers and, you know yourself, Commissioner, the criticism that these employers are not getting the skills they need and that they have to look outside Europe.

It is the duty of the Commission to inform Parliament about every step which is taken in the area of youth employment. I will be brief because of the shortage of time but I would like to respond to some of the key points of today’s discussion. First of all I would like to clarify very clearly that the Youth Guarantee is a reform. It is about a reform agenda; it is about reforming vocational training; it is about reforming, if necessary, how the public employment services work in various EU Member States because it is public action that is needed to help young people who might be looking for a job or who might not even be registered as unemployed in many cases. Obviously the purpose is that young people gain skills that are relevant to the labour market and information and experience which will help them in their future careers. Let me also clarify that the Youth Guarantee is not a one-size-fits-all project. It allows for a lot of flexibility – for example integrating measures to boost entrepreneurship; it allows for demand-side measures but also supply-side investment; and it calls for an innovative approach at Member State level and also within regions. Concerning current trends, I think it is clear – and clear too from the discussion – that recently unemployment, including youth unemployment, has been falling faster outside the euro area than inside the euro area. That just highlights how important the macroeconomic background is in making progress. Nevertheless in those countries where there has been progress in reducing the youth unemployment rate, I would like to underline three important criteria which also need to be observed at the same time. One of them is the quality of the new jobs and the new employment. The second one is outreach to their needs because it is not enough just to reduce the number of registered unemployed; the Youth Guarantee is also about reaching out to those who are not in education, employment or educational training. And the third, to monitor something very important in our scheme – and it is actually uniform – namely the four-month deadline, the actual guarantee that young people can count on this safety net. Another observation concerning current trends is that there is indeed no conflict between labour mobility and reducing youth unemployment. Countries that have either been performing well or making progress in the recent period, like Germany or the United Kingdom, have experienced a relatively significant inward mobility but, at the same time, falling or low unemployment. Why? Because they have been on the better side of the EU in terms of economic growth and this has allowed new jobs to be created in this period. So the contradiction or the trade-off which some people assume to exist cannot be observed in reality.  Fourthly, regarding money: more money is of course always better than less money but the important thing is that we take advantage of the existing budget. The EU budget is not the only source. It was never meant to be the only source for the Youth Guarantee, especially in countries and regions that are not eligible because their performance has already been relatively better. So it is also important to rely on national resources and combine the European Social Fund plus the top-up fund – the famous EUR 6 billion – in regions where the youth unemployment rate has been extremely high in the past period. It is also important – if Members are concerned with the flow of EU funds – to take the lead in Council in order to refill the EU budget with the payment credits needed to enable the Commission to pay the bills in time under the European Social Fund and other financial instruments. A very good starting point for this would be to agree on the third amending budget for 2014 and the draft budget for 2015 without any cuts to the Commission proposal. We need to reduce the accumulated backlog of payment claims and not to increase it further. Finally, my fifth point is about the evaluation. I agree with those who stress the importance of a serious fact-based evaluation of progress – or, in some cases, the lack of it – and this evaluation has to be inclusive. It has to include the social partners, the parliaments – the European Parliament as well as the national parliaments – and, most importantly, the youth organisations themselves. This is what I have been doing in my capacity – meeting as much as possible representatives of the Youth Forum and various youth organisations.

There is only one point on which I would like to say a few words. Since some speakers have strongly criticised the guarantee mechanism for young people, there has been talk of hypocrisy. We have never claimed that the measures we have discussed today can provide a solution on their own. The youth employment initiative is the seed capital for stimulating national initiatives and the scope for action at EU level is relatively limited and the main focus of initiatives is on coordination, promotion of new initiatives and support for funding mechanisms.  The Council provides guidance to the Member States and strongly encourages them to take action to tackle the problem of youth unemployment and, on behalf of the Council, I can assure them that the Italian Presidency will do all it can to help create the conditions for the worrying situation of youth unemployment in Europe to be alleviated.

An important step in this direction is reforming old rigid structures and promoting new, more flexible systems in every Member State. If young people have their say, they will stand up for an education that is no longer focused on memorising and reproducing information, but on fostering practical skills and analytical thinking. This is what the current labour market needs. We must therefore be more proactive with bottom-up initiatives, where young people decide on the design and content of educational and work programmes.  If we empower young people, we will have a new generation with the capacity and motivation to build their own professional life.

Firstly, I would like to thank THE EU Commissioner for Employment László Andor for his dedicated work in recent years: he has a number of important initiatives and achievements to his name. However, there is still plenty of work to be done. Last year, 26.6 million people were out of work in Europe, and the consequences of the economic crisis hit young people hardest: in 2013, the number of unemployed people under the age of 25 in the European Union reached almost six million. The Youth Employment Initiative and the Youth Guarantee Programme are important handrails, but far from sufficient.  Hundreds of thousands of people are leaving their home countries, mainly from Eastern and Central Europe, to find prosperity in more developed countries due to austerity economic constraints. There are hundreds of thousands of people who migrate not out of 'adventurousness', not for learning purposes or taking advantage of labour mobility in Europe, but from a simple, painful need to make ends meet. The European Union must respond and help the hundreds of thousands who, if they were able to do so, would be repatriation from their economic emigration. This is why, as a Hungarian MEMBER, I launched the Hungarian Home Waiting Programme, providing targeted assistance and seeking social refugees in my own country. I will take the initiative, week after week, to launch a comprehensive EU programme to support young people who wish to return to their home countries and want to build a new existential system there.

I would ask you to take a seat. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent report, which In the early morning of 1 September 75 years ago, the Second World War began with the invasion of neighbouring Poland by Nazi Germany. A world fire was unleashed, driven by an insane ideology, which, in its rage of destruction, in the madness of manor, sought to destroy other countries on the grounds of a habitat policy. Other countries should be exploited, enslaved, entire peoples should be wiped out. This was followed by radicalization, which led to what was called the \"total war\". This was preceded by a cynical pact between Hitler and Stalin, which led to two armies invading Poland, Germany raiding Russia and bringing immense suffering to the country, with the result that six years later Germany was also completely destroyed. 60 million dead, fallen on battlefields, starved in captivity, civilians, men, women, old people, children, arbitrarily murdered, systematically wiped out, driven out of their homes, died miserably on the streets, fallen on the battlefields, devastated and devastated by incendiary bombs, fallen in the rifle salvos, executed at the gallows or driven into the gas chambers – the civilisational low point of human history, the genocide of the Jews. Ladies and gentlemen! This breach of civilization casts its shadows to this day. We remember thousands of years back to atrocities that took place at that time. How can we believe that almost 70 years after this breach of civilization, something could be forgotten? We are all today, every day, under the impression of this devastating war and its effects. One result of this war was the will of the generations who had experienced the First and Second World Wars to create an order in Europe that would make it impossible for this to happen again. Transnational cooperation between peoples across borders – and not just across physical borders, but across economic borders, across cultural borders, across religious borders – has created the Europe we have today. And this multinational assembly of parliamentarians is a result of this will. Here, Members of the European nations sit together in free self-determination. In our Parliament there are different religions, different races, different political beliefs, representatives of different cultures and nations, but united with one will: that this must not be repeated on our continent. It is a miracle that reconciliation has succeeded on this continent after everything that has happened in our Europe. For me, it is always a fascinating moment that captivates me when I come to this Chamber and see that, in free self-determination, we are creating a Europe that has managed to overcome war and hunger, to tear down borders and walls, which has succeeded in overcoming its artificial division according to the Yalta order and living together today in a united Europe. The miracle of European unification can help us ensure that such a human catastrophe does not happen again. Ladies and gentlemen! We have no guarantee of this. We did not conjure up the war. It exists. We have created institutions and structures that make it likely that war will not return to our peoples. But that is because we have these transnational structures. If we smash them, there is also the danger that ultranationalism, hatred, racial hatred, the madness of men's manbeing can return to Europe. We have created an immune system against war, but we have not eliminated the war. And there are people in Europe who are afraid of war. Borders on our continent are once again being shifted unilaterally. We must be attentive. Peace and freedom are the great privilege of the post-war generation to which I belong. As a German, I am one of those who have not taken on individual guilt – I was born after the war – but who have an individual responsibility that I want to live up to – just as all those who know that peace, tolerance and respect only have an effect if they are not written on paper, but are implemented in daily practice. The great strength of this Parliament is that we are doing just that. That is why the European Parliament has a special responsibility to recognise that peace, tolerance and solidarity must be defended every day, because they threaten every day anew. Be. That is why the work of this multinational assembly of parliamentarians is a good instrument – not the only instrument, but a good one – to defend our Europe of respect and peace. In memory of the victims of the Second World War, our common task should be to consider peace in Europe, tolerance and respect as our primary task.

A particularly significant point of the resolution relates to the expansion of the offer of assistance to the self-employed, but also to persons who are not employed or in the process of education or vocational training, under the age of 25 or if the member state decides to put the limit at 30 years.

This region in Romania relays principally on the finished and semi-finished steel products sector, therefore it is not surprising that the redundancies in Mechel affected the local labour market in the region as whole.

I agree with the Commission that the conditions set out in the EGF Regulation have been met and that the Netherlands is therefore entitled to a financial contribution under that Regulation. The redundancies of workers at 89 NACE companies concerning the construction of buildings in the neighbouring Dutch regions of Gelderland and Overijssel are linked to the financial and economic crisis. It refers to the fact that banks' policy has introduced stricter criteria regarding mortgage lending and thus significantly reduced the supply of mortgages and loans. Government austerity measures to reduce the national debt and budget deficit have reduced public spending and resulted in a drop in the price and value of properties, making it difficult to buy and sell houses.

This is a public health emergency which is causing considerable international concern.  The Ebola epidemic is having an unprecedented impact on public and humanitarian health on the affected countries and the region as a whole. The Council is gravely concerned about the consequences for the socio-economic and security situation of the West African countries affected. At the same time, we would point out that, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the risk of being infected with the Ebola virus for EU residents and those travelling to the affected countries is low, provided that the recommended precautions are taken.  The European Union has taken a leading role within the international community in responding to the epidemic. At their meeting on 15 August, the Foreign Ministers called for careful follow-up and a coordinated international response.  The extraordinary European Council of 30 August 2014 also stressed the importance of providing coordinated international support as quickly and effectively as possible. It called for greater coordination at EU level and called on the Council to adopt a comprehensive EU response framework to address the situation. What have been our follow-up measures in this case? As far as humanitarian aid is concerned, the European Union and its Member States have reacted to the Ebola crisis from the outset. This includes financial support for health and humanitarian actors and UN organisations. We pay tribute to the extraordinary commitment of these operators on the ground, a commitment that some of them have paid with their lives. In close coordination with the Commission, Member States have regularly carried out joint analyses and assessments of the need for humanitarian assistance. The civil protection mechanism was activated at the request of the WHO and the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. The emergency response coordination centre, which is operational seven days a week and round the clock, helps coordinate assistance.  Since the crisis escalated, Member States have stepped up their support and expressed their willingness to provide further assistance and mobilise experts and medical staff. Let me give you a few brief examples. The UK has started to set up a treatment centre near Freetown in Sierra Leone, the first phase of which is expected to be operational within eight weeks. Austria and France have offered assistance in kind in the form of medical equipment. Germany has welcomed a WHO staff member who contracted the virus. Italy has supported the World Health Organisation since the onset of the crisis, making an initial contribution of EUR 200 000 to WHO activities in Guinea in April. A further EUR 240 000 has recently been allocated. In addition, we have just approved an intervention totalling EUR 1.2 million for the prevention and treatment of the virus. The Council is currently working on a framework for the European Union's global response to the crisis. This framework will also include the coordination of air transport, which is currently a critical shortcoming and restricts access for medical and humanitarian personnel and resources. The Presidency is well aware of the need for more to be done. The EU must help rebuild health systems that collapsed as a result of the Ebola crisis. If we do not do so, there is a real risk that the humanitarian crisis caused by the Ebola epidemic will spread to other countries on the African continent. The Presidency, in cooperation with the Commission and the EEAS, will help coordinate the European Union's collective response in partnership with the WHO and the UN.  On the public health front, the EU response framework is active, sufficient to protect human health in the Union. EU Member States have national preparedness plans to respond to possible health threats. At European level, Member States, in cooperation with the Commission, coordinate their responses to serious cross-border health threats in the Health Safety Committee. A network of competent national authorities, the Commission and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, managed and coordinated by ECDC, are responsible for epidemiological surveillance of communicable diseases and related special health problems.  A high-level meeting was held in Brussels on 15 September to coordinate the further stages of the EU's response to the Ebola epidemic in West Africa. In addition to the relevant Commissioners and several Ministers for Health and Development of the Member States, the meeting was attended by the high-level coordinator of the UN System for the Response to Ebola Virus Disease as well as representatives of the World Health Organisation and the NGO Médecins sans Frontières. The meeting paved the way for greater coordination of the international effort needed to combat the epidemic. Eu ropean Union health ministers will discuss the issue at the informal ministerial meeting in Milan on 22 and 23 September, in particular with regard to the following actions: medium and long-term follow-up measures; information to travellers and citizens; the health eviction; the need to share resources in complex emergency situations; interventions to improve the availability of Ebola treatments and vaccines; the need for further support for the affected countries, the WHO and non-governmental organisations active in this area and the need for the EU to support the strengthening of global leadership and operational coordination of the WHO and the UN in crisis response. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I thought it important to take a long time to give you an account of the commitment of the Presidency and the Council to coordinate the EU's efforts to help the affected countries and international organisations in the fight against this serious epidemic.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 4, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 11, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "NI"}, {"id": 485, "date": "2014-09-17.json", "name": "Kristalina Georgieva", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "  Member of the Commission. - Mr President, we have heard a very comprehensive presentation from the Council. I would like to contribute to the discussion by elaborating further on three points: first, the character of this epidemic; second, what we are doing at the Commission to advance a coordinated response; and finally a few words about the approach we are taking to protect our own population, the citizens of Europe. On the epidemic itself: it is unprecedented in two ways. Firstly, this is a pandemic which is taking place in countries that had very weak health systems to begin with. In the past, if pandemics occurred they were mostly in middle-income or high-income countries where the health systems could be mobilised to respond. This is not the case now. Secondly, at no time before has an Ebola epidemic lasted so long, and it is not yet contained. So we are in a very unusual and very dramatic situation. As was mentioned, the UN Senior Coordinator for the fight against Ebola, Dr David Nabarro, who is extremely competent, told us that not only do we have 4 963 cases and 2 453 deaths today (that is actually as of yesterday) but that the most important and troubling fact is that figures for the number of cases are nearly doubling every three weeks.  If we do not act decisively now, there are three major risks stemming from this. One is that in the three countries which are the most affected, Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, the spread would be such that containing it would become extremely difficult. It is already difficult but it would be extremely difficult. Secondly, we may not be able to protect other countries in the region from the spread of the epidemic. The worry then, of course, is that it may go further. And the third and most dangerous risk, I believe, is that the longer we fail to get on top of the epidemic the greater is the risk that the virus may mutate. What its impact would then be is hard to predict but it could be quite dramatic. We are not talking anymore just about a health emergency in the three countries; we are talking about an impact on their economies and their societies that is quite dramatic. Growth rates have dropped significantly. We are worried about the political and security implications, and let us remember that these are countries that experienced civil wars in the 1990s and 2000s. They have just emerged from this, rebuilding their societies, and now they are being tremendously badly hit. We talk about fighting Ebola on the front lines but this is not your usual humanitarian emergency where we can mobilise humanitarian staff, send them into the field and then they deal with the problem. This epidemic requires highly competent professionals in the health field who know how to deal with it. We are very constrained in terms of personnel, equipment and transport.  Going on to my second point: what are we in Europe doing in terms of being on the front line in fighting Ebola? Of course we are mobilising money. I am proud to say that the Commission, with EUR 150 million, is leading in the financial response to this crisis. We have just received a figure from the United Nations revised upwards: close to a billion dollars is now necessary, but we are putting our funding together and we will do more. On Monday our Member States had pledged up to EUR 78 million. Many of them, however, are working on raising their financial contributions so we can be more and more effective. Much more important than money is mobilising assistance in kind and deploying teams. We have laboratories in the affected countries and, as we have heard, our Member States are providing new hospitals and new treatment centres to provide beds. But let me tell you what the reaction of Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) was to our numbers, which are in the high hundreds. They said high hundreds is good, but what we need is in the thousands if we want to stop the epidemic, because they are still sending people who are coming to treatment centres back to their communities, with all the risks that this creates.  We are very focused on the critical issue of medical evacuation. For many health workers, one concern about going to the affected countries is ‘What would I do if I am impacted, would there be any help?’ We are working in Europe to create a medical evacuation capacity so that that concern, and the health of medical workers, are addressed.  Last but not least, we understand how critical it is to invest in research, in vaccines and in treatment, and also to build a wall against any future Ebola outbreaks. There was a discussion here in Parliament on this topic with Tonio Borg in early September in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.  The third point is: what do we do about the safety of our own citizens? Here we have received the message very loud and clear, and I want to split this into two points. One, we are saying let us stop the virus, isolate it and fight it back, but let us not isolate the countries. I want to pay tribute to Brussels Airlines and to Air France, European companies that continue to fly back and forth to the region – absolutely essential. Secondly, we have taken measures collectively to make sure that this is not going to bring the virus into Europe. I can stand here in front of you and say we are doing this. A huge amount of work is going on at the moment to make sure that our laboratory system is ready to carry out testing in all Member States and that those with fewer capabilities can count on the support of others; that we have suitable treatment facilities; that we coordinate our preventive measures; and also that we communicate with one voice so that we do not confuse people. I want to end by saying that I was very encouraged at the meeting on Monday to see Europe coming together as one. I heard a Member State that would not normally say such a thing asking ‘please, coordinate usʼ. We want to act together and together we will act.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 4, "pandemic": 1, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 6, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 486, "date": "2014-09-17.json", "name": "Davor Ivo STIER", "mepid": "119435", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Club. – Mr. President, as we have heard from the Commissioner, the virus is spreading at a truly exponential rate, and at such a rate, according to world health organization data, we could have as many as 20,000 cases by the end of the year. So colleagues and colleagues, today we need a serious and responsible discussion, of course we do not need any sensationalism or unnecessary intimidation of our citizens. But we must say, loud and clear, that the international community underestimated the danger of the Ebola epidemic. We need to make it clear from here that the Ebola crisis is not only a West African problem, it is a global threat and it is looking for a decisive response from the European Union.  I welcome the efforts of a Member State and what the European Commission has done with around €150 million, these are good moves, but it is clear that this is not enough. Partner organizations in the field point out to us the fact that besides money we need most organizational capacities to isolate and treat patients. All this includes, and what you commissioners have said, hence human resources and logistical material and technological capacities, health equipment. In West Africa we have a really big shortage of qualified staff, adequate training for healthcare professionals and what may be badly needed, we don't have wider information for the local population. That is why we are also calling on the European Commission to continue its stepped-up efforts.  We also heard that we will have a meeting of health ministers in Milan. We also ask them for an urgent plan of action by the Member States coordinated by the European Commission, of course under the auspices of the work of the United Nations.

It is a critical week now for tackling this problem. Mr Stier mentioned the World Health Organisation figures of 20 000 dying before the end of the year. But that is if we do something. They are saying it will be much higher if we do not do something. So we really have to step up our act. There was the meeting on Monday; I very much welcome what happened on Monday in Brussels and the announcement by the US President that the United States is going to take part in this global effort to combat Ebola. But I think we need to reflect: we need short-term measures. We have to get the emergency under control but, once that is done, we need to reflect on the long term. It is pretty clear that we have all been slow off the mark, and we need to be asking ourselves: why is it that this epidemic is far more serious than ever before? Why have more people died in this epidemic than have died since the disease was first identified about forty years ago? Why is it that vaccines and treatments have been looked at for many years but we have not had the results we need? How do we make sure that this time we do the research and continue it when the headlines disappear, when hopefully we get the disease under control? A trial started today in the United Kingdom, and we hope that clinical trial will lead to a vaccine. Finally, I want to pay tribute, as the Council did, to the health workers and professionals on the ground from our Member States in particular who are going in, but also health workers from across Africa and across the globe. They are very brave people; they have gone in under very difficult conditions. As the Commissioner said, we need to strengthen the health systems in those countries and, if we make that commitment to strengthen them, it is a good investment for European citizens, because ultimately it will protect us at home as well.

Mr President, the international community's underestimation of the crisis and the lack of a well-coordinated strategy explain the more than worrying spread of the virus. Are we up to the challenge? The answer, alas, is no until we can contain the pandemic. The number of Ebola infections doubles every three weeks. The longer the response is, the more difficult it will become to stop proliferation. In the case of Ebola, you have to be faster than the virus. What do we need? Vigilance, of course. It is important, in the immediate future, to ensure a capacity of some 2,000 beds to receive the necessary care but also to prevent further contamination outside isolated areas. Not the day after tomorrow, not tomorrow, but now, right now.  This is a serious time. We need resolute action. The great humanitarians have indicated all that needs to be done. If any of them appeal to the international community to mobilize all means, including military ones, and deploy them under the leadership of the United Nations, that is to say that the time is no longer for academic discussion. We have to do something.  It is by creating treatment centres that we can provide care to those who are infected. Treatment capacity is insufficient and very often non-existent. Too often, patients are turned away at the door of saturated centres and have no choice but to return home at the risk of contaminating others.  In Liberia, the situation is changing in a particularly dramatic way. Indeed, in this country, the health system is, so to speak, down. If the international community's response to the current tragedy before our eyes were to prove insufficient, other health facilities in the region could also collapse. We should also note the disastrous impact of the current crisis on economic activity. In many companies, the production tool is at a standstill. This makes the countries concerned even more dependent on foreign aid.

Development aid is not charity, gentlemen, it is justice. And European countries have a huge debt to African countries. And I'm not going to talk about the resources we continue to commit on that continent. But it seems that the people of the South are not a priority even in situations of extreme need.

Mr President, I would like to go back a little bit to the question of how we have managed and mismanaged this epidemic. It started on 22 March in Guinea and quickly spread to Sierra Leone, Liberia, now Senegal and Nigeria. As you said, there are more than four thousand nine hundred people, but that is an assessment because we do not really know how many people are infected, and more than two thousand four hundred dead. The international community has not reacted quickly enough, even WHO. They thought, we're going to do what we used to do, we're going to be able to contain the epidemic. And then it went at a high speed V and we realized that the countries could not respond, we are in a state of war. When we see the situation in Liberia, even the Prime Minister says \"my country is going to collapse\", there is no health system, there is no business and even there is a food crisis that threatens.   I was quite pleased when I saw that the Commission said that it was releasing EUR 150 million, but that is not enough! There has been a lack of international coordination and we would have liked the United Nations, through OCHA for humanitarian crises, to address this problem, because we need real coordination.  When I heard President Obama say, \"We are going to put three thousand military personnel in,\" and I would like to respond to my colleague, it is not three thousand military personnel, three thousand people are going to set up hospitals to meet the demand. And that's a good thing. But beware, this will not be enough, the Commission must say 'we too will put hospitals, we too will put staff'. I have my children who are at MSF there and the situation is catastrophic. I have heard Commissioner Borg say that the risk is low in Europe. But he didn't understand anything! If this virus ever mutates, it could be a global epidemic. So you really have to be aware of the magnitude of the problem. Last thing: it is very good to say we need repatriation, we need planes, but do you know that at the moment there is no plane that is capable of repatriating a volunteer and in particular all these humanitarians working there?", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "Verts/ALE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 492, "date": "2014-09-17.json", "name": "Ignazio CORRAO", "mepid": "124856", "text": "  Mr President, president, ladies and gentlemen, i.e. the european Union, the European Union and its Member States are Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Ebola epidemic in North Africa is having a very strong health impact and a very high cost in terms of human lives. There are more than two thousand five hundred deaths and about five thousand infected, but in the African countries most affected by the virus, attention and concrete action have not so far been adequately concentrated. The Western world, easily suggestive, has been enormously alarmed and rightly mobilised whenever the contagion of a Westerner has occurred, but the same emotions, the same pathos, the same apprehension have not manifested themselves in the face of the hundreds of victims in Africa, which generally returns to interest when it comes to going to exploit resources.  I've often heard of blending. What better opportunity than an emergency such as the one caused by the Ebola virus to actively begin to make those multinationals that make huge profits from the resources of the countries most affected actively? Ebola is not only a health and humanitarian emergency, it is not only death and fear of contagion, it is also a social and political problem and it generates a disastrous economic effect. The FAO recently announced the huge risk to crops in West Africa. The secondary effects of this crisis are becoming increasingly apparent. Food insecurity is worsening the already fragile economies of these countries, which are now facing the rapid collapse of exports.  The challenges for Europe are immense. Local institutions are very weak, public health systems ineffective, inconsistent, even in some cases non-existent. There is a lack of basic infrastructure, roads and facilities to deal with the emergency.

And I wonder and wonder whether Europe can still turn a blind ear to the landing of thousands of people who, over and above the Ebola virus, can, indeed are carriers – these are data from Italian hospitals – of tuberculosis and scabies, but which do not stop in Italy, I say this to our European colleagues who care. The problem is not just Italian, the problem is European, so I ask you whether it makes sense to continue to pick up these people in the middle of the sea without any kind of control, guarantee or even if the money we are banging away for Mare Nostrum would not be better spent in Africa, in North Africa to prevent these people from traveling to death and to prevent us and our children from any possible infection.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "NI", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 494, "date": "2014-09-17.json", "name": "Bogdan Brunon WENTA", "mepid": "124903", "text": "   Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking West Africa is the largest Ebola outbreak.

Also, 160 medical personnel lost their lives in the fight against this epidemic. Ebola control is hampered by outbreaks of infection in various countries, insufficient precautions, dangerous cultural and funeral habits, lack of knowledge, diagnosis and handling of the disease.  The Director-General of the World Health Organization has announced that the epidemic is international in scope. Let us note that this epidemic can affect us all. It is the specific responsibility and responsibility of the European Union to support the African side and strengthen humanitarian aid and to monitor and plan actions to prevent further epidemics. The European Parliament resolution is very important. I support the transfer of an additional EUR 140 million from the European Union and the Member States.  Between 2000 and 2003, Ebola outbreaks with an 85% mortality rate occurred in Central Africa, but the further development of the epidemic was finally managed.

On that continent, on the other hand, there is armed violence, there is terrorism, there are civil conflicts everywhere. A continent that a few decades ago abandoned the situation of colonialism, but is now being colonized in its resources and structures. On that continent, the Ebola crisis has now broken out. The Ebola crisis, which, as Commissioner Georgieva pointed out, has three characteristics: exponential growth of those affected; a very high death toll of around 60%; and, on the other hand, also the lack of health structures with which these countries can deal with the problem. And that is our challenge: to offer, of course, structures; provide sanitary equipment; and allow humanitarian access.

However, I will answer on the issue of the British role in the research programmes that I am describing. In answer to the second question about Italian researchers, again I cannot speak for Italian researchers. The UK research community is one of the leaders in trying to solve and help find solutions for infectious diseases that unless cured at source are putting increased risks back on our own communities at home, for example drug-resistant TB, which is back in parts of Europe.

When we come out of this crisis, we will have to ask ourselves why the extremely slow international response will be. What has been dysfunctional for months that has made us take too long to take this issue head-on? That's the first question. Second, I want to acknowledge President Obama's commitment. I think it is good that there is a strong voice that has come up with this issue. And I know what you are doing, Commissioner, but I regret that there is not a strong voice - I do not know where the President of the Commission or the President of the Italian Council is - who spoke on behalf of the Union, on behalf of Europe in this battle that we must all fight against Ebola.

Nevertheless, it is not only a requirement of humanitarian aid that we help in West Africa, but above all it is also in our long-term interest. This is because several states are imploding. These are dramatic crises that are taking place there, and god knows we have enough crises in the world. That is why it is also in our interest to support these countries and to do everything we can.

It would be so easy to discard our responsibilities by saying that this disease does not directly affect our continent. In reality, this is a real global crisis. The values that we Europeans in the world up to these values of solidarity, dignity and respect for human rights make our support for the countries concerned a moral obligation. I really want to highlight the efforts that are being made by the medical teams there, there on the ground, by the NGOs.

There are, of course, health risks that could extend to Europe, but above all there is the risk of destabilisation of an entire region in social, economic and humanitarian terms. Europe cannot and must not remain passive in the face of such a tragedy, for it must also be Europe for our fellow citizens: a Europe that takes its place on the international stage and assumes its responsibilities.  But, we can really question ourselves. The Ebola virus was discovered in 1976 and so far there is no known treatment! That must be of concern to us. I see it as proof that we need to encourage research and innovation in the medical field more than ever. It's absolutely essential.

I am concerned about one issue, which is the resources we allocate. We are well aware that, in order to act quickly and to have a strong response, we need resources which will then serve to mobilise people and resources to help the people affected. Unfortunately, there are few resources in Europe's budget today, and they are few because we do not have sufficient room for flexibility in the multiannual financial framework. Well, this should prompt us in the budgetary negotiations that we are making to focus on those necessary resources, even at the expense of some other programme which is perhaps not as high priority as this intervention. On the other hand, allow me to say that, on behalf of this Parliament, as chairman of the Committee on Health and Social Affairs, at the informal Council on Monday 22 December in Milan, I will point out the need for an extraordinary effort by all twenty-eight countries to ensure that there is coordinated, strong and immediate action, because an epidemic such as this, even if it does not directly affect us today, certainly needs a time-free intervention in order to be able to prevent, of course, the problems that we may have in our own country.

In this respect, it has hurt me and many of us when you and your people in the Commission have almost begged the Member States not only to get going, but also to do so.

According to the World Health Organization, Ebola is a public health emergency that requires a coordinated international response. In this race we have to be faster than this silent enemy that has already claimed two thousand and three hundred lives. The situation, ladies and gentlemen, is deteriorating rapidly and Ebola is affecting the region's weak economies and, consequently, public order. Humanitarian needs are increasing and, if not met, it will be much more difficult to combat this disease. The number of patients grows much faster than our ability to manage it. We know that the Commission has increased humanitarian aid, but it also needs to increase the support of experts in the region.

This tragic event presents us with the structural fragility of the health systems of many African countries, and I believe that this also highlights the underdevelopment conditions in many parts of Africa. Only by relaunching the Union's cooperation and development policies will it be possible to avoid tragedies such as this in the future, such as through the fight against poverty, which becomes a priority.

Let me first start with the question of whether Europe acted quickly. From the humanitarian side, it did. We were the first to bring financial support and to send our own staff – our own doctors are there risking their lives – to mobilise attention to this epidemic. Since March when it started, we have been repeatedly giving a very straightforward message from the humanitarian side. This is serious. We have to act in a coordinated manner. Already in August, together with the World Health Organisation, we approached our Member States by activating the Civil Protection Mechanism asking for support in kind for the affected communities. Very often we in the humanitarian community are like the canary in the mine. We feel trouble and we sense danger before the rest of the world understands the magnitude of this danger. But it is also true that the international community as a whole has not been quick enough to respond to calls, from the doctors in the field and especially from Médecins Sans Frontières, the organisation that has been right there from day one. It has taken some time for the world to recognise – even the World Health Organisation if I am to be very honest – that this is very serious and requires a massive response. I want to praise our Member States because in the last weeks we have seen a surge in reaction from them: just to give you some examples, Austria with protective equipment, Italy with a field hospital, the United Kingdom and France with new centres to be opened and more beds to be provided, Hungary with assistance in kind, Spain with an emergency unit in the Kenema province in Sierra Leone, etc. Our military staff are also looking into how they can contribute – today and tomorrow – to the critical evacuation capability of which many of you have spoken as a crucial need for the medical professions in the field but also, broadly speaking, for evacuation capacity. So we are now finally seeing mobilisation on a global scale. But we also have to stay focused, because in today’s world we are facing crises competing with each other for attention and for resources. Not including Ebola, we have four level 3 emergencies – this is the highest possible level in humanitarian terms in the world – Iraq, Syria, the Central African Republic and South Sudan. I would like to respond immediately to those of you have said that we have to create more flexibility in the budget in order to direct funds very quickly to where early action will save lives, but also to reduce the cost, the human suffering and the financial cost of response in the future. I hope that we will work sooner rather than later on this flexibility of response in a more fragile world.  I was asked how this virus is spreading. Well, it is through the handling of infected chimpanzees, gorillas, monkeys, porcupines, but at the moment we are not seeing it as a danger for the rest of the world because we are not seeing that kind of movement of products. Also the virus dies, so from the time between a problem arising and its possible arrival in Europe, we do not have a danger. This is what the medical profession is telling us.  And also a very direct question: is the opening up of travel a risk for Europe? Let me first state something you may or may not know: that MSF do not have a single case of their international staff being infected by Ebola, and they are there, they are in the middle of it. In other words, Ebola is controllable. It means washing your hands, making sure that you sanitise before you get on the plane, and of course our airlines are doing that, so I think that we are very strong in our precautionary measures, and therefore we should not worry that keeping this line of communication open is going to be a danger. On the contrary, if we stop this ability to send more medical doctors to these countries and to bring out our nurses and doctors from the most dangerous zones, then the epidemic is going to explode and then the danger to us may – may – become real, because the longer we do not fight, the bigger the risk of this virus mutating. We have been asked about vaccines and using research. At the moment, there is very aggressive deployment of all that has been developed in terms of vaccines and treatment so that we can provide help to people who are infected. But let us be very fair and straight on that: quantities are limited. So can we help everybody who needs help today? The answer is no, and this is why we have to make every effort possible to fight Ebola at origin, now, and do it in the most aggressive way we can. My last point is on coordination. I could not agree more that coordination saves lives.

At the operational level, the needs on the ground remain substantial and include medical and humanitarian personnel, as well as laboratories, hospitals, etc. Other health needs are becoming an even greater problem due to the collapse of health systems in Liberia and Sierra Leone. There are also shortcomings in food and nutrition, agriculture, governance and security. All these factors can create instability that in turn risks contributing to the spread of Ebola.

In both countries the situation has changed radically in recent months. The Foreign Affairs Council of 15 August, the Gymnich and the European Council at the end of August addressed these increasingly pressing crises. On 15 September, France organised an international conference on peace and security in Iraq, co-chaired by President François Hollande and Iraqi President Masum. The meeting was attended by foreign ministers from thirty delegations who pledged to support Iraq's efforts to meet an unreserved challenge.   We are dismayed and outraged, like all of you, by the violence, murders and human rights violations perpetrated by ISIL, particularly against religious, ethnic minorities, including helpless women and children. We reaffirm our firm commitment to support the unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq.  The European Union has urged Iraqi leaders to establish an inclusive government capable of giving a political response to the crisis. We welcome the formation of the new government led by Al Abadi. ISIL and other armed groups represent a very serious terrorist threat to the entire surrounding region and a direct challenge to the security of the European Union and the entire international community. The intentions of the jihadists are very clear: the goal is to occupy territory that allows them to found what they call the \"Islamic State\". The terrorist threat itself is nothing new, it is its global reach that is unprecedented. In some ways ISIL poses as a state that controls territory, manages important assets and imposes taxes. It also has access to considerable, smuggled financial resources, such as oil and other raw materials. The European Union is determined to prevent ISIL from having access to oil financing and proceeds. EU ministers condemned ISIL financiers who acted in violation of UN Security Council Resolution 1267 and later. The despicable actions of the jihadists go from the heinous murder of hostages and prisoners, to abuse of children and women, to the persecution of members of religious and ethnic minorities and the vilification of sacred and cultural sites. Violations of human rights are carried out on a large scale and affect freedom of religion or belief, an essential principle, particularly in a multi-ethnic region, which would require being able to live their beliefs freely without fear of acts of intolerance or aggression. The European Union is determined to counter the threat of ISIL and other terrorist groups in Iraq and Syria, as called for in UN Security Council Resolution 2170. The perpetrators of these crimes will be accountable for their actions. We also have a specific responsibility for the large number of European citizens who have sided with other foreign fighters.  The European Union must act urgently on three fronts: security, political and humanitarian. The fight against ISIL and the alarming humanitarian situation are a top priority. The European Union and its Member States individually are engaged on a number of fronts, including the support of some Member States for president Obama's coalition. We are aware that the military and anti-terrorist response alone is not enough. Actions against ISIL must be seen in a broader context of reforms in Iraq and political transition in Syria. The Member States, on an individual basis, are providing military support through the supply of weapons, ammunition and equipment.  Specifically, US airstrikes and military support to Kurdish regional authorities in Iraq have been crucial in containing ISIL's offensive. The European Union as a whole supports these efforts politically. The action is under way and the first results are already being seen. The Iraqi armed forces have regained ground, as have Kurdish forces in the north of the country. The appointment of Al Abadi as prime minister by President Masum and the subsequent formation of an inclusive government are steps forward. The European Council welcomed the efforts of the United States and other partners, including the initiative of an international security conference in Iraq. The involvement and active engagement of partners in the region is essential to this challenge for security and stability. On the humanitarian side, the situation in Iraq is extremely worrying, with 1.8 million internally displaced persons since January 2014. Access to the population in conflict and risk zones in different parts of Iraq remains a priority for the Union. While humanitarian operations are continuing in the north of the country, unstable security conditions are hampering access to other parts of central Iraq, including the Al Anbar Governorate. Despite the budgetary constraints, the European Union has stepped up its efforts by allocating an additional EUR 10 million to combat the crisis. Thanks to this contribution, the eu's total budget for humanitarian actions in Iraq has reached 17 million euros since the beginning of the year. In addition, the Member States have paid another forty million euros in humanitarian aid. The EU Civil Protection Mechanism has also been activated to facilitate humanitarian assistance. The European Union has brought particular assistance to the most vulnerable groups in Syria and Iraq, mobilising more than EUR 2.87 billion in relief and assistance in Syria and its neighbours. Our help is aimed at all people in need without any discrimination. In Syria, ISIL is strengthening its presence in the country and could soon take refuge on the ground for its destabilization activities. The rise of ISIL in Syria is the result of instability caused by the Assad regime's brutal war against its own people. A lasting solution requires a relaxation of tension, an end to violence and a political transition that is led by the Syrians themselves. The European Union fully supports the mission of the UN Special Envoy, Ambassador de Mistura, to return from consultations in Damascus. On a more general level, we are convinced that the rise of ISIL can only be countered by the synergy of prevention, control and sanctions.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "NI"}, {"id": 537, "date": "2014-09-17.json", "name": "Arnaud DANJEAN", "mepid": "96747", "text": "  on behalf of the EPP group. Madam President, it took the fall of Mosul, the terrible persecution of Christians and other minorities, the killing of Western hostages, for our States to take the measure of urgency in the face of the destabilization of Iraq and the whole region by a self-proclaimed terrorist group Islamic State. We had pointed out here, a little less than two months ago, that this phenomenon unfortunately did not date back to these tragic events but that it was much more deeply rooted in the bad sectarian governance that prevailed in Iraq in recent years, in the chaos of Syria naturally and in the murky influence games between many regional actors.  The diplomatic and military response of the United States and several European states is welcome. She's to be saluted. Airstrikes and aid to Kurdish fighters have helped stem the Islamist surge.  However, I think that we should not be deluded about the chosen format, as it is currently presented. The display of a broad coalition is undoubtedly an exercise that is necessary diplomatically but suffers from serious limitations. This coalition first covers, behind a common objective in the very short term, a lot of ambiguity on the part of actors with divergent interests. It forgets the key countries we need in this fight - I am thinking in particular of Iran - and also avoids the complexity of our approach to the Syrian conflict. We also know that airstrikes and arms deliveries are necessary but that they will not be enough to defeat this terrorist group. Finally, the focus on this Islamic state is understandable, but it risks forgetting some other groups, some other threats, while provoking the rallying of jihadist groups, hitherh marginal, to this Islamic State. The Islamic State and its expansion into Iraq and Syria are far from the only Islamist threat facing the Middle East and our Western societies. In the face of this multifaceted challenge, enhanced and very pragmatic legal, intelligence, special operations and military operations coordination is needed to provide a lasting solution.  I would particularly like to stress the need to harmonize anti-terrorism legislation between European countries because we see the phenomenon of these European foreign fighters going to train in Syria and Iraq, a phenomenon that is increasing and poses a real threat to our societies.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 538, "date": "2014-09-17.json", "name": "Victor BOŞTINARU", "mepid": "39711", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group. – Madam President, my group is extremely concerned by the deterioration in the security and the humanitarian situation in Syria and Iraq. The extreme violence used, the indiscriminate killings, have resulted in a large number of civilian victims of IS, including a large number of women and children, as well as the complete destruction of important Shiite, Yazidi and Christian places and symbols. The cruelty and unacceptable use of violence against large communities is condemned by the international community. We have a duty to act.  I am very shocked by the murder of David Haines, the third Westerner to be killed by IS militants recently. We know that in many cases people from our EU Member States have also been involved in the conflict, the so-called ‘tourist terrorists’, who are now coming back posing an even higher risk to our security. It is essential that our Member States do all they can to prevent this from happening, and to identity these people and render them harmless, which requires coordination among the 28 Member States.  We need to see the problem not as a national one, but as a regional one, and for the regional problem to be addressed we need a regional response. Iraq cannot be seen as a different problem from Syria, and IS must be contained and then defeated, but this can only happen if we can find a suitable and pragmatic solution. We are dealing with an extremist fundamentalist group which is using a harsh interpretation of Sharia law and our first responsibility is to make clear the difference between this violent group and Islam.

It resulted in the deaths of countless citizens of both countries and the need to flee, to find refuge in other countries. The establishment of the government of Haidar al-Abadi is a hope, it creates hope and there is no doubt that the free world, the European Union, should do everything it can to help stabilise, to make this government a united, inclusive Kurdish community and Kurdish politicians, ensuring the stability and unity of the country.  Less than a week later, an international conference was held, co-chaired by President Hollande. This conference is certainly a hope, but there has been a relatively small share of high representatives of the countries of my region, Central and Eastern Europe. However, Minister Lavrov, representing the same country that threatened my country with a nuclear attack a few days ago, was present. I hope that the Union will maintain unity, balance in assessing all threats and will not allow concessions to Russia in exchange for its participation in the anti-terrorist coalition.

That goes for Iraq; that goes for Syria; and I would like to dare to add that it also goes for Ukraine. I hope that one day we will face that question. In the meantime we must meet the many challenges posed by those situations, challenges that are humanitarian, military, political and societal. In the humanitarian field, there are millions of refugees, both internally displaced persons (IDPs) and refugees in neighbouring countries, so there is a need for increased humanitarian assistance and I hope that, at the international donor conferences which are being organised, many Member States and the EU will come up with increased support. There is also the need for better protection of minorities, including religious ones and all vulnerable groups. On the military front, there is the need to fight Islamic State (IS) and other extremist militant groups. My group leader called a long time ago for a military intervention in Syria, and at the time – I honestly recognise it – I thought he was exaggerating a little bit. Unfortunately events have proved him right: had we intervened earlier things might not have taken the bad turn that they did. Now, a coalition is being put together to take military action against IS, but if Afghanistan has taught us anything it is that groups like the Taliban or IS are not easily defeated, so we will also need political answers: political answers and societal answers. Political action means supporting a unified government in Iraq; trying to ensure a transition in Syria if that is not a completely impossible task, and, if it is, imposing one; strengthening the present regimes in Jordan and Lebanon; and demanding stronger actions by Arab countries.

The crimes of the Islamic State terrorist militia are extremely cruel and heinous. In Iraq .... (microphone failure) Yesterday, THE UN Syria investigator Pinheiro presented his eighth Syria report to the UN Human Rights Council, and he describes some of the crimes committed by ISIS. He says that the jihadists not only publicly executed the two foreign journalists, but that they are killing many Syrians in the same way in public places in the north and east of the country. ISIS systematically exposes children to violence. They are encouraged to take part in executions and are allegedly confronted with crucified in public places.  Women accused of adultery or who are found in public without male accompaniment would be stoned to death. So far the report. However, Pinheiro also stresses that the Syrian government is still responsible for the majority of civilian crimes committed in Syria.  I would like to take this opportunity to reiterate our awareness that there must be no impunity for all these crimes – crimes against humanity and war crimes – that are happening in Syria and Iraq, and I therefore call once again for the International Criminal Court in The Hague to investigate war crimes there. However, some of the demands in the resolution do not agree, namely where it is said that the fight against ISIS should be waged by all means. It may be necessary to use military means on a point-by-point basis, especially when it comes to the protection of civilians. What we strongly oppose, however, including in this resolution, is an uncontrollable, unregulated military action.

Before Britain joined the European Community, our independent foreign policy allowed us to broker alliances for the protection of those who were threatened. However, in the name of communality, we are losing this skill. This is all the more tragic as genuine diplomacy is what is needed at this pivotal moment in history. Your obsession with harmonisation and a belief that you are always right can only be defined as navel-gazing. Britain, not the European Union, needs to take a lead here, not with troops on the ground but with the diplomacy to motivate and galvanise a global community of reasonable people, including moderate Muslims, to put a stop to these murderous fanatics – including EU citizens in their ranks – who are intent on destroying the tolerance and decency which underpins civilised society. The Western world wanted raging change in Libya and Syria, yet our leaders failed to comprehend how tangled the web of Middle East politics really is. Diplomacy is not about the good guys against the bad guys; it is about understanding how competing countries with competing interests can nevertheless find common ground against this global threat. So, this place has to wake up and smell the coffee. If we are serious about tackling IS then just like in 1941 you have to accept Russia and now her ability to reach out to Middle Eastern states which view the West differently. I am no fan of Assad or Putin, but I recognise the old premise that my enemyʼs enemy is my friend.

Events today add to the tragic history of conflict both in Iraq and in Syria, and my group believes that there can be no substitute for the creation of stable, pluralistic democracies in both countries with full respect for minority and human rights and no impunity for all those responsible for violations. As Socialists and Democrats we emphasise that many Muslims, in the Arab world and within our own borders, are appalled by this horrendous violence. Although there are those who would call this an Islamic State, let me state that this is a fight not against Islam, a great religion of peace, but one against terrorism. Our group says that European diplomacy must give priority to a regional solution, one that, despite the difficulties, must include the participation of Iran and of Saudi Arabia. I have to say I am appalled at the evidence given to the Committee on Foreign Affairs that actors within the European Union Member States are purchasing oil which directly finances Islamic State and I hope that the President-in-Office in his response will commit to the urgent investigation of this problem that our resolution demands. Finally let me express deepest sympathy for the death of the aid worker from my own Member State, Great Britain, David Haines. Humanitarian workers go into zones of conflict and of danger in the world motivated only by the wish to help others. Their only protection is the principles of international humanitarian law as enshrined in the Geneva Conventions. Since 2003 the United Nations has said that any attack on a humanitarian aid worker by a belligerent party is itself a crime of war. Humanitarian workers indeed represent the best of humanity, and the killing of David Haines and the threat against other humanitarian workers can only be described as an inhuman act.

A number of NATO states have already been rightly arming the brave Kurdish Peshmerga which, with the US air strikes, has proven an effective way in halting some of the gains made by IS. I welcome yesterday’s announcement in Paris of a wide-ranging coalition made up of both Western and Arab nations against ISIS. Ahead of the Security Council meeting of 24 September we must also now find a way to extend these military actions against IS in Syria, particularly in Raqqa, their capital, as well as in Iraq where operations are currently going on. Lastly, the EU needs to address the issue of more than 1000 EU citizens who are fighting as ISIS jihadis and how we prevent their return to commit terrorist acts in our own countries. This threat unusually posed by ISIS is one rare issue in foreign policy which unites all major powers across the globe, both democratic and authoritarian.

And despite the support and recognition of the international community, they have suffered ongoing attacks by Iraqi al Maliki forces remote-directed from Tehran. Since their arrival at the camp in August 2012, these Iranian citizens have been enduring very long restrictions, which have intensified to intolerable levels since last August, when Iraqi forces, taking advantage of the chaos generated by the rise of the Islamic State, further tightened the rope around the neck of refugees, by blocking fuel supplies , food and medicine. Medical blockage is probably the most tragic and outrageous. In the past month, patients with cancer and other serious illnesses — in several terminal cases — have been repeatedly denied the necessary treatment and medical care.

This bloody nightmare arises from the superficiality of those who felt in the Persian Gulf and elsewhere that it was useful for bringing down Syria.

The road to fragile Iraq at risk of Balkanisation was cleared. Is it by chance that these fanatics, riding on the resentment of the Sunnis, declare that they want to cancel the Sykes-Picot agreements and the unfortunate partition of that Treaty of Sèvres that ignored tribal cultures, ethnic identities and theological divisions of Islam? Anyone who is under the illusion that this time a solution can be found, hypocritical as it is bloody, with massive bombing and the support of local factions is mistaken. He is wrong because the iraqi army, which is corrupt and now known for leaks and abandonment of weapons and vehicles, will not be enough, and ISIS obviously thanks.  Nor will the Iraqi Kurds be enough if we do not have the courage to recognise that the issue of Kurdistan, of the whole of Kurdistan, is calling for a solution at last.

Among these groups are many of the oldest Christian communities in the region who are now treated as foreigners to be killed or ousted. We have to really perceive what is happening. People are being indiscriminately murdered, tortured, sold as slaves and forced to flee in masses. To counter this new level of terrorism and crimes against humanity, declarations do not suffice. We need concrete actions, efficient international coordination, and also the use of force, because terrorists can be contained only by united political will and better arms. The American airstrikes have made a difference but it is not enough. Yesterday eight Christian leaders in Iraq called for the deployment of international troops on the ground, because airstrikes by themselves cannot defeat terrorists who are fighting among the local population. As a minimum, the international community must create safe havens in Iraq and Syria where refugees could have security and minimal assistance. At the moment the main issue is to assist refugees and repel terrorists, but our next commitment and responsibility is to ultimately guarantee the return of Christian communities and all traditional minorities to their place of origin, so that they can resume living there in dignity, equality and safety, freely practising their religion.

It is sold below the market price and also reaches EU countries.

After the murder of two American journalists and the violent death of the British aid worker David Haines, it has also become clear to everyone in Europe what Yazidis, Aramaeans, Shiites and Christians are going through in the region. The barbaric ideology of the Islamic State, which is forcibly intervening, is despicable, despicable, and it must be combated. I am therefore pleased that progress has been made at the Paris conference, that there is a determination, particularly on the part of the United States and France, with reconnaissance flights, to help with airstrikes in a very practical way. I would like the United Kingdom to be involved. And I would like my own country – i see this differently from colleagues who have spoken here – to do the same, so that Germany also participates, and not just with arms supplies. We have seen in the past that such arms deliveries are often directed against those who make the arms deliveries with the best of intentions. I think that is wrong. I think it is right to support the Iraqi forces, as well as the Iraqi Government, in protecting the integrity of their territory. An attempt must also be made to make the United Nations more accountable. Resolution 2710 was considerably too weak. I do not know what was decisive for this, but the discussions were certainly not enough to achieve a good result and a strong mandate from the United Nations.

The simple fact is that now, through government failure to tackle home-grown extremism, Britain is now directly threatened by Islamic State.  In the Middle East the West has long been seen as the ‘bad guys’, mainly due to the actions of Bush Sr, Bush Jr and Blair.

It is a moral requirement because a group, in the name of religious perversion, pursues from its murderous fanaticism all those who do not share its madness. Christians first, on whom I drew the attention of the President of our Parliament on 22 July and then several times in August, by asking him for an exceptional meeting of our Parliament on this subject. I'm sorry I wasn't heard. But also on moderate Muslims, on foreigners but also on nationals of these countries. And we, in the name of our values, cannot allow this to happen, we must act, not just in words but in a concrete way, by allowing people to also stay at home because it is not a question of having countries that become monoreligious, which could only lead to additional tensions. That is why it is also a political necessity for us to act because this fundamentalism feeds and encourages war between the Western world and the Muslim world. It pushes terrorists to act against our nationals wherever they are in the world and against our countries. I think it should be made clear here that no country is immune from terrorist acts, whether large or small, whether it is in the north or south of Europe, whether it has acted in this or that circumstance or that it has not. No one is safe and that is why everyone should act. A political summit, a sporting meeting, a religious event are, in the eyes of terrorists, the ideal place to act because what they are looking for is probably less to kill than to have media coverage. And they know how to use communication very well. We do need, together, to have the necessary needs. I say \"together,\" which means that some countries, which always rely on others for military action, may also have to understand that they must also make financial efforts.

A Europe that invented free will, invented freedom of thought, freedom to believe but also - and this is probably a hallmark of Europe - the freedom not to believe. And the jihadists don't want it.  Then, let us say it in this Chamber, if we Europeans do not defend the Christians of the East, who in the world will defend them? What are the solutions? Of course, military. To annihilate the Islamic State militarily and prevent it from harming and, as such, ladies and gentlemen, shame on all those Member States of the Union unable to line up a single plane, a single soldier to defend their values.  Of course, strengthen our humanitarian aid but, at the same time, stop these totally idiotic policies which, under the guise of wanting to protect the Christians of the East, want to move them to Europe or elsewhere. The Christians of the East are at home in Iraq, they are at home in Syria. That's where they have their homes, that's where they have their values. That's where we have to defend them. Of course, give them the means to weigh in on their future when peace returns. And as such, we must have in mind the Lebanese political model, which is certainly imperfect, but which gives each religious group guarantees of political representativeness.  Finally, to those who think that the Christians of the East must fend for themselves in their corner and who have not seen the genocide that is taking place, I mean the following very simple thing: if you do not want to act for the Christians of the East, act for you!

What has happened in recent months is that the situation has become acute, and therefore exceptional solutions are needed. One such solution is the realisation of a protected zone for the endangered minorities. With an internationally monitored protection zone, security would be increased – threatened groups could return home.

Not to vote for this is to vote for the rise of terrorism.\" The proposal for a closed zone is included in the EPP's motion for a resolution today. Unfortunately, it is deleted in the joint resolution. Socialists, Liberals and Greens blocked this proposal. Two points recur in their arguments. Firstly, this would require military action. Secondly, there is too much talk of vulnerable Christians. Against this background, it is relevant to ask social democrats, liberals and greens what their message is to those people who are currently fearing for their lives and who are appealing for our help with security and protection in northern Iraq. Of course, military action is needed to maintain a protected zone. Of course, Christians are in focus, but not just Christians. A protected zone would also provide protection for Yazidis and Shias.

On the night of July 10, DAESH takes Mosul: five hundred thousand people—Christians, Muslims, Sunnis, Shia—flee hastily. At the end of July, DAESH, in Mosul, marks the houses of Christians with the letter \"N\" (Nasrani, \"Christian\") and those of non-Muslims with the letter \"R\" (rwafidh, \"rejected\"). Terrible religious purification begins: either they embrace Islam or they have to pay the jizya—the Islamic tax for Jews and Christians—or they die. Either they leave town or they're killed. On 6 August inhabitants of thirteen Christian cities on the plain of Nineveh flee in the face of the threat of imminent invasion of DAESH without any Kurdish protection, nor from their peshmerga. These are one hundred to one hundred and twenty thousand Christians out in the open. From one hundred to one hundred and twenty thousand Christians to forty degrees of temperature, in public spaces around the churches, desperate. Their women and their girls are, for DAESH, spoils of war, in the way of the Yahiliya, before the Islamic era. Constant violations of human rights are nothing more than a social pathology that derives from a fanatical ideology, from a false political Islam that aims to conquer and impose Islamic sharia as supreme law. It's about creating a caliphate through terror, fear, oppression, systematic purification and weapons. That's what we're up against. Either we stop them, or they'll follow their progress without limits. A breakthrough of terror, domination and death. We stand in solidarity today with so many innocent victims.

Libya, a country on the southern shore of the Mediterranean, is failing to end hostilities in its main cities, with a government in crisis struggling to fulfil its basic functions. As you know, parliament meets in Tobruk, 1 200 kilometres from the capital, while a parallel government and parliament are installed in Tripoli. The intervention of third countries in support of the two opposing camps aggravates the current division. The situation has reached the point where an increasing number of Libyans are talking about the plausible risk of civil war.  As stated in the conclusions of the European Council of 30 August, the European Union expresses its growing concern at the current violation of human rights and the humanitarian situation in the areas affected by the fighting, such as Benghazi and the Wershefana area. The alleged attacks on the civilian population and civilian targets are unacceptable and must stop immediately. The impact on regional security, including in Europe, is becoming increasingly tangible. The attacks in Algeria and Egypt, the perpetrators of which come from Libyan territory, as well as the unprecedented number of irregular migrants landing on the Italian and Maltese coasts, give a measure of the seriousness of the situation. Terrorism, trafficking in human beings and the proliferation of weapons are expanding against a background of a growing lack of legality. The situation is dramatic. And yet the vast majority of Libyans want an end to violence and a peaceful resolution of conflicts. Families mourn their dead, they don't want the fighting to continue. An increasing number of groups, including prominent tribes in the South, reject a choice of camp and call for a easing of tension. The situation in Libya has not reached an irreversible point, but time is playing against it. The international community has mobilised in support of a peaceful solution to the crisis. A ministerial conference is being held today in Madrid at which Libya's neighbours in Europe and Africa discuss the issues at stake and the possibility of concerted initiatives. Next week, Secretary of State Kerry and UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon will host a meeting on Libya on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly. The EU strongly supports the efforts of the UN Support Mission in Libya, led by Bernardino León, to achieve an immediate ceasefire and bring the parties together around the negotiating table to resume the political process. UN Security Council Resolution 2174, adopted on 27 August, broadened the scope of international sanctions on Libya to include those who work against peace, threaten Libya's stability or security or undermine the success of the political transition.  The EU considers that the legitimacy of the House of Representatives comes from the elections last June. At the same time, we stress the need for the House of Representatives to involve all parties in order to achieve an inclusive agreement. Unfortunately, some of the messages sent and the decisions taken by the House of Representatives itself in recent weeks may have exacerbated the directions rather than building a bridge between them.  Today, some Members of this Parliament are boycotting its work. We have a duty to persuade all Members of Parliament to reach an agreement so that they can play their full part.  We therefore strongly emphasise the need to create an inclusive government, representing all Libyans who wish to accept the rule of law and the democratic process, regardless of membership. As soon as the situation permits, an inclusive national dialogue must be organised. We welcome the work of the Constituent Assembly in drafting the Constitution. We very much hope that the spirit of consensus and constructive dialogue prevailing there will reach the entire Libyan population. We fully understand the concerns of Libya's neighbours. It is important to note the hospitality that Tunisia has offered to hundreds of thousands of Libyan refugees. It is essential that our neighbours and other countries in the region support mediation efforts aimed at an immediate cessation of hostilities and a political agreement.  It is also essential that the parties involved at regional level refrain from actions that can current divisions and undermine Libya's democratic transition. UN Security Council Resolution 2174 should also make the arms embargo more effective.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "NI"}, {"id": 616, "date": "2014-09-17.json", "name": "Arnaud DANJEAN", "mepid": "96747", "text": "  on behalf of the EPP group. Mr President, we talked about Ukraine, we talked about Syria and Iraq. At the risk of shocking a little, I think that Libya is currently the country in our immediate neighbourhood that probably concentrates the most security and humanitarian challenges for Europe. The structural fragilities of this country were of course awakened by the circumstances of the fall of the Gaddafi regime in 2011. We must not be fooled, however. These structural difficulties, this fragility of Libya do not date from military intervention and it is not a question of speculating endlessly on the merits of what was done, three years ago or not.  The complexity of the crisis we are facing today, the weakness of the Libyan institutions, the multiplicity of actors mean that there is no solution possible in Libya without a minimum of consultation and coherence in the action of neighbouring countries and international organizations. From this point of view, we can regret the too little coordination between all these actors over the last three years.  The framework of the United Nations was, of course, legally indispensable, but it proved to be very weak operationally and everyone had, in fact, carried out their small Libyan policy - including our Member States - in its corner and without any real consultation. This has been the case, in particular, on the key issue of security structures, security institutions and, from this point of view, the United States, Italy, France, the United Kingdom, Qatar, Turkey, NATO and I do not know who else, each has conducted its policy without real consultation and we are now in a situation of total confusion. To the Confusion in Libya, which should not be excused, that should not be exonerated, has responded to the international confusion, and we have not been able to find a lasting solution. This is worth it, and I would like to mention this in conclusion, for the famous European mission that we have undertaken, the EUBAM mission, border management, border management. This is a key issue.

Salwa Bouguiguis was cowardly murdered and her husband kidnapped on June 25 after voting in the last Libyan elections. This tragedy illustrates the spiral of violence and sectarianism that has befell the Libyan people in the last year and calls for the solidarity and urgent action of the international community. Violence is compromising the viability of the state in Libya. And this spiral, if it has much to do with internal rivalries, we cannot ignore that it is also instigated from abroad, either by Kadafist strongholds or by terrorist forces with destabilizing agendas in the region. The priority must be to invest in security and national reconciliation. A ceasefire between rival militias is needed and all parties need to be brought into dialogue. The European Union must impose sanctions on those who put themselves on the sidelines of this process and continue to instigate violence and chaos in Libya. At the Madrid Conference today, alongside humanitarian support, it is essential that the international community and the European Union, in particular, decide to support the training of Libyan security forces, police and armed forces on a national central command to provide security in a region where organised crime with trafficking in human beings, arms, drugs and terrorism proliferates. It's our own safety we're talking about here, too. Libya may be on the verge of becoming a failed state, a sanctuary of armed terrorist networks here on our doorstep, at the gates of the European Union.

The cases of arbitrary detention, abductions, unlawful killings, torture, violence against journalists and officials and human rights defenders are very troubling, and meanwhile there is hardly any government structure to adequately run the country in crisis. We recognise the House of Representatives, but hope that all parties will engage in an inclusive and constructive dialogue to rebuild stability and in fact to rebuild the country. One important step they should take is to ensure that oil which is still flowing is not sold by illegitimate terrorist groups, and in this sense I emphasise EU-based and international companies’ own responsibility to refrain from purchasing such oil. With such threats at our doorsteps, we need the EU to show more leadership. Globally, we now see a chain of Islamist jihadist militias stretching from Nigeria through the Middle East to Pakistan. So we need more EU leadership to fight jihadist militias, to prevent regional spill-overs and to ensure that the people who flee this violence do not suffer a horrible death by drowning in the Mediterranean. We must seek accountability for the perpetrators of violence and end the impunity with which the most horrific crimes are now met.  Additionally, we should put pressure on those who are externally funding Islamist groups and urge them to stop these toxic activities. Sadly, some of these sponsors are our EU allies.

As things stand now, we must state that the European Union has failed to develop and implement a comprehensive strategy for assisting in the post-Gadaffi transition. We deplore the persistent lack of coordination between EU Member States’ policies towards Libya. In the field of security the EU has a limited focus on border and migration management which did not address the root causes of insecurity in Libya. We urge the EU to develop a broad concept for the reform of the security sector in Libya with a special focus on parliamentary oversight of the sector, including strong elements of human rights and humanitarian law training. The EU should further assist in the demobilisation, disarmament and reintegration of former combatants and in the collection and destruction of the many irregular weapons in the country. It should make full use of the Instrument for Stability and Peace with regard to mediation. Even in such a difficult situation as the one now in Libya, it is also absolutely necessary that the EU supports the empowerment of civil society organisations, in particular women’s groups, aiming at finding non-violent solutions to the multiple crises in the country. Finally, let me express grave concern at the fate of migrants, asylum seekers and refugees in Libya whose already precarious situations have further deteriorated. We have ongoing reports on horrific detention conditions for thousands of migrants and refugees – including in government-run centres – and we ask the EU to consider withholding financial support in this sector until this has been investigated.

The United Nations plays a very important role, including as a mediator in seeking political solutions. Neighbouring countries and those throughout the region must help. It is very necessary for the neighbours to help prevent the arms trade fueling this violence, which is what the Security Council has been insisting on lately, in this resolution which I mentioned earlier. I welcome the preciseity of a ministerial conference in Madrid today, attended not only by European countries, but also by neighbouring Libyan countries and members of Dialogue 5+5, together with representatives of the United Nations, the European Union, the Arab League, the African Union and the Union for the Mediterranean — the Italian Presidency referred to this meeting earlier. This Conference is a sign of the support of the countries of the region for the Libyan people in this very difficult situation. There is a very serious deterioration which is seriously affecting Libyan citizens and also creating serious problems at the economic level and certainly in humanitarian, security, displaced, etc., and which has very negative consequences throughout the Mediterranean region and, of course, also in the Sahel. The greatest possible international coordination and concertation is needed. I hope that the Madrid Conference will contribute to this concertation and to identify measures that allow a ceasefire, as well as to this peaceful, inclusive political dialogue, which leads to consensual solutions and reconciliation, for a country in serious danger of fragmentation that needs peace, stability and unity.

Anyone who knows the reality of Libya knows that this could only end up like this, and acknowledging the mistakes today would not be a sign of weakness but of foresight.

Firstly, the identification of a path that can lead to democratic stabilisation, a parliament and a government that works, recognized. Secondly, on the terrorism side, because the confusion that has been created in the country offers enormous space for jihadist and terrorist forces. I do not believe that we are in a situation like Somalia' s, but the problems that exist, if not addressed, are in danger of widening and widening.  The third issue concerns the issue of immigration.

Of course, the only solution we have today is to support the political process and the Parliament that emerged from the June elections and, of course, to do so by involving all the regional actors, since they are the ones who are now using Libyan territory to confront each other.

The current crisis can and must be tackled through peaceful negotiations paving the way for the political process. The European mission EUBAM – Libya, which aims to help the Libyan authorities manage their borders, remains ready to resume full operation, as soon as security conditions allow and to adapt, if necessary, the current mission to the new reality that will emerge in Libya. We trust that the mediation efforts conducted by the UN support mission in Libya, with the support of the EU and its Member States through the special envoys, will begin to produce results. The reports received following the latest visits indicate the possibility of a change in dynamics and a growing willingness on both sides to reach agreement on the basic principles that will guide the political process in the future. The international community must devote all its energy to supporting these efforts and complement them, for example, by applying the relevant UN Security Council resolutions and refraining from actions that risk exacerbating tensions. We hope for a positive outcome to today's ministerial meeting in Madrid and the one scheduled in New York.

By putting an end to a cycle of violence that has left more than 2 100 Palestinians dead and 71 dead among Israelis, this ceasefire has made it possible to launch a much-needed humanitarian assistance operation which is now facing considerable difficulties. However, the ceasefire agreement did not guarantee that the previous status quo would be exceeded. This is of fundamental importance, and the various conclusions adopted by the Foreign Affairs Council and the European Council in recent weeks clearly underline this.  What is needed is a lasting solution to the Gaza issue, which will decisively address both the problems of the people of Gaza and those of Israel. A broad political agreement is needed, which will frame the Gaza problem within the framework of a peaceful and comprehensive solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. There has never been any doubt for the European Union that Gaza should be part of a future Palestinian state. Efforts are continuing to continue the path taken with the ceasefire agreement of 26 August. On 20 September – within the agreed one-month deadline – Egypt is expected to re-invite the parties to Cairo for important negotiations on the key points that remained unresolved in August. These include calls, on the one hand, from the Palestinian side for the opening of a seaport and the reopening of the airport; on the other hand, on the Israeli side, on the security and demilitarisation of the Gaza Strip. At the same time, the members of the UN Security Council are seeking a consensus on the adoption of a resolution establishing an international framework for normalising the situation in Gaza. There is no denying that there is great uncertainty about the outcome of all these negotiations, but one thing is certain: the EU and its Member States spare no effort in trying to achieve a result that is satisfactory to all the parties involved.  The EU is also mobilising to make a concrete and substantial contribution to the reconstruction of Gaza. Of course, the EU's ability to provide practical assistance is closely linked to the political process I have just described. Political stability will be crucial if we are to be able to provide humanitarian assistance and continue to offer stable support. To this end, it will be crucial for the Palestinian Authority to re-establish in Gaza and take back control of security. EU missions already on the ground (EUBAM Rafah and EUPOL COPPS) could provide a good starting point, provided that the parties reach an appropriate agreement and that the situation in Gaza improves from the point of view of conflict and security.  The European Union calls on the Israelis and Palestinians to choose peace and the resolution of the conflict which has been opposing them for too many years. It is time for the leaders of both sides to take bold decisions, which are necessary to end the spiral of violence and resume negotiations. Rest assured, ladies and gentlemen, that the European Union, with your support, will do its greater to contribute to achieving this objective.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "NI"}, {"id": 642, "date": "2014-09-17.json", "name": "Cristian Dan PREDA", "mepid": "96838", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, I would first of all like to welcome the truce reached on 26 August and to underline the very important role that Egypt played in achieving this agreement after seven weeks of conflict. I hope that both sides will remain committed to finding a lasting solution and that Egypt will continue to play a positive role in future negotiations on a permanent ceasefire. I deplore, on the other hand, the fact that the recent conflict has once again caused loss of life and suffering to the civilian population. I express my sympathy to the victims and their families. It is important that the responsibilities for these acts are clarified and, from this perspective, I would like to welcome the fact that the Israeli authorities have committed themselves to examining any credible allegations of Tzahal's actions in the recent conflict and have launched five criminal investigations on this subject. I would also like to note that our joint resolution addresses the humanitarian situation in Gaza at length. This remains very concerning. It is clear that Europe needs to do more to meet humanitarian needs on the ground, and this is where not only political will is needed, but also appropriate financial means. I would also like to point out that in the AFET Committee, where we discussed the Union budget for 2015, there was a very broad political consensus on the idea that financial assistance for UNRWA needs to be increased and we have adopted amendments to this effect. I therefore welcome yesterday's agreement on the establishment of a provisional mechanism to speed up, under the supervision of the United Nations, the reconstruction of the Gaza Strip, while ensuring that construction materials will be used for civil purposes. In the run-up to the DonorS' Conference, which will take place on 12 October, I hope that the Union will contribute substantially to the reconstruction process. Finally, a word about the overall role of the Union.

It is once again the result of close and serious work by our political groups, which shows Parliament’s commitment to fighting for and working for peace in the Middle East. Without mentioning the numbers – the damages and losses which are part of the daily tragedy we faced in the Gaza Strip – I would like to make the point that Europe was practically absent, and has not been living up to its duty in the Middle East in recent months, during the USA-brokered negotiations or during the ceasefire. This is a fact of life and it is a painful lesson in terms of what we need to do. Regarding what we need to do, I was inspired by the visit we made to Jerusalem and Ramallah. Firstly, implementation of the ceasefire agreement is fundamental and is also a good basis for the negotiations which will soon take place to address the most important topics on the agenda. Secondly, a successful donors’ conference in Cairo will offer an opportunity for starting the reconstruction of Gaza. Thirdly, the national consensus government of Palestine needs to be empowered to take full control over Gaza, for without that the reconstruction will be in jeopardy. And finally, the role of President Mahmoud Abbas, and his moderating authority to negotiate with the Israeli side, must be strengthened. The most important thing is to work for the peace process. Here our Union, together with the United States and with such important regional actors as Egypt, Saudi Arabia and others, should contribute to the success of the talks. I believe that now is the time for Europe to change from a payer to a player. It was a payer but we have to become a player and I am therefore very happy for the newly designated High Representative, Federica Mogherini, to pay so much attention to the Middle East and to the role of our Union in trying to work for peace in the Middle East.

With my own eyes I saw timely discovered and dismantled hamas terror tunnels. The local population in the western part of the Negev Desert has been exposed to Palestinian rocket rains for years. And now this debate on the role of the EU after the last round of fighting between Israel and, let us be honest, islamist enemies of death are in Gaza. What role should the EU play in this inevitable conflict? Well, given that Hamas rules Gaza and is on the official EU list of terrorist organisations, it is obvious that the EU supports the Jewish state in its relentless defence against Hamas with words and deeds. In concrete terms, this means that the EU is making a real effort to achieve a real demilitarisation of the Gaza Strip. Does the Council share this European role as essential? What steps does he intend to take in this essential direction towards a decidedly urgent pacification of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict? In any case, it is of great importance that any European aid to the economic reconstruction of Gaza does not contribute at all to the military reconstruction of Hamas. Finally, an influential role for the EU in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict certainly requires good relations with Israel, including the annual meetings of the Association Council. I very much regret that the High Representative is not here, because she has not held the last two association councils. This is extremely bad for relations between the EU and Israel, which I very much regret as chairman of the delegation for relations with Israel.

Recently, 13 MEPs were refused access to Gaza because Israel did not want us to see destruction there that is comparable to World War II. On fact-finding in the West Bank, we MEPs witnessed the South-Africanisation of Palestine with its apartheid roads, walls and buses. Israel’s violations of international law have been well documented – on six occasions, in fact – by the UN Security Council plus the International Court of Justice. The clearest violations are the illegal transfer of 600 000 Israelis to live in illegal settlements in occupied Palestine, where 170 000 acres of Palestinian land have been confiscated since the Oslo Accord – 1000 acres last week alone. International law imposes a duty on all members of the international community, including the EU, not to recognise as lawful or render aid or assistance in maintaining a situation created by a serious breach of international law. Allowing economic relations with Israeli illegal settlements and importing their products into the EU contributes to the prosperity of those settlements and assists in their development, all of which is contrary to obligations under international law.  Those who make the law must uphold it. The EU must not simply discourage business relations with firms established in illegal settlements and only insist on correct labelling of settlement goods, but must also halt all relations with Israel and prohibit imports of its goods.

However, we must clearly name the cause of the escalation of tensions and condemn the attacks on the State of Israel. Hamas does not warn the population of attacks, on the contrary, it urges them to stay at home and even put them on the front lines. Hamas hides rockets in schools and hospitals, \"forcing\" Israel to attack these civilian buildings, in which women and children are present.  One renowned Czech psychiatrist characterized this as israel protecting its people with rockets and Hamas protecting its missiles. The response must also be appropriate on the part of Israel, but we must take into account the overall context, although I think that Israel has also exaggerated this in this war.  The European Security Strategy 2030 clearly declares: the strategic priority for Europe is the resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict. Without it, there is little chance that other problems in the Middle East will be solved. Resolving this conflict is a key prerequisite for facing the threat of terrorism. I therefore call on the EU to make peace efforts to stop the violence in Gaza. But I am aware that civilian casualties are also significantly damaging to Israel's image in the world.

We should therefore demand that Israel open Gaza’s borders. Israel must halt and withdraw from all illegal settlements, which are currently undermining the two-stage solution. We must also support the investigation of war crimes.

A bitterness because I heard from prosecutors on both sides, I heard going to war on both sides as well. And I have heard few messengers of peace in this debate. However, I believe that we are a large majority in the European Parliament who want peace and show that there is indeed a balanced voice to say stop to what we experienced during this week when more than two thousand children, women, especially on the Palestinian side, were massacred.  We also know that at the gates of this region we have jihadist terrorists, whether it is Da'esh in Iraq, we talked about it earlier, but also al-Nusra in Syria, but also in Egypt with the supporters of Jerusalem.  We see that the only solution is reconciliation, it is to find the voices of peace, to finally find a credible voice, a credible diplomatic policy of the European Union and I, that is what I am asking for. Let us return to Europe's initiative, to the Oslo Accords, because there is a possible basis both vis-à-vis Israel and Palestine.

He commits crimes against humanity, steals his lands and houses from the Palestinians. Kill, stop and imprison with total impunity.

Events show that there will be no definitive cessation of violence, no lasting peace, until the aspirations of the Palestinians to have their own sovereign state and the aspirations of the Israelis for security are fulfilled, through a comprehensive, negotiated peace based on the coexistence of two states.
