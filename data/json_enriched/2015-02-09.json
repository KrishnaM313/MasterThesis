As you know, this committee is responsible for the area of intellectual property rights. I dare to say that this area is of great interest for a large number of committee members who understand the importance of intellectual property rights in the 21st century. I think that the Commission is of the same view, and I would like to thank the Commission for its quick reaction when providing us with its understanding of the issues raised in our question. While drafting this question, we have been motivated by the fact that, given the importance of intellectual property rights for the future growth of the European Union, we should use all our instruments in the most effective way in order to get the best information available. We could use the information obtained not only for the purposes of enforcement evaluation, but also, for example, while thinking about the future reform of copyright. That is why we would like to ask the Commissioner to confirm that there will be no duplication of tasks between the observatory and the group of experts which the Commission would like to establish, according to the action plan on the enforcement of intellectual property rights, and that no related unnecessary financial implications will take place, and to confirm that Parliament will be invited to send experts who will take part in this proposed group of experts as observers.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE-DE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 20, "date": "2015-02-09.json", "name": "Elżbieta Bieńkowska", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "  Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I want to thank the Committee on Legal Affairs and especially its Chairman, Mr Svoboda, for their question, because the answer will allow me to maybe explain more and put a decision in context. You asked about the setting up of a group of experts on the enforcement of intellectual property rights. So maybe just one short remark putting the decision into context. Markets and technologies are constantly changing, and we need to keep up with them. We need to keep on finding new solutions to breaches of IPR, and we need to be targeted. We need to develop new enforcement tools. It is for this reason – and also because Member States cannot go alone with the issue – that in July last year an expert group was set up. It was a core part of our ten-point plan to improve IPR enforcement, and the Member States welcomed it. Let me turn to the specifics of your question. First you asked about the tasks of the group and how they add value to the work of the Observatory. Second, you asked about the financial implications and whether there will be duplication.  The expert group, it has to be stressed, has a strict mission. It is to advise and assist the Commission on policy initiatives. Its members are the national authorities responsible for national IP policies, and it is to exchange experience and good practice. It will not gather data or conduct studies itself. Instead it will rely on work done at national, EU and international level, including, of course, the work done by the Observatory. This is completely different, as we see it, from the role of the Observatory. The Observatory is there to facilitate and support the practical enforcement work. That includes improving understanding and raising awareness of the impact of IPR infringements, providing training, promoting enforcement tools and technology, and helping national enforcement authorities to work together. The Observatory supports national authorities, the private sector and EU institutions. Part of this is data collection; the data collected and reported by the Observatory supports the work of the Commission and the Member States. So the expert group focuses – just to repeat – on policy, best practices and monitoring, and the Observatory focuses on the day-to-day enforcement and the collection of data. They do not duplicate. On the contrary, they are complementary. So the group will not result in unnecessary expenditure. Third, you wanted confirmation that you could send experts to an expert group meeting, and the answer is yes, absolutely you can – you will be very welcome. We apply the framework document on relations between the European Parliament and the European Commission, but equally important, I think, is that you should be part of this body and participate in this work. We have to work together on IPR enforcement. It would be really helpful if you would follow the group actively. I will also listen to your questions and remarks, because I think that it will help our future work.

Infringement of intellectual property rights causes great economic damage. The OECD estimates that the global economy loses a total of around €200 billion each year as a result of infringements of intellectual property rights. After all, it is particularly important to us, as the Social Democrats and the S&amp;D Group, that the interests of cultural workers are particularly taken into account. This should be taken more into account in the action plan, and this should also be more closely focused on the expert group.

Of course, good enforcement of intellectual property rights is needed, but not at the taxpayer's expense, not wasting public money, which in low-standard countries would mean the livelihoods of hundreds of families.  Is it really necessary to set up this group, provided that the Observatory is already engaged in this and one of its working groups is fully engaged precisely in the enforcement and protection of intellectual property rights? The Observatory even has its own observers in the European Parliament, including me, and the expert group does not even foresee this.

The period of seventy years for the protection of the property dimension of copyright relating to an intellectual creation after the death of the respective author constitutes a legal and economic aberration. Moreover, it is an inadmissible privilege in the present day, without any acceptable justification. This long period of time does not protect the authors but rather the people who have no legitimate connection to the act of creation. It prolongs, after the death of the author, an illegitimate situation of monopoly exclusivity that, being understandable during the life of the creator, becomes unacceptable after his death, because it prevents, or at least restricts, the enjoyment of the work by the general public. This privilege is more proper to privatistic conceptions of the time of Napoleon's Civil Code than of a time like the present, in which it seeks to democratize access to culture and the widespread enjoyment of works of art. The current legal regime prolongs for too long a situation of monopoly exclusivity in favor of the heirs of the intellectual creator, so that only they, or whom they designate, can disclose the work. At the limit, they may even prevent its dissemination, that is, they may even prevent his work from being disclosed or known to the public for seventy years. Let us see if this scheme applied, for example, to drug patents, where the medicine could be protected for seventy years after the author's death.

He announced he would have the list of members of this expert group published along with ‘all relevant documents, including agendas and minutes of each meeting’. So far, 13 out of the 28 Member State authorities remain unlisted in the register entry for this expert group. No minutes for the first and only meeting so far have been published. Meeting documents of this first meeting also remain unpublished. So, while the answer to my parliamentary question came from Commissioner Oettinger and not from the Commissioner in charge, the open task remains the same. Therefore, do get serious on the transparency and proper record-keeping of this group. Will the Commission commit itself to deliver these basic requirements on a specific date?  Along with my fellow colleagues from the Committee on Legal Affairs, I agree that it is important that there is no duplication in the setting-up of this expert group and the OHIM Observatory. The Commission should also comment on such a possible overlap and the apparent disconnect of this expert group from its predecessors also set up by the Commission in previous years. The burden of proof is on the Commission to show that this expert group will go beyond the OHIM Observatory and its rather extensive mandate. If such an added benefit exists, it would rather call for the readjustment of the EU Observatory mandate.

Therefore, the Commission should assign observer status to Parliament and it should do so immediately. The Committee on Legal Affairs will be happy to follow the work of this working group very actively.

That is why I fundamentally welcome the establishment by the Commission, announced by the Commission in the EU Action Plan on the Enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights, of an expert group to enforce precisely these rights and the plans to further intensify work with the Observatory, with OHIM. However, it must also be pointed out here that the clear task of this new group of experts does not overlap with the experts involved in the Centre – here too, there are already corresponding expert groups. I would also like to take this opportunity to support the fact that the involvement of representatives of Parliament and the relevant committees, as well as the Centre, is extremely important. The European Union cannot afford to suffer from the sometimes massive infringements of intellectual property, as well as its cultural and creative industries and its large creative industries. It is therefore of enormous importance to exchange views with all the actors and also to bring the cultural and creative people to the table, including in this new group of experts. Structures should be created to make it easier for small and individual actors to enforce their rights. If the European Union is to remain at the forefront of innovation for new designs, technology and culture, better cooperation in combating intellectual property infringements at all levels is essential.

Today we are talking about the Commission's decision to set up an expert group on the enforcement of intellectual property rights. I would like to make two comments: we have a common internal market. That is a good thing, and it is important, and no one wants to shake it. But what we also have is an office for it: the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market. The protection of intellectual property rights is already located there. So if the Commission is now setting up another group of experts, precisely on this subject, it is reminiscent of a popular game. On German, they say, \"If you don't know any more, then set up a working group.\" It seems that one hand does not know what the other is doing. Or worse, one hand does not even know that the other exists. If this is not the case here, then I would like to raise the real problem that it is not so much the creation of double structures, which is obviously at stake here. I do not think we have all understood what the Commissioner has been dealing with here, why it is not a double structure. In any case, it didn't get to me. The problem is that if we want to increase citizens' support for the European Union, we should not create more working groups and offices, but abolish them.

We have listened very closely and carefully to them. It has to be said that the issue of the enforcement of IPR is only a part of the broader action of the Commission on the modernisation of the IPR framework at EU level. The question which should be answered first is that concerning duplication of group experts in the Office for Harmonisation in the Internal Market (OHIM). Ms Regner, I would like to thank you very much because you were very much to the point. First, the OHIM agency, according to the mandate, cannot advise the Commission. The agency is working on the current issues and cases. It is collecting data. We need to have a body consisting of the Member State experts to advise us for the future and on the next steps to take. It is much broader than just focusing, as the agency is doing, on the current ongoing cases and day-to-day work. It should also be said – for example to Mr Dzhambazki but many of you asked about it – that no new money has been dedicated to the activities of the expert group. Secondly, Mr Köster asked about the mandate. It is of course public and available online. This is a Commission decision. We can provide each one of you with the information if necessary. In responding to Ms Reda, of course the minutes are also public. There has been only one meeting of the expert group and the minutes have not yet been adopted. According to the mandate, they will of course be transparent and published as soon as the whole documentation provided by Member States and adopted by the group is available. Thank you very much for your remarks on the cultural sector. This is of course extremely important and will be discussed as a part of the digital single market. This is part of copyright reform. The Commission is very aware of the sensitivities of the copyright reform and IPR will be an important part of the digital single market strategy, while the discussion on copyright reform is of course in line with this. Regarding the concrete mechanism we will provide, the first thing is the copyright review and then we have to go through the IPR Enforcement Directive and look at why it is not working. It was approved in 2004. Then we will work on the trademark package and the trademarks and trade secrets. Let me remind you that there is ongoing legislative reform on the trademarks and trade secrets which will help companies better to protect their innovations. To conclude, after the few measures dealing with current issues, the expert group will advise us in what way we need to go further. Only two Member States have not appointed their experts to the expert group, not thirteen.

This also highlights many important aspects for the current global discussions on internet governance. This topic remains a priority for the European Commission. I look forward to working with you to further promote and improve the multi-stakeholder model for internet governance, which is such an important resource for Europe’s economy and society. Last year the Commission adopted its communication on internet governance and policy. The Council conclusions adopted in November will certainly help us to position ourselves in the global debate. The European Parliament and Commission have been working side by side on these issues, in particular in the context of the IGF. We wish to promote a unified internet based on the respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms. The Commission looks forward to continuing in these efforts with you. This parliamentary resolution is another step in this direction. It also comes at the right moment because 2015 will be a critical year for internet governance and there are important developments ahead. The text of the resolution rightly acknowledges this and reflects the importance and impact of the current discussions for the EU. Our main common objective is to make sure that the internet remains a truly global resource, free from being captured by a few or by specific economic or political interests. The internet is for everyone. We need a system built on cooperation, trust and the clear rules that can safeguard them. This is why a greater global balance should increase the legitimacy of the existing governance arrangements. As you know, the Commission welcomed last year’s decision of the United States Government to transfer key internet domain name functions to the multi-stakeholder community, known as the IANA (Internet Assigned Numbers Authority) transition. An important ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) meeting is now taking place in Singapore. I hope that there will be substantial progress made, including on the most sensitive issues such as those related to ICANN’s accountability. After all, ICANN cannot be itself the final judge in its own disputes with other parties. ICANN accountability and the IANA transition are closely interlinked. They are two sides of the same coin. The main challenge ahead is to ensure that the rights checks and balances are in place. At the same time we should stay focused on what is happening in the context of the review of the outcomes of the World Summit on the Information Society. As you know, the renewal of the IGF is at stake and it will be addressed in this context. I see some worrying signs coming from this process with constant pushes towards stronger multilateral approaches. On substance we must ensure that the World Summit on the Information Society will not lead to the introduction of stronger governmental control over the internet. We also support a stronger IGF, stronger financially, stronger in substance. This is essential to guarantee the stability that it needs to keep up with increased expectations from the international community. We also need other platforms to complement the current discussions on internet governance but without duplicating the existing efforts. Since the Commission supports the implementation of the NETmundial outcomes I am honoured to belong to the Coordination Council of the NETmundial initiative. I look forward to working with you to further promote and improve the multi-stakeholder model for internet governance.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 56, "date": "2015-02-09.json", "name": "Pilar del CASTILLO VERA", "mepid": "28390", "text": "  PPE Group. – Mr President, I welcome our Vice-President, Mr Ansip.

The United Nations General Assembly will decide on this throughout 2015: will the mandate be renewed or not renewed? That's the point. In the opinion of the European Parliament, and on the basis of the experience we have had working side by side with the Commission, it is essential that it be renewed, because it expresses precisely that 'multipart' nature that internet governance must have. There is a threat that internet governance, internet governance, will be based on intergovernmental relations, rather than relying on stakeholder approach development or the multipart approach.

The declared aim of this open forum is to inspire those who have decision-making power over the design and use of the Internet through discussions that have taken place there. The Forum is based on a mandate from the UN: it is intended to implement Article 19 of the Convention on Human Rights, the right to freedom of expression. The Forum lives solely on the power to be respected and respected worldwide. Internet governance, however, means more than just regulation, but takes a much more holistic approach. Current core problems have been identified: rights, freedom and access to information and user rights on the Internet. This year's World Economic Forum in Davos also addressed fundamental questions of the network. It is noteworthy that, among other things, company representatives concluded that some applications on the Internet can lead to an undesirable concentration of power and that there is an existential interest in connecting seven billion people worldwide equally. Both are demonstrably best achieved by providing good protection for net neutrality. In the United States, the signs of the times have clearly been recognised. Tom Wheeler, the head of the FCC, for strict net neutrality should also make us stand out in Europe. He wants to ban any paid preference, blocking or slowing down any content so strictly because the lax handling of it has brought competition in America to a standstill. Let us not fall for the rhetoric of local network operators who are now saying: 'We do not need this, competition is still working here'. Yes, it still works because we do not have the free play of the free forces here, because we have realised that the debate on special services is more than an economic one, and it is about prioritising fast lanes and restricting communicative freedom.

If so, what are the rules and rights online?  What it is key to remember in that debate is that the internet is not national, or even European; it is global, and any rule on surveillance, on competition, needs to be thought about in a global context to prevent any fragmentation of the internet. This is why we, as Europeans, need to support and be actively involved in the Internet Governance Forum, as a debate at international level about the internet – its challenges as well as its opportunities – is essential.  On behalf of the Liberals, I have stressed in this resolution that the human rights and fundamental freedoms that we have offline should be protected online as well. This is often forgotten. State-controlled internet, but also mass surveillance and online censorship are on the rise around the world, including in Europe, and this clearly goes against our fundamental freedoms. My country, Estonia, ranked second on internet freedom. However, it was almost an exception as 84% of countries had, in 2014, weak laws or no laws at all to protect citizens from mass surveillance. It is getting worse, as it was 64% in 2013.  I would add one point to that. The rights of individuals to secure communication, including through encryption, are part of the same debate and this needs to be discussed as well in the Internet Governance Forum.  I strongly believe that the day the privacy of individuals on the internet ends will also be the day that the internet ceases to exist as an open platform of innovation and exchange of ideas.

There is hardly anything that is more regulated. This is a computer system. Computer programs that have no nature, which consist only of artificial rules and guidelines that have been made by humans. At the same time, the Internet is an unregulated success story. It was designed openly and freely, open standards, everyone can/could do what he or she wanted in it. Only in this way could the Internet become the success story it is now. This freedom of artificial unregulatedness is threatened because interests have changed, because governments and corporations very often agree that stronger regulation, different regulation of the network, would give them greater benefits. It is a good place for the European Parliament to promote the Internet Governance Forum and to promote a free network that continues to promote and promote open regulation internationally, at international level, and to do more. I would like to single out two points in this resolution on which I am pleased that we will now have a broad majority in favour in this sitting. This is net neutrality and the issue of surveillance. A free Internet needs net neutrality, we agree. I hope that, if there will be other votes in the next few years, we will also find reasonably comparable definitions of net neutrality. Because everyone is for that, but whether everyone understands the same thing, I dare to doubt. In my view, net neutrality is something that cannot be downgraded, cannot be classified, should not be considered in a differentiated way, but that all data traffic should be treated equally. I hope we can agree on that. When it comes to surveillance, it is similar: everyone is in favour of protecting privacy, civil rights; the definition is often different. I hope that, as a Parliament in particular, we will position ourselves very strongly in this regard in the future and defend the rights and freedom of the population and, above all, the innocent and the unsuspecting in the case of mass surveillance, more strongly than the interests of the secret services.

Every politician who believes in freedom of thought, expression or religion, or in free enterprise, should feel a chill at the words ‘internet governance’.  The themes of the meetings of the IGF over recent years have been full of feel-good buzz words, but that is all they are. The existence and growth of the internet and its facilitation of the exchange of ideas horrifies established elites who are no longer able to control and manipulate information to their advantage. For them the internet is the greatest threat to the established order since the publication in the late Middle Ages of the Bible in the vernacular. Eternal vigilance is needed to ensure that governance is not merely a cover for state control. Plainly there should be the means of preventing the dissemination of, for example, child pornography, or material that facilitates terrorism. But every attempt to control freedoms and free enterprise should be fiercely resisted. Secondly, we must remember that the internet is largely the creation of free enterprise. When we hear anyone talking about how governments must act to promote or provide growth for the internet, we must never forget that governments are pretty much incapable of managing their own IT projects, and the notion of the governments being the driver of growth on the internet is illusory. The principal duty of the IGF should be to guard the freedom of the internet and to create the conditions in which free enterprise can flourish, not to introduce pettifogging regulations which clog its arteries.

The European Union must continue to participate intensively in these international debates. In the past, the IGF has provided a constructive and concrete framework for this international exchange with all stakeholders. This should continue to be ensured in the form of a continuation and an extension of the mandate of the IGF. It is particularly important to emphasise the importance of the multi-stakeholder approach in Internet governance in this context. It is essential to pursue this approach, as it is only in exchange with all stakeholders that sustainable solutions for the Internet and Governance can be found. The model of Internet governance by various stakeholders must therefore not be restricted. The intergovernmental approach, which is repeatedly called for by individual groups, is, I believe, the wrong way to go. It is therefore up to all Member States, as well as stakeholders, to further strengthen the sustainability of this model by improving the accountability of actors at regional, national and international level, so that the procedure can be made more transparent and inclusive, thereby ensuring real output for work on the ground. The internationalisation of the main functions and organisations of the Internet is of the utmost importance. The internationalisation of ICANN should therefore be pursued without being at the expense of trust and security.

The Internet is carving out an increasingly important role in our lives.

The IGF has successfully brought together different stakeholders for open and frank discussions.

As you know, the Commission has been one of the most stable and committed financial contributors to the IGF. This is vital for the stability that an organisation needs to function properly. To conclude, the Commission very much appreciates your work in this area. Genuine progress is necessary on internet governance so that there are structures that are inclusive, transparent, accountable and technically sound. Otherwise the risk is that more intergovernmental approaches will gain momentum.  The multi-stakeholder governance of the internet needs to be strengthened. It needs to be credible and inclusive.

The resolution adopted by the ENVI Committee proposes that Parliament should make a contribution to the indication of the origin of meat in processed foods, which could be useful in view of future legislative proposals by the European Commission. The Reports of the European Commission to which I referred a moment ago, as well as some surveys made in recent months, recognise that more than 90% of the consumers surveyed consider it important that the label of processed food indicates the origin of meat, thus demonstrating the strong interest of consumers in this information, which is one of the factors that can influence their behaviour. This is all the more true when we consider that, at Member State level, it is estimated that between 30 and 50% of the total volume of slaughtered meat is processed into meat for use as an ingredient for food, mainly minced meat, meat preparation and meat products. Commissioner, today we must regain the confidence of European consumers who, even in the wake of the recent food scandals, including the fraudulent replacement of beef by horsemeat, want stricter rules on traceability and information. Of course, these rules will not in themselves prevent food fraud, but they will also enable the authorities to carry out more effective investigations as well as inform consumers. The resolution does not forget the role of small and medium-sized enterprises, which are central to our economy in terms of creating growth, employment and development, and the commitment to quality and safe food. I therefore believe that a balanced approach between the different positions and interests involved is the way forward with a view to preparing new legislation in this area, which will have to take into account the transparency and legibility of information for consumers, while at the same time allowing European companies to operate in an economically viable and competitive manner, under conditions acceptable to consumers' purchasing power. On a specific point, we would like to ask the Commission for more information, namely on the assessment of the possible effects on prices of this measure. In fact, the results of research carried out by a consumer association French differ considerably from the data contained in the European Commission's report on the costs of introducing the indication of the country of origin on the label. I would therefore ask the Commissioner to look more closely at this issue in order to get a more framework. This assessment must not, however, extend the time when the legislative proposal is presented. When the Commission publishes its proposal, we will clearly react on the substance, together with the Council, on the basis of our prerogatives as co-legislators, but we are ready to make our contribution now through the work done on this motion for a resolution which contains our suggestions and the list of our priorities. We need clear, coherent and harmonised rules. We have a lot to do in the coming years and this is a sensitive area for our citizens. We therefore offer today and with wednesday's vote a positive and precise contribution to the European Commission, to which we are asking for legislative proposals to make it compulsory to indicate the origin of meat in processed foods. We believe that information on origin, which is currently provided on a voluntary basis, may mislead consumers and that compulsory information can instead ensure greater transparency along the food chain and better inform European consumers. Finally, we call for impact assessments to be taken into account at the same time, avoiding excessive costs and administrative burdens for businesses. As I said at the beginning, our aim must be to regain the confidence of European consumers, reassuring them about the quality and safety of the food produced in our territory and offering them the information required in order to make a conscious purchase.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 98, "date": "2015-02-09.json", "name": "Jyrki Katainen", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "  Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, consumer sensitivity about the origins of the foods they eat has certainly grown over recent years. Consequently, origin has become of increasing relevance for businesses and also for policy-makers. Before turning to the honourable Members’ questions, allow me to say a few words about the Commission’s report on the issue. The main purpose of the report is to set out in a neutral and objective manner all relevant factors in order to launch an informed discussion with Parliament and the Council. The report relies principally on the external study, which also includes a consumer survey. The coverage of the report is broad and heterogeneous. It covers all pre-packed foods with meat ingredients of all species. Products can range from relatively simple meat preparations, such as fresh meat with spices, to more processed meat-related products such as pizza bolognese. The supply chains of such products can also be quite complex and lengthy. Given the broad scope of the report, any estimated impacts must inevitably be both general and varied. Turning to the oral question, on the first point I would like to clarify that the Commission has not yet decided on any follow-up action. The report itself does not suppose or imply any a priori position of the Commission on the subject. The honourable Member’s second point cites a consumer study alleging that the cost-of-origin labelling of meat in processed foods is lower than price increases identified in the report. Here I should point out that the Commission report was based on estimates from the food industry. These estimates, as well as the methodology used, were discussed and endorsed in the context of a focus group comprised of professionals active in the food chain, including consumer associations. The figures provided in the Commission’s report take into account meat of all species and all structures of food supply chains across Europe. By contrast, the study mentioned by the honourable Member relates solely to beef products in France. For beef, origin labelling is expected to have the lowest impact, notably because of the existing traceability system and relatively lower volumes of intra-EU trade in bovine beef animals and beef compared to the other species. In the case of France especially, there is a sufficient supply of domestic raw material for the production of processed beef products. These estimated increases of 15%-20%, and up to 50%, mentioned in the Commission report refer to the additional operating costs for the industry and not the final product price, as is the case in the French study. These estimates correspond to the specific scenario where the indication of origin would be set at the Member State / third country level. The additional cost to the industry for origin labelling set at the EU / non-EU level ranges from negligible to up to around 25%. I would also like to note that it would be difficult to establish the final product price. In particular, depending on the strength of retailers or the suppliers, some of the cost increase might be absorbed downstream in the food supply chain, to the detriment of suppliers, and only partially passed on to the final consumer. Furthermore, the French study cited by the honourable Member does not specify the level of origin indicated on the label. It is therefore impossible to compare the estimates provided by these two sources. Finally, the French study summarised costs relating to origin indications provided on a voluntary basis. The estimations of price increases for voluntary schemes are less significant as they tend to cover cases where origin indication is feasible with relatively low cost. By contrast, mandatory origin labelling refers to all case scenarios, including those where it would be operationally difficult and costly. Therefore the costs are higher. As regards the third point on consumer preference, as to the level of the origin indication the Commission report fully reflects the observations pointed out by the honourable Member. According to the report, an origin indication set at EU / non-EU level may be considered from the consumer’s perspective as too generic and not worthy of any resulting price increase. However, at the same time, the report stresses the paradox of a discrepancy between consumer interest in origin labelling and their willingness to pay for that information. Mandatory origin labelling may negatively affect the consumption of needs-related foods. It is observed that consumers currently buy meat with origin indication less often than they would have wished, because of the price consideration. The price sensitivity is mainly reflected for origin labelling on meat used as an ingredient. The consumer would be interested in receiving the information at the highest level of detail possible if this information were to be offered without any price increase. Turning to the last point on the voluntary labelling of the origin of meat in processed food, let me reassure the honourable Member that such a system has also been addressed in the Commission’s report. The external study which forms the basis of the report looked into existing private schemes approved at national or concentrated industrial level. The study concluded that the use of such voluntary schemes concerning the origin of meat ingredients in meat-based products is generally limited. Where such schemes exist, they tend to be mostly private and not related only to geographical origin labelling, but rather form part of a wider quality initiative.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 99, "date": "2015-02-09.json", "name": "Renate SOMMER", "mepid": "4282", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Mr President, I would like to thank the As the Commissioner has just said, the consumer only wants this origin marking of meat in processed products if he does not have to pay extra for it. Three quarters of consumers say that if it costs something, if the product becomes more expensive, then I do not want it at all. That is why I do not understand why there are so many Members of this House who insist that it is essential that this origin marking should be in place. The consumer doesn't really want it. And the product will be more expensive, yes, definitely! That, too, has been pointed out by the Commissioner. Manufacturers have to take much more costs into account. Operating costs increase by up to 50%. In addition, we will have an increase in bureaucracy costs – plus 30% – and we are working against excessive bureaucracy. In addition, manufacturers need separate storage spaces and they need to design a lot of new labels and packaging. Because a slice of sausage is easily loaded with origins from four to five different countries. So they have to design 400 to 500 different labels and therefore packaging. Who is to handle this? The consumer does not want it, it costs a lot of money, it increases the proportion of bureaucracy, and there is absolutely no link between the horsemeat scandal and origin labelling. This is something that this Parliament, with the participation of all the groups that are now so in favour of this nonsensical, really stupid origin marking of meat in processed products, has clearly stated this. Finally, it has to be said that this origin marking is antisocial, because many people cannot afford to pay much more money for their food, and that would be the case.

From the vote in Parliament at the time, it was clear that MEPs wanted country-of-origin labelling for all meat, including meat in processed foods. And although in the negotiations we finally agreed on origin labelling for fresh meat, MEPs and Member States were subjected to a huge lobbying campaign from industry. In the end, unfortunately, we could not get agreement from the Council on meat in processed foods. But of course, consumer groups were at a massive disadvantage, because they just cannot compete with the lobbying resources available to industry. The Commission report states that the costs will increase if we have country-of-origin labelling. However, the Commission’s report was based totally on industry self-reporting. So what did you expect? Consumer organisations were invited to the focus groups, but it is clear to me they did not and do not endorse the report’s findings. Consumer research from France found that labelling the meat in a frozen lasagne cost just 1.5 euro cents, and for a Bolognese sauce it would be less than a cent. Hardly that expensive, I think. And you know, if they really thought about it, this could be really good for the food industry, helping to restore the trust in their supply chain that has been so badly damaged in recent years due to the horsemeat scandal. What is really important is that over 90% of consumers say they want to know where the meat in the processed food they buy comes from. All we want is clear, honest food labelling. Surely consumers should not be misled. If a beef lasagne is labelled as a British product, that should mean it is made with British beef, and if it is labelled as a French product, it should be made with beef from France. It is not that difficult to understand. This Parliament led the way on labelling of nutritional information, on labelling of palm oil, on labelling of allergens to enable consumers to make informed choices about the food that they give to their families. This week we must send a clear, strong message to the Commission to bring forward proposals for mandatory country-of-origin labelling of meat in processed food. It is clearly what Parliament wants; it is clearly what the farmers want and, more importantly, it is clearly what consumers want.

Mr President! The European Parliament has been debating for years whether processed meat should be labelled with country of origin so that consumers can see where the meat comes from. A study carried out by the Commission shows that at least 90% of consumers think that the labelling of processed meat is important, and I think that is also important.  This proposal is about trust between consumers and producers. In this context, we can say that the horsemeat scandal also made it clear that there is a real need to have a full overview of where the processed meat comes from.  Traceability, so that one can follow a product from farm to fork, is a consumer requirement that one should always meet. It is the right of consumers to know the whole origin, and therefore also the country of origin, of the food they buy. Of course, country-of-origin labelling requirements will never be able to prevent the fraud that has taken place, but it is part of a chain of requirements to ensure that consumers get the goods they pay for – and the culprits they must be punished if they cheat!  When processed meat is used as an ingredient in a product, it must of course be possible to find information on, for example, the country of origin of what you have purchased. A secondary effect of country-of-origin labelling may also be that countries will strive even more to meet the high consumer requirements and good animal welfare, as well as quality, and that those countries that may have a smaller one – what to say – are less good at meeting what they will be punished.  Just as a consumer would like to know where a whole chicken or pig comes from, you would of course also like to know where the processed meat comes from. It must therefore also be the case that you know the country of origin of the piece of bacon or the pâté or sausage that is being sold. In addition to the food safety that lies in seeing where one's products come from, then this proposal can also help to provide added value to food producers.

Does it have cost implications and what kind, and what other effects does it have?  Studies show that a large proportion of consumers want to know the origin of meat. Not all of them, but very many people want to know how far the chicken or other meat has travelled before it comes to the plate. Estimates of these costs have been presented here, as well as in the Commission's papers. Here came the estimate that the price of a kilogram of meat would increase by 50% if the origin marking were to come. On the other, it is considered that it would be less than one centimetre per kilogram of meat.  If the fork is this large, then I think it really makes sense for Parliament to agree that the Commission should examine these cost implications. Surely no one wants compulsory labelling if the price of meat rises by 50%. But I can't believe that argument myself, and here I can appeal to Finnish experiences. We have food companies, companies that mark origin and very precisely. And that is not a price issue, at least not according to the own calculations of these companies. It will increase confidence in consumers, and this may also lead to an increase in meat consumption.

The horsemeat scandal was the biggest food fraud of the 21st century, and it exposed the lengthy, complex, and often very murky extremes of food chains in Europe. That some of the biggest supermarkets were able to just apologise, and claim they didn’t know where the meat came from, is astounding. Whilst this scandal was – as rightly pointed out – caused by criminal activity, it underlined the extremely poor levels of traceability in the food chain, for consumers to know where their food is coming from. Ninety percent of consumers want to know the origin of their meat, both fresh and processed. This is a demand which has pre-dated the horsemeat scandal, and it still goes unfulfilled. The European Commission needs to stop being apologists for the corporate food industry and start acting to defend and represent the interests of the citizens that they supposedly work for. It would do well to avoid bleating out the big food industries’ arguments against and seek to implement as soon as possible what citizens and consumer groups have been calling for for years. The Commission claims, in its 2013 report – we have heard it here – that the production costs could increase by anything up to 50%. We know that the consumer groups have shown that the opposite is true. Let us not forget that, when it was introducing country-of-origin labelling for meat – unprocessed meat – we heard these same arguments. In Ireland, our voluntary labelling scheme, which includes meat and processed meals, has been a remarkable success, with almost 40 000 producers and 122 processors currently involved; this is a perfect example of the appeal and benefit to businesses such labelling can have. In fact, it is so successful that now what we have, because of the absence of mandatory labelling, is dishonest food manufacturers giving misleading representations of where the food comes from, labelling them as Irish recipes, traditional, farmhouse and local.

However, if they bought a pork pie or a chicken nugget, they would not have a clue as to the origin of their meat. Today’s proposal will bring a consistency with the new rules on country-of-origin labelling of unprocessed as well as processed meat. The 2013 horsemeat scandal not only shattered public trust, it reinforced consumers’ demands for information on how and where food is produced. Whilst no silver bullet against fraud, compulsory labelling of meat in processed foods would oblige food makers to keep a tighter grip on their suppliers and would make them more accountable for what they put into their food products. Research, as we have heard from the Commission and consumer organisations across the EU, consistently tells us that 90% of Europeans do care about the origin of their meat. They want to find this information on the label, whether the meat is fresh or used as an ingredient. The beef labelling model, whereby the animal’s country of birth, rearing and slaughter must be given, has raised consumers’ expectations, and people want to know the animal’s full journey from farm to table, because a more transparent meat supply chain will benefit not only consumers and businesses alike but make it harder for less scrupulous operators to cut corners. Some industry groups report that price increases of 15 to 50% would be triggered by mandatory labelling.

At present, there is no obligation at European level to indicate the origin of meat in processed products. This obligation exists only for meat when it is sold individually. Therefore, to date, every producer can freely decide whether or not to indicate the origin of processed meat and, if he decides to do so, he can do so without being obliged to follow any rules. This is absurd. That is why many producers point to the country of origin of only one of the ingredients of the final product – of course the country that suits them best commercially – or they freely choose to indicate only the ultimate country of food processing, while still benefiting from the marketing advantage that comes with it. This type of labelling is, of course, of no use, it only serves to make unfair competition between companies. In this way you can sell a product as if it were Italian, as if it were Spanish, as if it were Greek or English, etc., even if the meat it contains comes from a different country. Commissioner, you spoke earlier about voluntary labelling as a possibility. That is why, in the resolution, we called on the Commission to lay down clear rules for producers who decide to use voluntary labelling, but above all we have asked for clear rules to be laid down for those who decide not to label. From our point of view, the traceability of a product is an added value to the product and if a company decides not to label at that point it must in no way refer to the origin of any of the ingredients of its product because, otherwise, consumers will be misled. This is the only position that allows us to safeguard the freedom of choice of companies on the one hand and at the same time protect consumers from fraud. That is why, pending the compulsory labelling that we want, we have asked for our position to be adopted by means of an implementing act so that we can adopt these measures much more quickly than directives or regulations.

They must, in fact, keep track of all the products they use. So I find it very difficult to believe that asking for more transparency in this area would lead to such a great complication. Nevertheless, this is an essential point for future negotiations on a legislative proposal.

Therefore, the request for a compulsory indication of origin of the meat used as ingredients in processed products goes in exactly this direction. Therefore, while it is right to promote the basic principle of compulsory indication of origin, I believe that at the same time we cannot overlook the fact that the mechanisms for ensuring this greater transparency could also result, as someone else has already said, in a cost to businesses and therefore to consumers.  I listened very carefully to Commissioner Katainen's speech precisely on the cost-benefit ratio that labelling measures may entail.

Quality is also achieved through the use of countless SMEs, every day, small businesses, medium-sized enterprises that work in craft, who are proud of the quality they deliver every day. I am absolutely opposed to the resolution before us for the following four reasons: – origin labelling has nothing to do with security. It does not increase the quality nor the traceability and it does not prevent fraud; – it is operational and practically unfeasible. The sector is rightly soundly sounding the alarm; – it increases administrative burdens and costs and ultimately leads to a higher price for the consumer, who seems to find origin labelling to be relatively important, but does not want to pay extra for it; – finally, this is a taste of protectionism, which is contrary to the principles of the European single market and is particularly to the detriment of smaller, export-oriented regions such as Flanders. We do not need additional rules to restore consumer confidence, but more controls, stricter enforcement of existing agreements and tougher penalties. Voluntary origin labelling for meat as an ingredient already exists and is applied cost-effectively when a clear market demand goes hand in hand with operational feasibility.

Consumers were shocked, and rightly so. Food safety must be guaranteed and such fraud must be tackled harshly. However, the European Parliament's call for meat in processed products to be labelled as provenance will not prevent fraud. If someone wants to sell horse meat for beef, a label really doesn't stop him. In Europe, food safety requirements are among the strictest in the world. All products produced or imported in Europe must comply. The meat processing industry uses different meat suppliers from several countries. There is also a lot of change of supplier, so a label would have to be constantly changed. This makes the regulations practically unworkable. The Commission's research shows that this measure increases the cost of production by up to 50%. Such costs are not only borne by the entrepreneur, but also by the consumer.

Transparency must in fact become the essential principle of food production, and labelling is an opportunity for the consumer to understand this. If we say here on the one hand: 'Fresh meat yes, no in the case of processed meat', that is simply inconsistent. That is why we must consequently take the next step. Now is the time to close this gap. I wonder, of course, why not do this? Two trends in the food industry are clear: \"organic\" and \"regional with a good origin\" not only bring higher prices, but also bring more to producers. These trends must also be followed in other areas. On the other hand, there is a food industry that wants to shop cheaply, wants to shop as anonymously as possible, throughout Europe, and as far as possible without control. I am a little surprised that the Commission accepts the arguments of the food industry so unchecked and spreads horror figures, from the fact that the price has been increased by 50%. That has not been proven; there are other studies. However, dear Commission, but also the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, let us work together on workable solutions on how we can implement labelling, but not to block it here and to offer the consumer no solutions at all. We must further increase confidence in European food. That is a task for us. And the fact that this will ultimately lead to consumers appreciating European food on the basis of the safety tested has become clear in recent years and has been evident in many places.

Many consumers, but also many manufacturers, are talking about over-regulation in the European Union, not about its absence.

I would also like to respond a little to some of the arguments that have been put forward here. First of all, there is the argument that it makes food much more expensive. I believe that apples have been compared to pears here and that we need to talk about production costs on the one hand and costs for consumers, that is to say for consumers, on the other. There will be big differences. I think the 50% or up to 50% that were in the report is far too high. I believe that there will be significantly less and that consumers will then be happy to pay one cent more. I would like to make another argument here.

I, too, am clearly in favour of maximum transparency as regards the origin of our food. In particular, I believe that meat labelling would be a very great benefit, on the one hand for consumers and, on the other hand, for agriculture. I also believe that this horsemeat scandal in particular – not the horse of the scandal, but the wrong labelling – could not be prevented by a law and a new directive. If someone wants to cheat, they will probably continue to do so in the future. Nevertheless, I believe that we are creating more transparency for consumers by means of mandatory origin labelling for processed products. It doesn't really have to be labeled every slice of salami on a pizza. I think it is also clear that this goes absolutely too far. But a minimum of origin marking is absolutely necessary. Here I am in favour of a combined approach of compulsory and voluntary labelling. The introduction of a mandatory minimum labelling of origin \"from the EU\" or \"not from the EU\" for sausage and meat products probably costs the industry virtually nothing, but nevertheless creates clear conditions, especially as regards the purchase of raw materials. There have also been scandals in my region on a number of occasions. I believe that the possibility of voluntary labelling is particularly important.

Now I have to say to people: if you believe the advertisements of the supermarkets, that you can get four hamburgers for a pound, do not be surprised if what you were promised is not actually there. So, you know, there is also another aspect to this. We should not allow the large supermarkets to tell us these things or to browbeat those in the processing industry to provide them with the loss leaders that force people to do these sorts of things.  Now the horsemeat scandal had nothing to do with that. That was pure corruption. People out to destroy the industry. People changing meat on computers. The meat never moved! It was done on computers.

We have only partially succeeded, and so in the meantime there have been a number of food fraud scandals and there has been a significant reduction in consumer confidence. That's the result.  Now the results of the European Consumer Association survey show that more than 90% of respondents want the origin of the meat to be clearly identified. Consumers would not only welcome such information on packaging, but rather wonder that the information is no longer there, because they do not understand why processed meat should not be subject to the same strict and high-quality regulations as unprocessed meat. Regardless of which State of the Union the rules are enforced. We are not talking about any small amount of meat, in some EU countries up to half of all meat products are due to this condition without any indication of place of origin, and this is, in my opinion, alarming. There is so much lobbying around it now, so much scaremongering by price increases and bureaucracy, that I feel that this debate is really in the right place, and it needs to show, among other things, who is listening, whether it is consumers or industry.

After major scandals and scams with the mesa, there was a need for a legal solution that would make such cases impossible or at least more difficult. That is why we need to send a clear signal to the European Commission to propose new rules. A declaration that does not provide details on the origin of meat is simply not fair to consumers and paves the way for various scams.  Such a situation can be solved relatively easily and at no great cost to manufacturers. After all, if we talk about costs, I find consumer trust to be simply invaluable. Furthermore, labelling the country of origin of meat will make it easier for national authorities to combat food fraud and punish perpetrators.

In my view, reputable food producers, whether of products with processed meats or otherwise, have sustainable long-term relationships with their suppliers and therefore should not have the need to switch and swap between those suppliers. That is how I come to this debate. I am torn between the debate about what consumers want and what they are prepared to pay for. I do not see this on the Commission’s work programme for this year.

Not least in a globalised world where food passes through the supply chain across many countries and across many continents, it can be really difficult for consumers to get an idea of what kind of food is a food that is being provided with. So it is perfectly reasonable to demand to know which country a food comes from.  We also talked about the horsemeat scandal tonight. It was a fraud, but it taught us one thing. It is that a great many companies do not have control over their supply chains. Therefore, a legal requirement for the labelling of processed meat, where it comes from, can help them to get a handle on these supply chains. Yes, it will probably cost a little more, but i wonder if the prices presented by the industry are exaggerated slightly.  Commissioner, try to listen to consumers for once.

We have taken note of your views and I will pass these on to my colleague Vytenis Andriukaitis, who will be in charge of this particular issue. I would also like to underline that the estimated increase of 15% - 20% and up to 50% referred to the additional operating costs for the industry and not to the final product price. It is very difficult to estimate what kind of impact this would have on the final product cost. This depends firstly on the animal species concerned, secondly on the specific product concerns, on the applicable modalities, and fourthly on the specific operational situation of the operation concerned. The French study cannot be compared to the Commission report because it only concerns beef, and second only in France, and third only voluntary schemes.

Despite Mr Hogan's subsequent assurances that there would be no bilateral agreements with Russia to ease the embargo, I find this very worrying. Breaking EU solidarity and allowing Russia to choose the partners from which it will buy selected products, while leaving its market closed to producers from other countries, would be extremely damaging to the entire European Union, because unity and consistency are our strength.
