A year ago, we adopted the new legislation on the fair use of so-called conflict minerals. This was an important step in the context of a value-based trade policy and also away from a trade policy based only on bilateral agreements towards a focus on value chains. This is just the right approach in the face of global value chains. I would also like to thank the Commission for the very productive monitoring of the negotiations. This has certainly been a great success for all the institutions of the European Union. This legislation will fully enter into force on 1 January 2021. We deliberately took a little longer because this is a new approach — a new approach that requires responsible management, corporate due diligence for the entire value chain. This is, of course, something new that has not yet been tested in practice. And that's why this longer period is right. We have focused on the four main so-called conflict minerals — tantalum, tungsten, tin, and gold — that are currently being obtained in regions burdened by civil wars and other conflicts, where people are forced to force children to mine these minerals. I believe that anyone who has gold jewelry or a smartphone should be sure that the materials used here, do not result from forced labor, from brutal situations. That's why these four minerals cover the entire value chain with a duty of care, from the mine to the melting plant to the product. These four minerals that we have focused on account account for 35% of global trade, 35% is a lot. In this respect, we will also take an important step in the global context. And now the two have Committees submitted this debate and the question for oral answers, because, of course, some steps need to be taken in the preparations for January 2021. Legislation is the first step, but then there are some steps in terms of implementation. And, of course, we want to design legislation in such a way that there are no loopholes that will allow this good legislation to be undermined. In this respect, we want to ensure that the maximum of this positive effect is truly appreciated. Incidentally, to industry: we have, of course, set 1 January 2021, but this does not prevent anyone from applying the legislation ahead of schedule. The main issues focus on the area: what is the real situation with the recognition of voluntary industrial schemes? We have said in legislation that if certain industries want to move forward and have reliable autonomous industrial schemes, this will be recognised. Are there any studies there already and are there any agreements with the OECD to take into view certain schemes? Then, within the framework of legislation, we also asked for accompanying measures, both as regards small and medium-sized enterprises here with us, which are certainly experiencing particular difficulties, and with regard to the question of how to provide development policy assistance on the ground. The transparency of the data was also an important consideration. This is about the data base, whether a certain pre-development has already taken place. And finally, of course, I said that 35% of minerals are recorded, but that means 75% is not covered. What is the process of working with other countries around the world to ultimately capture 100%?", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "aws", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 3, "date": "2018-03-15.json", "name": "Linda McAVAN", "mepid": "2327", "text": "  author. – Madam President, before talking about the technical side of the conflict minerals supply chain, it’s maybe worth pausing and remembering why we are having this legislation at all. Because it’s not a technical issue, it’s about human rights. It’s about combating violence against women and girls, and it’s about improving governance in some of the world’s most fragile and poorest countries.  I’ve been an MEP for almost 20 years and I’ve seen many great speakers in this Chamber. But one of the most memorable was Dr Denis Mukwege, who came here in November 2014. Dr Mukwege spoke passionately about his country, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and about its enormous mineral wealth. He made a direct link between the illegal exploitation of that wealth and the appalling abuse of human rights and violence against women, the rapes and worse of women and girls, who he treats in his hospital in Panzi. I visited the hospital in Panzi and if you can go, please go, it is an extraordinary place, and Dr Mukwege is an extraordinary man.  What he said struck a chord with many of us here, because back in November 2014 Parliament was examining the proposal from the Commission on how to tackle conflict minerals. We had, to be frank, a rather thin proposal from the Commission, which talked about voluntary measures. I’m looking at Judith Sargentini here, and I have to pay her tribute because she fought for many years for legislation in this field before the last elections. But when Dr Denis Mukwege came, it did have an impact. People started to listen. Parliament listened. You listened, Madam Commissioner, Neven Mimica listened, and eventually the Council even listened and we brought in a mandatory system. And now we have to make that mandatory system work.  We are seeing some progress. I would like to pay tribute to Global Witness, and Amnesty International as well, for pushing us along this path. Global Witness published a report last summer. They surveyed a number of mineral-exporting companies, showing that whereas none reported on due diligence in 2013, almost 50% were reporting by last year, and as the legislation takes hold we expect that number to increase. But the report also showed gaps. Only one gold-exporting company was reporting, and the standard of reporting was extremely weak. That’s where our accompanying measures come in. We need to work with these companies to improve reporting and standardise the content. And we need to do more. The 2014 Commission communication lists 14 areas of work. Late last year, we saw the first Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI) proposal come on stream, it was a good project, and what we are asking today is a timetable for the other proposals which need to come between now and 2021. We need projects with companies – yes – but also with governments. We need projects with civil society, with women’s organisations. And we need the EU to step up its diplomacy. We need to be asking these countries, when we have our political dialogue, what they are doing about the due diligence on conflict minerals, and we need to be asking our Member States as well what they are doing to ensure that this legislation is implemented and that the OECD due diligence guidelines are actually effective across the European Union. We need regular reporting back to this Parliament, and we also need the Council and the public at large to be kept informed.  Why do we need to do that this? We need to it because we need to make this legislation work. We need to deliver on the promise made in Addis Ababa on financing for development and on ensuring more domestic resource mobilisation. If we have legal channels for mineral exports, we will have better tax revenues in some of these countries. We need to deliver on sustainable development goals, not least of which is SDG 16 on good governance, and this would help tackle corruption and stop fuelling armed conflicts. Most of all, we need to do it because we owe it to the people, to the women and the children whom Denis Mukwege spoke about and whom he treats in his hospital. It would be a real legacy of this Parliament and your work, Commissioner, over the last five years, if we could make sure that this legislation takes hold and is effective, and if we could see a change in the future.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 4, "date": "2018-03-15.json", "name": "Cecilia MALMSTRÖM", "mepid": "4273", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, allow me to congratulate you on your national day.  This is indeed very important legislation. We can jointly be proud of it. We worked hard together, and it is – as the two rapporteurs have said – the clear evidence of the value-based trade agenda. It is complex and difficult, so we need to have an integrated approach. I appreciate this possibility to update you on what we are doing to prepare for the full implementation of this. The regulation stipulates that the requirement of EU importers of tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold shall apply as from January 2021, so that companies, Member States and the Commission can efficiently prepare. There are a series of actions explicitly set out in the regulation, and we are busy finalising them. For instance, the guidance to help companies on the identification of conflict-affected and high-risk areas and other supply-chain risks they may consider in their due diligence process.  We are also preparing guidance for the Member States’ competent authorities in their upcoming enforcement activities, in particular, the so-called ex-post checks on importers and a delegated regulation on the methodology that the Commission will use to recognise and validate industry due diligence schemes, which would be instrumental in ensuring that the regulation is operational.  These initiatives are well advanced and they should be adopted already in the first half of this year. In the subsequent step, building on these initiatives, the Commission will adopt and implement the act establishing a list of global responsible smelters and refiners and find a first indicative non-exhaustive list of conflict-affected and high-risk areas from external expertise already next year, which is well in advance of the deadline.  In addition to the initiatives explicitly mentioned in the regulation, we are also advancing the accompanying measures, and we are fully committed to honour the promises of a more political nature that we made during the negotiations on this regulation. In this regard, I would like to emphasise four work streams that we know are important for you.  Firstly, the measures to support SMEs: both of the honourable rapporteurs mentioned the oral question put, to support SMEs in their efforts to implement policies for responsible sourcing of minerals. In January this year, the Commission finalised our study on the support system for SME supply chain due diligence. On this basis, by the end of next year the Commission will deliver an online tool designed to help SMEs in their due diligence efforts. This will be available to SMEs in the EU that want to develop and implement due diligence of mineral supply chains, irrespective of whether they have the obligation or not under the regulation. Particular attention will be paid to the competitiveness aspect of SMEs applying due diligence.  Of particular relevance to SMEs will be the translation of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) guidance into all EU languages, which the Commission will provide as early as the spring of this year. Secondly, the measures to foster uptake of responsible sourcing policies among downstream companies. Companies producing goods, including tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold, but which do not themselves import the metals and minerals to the EU, do not have legal obligations under the regulation. Nevertheless, it is important that also these so-called downstream companies consider responsible sourcing as far as possible. Last year, the Commission published non-binding guidelines on how to implement the directive on non-financial reporting, explaining that companies are expected to disclose relevant information, in particular on conflict mineral supply chain due diligence. These include notably companies that are active in the downstream. Later this year, we will also make available an online transparency platform where downstream companies can showcase their work on due diligence and exchange best practices. This transparency exercise would be very much welcomed by civil society organisations. In addition, the aforementioned efforts to support SMEs will also be available to downstream companies.  Thirdly, the measures taken to provide the necessary funding for projects on the ground, I would like to highlight a few. We have support to the project promoting responsible supply chains in the area of conflict minerals, which was approved in December 2017. It will foster cooperation between producer and consumer countries on responsible sourcing of minerals through the European Partnership on Responsible Minerals. That is EUR 5.4 million. We have also supported the OECD’s important work on due diligence and responsible sourcing to the tune of EUR 4 million for the period 2014-2019. We have supported the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region for regional initiatives against the illegal exploitation of natural resources. That is EUR 3 million that we paid before, with an indicative amount of a further EUR 3 million for the next stage of the initiative. We also provide support to artisanal and small-scale gold and diamond mining in Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire and the Central African Republic, to the tune of around EUR 4 million. We are considering projects in a number of African countries. We have a maximum here of EUR 4 million. These important financial efforts are in line with the commitment I made to you, together with my colleague, Commissioner Mimica, and of course Vice-President Mogherini, in a letter that we sent to you in March 2015.  Moreover, in implementing these measures, the Commission and the External Action Service attach great value to the multi-stakeholder approach. So we are working closely with industry and civil society.  Fourthly and finally, I would like to stress the important work we have to encourage third-country producers and consumers of minerals and metals to adopt and implement policies for the responsible sourcing of minerals based on the OECD guidelines. Our efforts here are based on three pillars: firstly, we have senior-level technical dialogues that have been carried out over the last two years with major economies in countries of special relevance. This includes, for instance, China, India, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and the United Arab Emirates. In this regard, our outreach, together with the OECD secretariat, has delivered tangible results in China, where they have adopted guidelines on the responsible sourcing of minerals, and also in India, where there have been various initiatives launched on the responsible sourcing of gold, in particular.  Secondly, there are proposals to include references to responsible sourcing of minerals based on the OECD guidelines in our free-trade agreements, for instance with Mexico.  Thirdly, substantial support, including funding, for the OECD’s work on the responsible sourcing including promotion and awareness-raising across the globe in producing and consuming countries alike.  You can see that we have worked a lot since we concluded our common work here. Many strands of work, an integrated approach that can deliver but also inspire similar initiatives in other important markets. Thank you again for the opportunity to discuss this with you.

Happy birthday to celebrate the national holiday of the Lady of the country! Commissioner, good morning! We discussed other things here last night, so I respect you are with us this early morning. As rapporteur, from the Committee on Development, of the opinion to the Conflict Minerals Regulation, I postulated the introduction of accompanying measures to support and control due diligence in the supply chain of minerals in the countries of origin. From the point of view of our committee, this is very important. As the Commissioner said, the first accompanying measure derived from the Development Cooperation Funding Instruments (DCI) covers only part of the 14 action areas listed in the 2014 Communication. The Commissioner also mentioned the plans and links. Does the Commission intend to present additional accompanying measures covering all other areas in this Communication? I'll also ask a more interesting question about the schedule: what will it look like temporal? You've also spoken about the budget, but will there be any links?

I would also like to join Bernd Lange on his thanks to the European Commission, because we were able to work together to amend the original proposal and make it mandatory, despite the many obstacles that existed in the various discussions. Legislation has put at the heart of the mechanism the recognition of industrial patterns, which are truly a key element in legislation. However, a corruption and money laundering scandal broke out in 2016 on the refinery and metals that were certified in an LBMA industrial scheme until 2017. This case shows the limitations of the functioning of industrial schemes and, in particular, the lack of transparency of industrial schemes at present. My questions are of three orders. Firstly, in view of this lack of transparency in industrial schemes, will you require them to align fully, as requested in the negotiations, with the OECD principles, namely the public and detailed declaration to give access to the entire information? Secondly, are you going to conduct in-depth analyses using audit practices, by sample, in the case of these industrial schemes? Third, will you ensure that companies remain individually responsible for their due diligence when they do not adhere to a scheme as such? Ensuring the effectiveness of these schemes is really essential if legislation is to be effective. I will now come to the accompanying measures. I read yesterday, in a document provided to us, that entitled “European Partnership for Responsible Minerals”, which brings together experts to work upstream, i.e. in mining mines, is financed by DG DEVCO in the amount of more than €5 million.

Besides, from the beginning of the history of mankind, wars were fought for 3TG and other precious metals and weapons manufacturing materials. The Trojan War was not about a fine Helen but about the gold of Lydia and Phrygia. Cyprus is constantly changing conquerors for copper, gold, vast forests and now for its natural gas. History repeats itself. Africa has huge deposits of precious metals exploited for the benefit of third parties and not the African peoples, and the regions where precious minerals exist are fields of harsh conflict. If mineral wealth were to be exploited honestly and transparently, Africa would be the richest continent and could escape poverty, underdevelopment and dependence on foreign aid. Instead, the exploitation of mineral wealth is the cause of bloody conflicts, wars and massacres. Africa remains underdeveloped and continues to spend the profits from its precious ore to buy weapons that Africans kill each other with. It does not spend its income on education, democracy and the welfare of the population, but on the violation of all human rights, especially children's rights, in a wild form of modern slave trade, as the World Bank for the Republic of Congo has catavaltically denounced in 2008. The European Parliament in 2007 took a very important step: it tried with the accompanying measures to regulate the marketing of 3TG, especially for production from conflict areas.

Commissioner, thank you for your personal commitment and for the Commission's efforts to address Parliament's concerns. I regret, however, that the amounts allocated to accompanying measures are mainly committed by the Commission and very little by the Member States: 20 million over the period 2016-2020 for all the countries concerned, this obviously seems to me to be totally insufficient. These are therefore very small amounts. I would add that nowhere I see the commitment of a permanent political dialogue with the partner countries. I express the same concern as my colleague Maria Arena about the lack of transparency in industrial patterns — I will not return to that. Of course, I would like to thank DG DEVCO for committing €5 million in 2017 for measures aimed at supporting local authorities, strengthening local communities, supporting the private sector in implementing due diligence, but this is obviously insignificant compared, of course, to needs.

That didn't work out. The other thing I regret is that it has to take so long. America has already imposed import restrictions in 2013, and we are actually not going to actually check until 2021. I think that's a pity. Anyway, we got it. And now we need to make sure that by 2021 it is also in place and properly implemented. My questions to the Commissioner are: how do we ensure that the development money available for that implementation does not just go to companies to get their bureaucracy in order, but that mining communities in countries like Congo and their governments are given the opportunity to which companies also really control? The next question is this: what have we done ourselves, what has the European Commission done to change the procurement rules so that we, too, do not buy computers without knowing what minerals and metals are contained in them, and do you also impose that kind of requirements on service contracts of commercial providers? That's what I'd like to know. One final point, if you may. There is support for regulation here to curtail trade that violates human rights. Textiles, for example.

I would like to address you, Mrs Malmström from the Commission, but also to the absent Council, because I miss it in this very important debate on an important legislative procedure: there are now more than four million internally displaced persons in Congo. According to UNICEF, 13.1 million people are dependent on humanitarian aid there, including 7.8 million children. These are destinies in the struggle for control of raw materials, and their sale to Europe and Asia makes the warlords, but also traders and buyers rich. That's how guns are financed. We have already discussed this importance here on various occasions. I ask you: what specific information does the Commission have on the associated delivery routes and cash flows? If you do not have this information, what do you do to get this information? The more than 360 companies in the Responsible Minerals Initiative have acted almost ahead and have substantially adapted their policies to the OECD guidelines. This week they already delivered the new reporting tools to their companies. In June 2018, i.e. this year, their use will become mandatory. When are we coming? Mrs Malmström, precisely because I was so happy at the time that we worked together and were able to achieve a lot, that today I am concerned that sceptics and brakers would like to let the initiative disappeared. This also includes the transparency requirement that has already been mentioned. How far has the Commission come in its accompanying support measures? How do we prepare for implementation in Central Africa? How do we prepare companies in the European Union? Where are the Member States? There's still a lot of work to be done!

With regard to this issue of conflict ores, I believe that if there is conflict ores, there is conflict, I would even say there is conflict because there are minerals. That is, we are in geopolitical games and power games. I would point out that the operation rebellion in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) around 1995 — and I was there — was manipulated, completely conducted by the United States and that all this was done, indeed, to have control of these minerals. So we must always place this matter in its geopolitical context of war in order to take control of minerals. Certainly, we need self-certification, of course we must have more transparency, but my colleague Maria Arena — and here I agree with her — has clearly shown the limits of this industrial scheme and how it can be perverted. Take the DRC: we are never talking about Mr Kagame, but he occupies this country and takes these minerals very gently when he is considered a very democratic man and, moreover, this with the support of Canadian, American and German companies. Nobody talks about this, how will your self-certification bring something? What we have to do is put things in their place. There can be no freedom of trade for very sensitive minerals.

Following the launch of the first development cooperation instrument-funded accompanying measure in late 2017, it is important to assess whether other accompanying measures responding to the objectives encompassed in the joint communication will be designed, and whether these additional measures would cover very relevant aspects such as the implementation of fair taxation for minerals.

There is clearly a huge interest in these questions, and I fully understand that because it is also important to us. This is very important legislation on a serious problem of grave violation of human rights in certain areas. This could contribute, but of course it will not solve the problems fully.  I also understand your impatience on this, but I want to remind you that the legislation has not yet entered into force. I answered many of your questions already in my introductory remarks, but am happy to come back to them. We are now focusing more on the incentives than on the legislation. When that enters into force, then we will have other tools as well.  We are working specifically to help SMEs to prepare for this with our online tool. The translations of the OECD guidelines will be done later this spring. The transparency platform for downstream companies is also targeting SMEs in particular.  We are working closely with our Member States and experts. There are only five Member States who still need to appoint their authority. The others are working on it, as some of you mentioned. There are lots of initiatives happening in the Member States today – we can come back to a fuller list of that at a later stage. There have also been some results from our outreach, for instance we see now that China is adopting legislation and that there are discussions going on in India as well. On the industry scheme alignment, this is done by a delegated act based on the OECD methodology, and yes, there will be shadow audits, but companies do remain individually responsible. On the Apple-Intel participation in the European partnership, it is key here to have a partnership between business, NGOs and governments. They will adequately complement the regulation with technical assistance and good mining practices for small and artisanal miners. On the transparency of schemes, the methodology adopted by, or developed by, the OECD is to recognise industry schemes to make sure that they fully respect the five steps of OECD due diligence guidance, including reporting. This alignment methodology is developed and monitored in conjunction with civil society organisations, including, for instance, the organisation Global Witness, which is very helpful in this regard. The Commission is not financing big private companies. We are focusing financing through a call for proposals on local activities for artisanal and small-scale miners to enhance their socioeconomic capacities, increase their productivity, make them, in due time, eligible to access credits, take care of the gender issue, and help them address the worst cases of child labour affecting the mining areas. There are also proposals to target the capacity of local authorities, so we are really trying to work on a bottom-up approach. Those expected to present proposals for EU funds will mainly be civil society organisations, and many of them have very significant experience in this field. We appreciate this and want to support it. On the Non-financial Reporting Directive, we have made a very clear commitment in this regard as part of the political agreement on the regulation, and we are fully committed to honouring it. The Non-financial Reporting Directive provides that the companies covered by the Directive shall include in their management report the principal risks related to those matters linked to the undertaking’s operations, including business relationship, products or services which are likely to cause adverse impact in these areas and to show how the undertaking manages those risks.  So we specified last year, in non-binding guidelines on non-financial reporting, that companies are expected to disclose relevant information on due diligence to ensure responsible supply chains for tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold.  On this basis, it is clear that the Commission expects companies covered by the directive to include reporting on the responsible sourcing of 3TG. As you know, we are planning a review of the regulation, even though it has not entered into force yet. In that review we could decide to include new minerals – the methodology has been developed to be neutral in that case. We will also make an assessment of whether it is enough or there is a need for new legislative measures, and we will be happy to work with you in this regard.  As you see, we have been doing a lot already to prepare and to make the accompanying measures in order to have all that ready when it finally enters into force. I thank you for your strong interest in this, and I commit, Madam President, honourable Members, regularly to come back and report where we are. I know that the interest is significant, and we promised at the adoption of this that the Commission would keep you regularly informed about what is happening.

The Commission warmly welcomes the European Parliament’s initiative. As Members of this House, you have already called for a high level of ambition with the adoption of the Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Directive in 2014. The Commission shares this ambition. The provision of a comprehensive, easy-to-use infrastructure for alternative fuels is a key prerequisite for the transition to low-emission mobility. Our first priority was to ensure that the Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Directive is properly implemented in all Member States. That is why we did not hesitate to launch immediate infringement procedures against those Member States not complying with the directive. With the second Mobility Package, of 8 November 2017, we delivered an additional policy stimulus, particularly with our Action Plan on alternative fuels infrastructure. By 2030 more and broader action will be needed. We need a larger part of the existing fleet to run on alternative fuels in order to meet the EU commitments under the Paris Climate Treaty. However, we don’t think that the directive needs to be revised at this stage. The Council and Parliament adopted this directive four years ago as the first ever legal instrument to ensure the promotion of a new market for alternative-fuel vehicles and vessels. Since then, a lot of progress has been made. Yes, the completeness, coherence and ambition of the national policy frameworks vary greatly. Our analysis of the implementation of the directive shows that, on average so far, the planning under the national policy frameworks which Member States had to submit pursuant to the Directive would not meet the level and consistency of ambition that will be needed after 2020, when more vehicles are expected to hit the roads. However, in many places the directive has acted as a catalyst and has stimulated and broadened national planning and strategies. It is therefore time for joint and concerted action, but not for reopening negotiations. So, with the Action Plan on alternative fuels infrastructure, we are now providing an important and very concrete stimulus. We are making available an additional EUR 800 million in the form of innovative financing instruments for the rollout of infrastructure: up to EUR 350 million through the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) ‘Blending’ call and up to EUR 450 million through the CEF Debt or InnovFin instruments. We can already see how the blending of grants and loans under CEF Blending works in practice. Several consortia will now start to roll out fast-charging infrastructure on strategic highways. This is good news for Europe. But there are also less developed parts of Europe where continued support action is needed. Here Member States can benefit from substantial cohesion policy support to accelerate such investments. In the current period of the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) EUR 70 billion has been allocated from the Cohesion Fund and the European Regional Development Fund for promoting sustainable mobility and transport, including the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure. Through the Action Plan we are also facilitating better collaboration among authorities and market players in relation to good practice. We have already started this process in the form of alternative fuels roadshows in Member States and have received a lot of positive feedback. It is fundamental to stress the need for greater efforts to introduce alternative fuels and clean vehicles. A major lack of infrastructure is no longer a valid argument against it. The basic infrastructure is starting to be put in place in many parts of the European Union. Consumer buy-in depends on quality of choice. It is highly relevant that more vehicle models are being introduced into the market and this is happening quickly. With the second Mobility Package, we have made important proposals to further support market direction, including proposals for a new CO2 emission performance standard and for the revision of the Clean Vehicles Directive. Low-emission and zero-emission vehicles will be favoured by consumers if the infrastructure is not only comprehensive but also easy to use. This is not the case at the moment, particularly not across borders. With the Action Plan, we have now outlined an approach for further discussion with public authorities and market players about needs and approaches for addressing the interoperability of services, including payment services, in the most effective way. We are already supporting authorities on very practical issues of data collection in order to map better the location and availability of charging and filling stations for consumers in Europe. Let me conclude. Together, all the points of action under this Action Plan will help to ensure that we have in place a comprehensive, easy-to-use spec on infrastructure for the recharging and refuelling of alternative-fuel vehicles by 2025.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "PPE", "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 29, "date": "2018-03-15.json", "name": "Massimiliano SALINI", "mepid": "125670", "text": " on behalf of the PPE Group. — Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, the Commission's decision, through this action plan, to take action on such an important matter as that of the matter of reduction of emissions into the atmosphere in the transport sector, that is, in the context of what has now become the great defendant, the great responsible, the most important responsible for the pollution, behold, is a correct action provided it is carried out in a balanced manner.

The transport sector is the only sector that continues to increase in emissions, as well as last year or the years before. We once again had 0.5% more greenhouse gases in the mobility sector in 2016 than in 2015, and you pointed out that we already had the Clean Power for Transport Directive of 2014. I have to tell you quite frankly, Commissioner — knowing that this is not your failure because you were not in action at the time — that this was a great opportunity that the Member States destroyed. At the time, with your help in Annex II, we had very clear quantitative targets, which ultimately envisaged building so and so many infrastructures in the various categories by 2020. It is precisely this Annex II that the Council has excluded, so we have now lost four full years. If it had been up to this annex, we would have 800,000 charging stations by 2020. Now we've only 130,000. These are numbers from the Alternative Fuels Observatory, so they are true. That is why this is a great opportunity that we finally missed. I am all the more surprised that the Commission is once again only coming up with an action plan. Legislation is in the process, it's one to 12. The other regions of the world are doing it for us. We know about the development in China, we also know the pressure our industry is under. That is why I invite all of you, especially you as the Commission, to build this infrastructure, the cost of which we have probably calculated, now in the form of a European investment fund. There is an opportunity, with EUR 24 billion, which could be shared by industry and the European Union, to make a rapid ramp-up in terms of infrastructure. If we can't do that — you also have at of CO2 legislation — I do not know if the automotive companies and industry will be able to meet the targets for 2025. Let us therefore be ambitious!

Commissioner! The transition of the European transport sector to alternative fuels is a process that is already underway. Its course is admittedly still slightly chaotic and is mainly driven by the energy of its greatest enthusiasts and some Member States, but it is hard to underestimate regular progress. The key to success in disseminating green modes of transport is no doubt the availability of terminals and places where such alternative fuel can be refuelled or loaded, whether it be electricity, gas, or hydrogen. The action plan prepared by the Commission rightly recognises the biggest challenges ahead: firstly, adapting existing and still built elements of the TEN-T network to the needs of users of alternative fuels vehicles, secondly, the expansion of the necessary infrastructure in suburban areas where progress in this regard is low. We must not forget that the departure of individual users from combustion cars is the first step.

The oil price was too low, so they did not set this in motion. It is also the case that new technologies available on the market are not accepted by consumers because they do not know whether they will be able to drive their vehicle. And this is true for all areas. I know for sure, I strongly promoted LNG at the time for more use of LNG, especially in ships. Many ports are already equipped accordingly.

Almost eighty years ago, an emission-free freight transport solution was already operating in Europe, powered by renewable energy. The Italians in 1938 had difficulties in the supply of fuels and therefore developed a trolleyway that transported materials thanks to modified electric filtrucks (the “trolley trucks”) of Fiat derivation. The Philovia dello Stelvio reached eighty kilometers of extension. It was powered by hydroelectric power. She was decommissioned in 1956. Today the Swedish government, Siemens and Volvo Scania have been experimenting with such a solution for years. The results are excellent, technological advances have improved system reliability by making long-distance electric freight transport possible, otherwise difficult with electrochemical accumulation alone . Costs per kilometre are relatively low and recoverable with operation due to the efficiency of electric traction. It is engaged on existing infrastructure, flexible logistics is possible seamless to the urban centres reachable by moving outside the electrified lines: for short routes with the energy accumulated in batteries during motorway routes, with on-board electric generators or with classic endothermic engines powered by alternative fuels. It is an innovation that does not distort the employment balances of drivers and transport companies. The European Parliament spoke out as early as June 2016 in favour of this solution, but we need vision and coordination at EU level, funds to start infrastructure.

So far, the European Union, I think, has sought a constructive dialogue with the leaders of the Maldives, even though it said what was wrong and what was wrong. At the moment, however, we have to accede to certain kinds of sanctions, it is impossible to wait further and look at what is happening in the Maldives today. It must be looked at that the human rights and political situation in the country is constantly deteriorating, that there is a restriction of human rights and freedoms, an expansion of the powers of the president, a polarization of justice. What we fear most is the reintroduction of the death penalty. Opposition leaders are pushing for the restoration of pluralistic democracy and rule of law. However, they are repeatedly subjected to attacks by authorities and police. There are even legal proceedings being fabricated against them.

His most recent act was the establishment of a state of emergency, which allowed it to suppress respect for fundamental freedoms.

It has continued to deteriorate since our last debate. The European Union remains mobilised and has intensified its diplomatic actions to support democracy and the rule of law in the Maldives.  The country is an important partner for the European Union in the fight against climate change. As current Chair of the Alliance of Small Island States, the Maldives plays an important role in support of the Paris Agreement, and we are interested in deepening our cooperation in this field. At the same time, EU Member States are playing an active part in the development of tourism in the Maldives. In 2017, more than 645 000 tourists – almost 50% of visitors to the Maldives – came from Europe. We are also interested in developing cooperation on counter-terrorism and on countering violent extremism with the Maldives. However, the EU has closely followed the recent deterioration of the situation in the Maldives and immediately informed the authorities of its concerns. A statement was issued on 6 February in reaction to the declaration of the state of emergency by the Maldivian President. Our EU Ambassador was there to deliver an EU demarche from 19-21 February. He pressed for the restoration of the functioning of the parliament, called for an immediate lifting of the state of emergency and a return to constitutional normality, respect for constitutionally-guaranteed rights and the rule of law, and the immediate release of political prisoners. He also encouraged the UN-facilitated dialogue to allow for a political solution for the preparation of credible, inclusive and transparent presidential elections.  Upon my proposal, the Council adopted conclusions on the Maldives on 26 February. It was the first time, and it sent a strong political signal in support of the return to constitutional rule of the Maldivian authorities and people. The situation is not in accordance with the principle of democratic rule and separation of powers, and if this situation does not improve, the Council may consider targeted measures. The Council underlined that the parliament and the judiciary should be enabled to return to their normal functioning, in accordance with the Constitution, and called for the immediate lifting of the state of emergency and restoration of all constitutionally guaranteed rights. The Council condemned politically motivated arrests and called for the immediate release of all political prisoners.  Since the adoption of the conclusions, the situation has not yet improved. At the request of President Yameen, the parliament renewed, on 20 February, the state of emergency for an additional 30 days. A number of fundamental constitutional rights are still suspended. To date, there has been no release of political prisoners, and former President Gayoom, who is 81 years old, has not been released from house arrest.  We commend the deployment of an electoral follow-up mission, led by honourable Member of the European Parliament, Eduard Kukan, in January 2018, which carried out an assessment of the implementation of the recommendations of the 2014 EU Electoral Observation Mission. We are looking forward to Mr Kukan’s report and call for the competent Maldivian authorities to fully consider his conclusions, with a view to organising credible, transparent and inclusive elections. It is essential to restore constitutionally guaranteed rights and lift the state of emergency, as well as to respect and protect the rule of law, human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the freedom of expression and the right to fair trial. The EU encourages all stakeholders to work with the UN to facilitate such a dialogue, and the EU is ready to support UN facilitation. We will continue to closely follow the evolution of the situation, with a view to deciding on the next steps.

The nationwide protests against the rising commodity prices, which started earlier this year, have been met with an excessive use of force by the authorities. In recent months, we have witnessed a surge in arrests and detention of, among others, human rights defenders, journalists, student activists and members of the opposition, including leaders of political parties.  Media freedom has deteriorated further, with seizures of several newspapers. Among those arrested is Mr Salih Mahmoud Osman, a well-known Sudanese human rights lawyer and the laureate of the 2007 Sakharov Prize. Despite the release of dozens of detainees in mid-February, a move which the EU welcomed, more than 100 remain in detention. The EU delegation in Khartoum is doing its utmost to keep an updated logbook of all those detained.  Specific cases of concern, like that of Mr Salih, are closely monitored and systematically raised in meetings with the Sudanese authorities. The EU delegation in Khartoum has also met the families of those detained as well as the Sudanese Human Rights Commission, whose work it continues to support. Moreover, numerous EU local statements have been issued, urging the government of Sudan to respect freedom of expression and to release all political detainees.  Furthermore, on 27 February, the EU special representative for human rights, Mr Stavros Lambrinidis, called for respect for due process for all human rights defenders in Sudan, including Mr Salih, in his speech at the UN Human Rights Council.  I would like to thank Parliament for its continued engagement, illustrated not only by today’s debate, but also for the recent statement issued by Vice—President Hautala and Pier Antonio Panzeri, Chair of the Subcommittee on Human Rights, calling for the release of Mr Salih as well as the visit of the Subcommittee on Human Rights to Sudan last December. The protection and promotion of human rights remains at the core of the EU’s engagement with Sudan, and we will continue to staunchly condemn all abuses and support brave human rights defenders.

Yet, there is an equally alarming practice referred to as ‘mercy killing’. This implies parents of children with disabilities killing their children or deliberately letting them die of starvation or through the denial of medical attention. Poverty and social stigma play a significant role, but not much information is available on the scale of the problem or the number of children concerned. In a recent documentary by a local TV station, some parents confessed to having engaged in mercy killings to save their children from severe suffering throughout their lives. Some also confessed to acts of mercy killing to save themselves from the difficulties of raising a child with a disability. Although Uganda’s legal framework provides for the protection of children, and specifically that of children with disabilities, only limited initiatives have been taken to avert the practice. This is partly attributed to the apparent social tolerance of such killings. The situation is further complicated by the fact that people with disabilities often face marginalisation and rejection. Such entrenched social barriers, coupled with inadequate support from communities and government, as well as families, can leave carers with the feeling of having no choice. The European Union, through the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights and other initiatives for the justice and law and order sector, provides support to the Government and to non-state bodies to address issues affecting children and discrimination against marginalised women and children. We ask the Government to address the problem of mercy killings. Parents of children with disabilities need support in providing special care for these children. The Government is encouraged to put in place adequate social services, medical care, special needs education and other facilities to enable children with disabilities to enjoy the same rights as any other children. The Government should, furthermore, ensure that the perpetrators of mercy killings are brought to justice. The EU stands ready to work with the Government of Uganda in addressing this issue.

Mr Hahn, I remember that you were always there when we were negotiating on the regulations for this period, 2014-2020, and that you were in the debate when we talked about the performance reserve. The performance reserve is really an innovation. We talk in this House about performance-based budgeting; we talk about the fact that those partners in the Member States, regional cities and Member States themselves reach the milestones and they are rewarded for it. It is to praise those who really perform and to give them another incentive to do their utmost. And what happens now? Now we stand with the question: what’s the point? The Regional Development Committee wants to test the Commission on the feasibility, to do a reality check on the performance reserve. As the President already said, it’s about the ESI funds, it’s about the Regional Development Fund, about the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund... and in these funds we put aside EUR 21 billion. That’s 6% of the whole budget for the 7 years, for the best to serve the best. Parliament, already last year – it was in Westphal report, on 13 June last year – established their building blocks for the rest of the period and gave a glimpse into the next period. Parliament there said that we wanted to have quicker decision-making, a faster track if possible, for this reserve that we had made. Since then we have had no answer from the European Commission on this point. So we want to hear clearly what the Commission is willing to do. The questions are clear. First, does the Commission intend to commence performance earlier when those programmes in the Member States are ahead of schedule and the evaluation can be done earlier. Second, depending on the outcome of any such anticipated performance review, is the Commission willing to release the performance reserves earlier? Next year, we go to the citizens. We have our elections. We did our negotiating in the year 2013; in 2014 we started; 2016... 2017... 2018, and now we have to wait until 2019 to have an evaluation, and then this money that’s already in the envelope of the Member States can be committed to be spent later in 2021-22-23. How can I explain to my voters that Europe delivers, that Europe has better regulation, that Europe has an open ear and delivers, where companies and schools and public authorities take the right path? So this is the question: where is the flexibility on the side of the Commission? But then something happened: the Commission itself came forward in December with a new proposal to take the money of the performance reserve, and they had the intention, and I quote the College, to test the main features of the reform delivery tool in a pilot already in 2018-2020. And that was for quite another goal: to prepare countries, if they want to, to join the eurozone. And this got us to the question: what are we doing with the performance reserve? Who can explain this way of acting? So this is the question the REGI Committee wants to bring forward and I hope that you can come with at least a clear message – because it was so silent, it was too silent.

It’s also good to see some well—known faces again here in the plenary.  I am speaking primarily representing my successor and I don’t want to intervene too much, but there is a common Commission view, of course, on this issue. I would really like to emphasise – and to begin this intervention by underlining – that the applicable provisions of the common provisions regulation as adopted by the co-legislators don’t foresee an earlier performance review, or an earlier release of the performance reserve. Hence, it would be necessary to amend these provisions if the performance review was to be carried out ahead of the deadlines specified in the current legislation. The Commission does not intend to propose such a change in the current provisions applicable to the date of the performance assessment and the allocation of the reserve for the following reasons: First, the rate of project selection is an important indicator of progress of programmes and of their potential final achievements, but it’s not an automatic or a sufficient guarantee that the physical and financial intermediate objectives, so—called milestones, of the programmes measured by the performance framework will be achieved. Moreover, the so—called selection rate is not among the indicators included in the performance frameworks and the performance reserve may be released only when and if all indicators included in the performance framework meet the milestones in line with the applicable legal provisions.  Secondly, in order to avoid excessive burden on Member States and regions, reporting on the achievement of milestones takes place in the framework of the annual implementation reports. Any anticipated performance review would require separate reporting on the achievement of the milestones to take place before that date. Moreover, the performance framework and performance reserve are included in the programmes at the level of priority axes, and anticipated performance reviews may therefore result in a situation where some priority axes in one programme receive their reserve while others have still to undergo another performance review in 2019. This would therefore add complexity to the system and increase the burden on Member States and regions without bringing tangible benefits.  Therefore, the Commission doesn’t intend to use its right of initiative to propose amendments to these rules as the potential benefits are significantly outweighed by the associated disadvantages, such as administrative burden, complexity, inconsistency across Member States and programmes, and unplanned changes to the indicative budgetary profile. The additional work for the legislators to process a potential amendment comes in addition to this. Having said that, the Commission stands ready to listen and to discuss specific ideas to improve this instrument with the European Parliament.

There are, of course, no inconsistencies between the two stories. You can understand that. We think – and we want to underline this – that the visibility of our policy should be underlined. With all the complexities maybe we have created a very heavy instrument with this performance reserve, but that does not mean that, in the sense of better regulation and even on the request of a Member State, it can present these milestones on the priority axes at the speed we need. So there should be flexibility and I am happy that the total silence until now on this subject in this House is broken and that you are offering us this dialogue. We will definitely take it. Secondly, this debate is also in the framework of the new proposal by the Commission, and I can say that, if nothing is moving and no flexibility is coming from the performance reserve, I think that we will have serious doubts as to whether we have to be positive on the extent of the proposal that the Commission made in December alone. If you don’t move on the one side and you add full flexibility on the other side, I don’t think that the College is being consistent. So we have to speak. Otherwise it won’t fly.

Some countries have already taken decisions for more than 70% of their expenditure on their allocations to the Regional Development Fund and the Social Fund. However, following Parliament's resolution, adopted almost a year ago, on the building of pillars for a post-2020 European Union cohesion policy, no further information on the unlocking of the reserve of effectiveness. The Commission must, in my view, unlock this reserve by anticipating the effectiveness of implementation verification for programmes which are ahead of the planned deadlines. Among the initiatives in the package to complete the Economic and Monetary Union, recently submitted by the Commission, is the proposal to amend the General Regulation on the Structural Funds for allow Member States to leave in whole or part of the reserve of effectiveness in the Commission's readiness, in order to implement their own structural reform plan, which Europe would pay through a simplified procedure without the need for national co-financing. The Commission has also theorised a bipartition between low-income regions and low-growth regions. It is a mechanism which, however simple in appearance, can generate misunderstandings and misunderstandings, first of all with regard to the very notion of structural reforms which, as understood by the Commission, appears in complete antinomy compared to that of infrastructure. My position is clear, precisely because I am aware of the infrastructure delay that continues to penalise lagging regions — such as the Mezzogiorno d'Italia, which I am privileged to to represent in this House — and the difficulties that daily their productive fabric meets, I am convinced that cohesion policy should pursue, contrary to the Commission's proposed, its original aim: to reduce, that is, the gap between territories, but between all territories, without distinctions between “good” and “bad”, which in someone's intentions should result in different goals for cohesion funds. We must clear the field of the misconception that European funds, which surely can contribute so much, alone can do everything. It would be an unforgivable mistake, not only to accept, but even promote the idea that they can become the reserve for all the needs and emergencies facing Europe.

Commissioner! The implementation reserve funds are a very important tool to encourage Member States to implement projects financed by the European Regional Development Fund and the European Social Fund quickly and efficiently. The rules for the use of this reserve should be clear and Member States should be informed of its commissioning at such a time as to make the most of these measures possible. The Commission should allow Member States to launch a provision for implementation, taking into account the fact that a significant proportion of programmes are implemented in advance. This entails the need to adjust the date of the review of the results concerning the achievement of the indirect objectives on which the mobilisation of these measures depends. In May 2017, the European Parliament unequivocally stated that the time between the conditions and the release of the performance reserve is too long, thereby reducing its effectiveness and efficiency.

We are convinced that it’s very useful for the quality of the funding programmes. It is based on a new focus on results and milestones that have to be achieved. Some – if not all – regions and territories have done their job and are working hard towards the results by putting in place support for energy transition, creating new jobs and continuing to fight poverty and social exclusion. They have done everything the Commission asked of them, and now, Commissioner Hahn, the same Commission wants to take away the money that was put in reserve to honour their efforts? Seriously? Commissioner, the latest proposal from the Commission on the performance reserve has damaged the credibility of the European Union in the regions. For the Verts/ALE Group it is not acceptable to destroy the performance system at the moment, when it is at full speed.

The 5 Star Movement, on structural reforms, is absolutely against all those measures affecting the welfare state, including labour market interventions, while we are open to relative measures, for example, improvement on administrative capacity or combating tax evasion.

When he speaks, he speaks with authority and knowledge and we would be well advised to listen to him. Therefore, I believe it is necessary to call on the Commission to commence the performance review earlier for programmes that are ahead of schedule. In Ireland, for instance, we have established many programmes with ESI funding for 2014—2020. For recovering from the recession in 2008, the Programme for Employability, Inclusion and Learning, for example, has been a fantastic development in providing employment training and educational opportunities. This programmes aims to help one million people integrate into the working world and encourages a continuation of third level education, including those with disabilities and those with financial disadvantages. The programmes implemented aim for sustainable and quality employment. Some examples of these programmes include training for the unemployed and Springboard Plus, which offer free part—time and full—time conversion courses at certificate, degree and postgraduate level. However, in order to keep on track and continue progressing, it is important that performance reviews be delivered. These programmes have been funded by ESI, so I think these reviews should be made earlier than 2019 for the programmes ahead of schedule. The European Regional Development Fund has had a significant impact in decentralising development from main cities and spreading this development into rural parts of the country by developing the Southern and Eastern Regional Operational Programme and the Border, Midland and Western Regional Operational Programme. It is important for these programmes to be reviewed so that their strengths and weaknesses can be established and work done rather than endlessly spending EU funding without knowing if it is actually effective.
