And I would like to thank the shadows because this has been a very rapid process, a fast-track, in order to ensure that we can very quickly have legal certainty in place on what to do when a bank is in deep problems. I think an important point of departure is the fact that in the European Union investments are far too low. Investments are at a pre-crisis level. I think it is important to understand and to see that this in itself means a systemic risk and a risk of financial instability. Because, if investments are too low, competitiveness lags behind and jobs are lost, but we are also lacking the growth we need in order to ensure stability in the economic system and the financial system. And that is why it is important to ensure that banks can be stable and at the same time have the strength and opportunity to finance investments. In the European Union, banks are crucial for this. We have more banks that are crucial for investments than in other economies. Our capital markets are of that kind. That is why it is important that banks can make investments, create markets, can in all ways ensure that we have the investments and the growth that is needed.  This legislation, that we are to adopt today, is about ensuring that when a bank is in deep problems, there will be no discussion that governments or taxpayers shall finance the problems of others. And this is in itself an extremely important signal to markets. First of all, it is a way of ensuring that when you are in trouble, you know what to do. That is why we have this ranking. And that is why we have the Bank Resolution and Recovery Directive (BRRD), because that is how we tell the market that we are going to bail in or do something else with the banks, but not lean on governments. But a second thing with the BRRD which is, for me, extremely important is telling the market – those who invest in a bank, those who own a bank – do not get into the belief that someone else will save you. This in itself is creating a market discipline that is crucial. My aim with the banking package we are now dealing with is to ensure that we introduce total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC). This will mean even higher security and certainty on what to do when resolving a bank but no higher capital burdens beyond that. Because if we go down that route, it will mean less investment and less opportunities for growth. But the legal clarity we achieve with this hierarchy will safeguard depositors, safeguard taxpayers and will make it known among everyone in the market that you take the same risk when you invest in a bank as when you invest in another company. That is how simple it is. I would once again like to thank colleagues for the very rapid process, because it is important that we have this cornerstone in the banking union in place. Now we have some other things to do in order to complete the banking union, the financial market and the banking legislation.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2, "date": "2017-11-30.json", "name": "Jyrki Katainen", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission. – Mr President, I would like to thank the House very much for its efforts to solve this issue.  As Mr Hökmark already said, the basic idea in this legislation is to make the market economy more healthy, to show where the risks lie and also to create a more solid rule base for the problems which may arise, as happens every once in a while in the market economy. But this piece of legislation does not overshoot the regulation. It just clarifies who is responsible, and for what.  This will enable banks to build up buffers that can absorb losses when the bank fails, without jeopardising financial stability, and without burdening taxpayers. Banks will issue debt under the new statutory category available in all EU Member States. The debt will be ranked just below the most senior debt and other senior liabilities, for the purposes of resolution. It will remain part of the senior debt category, but as an unpreferred tier senior debt.  Clear, harmonised rules on the position of bondholders in the bank creditors’ hierarchy in insolvency resolution will facilitate the bail-in being supplied, by providing greater legal certainty and reducing the risk of legal challenges. This measure will give banks clarity so that they can build up buffers to absorb losses and protect taxpayers. It is also a key, and most cost-effective, way to comply with the global standard on total loss absorbing capacity, which requires global systemically important banks to build up a minimum level of buffers to be used in resolution. Our ambition is to allow banks and investors to take full advantage of the opportunities of our single market to issue and buy debt, through harmonised solutions.  Once again I would like to thank Parliament, especially Mr Roberto Gualtieri and, of course, Mr Hökmark, as rapporteur, and all the shadow rapporteurs for this file. This was one important piece of the entire banking package. We still have a lot of work to do to finalise the whole banking package and we have to keep working together in a fast and comprehensive way.

Therefore, we must not fail to point this out when we have the opportunity. The truth is that this legislative proposal, which reviews the hierarchy of creditors in the event of resolution, achieved this almost miracle: not only was it adopted in an accelerated procedure, but it managed to gather a broad consensus, both in this Parliament and in the dialogue we established with the Council and with the Commission. I want to thank the rapporteur, my colleague Gunnar Hökmark, but also the rapporteurs - shadow of the other political groups, for the excellent work we had the opportunity to do together. This legislative proposal is important and necessary. It aims to improve the rules of the so-called bail-in, the internal bailout of banks at risk of bankruptcy, which were created to protect taxpayers' money. These rules need to be clear. We have changed the creditors 'hierarchy to create a new category of senior non-privileged debt, which increases the banks' ability to absorb losses and achieve the necessary recapitalization. I must say that the socialist group is particularly satisfied with the fact that the contractual maturity of the new class of senior non-privileged debt has been fixed at least one year, with the fact that grandfathering has been established, that is, the new criteria for eligibility may apply to previously issued debt instruments. It was also clear that the debt issued by banks under the previous national legislation, but which complies with the requirements now set, may occupy the same position in the creditors hierarchy as the new category of debt now created. Finally, and very importantly, it has been clarified that nothing in this directive affects the possibility for Member States to give increased protection to deposits. I therefore think that we have a good solution and we hope that it can be continued in the revision of the DRRB Directive.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 4, "date": "2017-11-30.json", "name": "Brian HAYES", "mepid": "118658", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, I would like to firstly congratulate Gunnar Hökmark for this negotiation, which was brought about in the informal trilogue process but also as part of the banking package. I think it is important that the agreement that has been obtained across the House sends a strong message in terms of how we are going to deal with it, were a crisis to emerge again. It is absolutely clear, when one looks back on the financial crisis 2008-2009-2010 that we did not have the architecture, we did not have the rules, we did not have the instruments as a European Union to respond to that particular crisis.  Coming from a country that went through an appalling banking crisis, where the Irish taxpayers had to bail out the Irish banking system to such a huge level, for us it is crucially important that we moved to a bail-in process. What I very much welcome about this particular instrument is that there is now clarity on the question on non-preferred debt but also on the categorisation of that debt and how that is to work. Had we had that clarity at the time, as part of a bail-in regime, we would not have found the difficulties that were there for our economy – but other economies as well – going through that crisis.  I think it is crucially important that this instrument is now in place, that there is agreement from the Commission, the Council and Parliament on this matter. It is part of the banking package which now seeks to intensify further banking union, which has to be at the heart of all that we are trying to achieve as a modern economic bloc within the world and having these rules with such clarity allows us to do that.

We must strengthen this framework to avoid, as the rapporteur has said, that taxpayers' money is used again to massively bail out the banks. I do not want to recall the data, for example, that in my country the Bank of Spain has recently given: that the Spanish bank bailout cost the Spanish Treasury 60 billion euros, which is practically 6% of GDP. We are concerned, however, because this framework currently has implementation difficulties, and not only because of what has happened recently with the Venetian banks, which, in the end, as they did not want to go to the resolution and went to the liquidation through national law, have ended up costing the Italian taxpayer 5 billion euros. Or there is also the case of Banco Popular. As we saw, at the moment the holes in the application of the DRRB are very large: Mrs. Koenig recognized us, for example, that in the case of Banco Popular, when she asked for the list of funds and assets available to operate the dance- in, because that list was not there, it did not exist, it was not available. And that is a problem. Therefore, progress must be made in strengthening the DRRB, in which this Parliament is united in defending its respect and, obviously, what we decided with today's package is a step forward, because it will allow banks to improve their loss absorbing capacity without recourse to public money.

We are trying to establish, or what we are trying to work on, is the principle that if you take risk, you cannot shift the cost somewhere else. Bankers take risk; they cannot just catch a return but they need also to carry the cost. That does indeed mean that we aim for a bail-in and not for a bailout, most certainly not by taxpayers. That is a principle, that is clear, but that requires work and I am very pleased to see this proposal and the good work.

Therefore, we had to organize the rise of a market allowing players to be ready in order to have the quality of debt allowing them to meet these obligations. In fact, several member states had launched their own reform in anticipation of the European response, and the banking sector, since the agreement at the Financial Stability Board (FSB) at the end of 2015, was affected by the TLAC requirement. The markets themselves - as evidenced by the large volumes of TLAC-eligible debt successfully issued by banks - reacted and anticipated the effects of this reform. The idea is to allow banks to build up subordinated debt cushions improving their resolvability, without unduly constraining their financing costs.

Sometimes when discussing these kinds of issues, people feel that it does not make sense that banks take too much risk, and that is why banks are bad and they want to fail. This is not the case. Banks usually do not want to fail on purpose, but we have to understand that banking is just like any business. It may fail, for various reasons, and that is why we have to have an orderly manner to solve these banking problems.  The taxpayers’ role is also very critical here. Taxpayers have sold banks, i.e. investors in the banks, shareholders of the banks, who are usually normal European citizens. There are also sometimes other businesses which have invested in the banks so we have to make sure that the European market economy is functioning well and it has a solid rule base, and even if we are talking about the banking sector, it does not mean that taxpayers should have a greater responsibility to savers, owners, investors or creditors of the banks as they have responsibility in other sectors of business.

We are working hard to make sure that no one is left behind.  People with disabilities face a much higher risk of social exclusion than the greater population. Across the European Union, the employment rate for people with a disability is around 48%, only 27.8% have completed tertiary education, and one in three people with a disability is at risk of poverty. This is a situation we cannot accept; the gaps are too big.  On 17 November, the Commission, the Parliament and the Council proclaimed the European Pillar of Social Rights. It represents a powerful joint commitment to everyone’s rights, including people with disability, to equal treatment and opportunities.  The Pillar highlights the right to income support, which ensures that people can live in dignity, to services that enable people to participate in the labour market and in society, and to a work environment that is adapted to people’s needs. The Pillar will also contribute to the implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Our work-life balance package is a concrete example. It will help informal carers, often women, to better balance professional and care responsibilities.  The European Commission remains firmly committed to the UN Convention and to its human rights approach to disability. In February 2017, the Commission published a detailed progress report under the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020, assessing progress in its eight areas up to 2016. I am very grateful – and glad, of course – to the Parliament for coordinating such a comprehensive resolution in response to it, and I want to congratulate, in particular, the rapporteur, Ms Stevens.  While our progress report confirms many of your concerns with regard to the situation of people with disabilities in the European Union, it has also shown areas where European action has made a difference. Promoting accessibility in all policy areas is certainly one of them. We can be proud of our achievements with the Web Accessability Directive, with the Marrakech Treaty and in the field of transport and telecoms. We must now see that these instruments are fully implemented.  After two years, it is now high time to take another leap forward with the adoption of my proposal for a European Accessibility Act. Parliament has already adopted its mandate, and I remain confident the Council will also reach a general approach next Thursday. Accessibility and non-discrimination are important building blocks for independent living. Adequate support services are certainly another. European funds offer significant resources to developing the community—based care and services that are essential for independent living. They may not be used for building or renovating residential institutions. The right to affordable long-term care services of good quality, in particular home care and community-based services, is also emphasised in the European Pillar of Social Rights. In this regard, I take good note of your call to ensure that European funds must also adhere, over the next programing period, to the UN Convention and should continue to foster deinstitutionalisation as a matter of priority.  I would also like to mention the work done under the Estonian Presidency on this topic, which should lead the Member States next week to adopt the Joint Council Conclusions on enhancing community-based support and care for independent living.  The last area I would like to mention is free movement. The Cross-border Healthcare Directive contributes to breaking down barriers to the free movement of all European citizens, including people with a disability. The same counts for my proposal to clarify social security coordination applying to long-term care benefits.  Next year, the Commission will also evaluate the pilot project on a European visibility card, which is now up and running in eight Member States. I have noticed that this initiative raises interest and expectations and I am grateful for the support you express. Lastly, I want to say that today’s discussion and your resolution will also enrich our reflection on the shape of future EU disability policies. The Commission is committed to taking the lead in this process and involving all actors, in particular people with disabilities and their representative organisations.

I would like to say a huge thank you to all the shadow rapporteurs and the secretariat for joining me to meet this deadline. It is so important that we continue to think about limitations and keep inclusion on the political agenda. After all, people with disabilities are not the sexiest item on the agenda and very few politicians like to talk about it. And this while one in six people has a disability to some extent. That equates to 80 million Europeans! Can we really afford to continue to ignore this large group of European citizens? I am indeed talking about citizens, because that is what they are: European citizens. So they should be able to enjoy the same rights as everyone else. The right and the freedom to go to school, work, eat out, go to the theater or the cinema. The right to travel abroad and enjoy their free time with family and friends. People with disabilities should not be second-class citizens because of their disability. Mr President, I would like to ask everyone to please keep in mind that not every person with a disability is as fortunate as I am. They are not always able to tap into their full potential, take the job that they want, live where and how they want or even marry who they want. The EU is effectively one of the most advanced and richest regions on the planet, yet it is not inclusive enough. We unfortunately still manage to exclude so many of our citizens on a regular basis. The result is that we are losing out on valuable skills and potential labor force in the process, while they are more than ready and willing to contribute to our society when given the opportunity. Let's not forget that money is lost due to inaccessible infrastructures, goods and services.Therefore, the European Disability Strategy 2010-2020 is an essential tool in ensuring all our citizens are able to form an integral part of our society and contribute to our society.We need a post-2020 strategy to follow up and it needs to be both bold and effective, because if we don't get it right who will?It is time for action.Let us all work together to make the European Union more inclusive.", "language": "en", "original_language": "nl", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 30, "date": "2017-11-30.json", "name": "Rosa ESTARÀS FERRAGUT", "mepid": "96811", "text": "Rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality. - Mr President, first to thank Helga Stevens and also to the Commissioner for her involvement in this European Strategy that is now in force, and that we have to work on the next one now.

I want to point out four main things. First of all, I believe that adequate social support for people with disabilities is very much needed, and states must provide social support and provide the necessary social services to their citizens with disabilities. Their additional needs and, in most cases, unfortunately, low and low-quality employment simply dictate such a need. States must guarantee at least a minimum income for people with disabilities and their families, as, unfortunately, such support is often the only source of livelihood for them. The basic needs of people with disabilities often lead to significant additional costs compared to people without disabilities, i. y. hiring assistants, additional adaptation of the environment, additional necessary equipment, medicines and many other things. I would also like to draw attention to the employment of people with disabilities. I think no one doubts that people with disabilities want to live an independent, full life and want to work, but usually cannot do so because of their disability and because the labor market is not ready to accept them. We must therefore take this very seriously so that the labor market is accessible to people with disabilities. I also want to point out accessibility. Indeed, it is necessary to adopt and have an accessibility act, because access to public services is very important both for our citizens with disabilities and for the elderly, who often also have temporary restrictions on movement. Public transport, health care, education and social services must be accessible, affordable and of high quality.

In fact, each of us experiences disabilities to a greater or lesser extent, although the modern world is organized by and for non-disabled people. It would be so beautiful and noble if the world of the disabled and the world of healthy people stood on one solid foundation and if they mutually enrich and complement each other. That in this one world we would act to alleviate dysfunctions and at the same time prepare disabled people for active life in the natural environment. After all, disability never means disability. A disabled person is above all a person and is never a cripple, handicapped, or underdeveloped. Always and everywhere, we are to first see a person, a man, then possibly his cart.

The existing provisions on broadly understood human, civil and political, social, economic and cultural rights apply equally to women and men, girls and boys.

Today we are discussing the implementation of the Disability Strategy in light of the ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD). Today Parliament gives its perspective on progress to date so that the UN CRPD you can have real meaning for real persons with disabilities, in real time. By that I mean today, now. Life is not a dress rehearsal for any of us and the same is true for persons with disabilities. When we speak about accessibility it must mean that services are accessible, that public spaces are accessible, that public transport is accessible, that technology is accessible, and so on. Otherwise, we are saying to people with disabilities: we will improve accessibility in the future, we will improve accessibility when we have money, when we have time, when we have dealt with all the other urgent issues that need to be dealt with. But the truth is, accessibility is an urgent issue and it needs to be treated as such. This report contains many important recommendations, but because of time constraints I can only mention one or two. To me, the first and most important is that while we have the UN CRPD, the Disability Strategy, the Marrakech Treaty and, hopefully, soon the Accessibility Act, as the Commissioner herself pointed out this morning, we have to ensure full implementation. Other areas that I consider important include: reasonable accommodation; the mainstreaming of UN CRPD in all our legislation and then ensuring compliance with that legislation; and the guarantee that all EU funding programmes will be fully accessible. We need to eliminate the medical model of disability and promote a rights-based model. Finally, we must ensure independent living for persons with disabilities.

In schools, architectural barriers are unfortunately the condition that prevents many children from accessing their classrooms and sharing the time of study and even extra-curricular moments with their classmates.

Access to work and the ugly, obscene condition in which many workers with disabilities find themselves, suffering discrimination and unfair dismissals, are unfortunately still an objective fact, not to mention the concept of deinstitutionalisation that in my country, today, it seems not only a chimera but something completely unknown, that is the possibility of being able to decide how to live one's condition of disability. Unfortunately, this simply shows us that we are not yet able to think of an inclusive society, where disability is simply a common and universally accepted condition, seen as a resource and a wealth.

Even the websites of the EU institutions do not all have the best level of accessibility. Yes, the report is right: barrier-free access to the labor market begins with adequate education. Member States must first of all take action without delay to train teachers accordingly. At the same time, it is important to consistently convey and implement accessibility and to ensure further training during job interviews and the necessary adjustments in the workplace, but also in the means of transport. It is also about rehabilitation and reintegration into the labor market. After all, unemployment among people with disabilities is significantly higher than those without. So let's start now!

Firstly, it is indeed high time that the Council unblocked the negotiation on the European Disability Act, and I do hope this will be the case next week. This must be a strong act because, besides persons with disabilities, it will also need to cover people with functional limitations. The second thing I want to stress is that in the view of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats of the European Parliament, disability benefit should not be made conditional upon being employed or not. As it stands, there are too many cases where disabled people cannot afford to take a job because it will actually make their financial situation worse.

It is our duty, of course, to work together for the dignity and well-being of all parts of society, even the most vulnerable, and of course people with disabilities, because in the European Union every sixth individual over the age of 15 lives with a certain disability. People with disabilities still point out that many international documents written on the rights of people with disabilities are not provided in practice, especially the social situation of people with disabilities, poverty and the unemployment rate. Therefore, of course, it is to be welcomed that a lot of attention is paid to employment in this document as well. This is, of course, one of the main means of fully integrating people with disabilities into society. Of course, there is a huge, huge amount of room for improvement in virtually every Member State.

As the Social Democrats' shadow rapporteur on the European Accessibility Act, I would therefore like to emphasize that accessibility is one of the key issues. Accessibility of common services and goods, but also of the built environment can significantly improve the quality of life not only for people with disabilities, but also, for example, senior citizens and contribute to their full participation in society. I am pleased that Parliament has voted in favor of the act, and I hope that it will be adopted immediately by the representatives of the Member States in the Council, as this report also calls for. It is also essential to promote inclusive and active access to the labor market and, in particular, to tailor vulnerable groups from the outset in a non-discriminatory manner.

Unfortunately, the decisions of this Parliament, which attacked the Polish social society at the previous session, and I would like to emphasize the social legislative initiative concerning the right to be born of disabled children, are part of a similar policy.

This cost the jobs and livelihood of most of the around 2 000 persons with disabilities working in sheltered employment and the existence of 740 employment and work services for persons with disabilities.

Many Member States recognize this, but let's be honest: when we look at the United States, we must also dare to put our hands in our own bosom and recognize that we are lagging behind enormously. In the United States, people with disabilities can safely go to school, take up a job, with support they can enter a store or the bank. They can go to the cinema, to a museum, to a sports stadium; the list is endless. They can do that without barriers. But when we look at Europe, sometimes the situation is crying with the cap. Many people can only dream of it here. Look at Brussels, at Antwerp, look at Paris, look at Berlin: not accessible! Why the backlog here compared to the United States? I think we need to be more ambitious. People with disabilities are still faced with many obstacles in Europe. In the United States these have long been eliminated. Why is this not possible here yet? Why are those barriers still there?

The existence of architectural barriers in schools is a condition that prevents many children from accessing their classrooms, precluding them from being able to study with their classmates. To date, professional figures able to accompany children, in addition to not being regulated, are very often not even professionally suited to the needs of disabled children. Access to work and the shameful conditions in which many workers with disabilities, victims of discrimination and unjust dismissals find themselves, are still a sad reality, not to mention the concept of deinstitutionalisation, or the possibility of being able to decide how to dispose of one's own condition of disability, a concept still unknown in my part.

Only 48% of persons with disabilities are actively involved in the labour market and only 28% have finished higher education. The Members of the European Parliament call upon the EU co-legislators to approve the European accessibility act without further delay as a key part of the European Disability Strategy. Inaccessibility causes exclusion from various areas, including culture or transport, and thus limits the possibilities of social engagement. In order to effectively fight segregation in education, participation in the EU programmes, such as Erasmus+ or the Youth Guarantee, should be granted. Furthermore, I call on the Commission to encourage the uninvolved Member States to join the EU Disability Card project, which secures equal access to benefits for people with disabilities across the EU.

The political environment is framed by the power struggle between the Houthi movement religious group and the al-Hadi Government. The situation is having dire consequences on the Yemeni people, and we must not ignore this. Between a desperate security and economic situation, which includes widespread corruption and severe food and water shortages, the Yemeni citizens are at breaking point.
