Mr President, thank you, Commissioner, for being here, we feel a little less alone and it warms the soul a little in this morning. First of all, I would like to thank, since they are here, the representatives of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, all those who have worked with me, and in particular Mr Juregui, who has worked not only in this report, but also in the context of his report. This report on differentiated integration is a follow-up to the Commission's proposal, namely the famous five scenarios that President Juncker had come to present here. This report is part of the Commission's third proposal, which is obviously in the favour of the European Parliament, namely a Europe that is progressing and a Europe that allows those who want to move forward to be able to move forward. It is with this in spirit that we present this report. We are in a moment - I do not need to stress this issue - very particular for the European Union. There is Brexit, there is the difficulty of being heard by citizens, but above all there is the danger of entering a multi-speed Europe: a Europe of first class for some, a Europe of second or even third class for others. We have to keep our unity, that's the challenge we're trying to meet together. The report opens up a number of avenues. It opens up avenues within the treaty and makes proposals for the future. Within the Treaty, we insist - and Parliament really insists very strongly - that the 'bridge' clause be implemented and used to move away from the logic of unanimity that blocks decisions. We also want the opt out to end. The primary law must be the same for everyone and, if new entrants want to come, either they accept the full primary right or we go through a logic of partnership agreements. It is very important to ensure that primary law is the same for all countries, that there are no different levels of country with regard to primary law. This is very important to us. We also hope that the European Union can put this fundamental values and rights in force very clearly and that we do not have the capacity, in a differentiated Europe, to back down on these fundamental rights. Apart from that, I will end with the evolutions we can have. We really want to put in place within the European Union a pillar of social, environmental and economic rights, which would ensure that this European Union has a real basis and that it can move forward on these conditions. That is the direction we want overall. Mr President, I would stress that we must ensure that this Europe moves forward with one voice and that we do not have a multi-speed, multi-class Europe, but that those who want to move forward can do so.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 2, "date": "2019-01-17.json", "name": "Notis MARIAS", "mepid": "125069", "text": "   Mr President, first of all, the subject we are discussing is particularly interesting, but of course we do not have the necessary involvement. Integration, in any case, is differentiated at European Union level, because we have Schengen, in which specific Member States participate, or the euro area. Therefore, it is something that we know about. Secondly, we have some states that have taken exceptions with specific protocols at the level of primary Community law, such as Denmark which is excluded from specific regulations, or also Ireland. I would therefore say that the regulation for countries wishing to move forward is again institutionally envisaged as differentiated integration and is therefore something that now depends politically on which countries should use and whether they want to use this issue to move forward with cooperation on social or environmental issues. I would say, however, that we must also look at this: some countries, because of particular problems, such as Greece, which has been in a memorandum all these years, cannot easily participate on an equal footing with the others. That is why we may have to provide within the Treaty for certain exceptions for countries that have fallen behind, a special liability regime for a period of time in order to be able to relieve these countries and follow the integration process along the way.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ECR", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 3, "date": "2019-01-17.json", "name": "Jo LEINEN", "mepid": "4262", "text": "   Mr President, differentiated integration is a vague, confusing and therefore difficult term by which certain States of the European Union and circles of the European Union are trying to disguise a dangerous objective they have set for the future of Europe.

As Mr Durand noted, there are different views as to what differentiated integration means and whether it is a good thing or not. Whereas, in some Member States, it is perceived as a positive step towards more integration, other Member States consider it divisive.  The Commission in its White Paper on the future of the EU presented, as you know, five possible scenarios for discussion. Scenario three was an option for some to go further, creating a positive drive towards deeper integration whilst remaining open and inclusive to all who may wish to join. We have seen over the years how this dynamic can help address emerging challenges and drive integration. The euro, now in its 20th year, the EMU and Schengen are examples, and over the years we have seen that more and more Member States have been inspired and have wanted to join such cooperation. I hope and trust that the same will be the case for the permanent structured cooperation (PESCO) since Europeans, now more than ever, need to stand strong in the face of a changed international order. There are also examples in the justice area, like the creation of the European Public Prosecutor’s Office, where in 2017, 20 Member States out of 25 Member States – because three had opted out – agreed to engage in enhanced cooperation to establish this key factor to fight crimes against the EU budget. Since then, two more Member States have joined and I am sure that others will eventually follow.  But differentiated integration is only ever the second best. The normal Community method and standard legislative procedure are still the best way to guarantee the integrity and wellbeing of the Union as a whole. It must also remain open to all who wish to join. That is also why the Commission started, last year, and is now pursuing a debate about more efficient and democratic decision-making in specific policy areas by making use of the passerelle clauses foreseen by the existing EU treaties to allow the use of qualified majority voting in areas such as EU foreign policy, EU tax policy or environment.  This will avoid blockages and the need for recourse to enhanced cooperation where unanimity is not forthcoming in these areas and where EU action is close to citizens’ wishes. The Commission looks forward to your support in this.", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 7, "date": "2019-01-17.json", "name": "Ioan Mircea PAŞCU", "mepid": "33984", "text": "  This item on the agenda has been closed.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I would like to thank the commissioner for her excellent work and for the work she has done. Citizens expect decisions and, above all, laws to be comprehensible and comprehensible, which means that the whole decision-making process is transparent. That is what they expect at home in our nation states, and they expect it all the more from the European Union, because Brussels is inevitably further and further away from the people. That is why we also need more transparency at European level than perhaps at national level. We have a situation where this Parliament is an open house. Everything we do can be understood. Our meetings are streamed on the web, our committee meetings are open, our preparatory meetings are open. So we are one of the most transparent parliaments in the world, and we can be proud of that. This is not the case with the other legislative body, the Council of Ministers of the 28 Member States. The Council of Ministers is still a black box, and much is happening behind closed doors. This has improved somewhat, but it is far from the standard we are asking for. And it must be demanded that the second chamber, the Council of Ministers, also have full transparency, not only in the votes on legislation, but also – and this is the point – with the 150 preparatory groups that exist. They are, after all, completely non-transparent. It was a thankful task for the Ombudsmen to take up this issue, and she has, of course, made a report to which we refer. We here in Parliament are also calling for full transparency in the second legislative body, in the Council of Ministers. It should really meet in public, and it should also make the preparatory meetings public. This goes hand in hand with another practice: the secrecy of documents. Most of the documents from the Council have the stamp 'Limité', that is, limited, although nothing is limited in Brussels. We know that every document reaches the public light somewhere; it is therefore a rather antiquated construction. And the Council of Ministers should sort much more carefully what really needs secrecy and what is not actually secret, but is also communicated to the public. Transparency in the Council of Ministers is also necessary because ministers often come from their national capitals, decide something in Brussels and then tell something completely different at home. And they can do that, because no one can understand how they voted. It is also very difficult for us MEPs and for our colleagues in the national parliaments to say how the national government voted. They can tell all sorts of stories that you can believe or not. And that is why, I believe, transparency in the Council of Ministers is also a means of countering conspiracy theories and insinuations. We have so many populists and so many nationalists who like to put any stories into the world. I believe that the time has come to set a good example through transparency and to set us as an example of good governance for the Member States themselves, but also for others in the world. I would therefore like to thank my colleague, Mrs Toom, and all those who have worked to ensure that we vote on this report here today. I hope that we will get a large majority in plenary at 12 noon.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 10, "date": "2019-01-17.json", "name": "Caterina CHINNICI", "mepid": "124861", "text": "  Rapporteur. – Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the Ombudsman for her work. Almost two years ago, she opened the inquiry on transparency in the Council. She concluded that the current practice in the Council constituted maladministration, especially when it comes to the failure of the Council to register the positions of Member States in the preparatory bodies.  The recommendations she made were very reasonable, but the Council did not answer. Can you imagine? They just did not answer her letter. Therefore, she turned to Parliament to ask for support. During our first meeting on the issue, the Austrian Presidency promised to address the problem, or at least to provide an explanation. But now the Austrian Presidency is over and they never answered either. Hopefully the Romanian Presidency will be different.  Transparency in the Council has been a topic of discussion for 25 years, yet not many things have changed. The small victories in this area, such as access to documents and public deliberations, were pushed for by Parliament and the Ombudsman. This underlines our role in this House as a catalyst for change. While the Council still holds on to the idea that their work is pure diplomacy, the role of the institutions has changed over time. The Council and the Parliament are co—legislators now. Therefore, their practices should be conducted in a similar way. The Parliament has become more transparent. All committee meetings, as Jo Leinen mentioned just now, are open and all reports, minutes and amendments are available. The positions of absolutely each and every Member are clear. It is therefore a logical step that the same should apply to the Council, and the Coreper meetings in particular. It says clearly in the Treaties that decisions should be taken as close to the citizens as possible and, especially now during these turbulent Brexit times, we have to be open and we have to be as close to people as possible. This means that all institutions have the obligation to be open and transparent. It’s crucial for accountability. There is an imbalance between the co—legislators as, when the public is unhappy about an outcome, Member States can easily point their finger at Parliament because our decisions are known, but the public does not see that often the outcome is the result of a struggle between the Parliament and the Council. Perhaps a Member State has a very strong position, yet they blame Brussels. This is problematic for Parliament and also for the media and even national parliaments, who are informed too late about the decisions of their governments in the Council, if at all. Sometimes they are just not informed.  These are the points we have focused on in this report. I would like to thank Jo Leinen for his good cooperation in the committee.

The Commission has however always been committed to enhancing the transparency of the legislative process in general, which is a shared responsibility. The Commission came to office with a commitment to enhance transparency. For example, Commissioners, their cabinets and directors-general only meet with interest representatives who are in the transparency register. We have proposed to extend this principle the Parliament and Council and we still hope that the three institutions will all agree on this in order to make the transparency register mandatory for lobbyists. We are also publishing information on these meetings and on Commissioners’ mission expenses. We have adopted new rules on Commission expert groups with stronger transparency requirements and we have provided unprecedented levels of access to information on ongoing trade negotiations and also during the Brexit negotiations. Based on the Commission’s proposal, this Parliament and the Council agreed with us on new interinstitutional agreement on better law-making which includes a joint commitment to enhance the transparency of legislative procedures, including as appropriate trilateral negotiations and to improve communication to the public. As your report notes, work is continuing between the services of the three institutions in developing the joint legislative portal, which we together committed to set up. It will be a user-friendly way for non-specialists to access information about ongoing legislative proceedings.

Yesterday, in the Internet newspaper Azeri Daily, I read an article in which I and the colleagues who worked on this resolution are accused of being involved in a large-scale plot to prepare a coup against the Government of Azerbaijan. I recommend that the journalists of this newspaper talk to us before they write anything like this. I also recommend, for example, to my elected colleagues from Azerbaijan in the EuroNest parliamentary assembly to talk to me. That is what I tried to do before we launched this resolution. Unfortunately, I did not succeed. My former colleague at EuroNest, Fuad Muradov, is now a minister in the government of Azerbaijan, and he knows very well that my concern in my work at EuroNest has always been to ensure good relations, reliable relations, especially between us MEPs. Why have we really put this urgency on the agenda? We are concerned about the fate of Mehman Hüseynov. Mehman Hüseynov has been on hunger strike since December last year, because he is threatened with being tried again before the end of his sentence, to which he was sentenced for two years, and now fears that he will be sentenced to five to seven more years before the end of his first prison sentence. This situation is not a one-off situation, but the Civil Society Forum in EuroNest has informed us that this pattern is now repeating itself for the fifth time. And this and our concerns for the welfare of Mehman Hüseynov have led us to put this urgency on the agenda. We appeal to the Azerbaijani Government with all the groups in this House: release Mehman Hüseynov! We appeal to the judges not to reopen such a staged case against him. Mehman has made a living investigating corruption in the Council of Europe. That is why he is now in prison. And he has not only dealt with problems in Azerbaijan, but also with problems of corrupt politicians, for example in Germany and Italy.

The message of the despot is clear: no one must dare to publicly highlight the extensive corruption and abuses by Azerbaijan’s rulers and officials.  The case of Mehman Huseynov is emblematic. The journalist and blogger has been repeatedly harassed by the police for years, tortured and jailed on fabricated charges. In addition, the new charges are clearly politically motivated. They are tailored to further silence a prominent human rights voice. As a matter of fact, instead of investigating the alleged mistreatment suffered by Mr Huseynov, he was accused of defamation of the same officials that tormented him. After all, what would you expect from a country that ranks 163rd out of 180 countries on the World Press Freedom Index? What do you expect from a country where independent journalists and bloggers are thrown in prison if they do not bend to harassment bribes, beatings and blackmail? The European Union is now negotiating a new agreement with Azerbaijan which should be based on the rule of law, human rights, good governance and democratic reforms. I believe this principle should not remain only on paper. The future agreement of Parliament to such an Act should not be given unless the situation changes radically.  Azerbaijan’s crackdown on dissidents must end immediately and the unconditional release of political prisoners must be a priority in EU—Azerbaijan relations. This is why I call on the Commission to use all its influence and pressure to ensure the Azerbaijani authorities drop the charges and release Mr Huseynov unconditionally, along with the ten other journalists jailed.

This is the situation we're talking about here. This is the situation of Mehman Heseynov, who serves a two-year sentence and faces new charges, so he may be imprisoned for another seven years. Prior to his arrest, in 2017, Heseynov launched the \"Find Corrupt Officials\" campaign, in which he exposed the corruption committed by Azerbaijan's ruling elite. This elite mounted a secret plot to pay European figures, buy luxury goods and launder money. According to the allegations, Azerbaijan's political dome, accused of systematic human rights abuses, widespread corruption and election-tailedness, bought European politicians and journalists to curb criticism of the president, silence human rights violations and promote a positive image of the country. It's what's called caviar diplomaphy. One of these European authorities was Pedro Agramunt, who had to resign from his post as President of the Council of Europe and as a member of his Parliamentary Assembly following this and other scandals. But because corruption seems to also be endemic in his party—the PP—he continues to serve as a senator even today in Spain. Corruption also permea in large natural resource extraction projects, but Azerbaijan is crucial as a source of resources for Europe in its longing to seek an alternative to Russia. That is why we have not spoken about this either in this Resolution.  Azerbaijan is the source of the South Caucasus pipeline and the BTC pipeline, 1,700 km of pipe carrying oil to the West. It was, by the way, the corruption of the BTC, promoted by British Petroleum ten years ago, that fueled the image-washing campaign in the Council of Europe that we were talking about earlier. We demand that any European participation in the South Caucasus corridor be cancelled. That the negotiations of the Association Agreement be suspended, since there is no willingness to respect the freedom of expression, association and assembly of its citizens. We recall that a few months ago this House approved the condition of the Association Agreement on the release of political prisoners, on the opening up of the civil society workspace. We're still waiting. We requested, as we did in 2017, an investigation by the competent authorities in the fight against fraud and money laundering of the so-called 'caviar diplomafia'. And of course, we urge the Spanish authorities to use all the mechanisms at their disposal to investigate the allegations against Senator Pedro Agramunt and force him to resign his senate seat.

Human rights defenders and activists, such as Mehman Huseynov who are shedding light on corruption are being harassed, unlawfully detained and tortured. And although this crackdown on human rights, democracy and civil society is systematic, the European Commission signed a partnership agreement with Azerbaijan this summer. I think we have to question the issue of conditionality and how we can best use it now. Certainly any partnership agreement with any country cannot become a reason to, or an excuse to, avoid addressing the human rights violations in the strongest possible terms. In fact, and many colleagues have mentioned this, Azerbaijan is ranked 163rd among 180 countries in 2008 on the World Press Freedom Index. That is a shockingly low ranking and it is confirmed by the fact that 10 journalists are currently imprisoned, but there’s also a number of websites and blogs that are blocked in the country. In fact some of the country’s brightest minds have already left, because their freedom and safety was jeopardised and their families were intimidated. This is the kind of thing we previously saw with the cowardly leaking of videos and the fining of Khadija Ismayilova of EUR 23 000, which is almost 10 times the annual per capita income of the country, and shows the extent of pressure and the diversity of pressure on press and journalists, but also on opposition figures, civil society leaders and others. The overall situation concerning human rights and freedom is very dire: imprisonment, harassment, intimidation and fines. These are in direct violation of Azerbaijan’s obligations stemming from its signing of the European Convention of Human Rights and also the rulings of the European Court of Human Rights. So as we look to a new agreement between the EU and Azerbaijan, it is important that we confirm our commitment to the conditionality of this partnership agreement, depending on democratic reforms, respect for the rule of law, good governance and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. They must be at the core of the agreement and we should not brush over them. There are also conditions before the consent of this House can be given at a later stage. So in the meantime we should a look to a renewed partnership agreement and as these human rights defenders are being systematically harassed, we expect nothing less than the European Commission and the High Representative/Vice-President, Ms Mogherini to condemn the human rights violations in Azerbaijan in the strongest possible terms, and to join us in calling for the release of journalists, opposition figures and political prisoners alike.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hr", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 26, "date": "2019-01-17.json", "name": "Jaromír ŠTĚTINA", "mepid": "124702", "text": "  author. – Mr President, when we talk about human rights and the rule of law being the basis of our action, and our action towards third countries, namely through the agreements that we have negotiated – that we are negotiating with Azerbaijan – it’s not rhetoric.

It’s not just perfunctory and the case of Azerbaijan is a scandal, what has been going on and, as the case of Mehman Huseynov demonstrates – but we could mention many other activists such as Khadija Ismayilova, Ilgar Mammadov and Afgan Mukhtarli, who was kidnapped in Georgia and brought to Azerbaijan to be tortured in jail.

As I am the shadow rapporteur of the European People's Party for the Azerbaijan report and now the EPP negotiator for this resolution, I consider that this resolution underlines the importance of the issue of bilateral relations between the European Union and Azerbaijan.  We need to attach great importance to the new Partnership Agreement between the European Union and Azerbaijan, and respect for the rule of law, human rights and fundamental freedoms must be at the heart of the new agreement.  Mehmet Huseynov is an anti-corruption blogger and director of the Institute for Freedom and Security, sentenced to two years in prison for publicly complaining about his experience with police and poor treatment and torture in law enforcement after he criticised public officials by releasing data on their undeclared wealth. Two months before his release, for allegedly assaulting a prison guard, he is facing an extension of his sentence to an additional 5 to 7 years. The resolution calls for the immediate release of Mr. Huseynov and the provision of professional medical assistance, stressing the importance of democratizing society and protecting human rights. The aim is to send a message that the European Union does not intend to sever ties and co-operation with Azerbaijan, but aims, as a show of support, to help find solutions and models in achieving the transformation of Azerbaijan into a democratic and tolerant society.  The European Union is currently the only one with the authority to help the country strengthen these rights through dialogue. I hereby call for the release of all prisoners of conscience. Europe must stick to the principle on which it is founded, which is freedom of thought and speech in the countries with which it cooperates. In particular, I do not list Azerbaijan here, but all third countries with which Europe cooperates without selectively applying the same principles, both by the European Union and this Parliament. This right, which is the basis of the declaration of human rights, must not be used selectively. This resolution is good in that it also warns about Azerbaijan's position in freedom of expression, which, unfortunately, is the 163rd country out of 183 countries. Tragic. The cases of using funds to buy influence in politicians, journalists and those who can create public opinion in Europe and in political decision-making power centres with their former political connections, this is worrying. It's got to stop. I expect urgent assistance to Huseynov, his release and adequate medical attention. The release, too, of all political prisoners and prisoners of conscience because it is inadmissible in the 21st century. Friendships with partner countries must be built on mutual values. Ours are: protecting the weakest and freedom of speech. That, Mr. Chairman and Esteemed Commissioner, is not traded with that. Rights are not traded, the protection of the weakest must be the cornerstone of European foreign policy and the basis on which we will build ties with all third countries, regardless of what area they come from. That's what we have to stand for in this Parliament and I will fight for that as long as I am an MP.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 28, "date": "2019-01-17.json", "name": "Sajjad KARIM", "mepid": "28481", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, I strongly demand the release of Mehman Hüsejnov, who is on hunger strike against lawlessness in Azerbaijan.

Baku's sanctions against critics of the regime are not limited to the territory of their own country. I draw attention to the expansion of the azerbaijani regime's influence beyond its borders. The export of influence and coercion takes place in different ways. For example, by kidnapping, as in the case of Muchtarlí. Another way of persecuting opponents of the regime is to abuse Interpol to extradite those who have fled the regime and seek asylum and protection outside their home.  Abuses of Interpol by China or Russia are becoming more frequent. Interpol resists attempts to extradite political opponents. It relies on Article 3 of its own constitution, which says interpol does not meddle in political affairs. Interpol relied on this article when it rejected baku's request to arrest three MEPs some time ago.

No matter how exciting and no matter how extensive the progress in international agreements may be, we must not abandon the individuals they are designed to benefit.

We are preparing to conclude this partnership agreement and I think it is a good opportunity to have a very serious discussion about the effect of the European Parliament's actions on third countries. When we have all worked in good faith, in an attempt to have constructive dialogues with the authorities, we have had and achieved the success of releasing a man, please remember, a prominent political prisoner – I mean Mr Mammadov – as a result of our efforts, but done in a non-confrontational manner, in a decent manner. Also in the same year, last year, through the same steps of the European Parliament, carried out in a diplomacy and in a coherent dialogue, we succeeded and released 146 people. I think it is very important that this kind of action continues. Mr Huseynov: We have seen very clearly how these allegations have started and we have seen the approach of Free Europe radio. At the same time, I received from Baku – because I confess that I have asked for explanations in connection with this incident – an official statement by the Department of Control of the Administration of Prisons, in which I was told that, in an ambush, one of the inspectors was assaulted and all those involved in this ambush were sanctioned. We have also seen that he has come out of a hunger strike, which contradicts a number of allegations. I believe, ladies and gentlemen, that when we draft a resolution on human rights in a third state of the European Union, we must, first of all, document ourselves very clearly, listen to all parties, because that means democratic spirit, and not privilege a source of information, because there is a risk, in a world where misinformation and fake news are the rule , that this rule should also apply to us and risk diplomatic steps that may have serious consequences.

Mr President, in our sittings on Thursday morning, say of good conscience, you mention the case of journalist Mehman Huseynov. He has just been sentenced to two years' imprisonment for denouncing Aliyev's authoritarian regime. Yes, this regime is autocratic, but what has the European Union done with regard to this regime?  I would like to recall that, on 16 November 2016, the Council gave the Commission a mandate to negotiate a comprehensive agreement with Azerbaijan. On 7 February 2017, negotiations began after President Aliyev's visit to Brussels. On 11 January 2018, new partnership priorities were adopted, including plans to relax the visa regime.  We know that the leaders of the European Union have only one obsession: to drag European nations and peoples into a new cold war against Russia. In doing so, as always, the small-memberists of the globalist cenacles policy aim to fragment the European continent. To do so, they do not hesitate to forge, as I have just mentioned, ever closer relations with the Baku regime.  We know that a pipeline is currently under construction between Azerbaijan and the Member States of the European Union, whereas our security of hydrocarbon supply should instead go through agreements with Russia. For the European Union, a lecturer, the smell of hydrocarbons trumps human rights. I would like to know what our colleague Norica Nicolai, rapporteur of the European Parliament's report on this new European agreement with Azerbaijan, thinks of this matter. According to the French daily Libération, she refused to comment on another previous case of human rights violations in Azerbaijan, that of Yunis Safarov, by referring to an article by the Azerbaijani News Agency, which is, of course, nothing but an unofficial body of the regime. What do the members of the ALDE group think, especially when they are willing to give us, usually always, lessons in democracy? For our part, let us not forget the martyrdom of the Armenian people of Nagorno-Karabakh caused by the Baku regime. For us, the true partner and friend of the European peoples in the Caucasus is the Armenian people.

This practice is compounded by a common trend whereby Azeri authorities press new charges against political prisoners whose prison sentences are ending.

Azerbaijan has long tried to shield itself from Western criticism by using its strategic position as a regional ally in the war against terrorism as well as an important country for Europe in its quest to reduce its dependency on Russian gas. But it is also known that it uses lavish gifts and foreign trips for Western officials in an attempt to tone down criticism against the regime.

We have been following very closely, like you all have, this situation and the recent developments in the case of Mehman Huseynov. This came to our attention already in 2017. We made a statement then, and let me use this opportunity to tell you what we have been doing in recent days.  Following the demarche by the delegation of the European Union in Baku, and thanks to cooperation by the Azerbaijan authorities, the EU delegation, together with five Member States missions, visited Mr Huseynov in prison. The visit at the end of last week allowed us to establish that his life was not at immediate risk. He is receiving medical care and he has stopped his hunger strike.  Nevertheless, we do believe, like you, that the new charges against him for allegedly assaulting prison staff lack credibility and should be dropped. We are aware, as some of you raised, of other hunger strikes by activists. We are following up here with contacts with a lawyer and the prison services and I know that they had been visited by the Red Cross.  Over the past years the EU has placed considerable emphasis on the human rights situation in Azerbaijan. We do so in our political dialogue with the country, including high—level meetings at the EU Azerbaijan Subcommittee on Justice Affairs and Human Rights. The joint partnership priorities, as agreed in July last year, underscore that the rule of law and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms are key in our relationship. The new EU—Azerbaijan agreement currently being negotiated will have democratic reforms, the rule of law, good governance and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms at its core.  We remain all too aware of the considerable challenges relating to the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Azerbaijan. We believe that we should work on addressing them through dialogue, including through the negotiations on the new agreement. We need to have channels of communication to build mutual trust and engagement to effectively pursue our values and interests in Azerbaijan. While pursuing our engagement with the authorities, we are continuing to work closely with civil society organisations, independent media and human rights defenders to follow up on their concerns.

Mr President, we have already adopted a number of resolutions on Sudan. The last one, in March 2018, concerned the arrest of Salih Mahmoud Osman, our 2007 Sakharov Prize winner, who was again arrested, apparently by the NISS, the sad Sudanese security service. His relatives fear for his health, not least because he is diabetic. One of many, unfortunately, once again. Human rights organizations say at least 2,000 people have been arrested since 19 December, dozens of people have been killed, not to mention torture. Since September 2013, protests have been taking place on a regular basis, mainly in Khartoum. Until now, they have been based on the economic crisis, following the loss of oil resources after the partition of Sudan, with record inflation - we are indeed talking about a rate of more than 120%, the second in the world - and, as a result, a steady increase in the prices of basic necessities in a country in a situation of shortage. Not to mention a budget of 70% for military spending, to the detriment of the rest, including health and education.  In December, after the tripling of the price of bread, the first demonstrations began outside the capital and spread across the country like wildfire, including in Darfur, where the ex-janjawid and the repression that goes with it still reign. Very quickly, the watchwords took a political turn. \"Freedom, peace and justice\" demand the protesters, as well as the end of the regime. Omar al-Bashir is not at all provocative and actually wants to change the constitution to represent himself, despite having been in power for 29 years, under several mandates of the International Criminal Court. The crackdown is all over the place: human rights defenders, academics, students, journalists, opposition leaders, including those of the People's Congress Party and the Sudanese Communist Party, which dared to lend its premises for a meeting of all stakeholders in the demonstrations. The Association of Sudanese Professionals has just called for a week of uprisings, culminating today in Khartoum and in major cities: a great march for peace and change. Here we have repeatedly denounced the agreements linking the European Union and Sudan through migration policies or the fight against terrorism. How can we cooperate with the law enforcement authorities in that country, including asking them to come here and identify their nationals in detention centres, or deliver equipment that can be used against the Sudanese population, including Darfur. All European funding needs to be reviewed to stop this hypocrisy.

Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating Mr I was going to divide my speech into three parts. The first: peaceful protests must be allowed. It is natural and highly understandable that protests should spread when governments drastically increase the price of basic food and when the economic situation in the country deteriorates due to poor governance. In this case, the protests have spread from the countryside into the capital Khartoum. It must also be allowed to protest in order for President Omar al-Bashir, who has been in power for 29 years, to bring forward a successor. International human rights organisations in the country report 45 deaths so far. These are people who have protested and been killed by police. The second issue is the methods of the security services. It is totally unacceptable that such excessive force, against people who protest and against political opponents, should be used by sudan's security service, NISS. The mandate and methods of the NISS must, of course, comply with international standards, and that is not the case today. International standards of arrest should, of course, also be followed by the NISS. It is reported, for example, that niss used live ammunition against unarmed people and that torture is reported to have occurred in the country's prisons. It can never be accepted, not in any country.  The third is that the electoral calendar should be respected. According to the country's constitution, the incumbent president cannot run for president in 2020. But, as in so many other countries, the President is now trying to amend the Constitution so that he can stand anyway in the 2020 elections, and to his aid he has a group of legal experts close to him. Twenty-two political parties in opposition to the incumbent president have called for power to be taken over by a transitional government and for a date for democratic elections to be immediately called. Since I have time to take over, I also raise a fourth question. This resolution is, of course, based on current and unacceptable events in Sudan, but if we take a look and think a little more about the situation in Sudan, it is impossible for me as a Green not to see how the climate impact and its consequences have had a devastating impact on development for a couple of decades.

But the fact is that Bashir is the only sitting head of state wanted by the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity and war crimes, genocide and ethnic cleansing in Darfur. Yet he remains free to continue his crimes, and he is welcomed by so many states with open arms – states like China, India, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and many others that continue to allow Bashir into their countries, welcome him and support him, instead of arresting him. It is also their inaction that enables Bashir to continue his crimes with impunity, attacking civilians. This is also why we are witnessing Bashir’s latest actions, whereby at least 37 people have lost their lives, more than 800 have been arrested, and there is ongoing violence and oppression by the authorities. Mass arrests and killings – targeting activists, human rights defenders, lawyers, doctors, teachers – Bashir and his accomplices must face charges.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Sudan, one of africa's largest countries, has returned to the centre of our attention.  Recent reports from Sudan have been very bad. While much of the world was busy celebrating at the end of the year, Sudanese poured into the streets and squares, protesting the decline in purchasing power. At the origin of the protest were the price increases first of petrol, then of bread whose price has tripled by decree. There have been protests in the country, which jeopardise the very fragile social balance achieved and unfortunately confirm the precariousness of people's lives. The economic situation is not favourable for the country, despite the fact that it has many resources.  Sudan is moving forward, alternating periods of relative calm with other particularly hard times for citizens, affected by hunger and the harmful effects of the government, which often degenerate into social conflicts with a strong repressive value, on the part of the security forces. Not only the sudanese citizens who are contesting the riots, but also the opposition, are paying the price for the unrest. In this way, Sudan confirms the sad reality of political repression of freedom of expression, which is the source of legitimate claims by exasperated citizens.  We must always remind the Government of Khartoum that it is up to it to ensure that its country's development is given priority and speed. It is only through the development of economic activities in the country and the installation of a healthy political climate that protest movements can be appeased. In this respect, it is important to stress the role of the political dialogue that we would like to see practised, especially after the formation of the new coalition of opposition parties.

Almost 30 years ago, Colonel Omar al—Bashir came to power, suspended political parties and introduced an Islamic legal code at the national level and appointed himself President in 1993. So, Sudan became a one party state under the National Congress Party. Later in the 1990s, Sudan was listed as a state sponsor of terrorism by several countries. Six years ago, President al—Bashir promised not to seek re-election, but ran again in 2015, while the opposition boycotted the elections. As for press freedom, Sudan ranks as one of the last ones, taking the 174th position on the list of 180 countries. Last December, massive demonstrations erupted, first as a protest against price increases but then expanded as a broadly based movement against the authoritarian regime calling for the President al—Bashir to resign. He has now been in power, as said, almost 30 years. The current death toll has reached almost 50, with hundreds of people arrested and tortured – especially Sakharov Prize winner Salih Mahmoud Osman, he’s a human rights lawyer, who was once again arrested only nine days ago. His whereabouts are unknown.  Furthermore, Sudan is classified as the fourth-worst country to be a Christian in last year’s watch list by Open Doors International. We condemn state-endorsed persecution of Christians and the closing and demolition of churches. Muslims who convert to Christianity faced the death penalty for apostasy. One very serious fact to keep in mind, which was mentioned just a few minutes ago, is that al–Bashir is the only incumbent head of state wanted by the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity, war crimes and ethnic cleansing in the Darfur region. He should be seen and treated as an international pariah.  The European Parliament strongly condemns excessive use of force against popular protests and asks for the immediate release of Salih Mahmoud Osman and all human rights defenders, journalists and protesters. We ask to end restrictions on access to the internet and provide for freedom of press. We call on the Commission and the High Representative to publicly condemn the intolerable situation in Sudan, and to use all means to convince the government there to end the ongoing violence, to stop mass arrests and killings.

There is no functioning, caring government, civil liberties are virtually non-existent. The international community has written countless reports on human rights in the country and very little is changing.

That is why I call on the institutions of the European Union to take steps to sanction Sudan for the injustices that sudan is unfairly inflicting on its people.", "language": "en", "original_language": "lt", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "EFDD", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Eurosceptic conservatives"}, {"id": 68, "date": "2019-01-17.json", "name": "Kostas PAPADAKIS", "mepid": "125093", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, the situation of human rights in Sudan is a continuous worry for the European Union. Our main areas of concern include freedom of expression, assembly and association, as well as the shrinking space for civil society. We have witnessed these fundamental rights being undermined in recent weeks by the response of the Government of Sudan to the widespread protests sparked across the country last December because of the rising cost of living and shortages.  The Sudanese security forces have responded by using force, at times live ammunition, tear gas, intimidation and arbitrary arrests. Reportedly, as you mentioned, more than 40 people have lost their lives and more than 800 people remain detained. Several media outlets, including newspapers, have been seized. Social media and the internet have been partially cut to suppress news and prevent coordination among protesters. The European Union has been alarmed by reports of the use of tear gas against medical personnel and patients in hospital. As emphasised in the most recent EU statements on the ongoing protests, we expect the Sudanese Government to release all journalists, members of the Opposition, human rights defenders and other protesters arbitrarily detained. We also expect the Government to conduct a thorough investigation into these recent deaths and abuses. It is vital that those responsible are held accountable for their actions. Furthermore, all sides should exercise restraint and abstain from any further violence in order to de—escalate the situation.  The European Union calls upon the Government of Sudan to allow the Sudanese people to exercise their constitutional right to express their views without fear of reprisal. We also call on the Government to implement much needed political and economic reforms to address the grievances expressed by the population about the challenges the country is facing. I would like to assure you that the EU will continue to stand for human rights and fundamental freedoms in Sudan, as well as to support civil society work and human right defenders by different means at our disposal.  As you know, our relations with Sudan are affected by the International Criminal Court (ICC) arrest warrant against President Bashir and subsequent decisions by Sudan not to ratify the revised Cotonou Agreement. That means that Sudan is not eligible for programme funds from the European Development Fund. However, as you know, the country is in a very dire economic and humanitarian situation. Widespread conflict and insecurity transcend borders and negatively impact the wider region. With that in mind, two years ago we made available a special measure for Sudan worth EUR 1 million for the benefit of the population. It does not mean that we are endorsing the political leadership. This money is channelled through the EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa and it aims to improve the situation of the most vulnerable groups.  We will continue to raise concerns in our engagement with the Sudanese authorities at all levels. We will also show our continued support through the use of the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR) and this has already provided funds, for instance, to several projects on press freedom, as well as civic and human rights and education in Sudan.

This is a unique opportunity to acquire knowledge for the Union in the area of the dismantling of nuclear installations and radioactive waste management, and therefore the separate investment provided for in the document is justified and in particular also because it is an exceptional case to the polluter-pays principle for radioactive waste cases. Why? Because this investment in nuclear energy was imposed on the territory of Lithuania by the then Soviet Union, it was intended to serve a much wider region, and disproportionate to the size and financial capacity of Lithuania.  The closure of the nuclear power plant has led to the need to increase energy imports to serve the region, and Lithuania has therefore been bearing very high energy costs for years.

Again, it is a kind of form of double standard – a topic that is especially painful for my fellow citizens.  It seems illogical to fight against the double standard in food, and at the same time for Bulgaria and Romania to be outside Schengen or to be accepted only partially. If the citizens of this Union do not feel equal, it would also negatively affect the future of the European project as a whole. Talking about Europe at several speeds in the run-up to the European elections will inevitably affect turnout, which has traditionally not been very high.

This is a success for the bloc itself, but of course it would not have been possible without its citizens all these years. The position of leading trading bloc also comes with responsibilities to other countries. Therefore, the Generalised Scheme of Preferences is the right approach that enables third countries to generate economic growth and upswing, and why not one day be an equal economic partner. Of course, it should be taken into account that in many cases the cost of production is much lower than those in the European Union. The requirements for the production of agricultural products remain among the highest, if not the highest in the world, which has an enormous impact on the economic attractiveness of agriculture in Europe. Rice production in the European Union is concentrated in several countries. The rice producers from Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece, France, Hungary, Romania and, of course, the country I know best – Bulgaria, unfortunately, are the ones who felt quite strongly and on their own back some of the growth of bilateral trade between the Union and the two countries of Southeast Asia. At the first European Union Forum on Rice, held nearly 3 years ago in Milan, as you know, Mrs Malmström, representatives of various branch organisations from seven EU Member States, rallied around the need for a new approach to rice production in the European Union. We must not forget that rice production engages resources, such as water, for example, for which there are requirements; the workforce for which there are also requirements; equipment for which there are also requirements. All this is making production in the European Union more expensive. Here in the European Parliament we stand by these requirements so that there are both fertile soils and clean waters for future generations. However, I am not sure that the demand for cheaper imports is the right approach. Because resources in other parts of the world, just like in Europe, must be protected. It makes sense that rice offered and imported into the European Union from third countries meets these social and environmental requirements. In the case of both Myanmar and Cambodia, the economic impact of the application of the Generalised Scheme of Preferences is significant. Trade trade between the two countries, on the one hand, and the European Union, on the other, for the period 2015-2017 there is a significant increase, which means that the approach is correct. Unfortunately, however, some European sectors feel this growth on their backs more than others, and quite negatively. One of these sectors is also rice production. In this regard, today, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I would be interested in initiating a question and debate on rice imports from third countries, in particular From Myanmar and Cambodia. I am glad that it is you, Commissioner, who are here with us and together we can send the positive message to European rice growers. Most heartily, and I am sure my other colleagues, welcome the decision taken by the European Commission, as of tomorrow, 18 January 2019, to introduce a new regime for imports of rice from these two countries. Today's publication in the Official Journal of the European Union is the result of a lot of work and effort on the part of both rice growers and the European Commission, of course. The survey carried out on imports of semi-milled and milled Indica rice originating in Cambodia and Myanmar for the period 2012-2017 outlines trends already familiar to the sector in Europe. Imports from the two countries considered together have doubled over this period, but I would like to draw attention to the huge increase in imports from Myanmar, which from 2 000 tonnes in 2012 to 2017 reached nearly 63 000 tonnes. This growth of 3 000% is huge and it would not be fair to remain unchanged. Low production costs in Cambodia and Myanmar are one of the factors that have shrunk European production by nearly 40% in just 4-5 years. This can't help but worry among the biggest supporters of free trade. Account must also be taken of the downward trend in rice consumption in the European Union, which, among other things, may also be due to a change in the European diet. I regrettably informed myself of the delays in communication with southeast Asian partners. I believe that cooperation with them should continue, but I strongly welcome the proposed introduction of rice duties over the next three years. I believe that the progressive reduction of these duties will enable European rice producers to recover and continue to produce a quality product. European industry has also already sent strong messages of support for the proposed measure. I am pleased that while on some issues we here in the European Parliament have different views from the Commission, in this case today and hence we manage to send a strong signal of support european rice production.

Nevertheless, under the rules of the general scheme of preferences of the regulation, the Commission may, temporarily, reinstate the common customs tariffs duties to shield a particular sector if products are imported in volumes or at a price that are causing serious difficulties to EU industries. Upon the request of eight rice producing Member States, the Commission initiated a safeguard investigation regarding imports of indica rice from Cambodia and Myanmar. The findings of these investigations confirm that there is indeed a surge of imports of rice that has caused economic damage to the rice sector in the EU. The imports of indica rice from Cambodia and Myanmar have increased significantly over the he last year. Imports from Cambodia have increased by almost 100 000 tonnes and Myanmar by 60 000 tonnes and this represents a significant increase of market share – from 15% to 25% for Cambodia and from zero to 6% from Myanmar. Import prices were much lower than the EU prices and, as a result, the EU industry lost a significant volume of production and market share. Therefore, it is warranted that safeguard measures are imposed and the Commission will reinstate the common customs tariff duty. The tariff duty will be EUR 175 per tonne in year one, EUR 150 per tonne per in year two and EUR 125 per tonne in year three. These measures will therefore be in place for three years and they can only be extended in duly justified circumstances.

I noted that European rice producers have become more and more vocal on human rights and labour standards violation in Cambodia and Myanmar, linking these issues to the GSP+ provisions. We all know that the general scheme of preference (GSP) has three objectives, to contribute to poverty eradication by expanding exports from countries most in need. Secondly, to promote sustainable development and good governance and ensure that the EU’s financial and economic interests are safeguarded. I agree that if we produce a human rights clause into our trade agreements, it has to be respected and GSP+ can be revoked in case of non-compliance. But don’t you see a moral issue in the fact that we start to point the finger at labour standards in Asia only after the economic interests of European companies get affected? Personally I do. The ‘Everything but Arms’ (EBA) arrangement is a preferential arrangement, and we need to keep in mind that granting tax exceptions for imports is our right but not our obligation. Therefore, I suggest that the European Commission has a very close look on how our EBA agreements are applied. Human rights promotions and protection is the flagship of the EU activity and we cannot discredit our international engagement in human rights by giving preferences to those sources who blatantly abuse workers. This makes the EU inconsistent in the eyes of the world and weakens our credibility. I can understand that revoking a preferential status after it has been granted is a politically painful act that we all would like to avoid, but that is why I want to underline once more the Commission’s duty of oversight, so that EBA preferences are given only if our partner has a concrete strategy for human rights improvement. On 16 March 2018, the Commission decided to initiate a safeguard investigation to clarify the impact of indica rice imports. We in the European Parliament here are waiting for the results to have some predictability for our rice industry. The stakes are high. Only in case of Italy, we are speaking about 4 265 farms and more than 100 rice companies generating annual turnover of more than EUR 1 billion euros. These companies are heavily jeopardised now. Concluding, I want to say that the revocation of the GSP+ can bring about a positive change in the markets of South Asia.

These people who work, create gross domestic product, pay taxes and end up supporting countries and the Union as such. Yes, there is no doubt that the importation of any goods from the outside, including the product referred to – in this case rice – must take place only under conditions which would not jeopardise would not put local producers at risk. And in this case, that's what we're talking about. The importation of large quantities of rice from those Countries mentioned in the oral question endangers local producers.  The working conditions in these countries, the respect for human rights that my colleague Mamiekins was talking about, are clearly not at the level at which we put conditions before our producers.

We simultaneously raise these issues, discuss them, adopt resolutions, but at the same time accept their goods, which, however, threaten and violate the rights of our manufacturer.

Otherwise, we finance producers from other countries and doom our producers to great difficulties.

Brussels has prevented us from 'getting the rice'. This expression is used in Spanish, in many areas, to underline how dangerous it is not to make decisions in time. In response to the complaint of producers, it has reacted quickly and forcefully. European sovereignty has been used to protect an unde transformed European agricultural product from unfair competition from third countries under the widespread preference regime. This combats Euroscepticism: demonstrating in the Albufera of Valencia, in the Ebro Delta, Lombardy or Piedmont, among others, that Brussels, that Europe is useful; explaining that this safeguard clause is strong, durable and also effective; stressing that, only as a Union, we have been able to meet the challenge of imports that have multiplied by forty in five years, which has clearly affected the market share of European producers, production and prices. This reduction has ranged, according to European growing areas, in percentages ranging from 10% to 30%, which has had an impact on employment and profitability. And the existence of a negative effect on these parameters is precisely the condition required by the Regulation to activate such measures. That's how Europe is built. But also dedicating all efforts to keep our farmers gaining positions in the value chain of their productions. And that requires helping them partner, innovate, participate in the marketing, distribution and transformation industry. Under these conditions, such import operations, typical of the logics handled by the large distribution, would be less common. Let us therefore greet this measure.
