In the negotiations, in the so-called omnibus procedure, we achieved in the trialogue that the Agriculture Committee achieved targeted improvements for the four regulations of the common agricultural policy - direct payments, rural development, common market organization and horizontal regulation. I am all the more pleased that we have succeeded in getting these important improvements for the agar part into effect on January 1, 2018. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the negotiating team of the European Parliament for the good - indeed excellent - cooperation in the interests of European agriculture, in particular Paolo de Castro and Michel Dantin, who have been actively involved in this work process from the start. I would also like to thank our chairman, Czesław Siekierski, very warmly and the claims reporters, who worked very constructively across all political groups. I would like to thank the Commission and, on their behalf, Michael Niejahr and Rudolf Moegele, the administrative and functional team, the employees in the parliamentary offices. Finally, I would like to thank Inge Gräßle and the Conference of Presidents, who supported the splitting up of the Commission's proposal. Only with their support was it possible to draw up a separate legislative report on the provisions of the AGRI mandate. 505 amendments were tabled in the Agriculture Committee. After intensive negotiations, a package of 16 compromise amendments was drawn up. Broad consensus among other major political groups resulted in a very successful vote in committee in May, with 34 for, 10 against and one abstention. This vote gave us a clear mandate to negotiate between the three institutions. Four trialogues were enough to to find a political agreement between Parliament, Council and Commission on 12 October on the changes to the four CAP regulations. The Agriculture Committee then approved the agreement with a clear majority of 39 to 5 votes. For our farmers, the compromise means more options for greening and more security for permanent grassland. Numerous measures are simplified, for example the definition of “active farmer”. We have succeeded in creating the opportunity for more biodiversity. In the future, as part of the greening, honey plants, throughgrown silphies and elephant grass can be grown on priority areas. Honey plants and streaky silphies are flowering plants that beekeepers are sure to be happy about. Elephant grass helps prevent soil erosion, after it stops in winter it also offers protection to small game. In addition, the weighting factors for protein crops were raised from 0.7 to 1.0. This was also necessary after the Commissioner, incomprehensible to me, pronounced the ban on plant protection products on priority areas by means of a delegated act. As a result, hundreds of thousands of hectares of protein crops are no longer grown in Europe. The factor 0.7 was no longer appropriate. We have also increased the factor for perennial rotation plantations from 0.3 to 0.5. Very little use has been made of this program so far. By raising this, we can assume that it will be used more. There was also a breakthrough in permanent grassland. After the incomprehensible judgment of the European Court of Justice on permanent grassland, it was necessary to obtain clarification. As a result of this ruling by the European Court of Justice, around one hundred thousand hectares of grassland were plowed in my home country Bavaria alone and had to be plowed in order to meet the five-year deadline. This was an impossible condition. Mr President, I have been told I am have six minutes of speaking time: four plus two. That is why I should like to ask again for a short speaking time, because I have adjusted to it. The decisive factor in this agreement is that it will apply retrospectively and will also provide legal security for the future. The conditions for the additional premium for young farmers have also been significantly improved. Member States now have the option of increasing the rates of support for young farmers significantly and paying them out for a full five years. Support for young farmers can be better tailored to their needs. The instruments of risk management in the context of rural development have been strengthened. A new sector-specific instrument for income stabilization will be introduced. An important demand made by the EPP Group to strengthen the position of farmers in the food chain is also anchored in this compromise. Unlike in the past, all recognized producer organizations can now negotiate their production and supply contracts on behalf of their members. It was important here to create an exemption for the cooperatives so that there would be no violation of the competition rules. Finally, I would like to ask the Commission to implement all of the resolutions in a very unbureaucratic manner. In this way we achieve more for ecology in Europe and more legal security for farmers in Europe.

But, as you know very well, rural development is something which for me, as the Commissioner for Regional Policy, is very close to my heart.  I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Deß, for this report and for his work in getting us to this point. We have been waiting a long time for this debate, both in agriculture and cohesion policy, in order to make the lives of beneficiaries in both fields much easier. Indeed, the text to be voted on tomorrow is the result of complex negotiations which started in the summer. I am glad that preliminary agreement was reached in October between all three institutions. As you know, this agreement covers a very wide range of issues in all four basic acts of the common agricultural policy. It contains many changes, which come from amendments proposed by both the Council and Parliament. Some of them go beyond the original Commission proposal. The text on which you will vote tomorrow is the result of a compromise. It was achieved through a constructive approach by all parties. However, as you know and as was outlined during the conclusion of the trialogue process, the Commission has some misgivings about the end results. This is particularly the case regarding the new provisions in favour of producer organisations and their possible consequences for effective competition. We also have reservations about the limited role that the Commission and the national competition authorities will play in safeguarding competition.  Having said that, we are nevertheless very happy to see that many of the important simplification proposals put forward by the Commission are in the final text. I am thinking of, for example, the simplification of rules for financial instruments, the improvement of risk management tools, and the possibility for greater flexibility for active farmer provisions. Commissioner Hogan has been taking this simplification agenda forward for the last two years. Member States and farmers are now anxious to see these important simplification measures and other improvements to the common agricultural policy rules enter into force as soon as possible. These measures will reduce the administrative burden on Member States and farmers. It was with this in mind that the Council and Parliament agreed to have the agriculture provisions separated from the rest of the Omnibus proposals. The original objective was to have them adopted as a stand-alone legal instrument to enter into force on 1 January 2018. Well, I would like to assure you that the Commission also wants to see these simplification measures coming into effect as early as possible for the benefit of farmers in all Member States. The Commission’s Omnibus  proposal is a single proposal. It covers diverse, but interconnected, provisions, and the Commission would like to see them all enter into force as soon as possible. For this to happen, we need to progress swiftly on the remaining parts of the Omnibus proposals, which also contain significant simplification provisions. Quick implementation of these provisions will benefit everyone. With a view to achieving tangible results as soon as possible, I can tell you that the Commission will not oppose the agreement reached on the new stand-alone text introducing changes to the basic regulations of the common agricultural policy. Therefore, the Commission will continue its constructive and cooperative approach in order to move further forward in this important area  so that efforts can rapidly bear fruit.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 19, "date": "2017-12-11.json", "name": "Czesław Adam SIEKIERSKI", "mepid": "23787", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - Work on the mid-term review of the CAP under the Omnibus Regulation was successful as a result of the concerted cooperation of the three institutions involved: the Commission, the Council and the Parliament. The changes that have been made can be called a small reform without hesitation, as it is about significant changes to some key CAP instruments. The elements introduced to simplify and provide more flexibility to Member States are particularly important. Young farmers, whom we need so much in rural areas, will benefit from the changes. They will be able to get even the doubling of existing payments and receive them for five years regardless of when they requested such payment. Further steps were taken to strengthen the farmer's position in the food chain, including thanks to the expansion of collective price negotiation by producer organizations and the exclusion of farmers from the principles of EU competition law. We also provided better risk management tools in the event of market difficulties, weather anomalies, and plant or animal disease outbreaks. The work on the collective regulation was also a good warm-up, a valuable experience before the upcoming CAP reform for the period after 2020.

The omnibus in fact offered us the opportunity to intervene on the current structure of the CAP, an opportunity that has materialized above all thanks to the determined and decisive contribution of the European Parliament. The small adjustments and timid openings presented in the Commission's initial proposal were certainly pointing in the right direction, but they did not appear to measure up to the challenges that agri-food systems are facing. Precisely for this reason we felt the responsibility to give European citizens and farmers answers that were more than a simple tweak, with an ambitious initiative, through which we were able to enhance and integrate the ideas offered by the Commission. The extent of the innovations introduced in the field of simplification, risk management and market measures means that this work is a genuine medium-term reform of the common agricultural policy. A mid-term reform with a double value: on the one hand, it is the response to the now certain postponement of the CAP reform to the next European legislature and the next Commissioner; on the other, it was able to set a starting point for reflections on the future of agricultural policies, also significantly addressing the recent Commission communication on the post-2020 CAP. The large number of amendments proposed by Parliament has generated an intense debate, but the balance found is welcomed with great satisfaction by all European farmers, and gives us an excellent example of the work carried out by our three institutions, fully respecting the ambitious goals time frames initially defined by the competent commissions.For this - I conclude - I want to thank the Estonian Presidency, Commissioner Hogan and his services, and all colleagues and shadow rapporteurs for the overtime, also from the procedural point of view, having succeeded in this extrapolation, and I also thank the Commissioner for thenot opposition.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 21, "date": "2017-12-11.json", "name": "Bas BELDER", "mepid": "4507", "text": "on behalf of the ECR Group.- I too would like to thank everyone involved for the result achieved.This is a good step towards simplification and, I hope, a reduction in the administrative burden for farmers.I am particularly pleased that my amendments have also been included in the text.First, support for young farmers.Young farmers will soon receive top-up support for the full five years.Every young farmer can make optimal use of this when the support is most needed.Second, my amendment on spelled.I am pleased that spelled will count towards crop diversification in all cases.For some farmers this is an important option, for example for farmers on heavy clay soil.After all, that is what it is all about: a well-functioning policy, everyone benefits.So thanks again to everyone involved for this achieved result.", "language": "en", "original_language": "nl", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 22, "date": "2017-12-11.json", "name": "Ulrike MÜLLER", "mepid": "124862", "text": "on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen! I too would like to thank the rapporteurs Albert Deß and Paolo De Castro most sincerely. On September 14, 2016 the Commission presented the proposal to review the multiannual financial framework. We in the agricultural sector were affected by four basic acts. The European institutions are often ridiculed and insulted that the process is taking too long. However, this is unfounded here. In fact, we've proven that when you work together, it can go very, very quickly. It is all the more important for us now that we vote tomorrow on the agricultural part of the omnibus regulation. We all wanted to achieve simplifications and the simplifications must come into effect on January 1st, 2018. The most important areas have already been mentioned: it is about the active farmer, it is about the young farmers. For me it was also important that we clearly define the status of the fields and that this definition of grassland is finally properly written down. The most important points, however, were of course greening and the expansion of plants in the ecological focus areas. The streaky Silphie and also the honey plants for the bees are to be mentioned explicitly. However, the ALDE Group is critical of changes to the common market organization because we are convinced that the common market organization, as it now exists, can actually lead to success if it is applied in this way in all other Member States. We differed slightly here. Nevertheless, it is important for us that we vote positively, that we achieve an improvement for the farmers.

Young farmers now will be able to get five years of payment irrespective of when they apply, as long as it is within the first five years of their taking over the farm. Although I say that they can get it, the Council has unfortunately made a change concerning my country, the Republic of Ireland. As ‘shall’ has become ‘may’, we fear in our country that the generational renewal will end up getting nothing and ‘may’ will be never, but you’ve done your bit and congratulations on that.  One thing, though, that young farmers don’t necessarily need is a crutch. What they need is to have the blocks taken off their back and to do that – and there is something done here – we need to strengthen farmers’ position in the food chain and their way to make money. Whatever the profession, whether it’s hairdressing, carpentry, or anything else, you don’t ask why we can’t get people to go into it if there is no money: we know the answer. We need more money to come to farmers, and it worries me when I hear the Commission say that it has misgivings about the whole idea of competition in this area, whereas there are no misgivings about supermarkets having a massive market share.

I think the balance sheet is at least mixed. Not everything was successful, and not everything can now be described as real progress.

A better definition of grassland, or that plowing no longer has to be done after five years - I think that is a matter of course. On the other hand, the weighting factors in greening have now become weaker. Dear colleague Müller, I have a different definition: why elephant grass and the streaky Silphie are now viewed as an enrichment of the European agricultural landscape is only accessible to those who make biogas. So actually I would put a big question mark on it. I would also put a question mark on the matter of the \"active farmer\". The Commission wanted to abolish the definition entirely. Now we are leaving it to the Member States. But we have to find a solution, because it is important that the payments from the European Union actually go to those who need them. Namely, those who are active in the business, and not to any investors who may be withdrawing the money from the European Union in the background. That is why this is another point that we will certainly need further discussion on. We have now heard a reform proposal from the Commissioner. There was even more ambiguity for us. There is one point that we definitely have to discuss, and unfortunately we have not succeeded: the proposals that Mr Dantin, who is after all a member of the PPE group, repeatedly brings forward that we can actively intervene in the market.

In this context, I appreciate that Member States will be able to increase payments to young farmers in the first pillar by up to 50% of the ceiling. Extremely important is the general instrument of income stabilization, which can be used in the event that farmers' incomes decrease by more than 30% of the average annual income compared to the previous year. However, this instrument, together with insurance contracts, must become instruments that are accessible to farmers in all Member States, and in this respect I believe that the role of national authorities is crucial in their implementation.

No fair price without a stronger position for the farmer. With this agreement producer organizations can now be established in all sectors.

And so it would be good if, when we talk about the single market, we think about how to unify these measures as well. Another huge problem for our farmers is that, last but not least, they are threatened by the policy of retail chains more than climate change. Indeed, retail chains treat small farmers and farmers in a very bad way, and they also play a huge role in many businesses disappearing.

I know very well that Mr Deß, Mr De Castro and all of you have been the soul of this initiative, which is very important, as it will enable you, with your vote tomorrow, to make the lives of farmers much easier all over Europe.  I am particularly happy – together with Commissioner Hogan, of course – about the change in the relationship with young farmers. The payment will always be granted per farmer for a period of five years, as long as a young farmer applies for the payment within five years of setting up for the first time. This goes hand in hand with our work together.  Mr Hogan, as the Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, and myself, as the Commissioner for Regional Development, are both in favour of doing something for villages in order to keep young people there: otherwise we shall be in danger of having food agglomerations and empty countryside. Regarding this proposal you have, I think, given us very good results. So, hand in hand, we have to work for rural development, and of course we have more support for farmers, not least in Greece, and more activities in villages. This Omnibus is a very important next step in the Commission’s simplification agenda, an agenda on which, with Parliament’s support, much progress has been made. Indeed, the Commission produced the Omnibus proposal precisely because we believe that there is significant potential for simplification across a range of policy areas, including the area for which I am responsible.  But we are a bit behind. Tomorrow morning we will have the last trialogue about cohesion policy. The Commission hopes that those who are negotiating other aspects of the Omnibus proposal can take a lead from all of the agriculture negotiations, for we are setting an example. As I said, I want to acknowledge the role played by the rapporteur and all his colleagues in the progress that you have managed to make in such a short time. I would also like to thank the Estonian Presidency for its leadership in the Council and for its collaboration with the other institutions in the trialogues.  Let me reiterate that the Commission will not stand in the way of the agreement when it is put to the vote tomorrow. Although, as I said, we had reservations from the point of view of competition, you, the European Parliament, have agreed this, so the Commission will stand by you.

The young farmers there have been pushing for it, and Esther Herranz from Spain has also strongly advocated it. We now have a very flexible instrument here - as required.

On the other hand, overly bureaucratic and difficult-to-implement greening rules have been simplified in a number of respects.

Commissioner Crețu! I would like to thank everyone who has taken part in the negotiations and worked on this regulation. We have succeeded in radically raising the standards for who should fish under the EU flag, and I am proud to say that the EU fleet will be the most transparent, and it will take the greatest responsibility globally at sea after our work. A great victory. This is the only way to credibly initiate a dialogue with other major fishing nations on how we raise standards internationally and how we sustainably manage our common resources for future generations. There is a struggle for marine resources. When we have extracted what we can on land, we now begin to look at the blue economy and what it can do to satisfy our insatiable needs. But in order not to endanger the food security of millions of people through overfishing and predation, the EU needs to take its responsibility. If we do not see that our behavior affects others, then we will see a world with increasing refugee flows, increased poverty and hunger. For humans on the African continent, fish is the most important source of protein, to name just one example. The EU must take responsibility at sea. The Commission's proposal was therefore a very good basis to begin with, for the first time bringing together all types of activities outside EU waters. Partnership agreements, private agreements, fishing within RFMO and fishing on open water. This is a very positive step and I am very happy that the Council of Ministers shared these goals. I would like to start by talking about our gains from the European Parliament. We succeeded in introducing several new regulations to improve the sustainability of fishing, both on the high seas and in private agreements. We now have stricter rules regarding the rental of boats, so-called charter, including a definition of what is included and a ban on this in the EU Partnership Agreement. This is important. Charter is the clearest way to circumvent rules around both social and environmental sustainability. We have succeeded in negotiating a more consistent adaptation to the IUU Regulation with regard to when fishing must stop if the Commission decides to give the country a red card for illegal fishing. It shall no longer be permitted to fish in waters where the country clearly violates international agreements on illegal fishing. We also succeeded in demanding better information about a ship's history and operations when it returns to the EU ship register. This is important to know that the boat carrying the EU flag has not fished illegally or rented out its flag to less meticulous countries. Fishing in open water will now require a scientific assessment to show that the planned activities are sustainable. Open water should not be the wild west for anyone to just grab. We must carefully regulate the activities there. We called for stricter rules for transhipment at sea and managed to get through rules that require prior notification to the Member State and an annual report to the European Commission. But as in all negotiations, we did not reach all our goals. Eligibility criteria - we wanted vessels not to be eligible for a fishing permit if they had committed a serious infringement or a crime the year before fishing began. The Council of Ministers refused to take this into account, and we finally had to go to bed. This is largely because Member States do not apply the Control Regulation in the same way. We really wanted to strengthen the European Commission's ability to revoke a permit if the Member State does not apply the conditions correctly. This is better known as the claw back clause. We came to a compromise wording that gives the European Commission the right to put more pressure on the Member State if the Member State does nothing in the event of serious crimes or infringements, and it remains to be seen whether the European Commission can make effective use of this opportunity. This means that we must continue to form opinions and keep track of our own boats.We also want greater transparency and transparency in the fishing fleet.The European Parliament wants the names of the owner and the final payee to be made public, but we did not go all the way;The information will be collected and available… (the speaker cut off the President)… These are the main features of the new regulation and I will now hand over to the debate where I look forward to the speeches.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sv", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 54, "date": "2017-12-11.json", "name": "Corina CREȚU", "mepid": "33997", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, honourable Members, my sincere thanks go to the rapporteur, Ms Engström, for her work on this report, also for the shadows and their teams who have worked hard on this Commission proposal. You know very well that this is an important element of the reform of the common fisheries policy, which is being implemented by my colleague Karmenu Vella. The proposal on the sustainable management of the external fleets is crucial to reinforce the role of the European Union as a key global actor in fisheries, ocean governance and the fight against illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. The Commission is very happy that the Council and Parliament have agreed on a compromise text based on the Commission proposal regarding the sustainable management of external fishing fleets. With this agreement and these new rules that should enter into force early next year, the European Union is creating a benchmark at international level on the management of external fleets. The European Union also takes the lead in ensuring sustainable fishing at a global level and is strengthening its capacity to tackle illegal fishing worldwide. Let me illustrate this with some of the main achievements. First of all, a comprehensive system of fishing with authorisation to fish outside European Union waters that applies wherever the fishing takes place based on strict eligibility criteria. This is of the utmost importance, especially for the outermost regions. I had the pleasure to be with President Juncker and President Macron in French Guyana, which has now the Presidency of the outermost regions. I know how important this is for the population, for whom fishing is the main activity. Secondly, fishing activities will be better regulated and monitored independently, whether fishing takes place under public agreement, direct authorisation by third countries, or on the high seas. In particular, scientific evidence should be given showing that the fishing activities are sustainable. Abusive reflagging of new vessels in order to avoid the rules will also be discouraged and penalised. The new rules will increase transparency on fishing operations globally, as the proposal was for the creation of a public register of all fishing authorisations granted. Finally, chartering and transhipment in the high seas and under private agreements will also be regulated. This is a very balanced compromise. The objective of better regulating fishing activities goes together with a reduced administrative burden as well as simple and harmonised rules. The role of each actor is clear in defining this proposal. The responsibility of the Member States as flag states is reinforced while the European Commission will play an important role in supervising the implementation of the rules and ensuring compliance with international obligations regarding the activities of EU-flagged vessels. The European Union has now become a strong global actor in shaping international oceans governance and this is now well reflected in our legislation, which we need to implement. I therefore trust that together we will manage to improve fisheries governance for a more sustainable future and a better livelihood.

I would like to emphasize that an amendment has been submitted requesting the inclusion of the so-called double sanction, which would penalize boats sanctioned the year prior to the authorization request without a license. My group has always opposed this inclusion for three reasons, basically: first, it is discriminatory; secondly, it would primarily penalize ships from those countries that apply the Control Regulation on sanctions more strictly, which, as is known, is unfortunately not applied homogeneously in the Member States; and, thirdly, it would mean a strong economic loss for the vessels of the Union's external fleet, which, due to their special characteristics, often cannot be converted and fish in Union waters. I hope for all this that the amendment does not prosper, and if it does, furthermore, all the work done so far will have been for nothing because I do not see the possibility of reaching a conciliation with the Council on this point.

It seems to me that a good compromise and a balanced end result have been reached. Combating illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing is a priority for everyone. Given that there are different levels of implementation between Member States, it was preferable to remove the so-called eligibility criteria for fishing outside Union waters. Thus, it was ensured that there is no double penalty, which would only apply to fishermen and vessels coming from countries that are already fully complying with control regulations. The offenders would benefit. Ensuring that international fisheries agreements and European fisheries are not used as a tool for money laundering and for tax evasion is a priority. The registration of information about vessels fishing in international waters, what are the opportunities for associated fishing, who are their owners and, very importantly, the final beneficiaries, makes all the activity carried out more transparent. At a time when efforts are being made to combat tax evasion, I was surprised by the difficulty of securing this specific point. It is necessary to continue the fight against IUU fishing and promote respect for the environment and local communities in third countries, so we must promote fisheries agreements originating in the European Union. We cannot allow inefficient and dormant European international agreements to continue. Marine resources are a common good and promoting sustainable, balanced and transparent exploitation by the Community fleet is a way of showing international partners how much we are committed to this.

I want to request a favorable vote for this report because it is decisive in improving the sustainability and transparency of the activities of the European Union fleet outside our waters. Its approval is a direct consequence of the introduction, in the latest reform of the CFP, of a chapter devoted to the external dimension. Its objective is to guarantee that the fishing activities of European industry are governed by the same rules inside and outside the Union. Currently this external fleet is made up of more than 700 Community vessels, which contribute a quarter of the Community catches. The co-legislators have reached an agreement that clarifies the existing gaps in the regulations and the division of tasks between the States and the Commission and that will provide a more efficient and transparent control of fishing activities. In this way, we contribute to improving the sustainability and reputation of the European Union in this area and to enhancing community values ​​around the world against illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. To this end, the Agreement includes in the scope of the Regulation all European Union vessels that fish outside our waters, whatever their type of authorization. Thus, private authorizations and charter agreements are expressly included. In addition, common legibility criteria are established for obtaining licenses and stricter rules against changing the flag. There will be more public transparency about the fishing activities of each vessel and more powers for the Commission to intervene in the processes of granting or withdrawing fishing authorizations when States do not comply with this Regulation. Finally, this agreement requires the improvement of the Control Regulation, which will be revised in the first quarter of next year. The current law encourages that not all states exercise the same type of control over their own ships because it does not guarantee surveillance or homologous sanctions.Until these conditions are met, a register of serious infractions would penalize the most compliant States and fleets.This is why this proposal could not be incorporated into the Agreement, and therefore we will not vote in favor of the amendment.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 59, "date": "2017-12-11.json", "name": "Anja HAZEKAMP", "mepid": "125023", "text": "on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group. - Today we are talking about sustainable management of the external fishing fleet.

I think it is an aspect that we must not forget, because behind each of these decisions there are people and many populations that live from fishing. And, therefore, that environmental sustainability we have to also accompany it with attention to those people who make a living from this.

Aviation accounts for approximately 2.1% of global CO2 emissions. In the EU, direct CO2 emissions from aviation account for approximately 3% of the total.  This might not sound like very much, but when you think about the anticipated growth in air traffic emissions – by 2050 they are expected to be seven to ten times higher than in 1990, according to ICAO – these projections are really quite scary. We need to take very strong action. Clearly such a growth is unsustainable and necessitates a policy response. We must work hard over the next few years to ensure we are on track to reach our climate ambitions under the Paris Agreement. In the European Parliament, we have taken the view that we must reduce the carbon impact of the growth of air travel. We all know the history of ‘stop the clock’, so I do not intend to repeat that, but I do want to emphasise the European Parliament’s commitment to continuing to work with ICAO to ensure the next few years deliver what they must: carbon reductions in line with our Paris commitments.  Since the proposal was made by DG CLIMA in 2017, earlier this year, we have moved at a fast pace in Parliament in order to reach an agreement with Council by the end of this year. From the publication of my draft report in May, I have fully supported the Commission’s approach that we await the progress on the GMBM. I did, however, make some additional calls, and I am glad to say we reached a satisfactory agreement during the trilogue negotiations.  The most important addition is the application of a time limit on the ‘stop the clock’ derogation. Whilst welcoming the agreement reached at international level, having an end date on this reflects Parliament’s legitimate concerns over the robust development of the GMBM and whether it would deliver on its commitment to ensure carbon-neutral growth from 2020.  At present, based on the current negotiations within ICAO, progress on the offsetting provisions appears to be slow, with some parties – China and India notably – objecting to ICAO’s role in setting the rules for the GMBM. As such, I believe it would be remiss to make a decision on the future of the ETS in support of a GMBM that is currently still vague and of an imprecise framework.  With this regulation we are effectively outsourcing all our climate action on aviation to ICAO, an organisation that routinely makes decisions behind closed doors and does not allow full participation and transparency. A time-limited derogation will maintain political pressure on the Council and Commission to develop a long-term regulatory solution. We must learn from the issues encountered with previous iterations of the legislation and provide the sector with much needed investor certainty by completing work on the GMBM’s reporting provisions and the transparency and environmental integrity of its offset registry.  With a trilogue agreement on ETS Phase 4 reached in early November, Parliament won a delegated act on the CORSIA MRV rules. We believe we should have the opportunity to assess the provisions when the time comes. The political agreement on the need for ICAO to act in full transparency and reach out to all stakeholders to inform on progress and decisions made must move from rhetoric to reality as the implementation of these measures progresses.  The trilogue agreement also safeguards the Commission’s proposal to introduce an annually declining cap from 2021 and the possibility to reassess this, with a view to increasing the percentage of allowances auctioned.

It is my pleasure to stand again in front of you for him and take part in your deliberations on the proposal on the European Union emission trading system for aviation. The Commission is glad that, on 18 October, the co-legislators were able to reach an agreement on this very sensitive file. I want to express a special gratitude to the rapporteur, Ms Girling, for her excellent work. It was instrumental to reaching a swift agreement. I would also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs for their contributions and support. It was imperative to conclude this file before the end of the year. If the amendment to this directive does not enter into force by early 2018, the full scope – covering all flights to and from third countries – will kick off again. The agreement between this Parliament and the Council is a balanced and fair one. Firstly, the deal ensure the continuation of the European Union ETS for intra-European flights beyond 2017. From 2021, the European Union ETS for aviation will be strengthened through the application of the 2.2% yearly emissions reduction.  We are also committed to assessing how the sector passes its carbon costs onto its customers, with a view to increasing the auctioning share in the next review. Secondly, the Commission will report regularly to the European Parliament and the Council on international developments, notably on the implementation of CORSIA, carbon offsetting and a reduction scheme for international aviation. We know that a lot of work is still needed to make CORSIA operational by 2021. Its rule book is being negotiated now and we have to remain vigilant. It is clear that we still have some challenges ahead before we can say that we have a robust and effective global scheme delivering what it is supposed to deliver. We also have to watch out to see whether and how our partners will translate these international measures into the concrete operationalisation of CORSIA rests on domestic action. As agreed, the Commission will submit a new proposal to amend the ETS Directive, with the aim of implementing CORSIA in a way that is consistent with our climate target. Finally the text agreed by the co-legislators contains an empowerment to adopt delegated acts on monitoring, reporting and verification of the emissions, and this is in order for the European Union to be able to implement CORSIA in that regard. Honourable Members, in our view the agreed text strikes a good balance between the leadership we should continue to have by addressing aviation emissions, the reinforced European Union ETS, and the responsiveness of European Union policies to international developments, notably the expected operationalisation of the scheme based on the assessment of their robustness and their effectiveness, which you asked the Commission to produce. I am confident it can get wide support in the European Parliament so that the legislation can enter into force early next year as planned.

Ich kann nicht für die EVP sprechen. I could try. Aviation is the largest, fastest—growing sector when it comes to CO2 emissions. It is not the biggest contributor on its own, but as the fastest—growing sector, it is incumbent on us to take action on it. It would make a mockery of the Paris Accord were we not to do so. The ICAO scheme, CORSIA, which will commit to carbon—neutral growth by 2020, is of course a very welcome step forward. Actually I have a grudging respect and admiration – a genuine admiration in fact – for ICAO, the work that they do and the fact that they have adapted to the needs to tackle climate change. You look surprised, Bas, but it is true. The admiration is real. But of course we cannot rely solely on these processes, because we know that they are not transparent and we do not know what the final result will be. But the Commission and the Council both started this process by saying they wanted indefinite exemptions for international flights from the ETS. This would of course give a blank cheque, and it is frankly an absurd idea, given that we do not know what the outcome of the ICAO process will be. So the deal of putting a limit on the exemption to 2023 is an excellent step, and this Parliament should congratulate itself on having ensured that. I pay tribute, as ever, to the work of the rapporteur, Ms Girling, for helping to secure that, as well as the work of all the other groups that supported her. It is not only the right thing to do: it also puts pressure on ICAO to deliver a CORSIA package that would be ambitious and would prevent the European Union from placing international flights under the ETS. It is obviously not in ICAO’s interests to do so, and we would therefore want them to be as ambitious as possible. However, it is essential that this process is transparent. The Aarhus Convention obliges signatories to grant access to the public to information, participation and access to justice. This process is opaque and is in contravention of these principles. One final point: there is an amendment saying that there should be protection for UK companies for the ETS scheme against UK companies dumping. My appeal to the UK Government is to just commit now to being in the ETS. We know what the outcome of phase one means.

Last month, once again in Montreal, ICAO showed how important it is that we have at least one instrument to keep pressure on the ICAO process when the ICAO council decided to take over only two of the 12 sustainability criteria for biofuels that their own environment committee had proposed.  It’s a very, very weak outcome of the sustainability criteria for biofuels and the same might happen with the offsetting criteria that are being set by ICAO. It’s very strange that an organisation like ICAO, which does not have any real knowledge about this, is dealing itself in the criteria for offsets.  At the same time, in the EU with the ETS we’ve had a very bad experience with offsetting, with huge windfall profits being made and almost destroying our system. So I’m very happy that we are keeping pressure on them by emphasising the transparency that will be asked for by all European institutions. Finally, Mr President, I would like to emphasise the need for further technological breakthroughs. In the end it’s the only way to limit CO2 emissions from the aviation sector.

The way in which you dealt with his file is really appreciated, as is the way in which you managed to get a broad majority in this House on board. That was a very good job on a not necessarily easy topic, so in that sense, I offer my congratulations.  So what does this deal really mean? It means that aviation for intra-EU flights will now also come under the decreasing cap of emission trading, which was not the case until now. Until now, they were part of ETS but they got a lot of free allowances and no decrease in caps. Finally, some shortage of emission allowances will hit this sector, because in the end every sector needs to play its role. Until now, aviation has been excluded. But that’s only for intra-EU flights. Of course, for international flights outside the EU we still have an exemption and we still rely on the international organisation ICAO. First of all, I would like to stress to the Commission, which sometimes gets cold feet when making new proposals, for example on maritime and on shipping emissions, that if there is one thing that is very clear from this experience, it is that if the EU did not take a step in 2008, ICAO would never have come to the deal that they have on the table now. EU policies do influence global policies, and the Commission should not shy away from it, rather it should learn from it and step up its efforts regarding the maritime sector, because that is the only other sector still not playing any role.  But secondly, we still have to wait and see what ICAO is really going to deliver. We know that ICAO has now delivered on their principle, but many countries still said that they do not agree with the target of a neutral greenhouse gas growth path after 2020. We do not yet know how many countries will really fulfil that target. Thirdly, they allowed for huge offsetting for themselves, and that’s why I looked a bit surprised at my colleague Seb Dance, who talked about admiration for ICAO. I think that’s a bit too early. We need to know what they’re going to deliver, and how they are going to develop their offsetting scheme is going to be key. If we had just said ‘okay, we trust the global deal and that’s it’, we would have made a very big mistake. That is why it is good that we time-limited the derogation until 2023. I would have loved to be a bit stricter, but I can live with this compromise. ICAO has until 2023 to deliver on an offsetting scheme, otherwise the EU needs to take action on its own.

In this sense, the ETS is an essential tool for an economically efficient reduction of these emissions.

Neither in this House nor at all in the European Council is there currently the courage or majorities to set a minimum price for CO2 certificates, at least temporarily. Without fundamental reforms, I consider the ETS to be downright fraudulent and a classic example of greenwashing of polluting sectors such as aviation. Aviation emissions are projected to be 70% higher in 2020 than in 2005 and could increase by a further 300 to 700% by 2050. The current system will not change that in any way, and you know that, ladies and gentlemen.

My skepticism is based on three points. First: CORSIA will only cover around a fifth of global climate / flight emissions, because it does not apply to domestic flights or to emissions other than carbon dioxide. Second, it is not yet clear how the emissions will be offset. So far we have had bad experiences with compensation worldwide. It is not for nothing that EU member states will no longer be allowed to use offsetting projects for their national climate targets from 2021 onwards. Third, what I also want to emphasize: Offsetting greenhouse gas emissions is only the second-best solution. We have to get as close as possible to the goal of not emitting any greenhouse gases at all. Therefore, in my opinion, technical solutions that prevent emissions at the source are better. To sum up my points of view: Climate-impacting emissions from aviation concern us all. The civil aviation organization should therefore develop a process that is transparent and involve the public more closely.

Thank you, Madam Commissioner, that is no problem at all with me, and I’ll be very brief anyway. I’d just like to give my final thanks to the shadows. It is rather ironic that we are here talking about an aviation item, when so many people have been unable to make what I know they saw as a very important debate, and because of aviation difficulties.  I would just like to make a couple of points: I think we all agree that aviation has to pay its way in the same way as road and rail transport do, and that the GMBM, whilst not perfect, does encompass our principles of protecting the single market and preventing unfair competition. It is the only game in town when it comes to a global measure. So we do need to stand by it, but we also need to be really, really clear that it is going to take some really careful watching. I appeal to all of the colleagues who will be here when I will sadly not be, over the next several years, to make sure that they hold both the Commission and ICAO’s feet to the fire on this issue and that when we get reports, as we’ve seen this week, about biofuels and how ICAO have reneged on commitments made only a short time ago, that must signal alarm bells that we need to use the mechanisms laid down in this report to hold them to account.  And finally, for the record, for my colleague Mr Dance, I would like to agree with him that the UK Government should indeed signal, as soon as possible, that they intend to continue commitments under both this and the main ETS scheme. There seems absolutely no reason why they should not, and indeed I would encourage them to do so – and do – at every opportunity.

The European Union is not just a set of institutions or a banking union, important as it may seem to us. If the European Union means anything, it means citizenship. It means the rights and freedoms of five hundred million people. It means equality before the law and the end of discrimination. It means being part of the largest democratic space in the world. This is what makes Europe an example for all countries. A political and moral space that offers an alternative to powerful authoritarian models in the economic, such as the Chinese, or threatening in the military, such as the Russian. For this reason, I am very proud to be the rapporteur for this report, on which I would like to highlight a few points. We ask to unblock the negotiations for the European Directive to combat discrimination, which has been in the drawer for a decade. And we ask for the decisive participation, especially of the Member States. There cannot be a single trace of discrimination, for whatever reason, in the Union. There can be no true citizenship without security. For this reason, the report calls for a European security agenda against any present or future terrorist threat, which includes the harmonization of actions in the Member States and which, in my opinion, must pass through European intelligence services. Against global dangers, European solutions. The prevention, detection and deactivation of radicalization is also an essential security element. We need to equip ourselves with programs and resources to meet the challenges of our open and multicultural societies. Europe fails every time a young European goes over to the side of those who want to destroy it. Citizens have a close relationship with the truth. If we don't know the facts, our rights will be in jeopardy. Europe must equip itself with the tools to fight against propaganda and fake news, which seek to undermine democracy and which, too often, come to us under the patronage of authoritarian regimes. Gender equality is another of the fields in which we play the true meaning of citizenship. It is time to finalize accession to the Istanbul Convention and to enact a Directive against gender violence. It is time to help, in short, to tear down the wall of silence that protects those who harass and abuse women. Many countries of the European Union have been among the first to recognize the rights of the LGTBI collective, but citizenship cannot be divided, so we must ensure that such rights are respected equally in any country of the Union. Today, many Europeans with different forms of disability find it impossible or very difficult to exercise their right to vote. Given that without suffrage there is no citizenship, it is urgent to remove obstacles immediately. Also the bureaucratic obstacles and the excess of paperwork and instances that become an obstacle to the rights of Europeans. We propose that the Union's offices in member countries become one-stop shops that facilitate access to Union information and services. And speaking of citizenship, it is inevitable to mention Brexit. For the first time, a Member State will cease to be a Member State if course is not corrected. And I want to remember, as I always do, that Article 50 is reversible. Perhaps we have not done enough so far to explain what it means to leave the European Union in terms of rights, in terms of citizenship. No one will win out of the UK, but the British will lose rights that - I'm sure - they will end up missing. In short, when we celebrate 25 years of the Maastricht Treaty, when we celebrate 25 years in which for the first time we gave a letter of nature to European citizenship, I want to to thank all the shadow rapporteurs, all the teams that have helped us to produce this consensus report, worked in collaboration with the Commission, which I hope will be a very powerful tool so that this third report on citizenship is whatwe need to have it in our hand to make it effective.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 105, "date": "2017-12-11.json", "name": "Csaba SÓGOR", "mepid": "39724", "text": "  rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs. – Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur for her work in this vital area of European construction.

Nothing highlights better, the value of these achievements and the problems painfully exposed by the Brexit process for the lives of millions of citizens facing great uncertainty and anxiety regarding their future. But EU citizenship is far from being a finished project. If I were to point out one single aspect that is conspicuously missing today from this endeavour, it would be the effective protection of EU values in the case of autochthonous minorities. EU minority citizens who are still subject to discriminatory practices today rightly feel that this gap needs to be addressed.

It is a powerful sign that we, as Europeans, belong to a union of common values.

All EU citizens can stand and vote in both local and European Parliament elections in their state of residence, and all citizens have the right to participate in a European ... (The speaker was interrupted by the President following interpretation problems.) In addition, every citizen of the Union has the right to petition the European Parliament, and I use this opportunity to recognise the work undertaken by the Parliament’s Committee on Petitions to help our citizens protect and enforce their EU rights. EU citizenship is also inextricably linked to equality. EU citizens have the right to be treated equally regardless of their nationality. Our citizens are protected by the Union’s legislation and actions against discrimination based on sex, racial or ethnic group, religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation. The regular EU Citizenship Report is a demonstration of the Union’s continuing commitment and outreach to its citizens. It gives us the opportunity to reflect together on what the EU can do better to improve and strengthen the rights of EU citizens.  I thank Parliament for the structured input it gave to the Commission for this year’s report. I would also like to thank the rapporteur, Beatriz Becerra Basterrechea, for her tireless work in steering Parliament’s reaction to the Commission’s report to its conclusion.  The Commission Citizenship Report 2017 priorities include the promotion to the status of EU rights and values of: participation in democratic life, simplification of the daily lives of our citizens and strengthening security. In relation to each priority, the Commission has set out in the report its ongoing and future activities for delivering.  My short intervention does not allow me to do justice to all the activities, but let me say a few words on two particular areas of action. Firstly, as regards both promoting EU citizenship rights and enhancing participation in the democratic life of the Union, our research showed that on average only 54% of EU citizens were aware of their right to vote and stand in municipal elections in their country of residence. We are committed to improving this figure by raising awareness on electoral rights and developing best practices to make it easier for EU citizens to vote in both local and European elections. Secondly, on free movement, rights and security, the Commission’s 2018 work programme will include two specific initiatives to enhance EU citizens’ rights to consular protection when traveling outside of the EU. We are currently looking at improving the security features of the EU common format emergency travel documents. The aim is to improve the security of EU documents used to cross our common external borders. At the same time, we will be raising awareness of our EU citizens’ right to consular protection by the authorities of any Member State.  We are looking at options to improve the security of EU citizens’ national identity cards and residence documents. The aim is to improve the security features of such documents to address security gaps and document fraud, and to help remedy practical obstacles faced by EU citizens. To conclude, promoting, protecting and strengthening EU citizenship is a challenge for us all. Raising awareness and encouraging our citizens to use their rights is part of the challenge, but we also need to remove obstacles to improve the operation of such rights and to ensure effective enforcement. I count on you to make this happen.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 107, "date": "2017-12-11.json", "name": "Krystyna ŁYBACKA", "mepid": "124883", "text": "author of the draft opinion of the Committee on Culture and Education. - Mr Chairman! European citizenship rests on two pillars. The first is the knowledge of the rights of European Union citizens, while the second is the uniform observance of these rights for every citizen. In both these aspects, education, culture and art play a huge role. It is thanks to education at every level of education that we can spread knowledge about common European values, as well as about the rights enjoyed by EU citizens. But for this dissemination of knowledge to be appropriate, it is necessary to have substantive support from teachers and educators so that they can include information on citizenship rights in the teaching process. Thanks to culture and art, we can foster a sense of European belonging and stimulate intercultural dialogue, which is of great importance for the integration of migrants. Programs like Erasmus +, Creative Europe, and Europe for Citizens are programs that pursue these goals.

Dear Mrs. Becerra Basterrechea, Colleagues! It feels good to talk about such a positive topic at the last meeting of the year. The joint work within the Committee on Petitions has paid off: we can put a report on the table that will add new elements and strengthen the institution of EU citizenship. I consider it important to draw the European Commission's attention to communicating the rights and obligations of EU citizenship to EU citizens, especially young people, in a consistent manner, and to provide in-depth information on the EU's role, not only at EU level but also at Member State level. too. I would also like to highlight the situation of indigenous, ie historical, minorities, who are also covered in the report for a few paragraphs. I note that every tenth citizen of the European Union has a connection to historical minorities, and I myself belong to such a minority. Sometimes these people, these EU citizens, are discriminated against overtly or covertly, and we all still have a lot of work to do to resolve this issue.

All forms of discrimination are major issues in citizens' reports: discrimination based on gender, nationality, sexual orientation, language, ethnic origin. People with disabilities face significant problems in their daily lives, at work, in access to medical care, in education, in the European Disability Card and in matters relating to the implementation of the Marrakech Convention in the European Union. The requirement of European Union citizens to exercise their voting rights even when residing in another European Member State is a frequent subject of reference, so we must ensure that every citizen has the right to vote in any country of the European Union. Free movement is one of the strong achievements, as it gives the citizens of the European Union the right to travel, study, do business, work and live harmoniously in other countries. In recent years, however, there has been a growing number of reports related to the problems faced by citizens in the European Union in relation to their rights to free movement. We must find solutions immediately without further delay, because this is not just a simple exercise of citizens' rights guaranteed by the Treaties and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, but directly linked to its very image and acceptance by them. citizens, as they touch the core of their interests, relate to their daily lives.

I think that is something which is very powerful. We need to look at how we can build on that for those who will be able to enjoy that in future. What we’re certainly learning from this experience – and indeed we see this in the report – is the importance of clear information to citizens, the right to good administration, so that the rights that they have are developed. But we do need, and we thoroughly agree with the report here, on the need to extend the work on anti—discrimination. European citizenship is an unfinished task at the moment, so we need to strengthen the anti—discrimination legislation, strengthen people’s access to the law to defend their rights and indeed to strengthen the tools that citizens have.  I think we should also look at the fact how shameful it is that even within the European Union now we have people who’ve lived here for years, whose family have lived here for years and yet are still stateless. We need to pay attention to the gaps that we see opening between Member States when people move – the loss of voting rights, the loss of nationality and potentials, and how that will affect children – the way in which different states have a different attitudes towards dual nationality and indeed different attitudes to the treatment of the right to family life, because we’re talking here about citizens, not just workers.

Part of this Parliament still does not want to face reality: the EPP Group's request to remove all references to austerity policies is paradoxical. It is now clear to everyone how the austerity policies have caused the worsening of social inequalities and the increase in poverty, and certainly have not contributed to the full enjoyment of the rights guaranteed by European citizenship.

The least we can say is that it failed! European austerity policies have produced tens of millions of poor people in Europe. It is the sacrifices of ultraliberalism, for whom European citizenship is expressed by appalling rights, which are the mark of their despair: the right to social downgrading for all those who have lost their job or who have never found one. , the right of the Greeks to go to the soup kitchen and even the right of French farmers, pushed to the limit by a common agricultural policy gone mad, to commit suicide.

Vain promise, when we know that the European Commission illegally buries petitions which it displeases, starting with those which protested against TAFTA. On the other hand, she puts forward those that she likes, such as, for example, the petitions which protested against Brexit. Violated or exploited, as the case may be, the right to petition is only a democratic alibi intended to camouflage the oligarchic nature of the Union. The second remedy is just as hypocritical, strongly recommended by the majority of the European Parliament. It consists - I quote from paragraph 31 of its motion for a resolution - in clearly defining a European policy to combat anti-European propaganda, an admirable antiphrase by which the Union accuses the sovereignists of propaganda when it is it who practices it. massively and with our money.

Being a European citizen has to mean much more than it does so far. It has to comfort, it has to give confidence, it has to protect, give autonomy. It has to be a source of pride. It has to mean so much that no European citizen wants their country to leave the Union because if such a thing happens, the people of it will lose something very valuable. Being a European citizen means being part of a legal and values ​​framework, and that is the integrity of European citizenship. Mr. Solé previously expressed a supposed contradiction in this report about how the provisions of the treaties, which is territorial integrity, that is, the legal framework that protects us, were made compatible with the possibility that a number of citizens decided to change that territorial integrity. The desire or the will remains within the realm of the particular, but the law always prevails over the desire of some. The law is what protects us. The law is what makes us be part of this project and guarantees us the rights that make us feel protected. For this reason, I want to remind the Members who have been accompanying me in this report - which has been laborious, but I think it is very valuable - that we must remember every day what we do here, who we represent, who has brought us to this seat. That they are neither more nor less than five hundred million European citizens, who are the ones who occupy the center of this Chamber. All of them. Because each of us represents all of them, not just those who have chosen us. If we do it for real, if we represent properly and are also citizens - because no one can tell us that those of us who are MEPs are not citizens, we must be the first to set an example and defend that citizenship - we will prevent populism and nationalism destroy the basis of this incomparable unity project.Thank you all very much and I hope your vote is in favor tomorrow.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 138, "date": "2017-12-11.json", "name": "Bogusław LIBERADZKI", "mepid": "23768", "text": "Thank you very much, the rapporteur.If I am permitted, I would just like to note that the Commissioner participated in most of our debate, and her delay was justified and she was replaced by Commissioner Bulc, which I would like to appreciate.I close the debate.The vote will take place on Tuesday.Written declarations (Rule 162)", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 139, "date": "2017-12-11.json", "name": "Doru-Claudian FRUNZULICĂ", "mepid": "124790", "text": "  in writing. – At the core of the European Union lie European citizens and their rights.

Parliament supports the agreement but calls for the human rights situation to be improved. It is good that this agreement strengthens political dialogue and cooperation with civil society. Respect for human rights and the rule of law form the basis of this agreement and future cooperation. The agreement strengthens the deepening of political and economic cooperation with Kazakhstan, an important country in Central Asia. The European Union is Kazakhstan's largest investor and a very important trading partner. The country is also important in implementing the European Union's strategy for Central Asia. Cooperation will strengthen trade, energy and sustainable development issues, as well as closer cooperation in foreign and security policy, for example in the fight against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and terrorism. On human rights issues, Parliament needs tangible and concrete reforms. Economic interests must not trample on human rights but must go hand in hand. Europe will lose its soul and its ideas if and when other priorities override human rights. This European Parliament resolution calls for the recognition and safeguarding of freedom of expression, assembly and association. The rule of law also requires an independent and impartial judiciary. We encourage Kazakhstan to continue working with the Venice Commission to improve legislative work. Parliament called on Kazakhstan to comply with the agreements of the International Labor Organization (ILO) and to allow an independent trade union movement to operate, and to release three trade union leaders from prison. The ability of journalists and NGO activists to act must be safeguarded. We now think that Kazakhstan has the eleventh moment changes the country’s laws that restrict workers ’rights. It is certainly not acceptable for those who protest peacefully against land reform to be sentenced to up to five years in prison. Parliament demands that Maks Bokayev and Talgat Ayan be released from prison, as called for by the UN Human Rights Council. Freedom of the press has also been curtailed and the work of critical journalists has become increasingly difficult. Again, it is not acceptable to restrict the work of journalists and civil society activists. Parliament called on the High Representative, Federica Mogherini, to say: Once the enhanced partnership and cooperation agreement has entered into force, a comprehensive system of democratic scrutiny between the EU and Parliament must be put in place. Parliament very much welcomed the human rights dialogue that had begun and hoped that Kazakhstan would ensure regular cooperation with representatives of civil society.

This Agreement is the very first of this kind in Central Asia and reflects the new level of ambition in our relations with one of the EU’s closest partners in the region. Our relationship with the Central Asian countries has never been stronger. The EU and our partners in Central Asia share many common objectives: regional peace and stability, fighting terrorism, fostering the rule of law, increasing prosperity and trade. The reinforced cooperation between the EU and Kazakhstan is an excellent example of how to advance in practice the goals and interests shared by both sides. To begin with, the Enhanced Partnership and Cooperation Agreement provides for a new level in the quality of our economic cooperation. The EU has become Kazakhstan’s first trade partner, representing over one third of its external trade, and also Kazakhstan’s first foreign investor. The Agreement promotes a better regulatory environment for economic operators in areas such as trade in services, the establishment and operation of companies, capital movements, raw materials, government procurement and intellectual property rights. We appreciate Kazakhstan’s commitment to promote the green economy with ambitious targets for economic diversification and investments in energy efficiency. These areas represent significant opportunities for European companies. The Enhanced Partnership reflects this progress in our energy cooperation, as this is the first time that we have concluded a chapter on raw materials and energy in a non—preferential agreement with an oil-producing country with rules going beyond WTO and Energy Charter Treaty commitments. We have not only built strong economic ties with Kazakhstan, we are also keen on consolidating our cooperation in other fields such as in nuclear non—proliferation, further reforms towards pluralism and democracy, and also to enhance the mobility of people between the two regions. In international relations, Kazakhstan has become an increasingly important partner in the promotion of peace and security. It provides an essential contribution to the implementation of the EU Strategy for Central Asia, notably in the EU’s regional cooperation programmes and platforms. Finally, we should not forget that democratic reforms play a crucial role too. The Agreement puts a strong emphasis on democracy and the rule of law, human rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as civil society cooperation, including on the involvement of civil society in public policy-making. On 29 November, the EU and Kazakhstan held their ninth Human Rights Dialogue. The EU has been promoting a more active role for civil society in the implementation of the Agreement. Ahead of the dialogue, we have held consultations with civil society representatives, both in Brussels and in Kazakhstan, and we have discussed specific recommendations from civil society that were then reflected in the dialogue with the Government of Kazakhstan. Moreover, just before the dialogue, our EU delegation in Astana visited an imprisoned civil society activist, Max Bokayev. The EU discussed his situation, as well as several other individual cases of human rights activists and journalists, during the dialogue. Notably, it was confirmed to us that former head of the Union of Journalists, Seitqazy Mataev, who was sentenced to six years in prison last year, was granted early release this month. Finally, the specific issue of trade unionists and the independence of trade unions were specifically discussed. Kazakhstan committed to amend its law on trade unions to bring it in line with the Agreement provisions and the conventions of the International Labour Organization. The EU also finances a substantial programme that contributes to judicial reforms and supports the rule of law in Kazakhstan. In all of its actions, the EU seeks to be a stabilising factor and will continue to put forward the view that non—extremist political pluralism and broad participation are the best foundations for creating, maintaining or strengthening the resilience and security of Central Asian societies. On other aspects of our mutual relations with Kazakhstan, we broaden our political dialogues on trade, customs, energy, transport, environment and climate change. We are now further enhancing the Humans Rights Dialogue and consultation with civil society representatives. More exchanges of views will follow during the Cooperation Council with Foreign Minister Abdrakhmanov, planned for 26 February in Brussels. Let me conclude by stating that the Enhanced Partnership and Cooperation Agreement has started to bear fruit and to produce successful common projects. This agreement with Kazakhstan is an excellent precedent for our relations with other countries in Central Asia. Negotiations for an Enhanced Agreement with Kyrgyzstan will start later this month, and we are hopeful for enhanced relations with Uzbekistan. The EU will continue to press for more open markets, both in the WTO and in our bilateral agreements, to spur economic growth and trade, as well as democratisation and sustainable development in Central Asia.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 143, "date": "2017-12-11.json", "name": "Eduard KUKAN", "mepid": "96651", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, Madam Commissioner, colleagues, first: congratulations to the Republic of Kazakhstan on celebrating the 26th anniversary of its independence later this week, on 16 December.

Freedom of speech and freedom of assembly and association are being attacked by the authorities, who have organised a crackdown against free voices in Kazakh society. Kazakhstan is publicly neglecting its international human rights obligations. Politically motivated criminal prosecutions are becoming more frequent and demonstrate that the authorities are unwilling to accept dissident voices.  I am very concerned by the detention of political prisoners and the ongoing use of torture. Human rights organisations have registered more than 35 cases of persons subjected to politically motivated prosecution for civil and trade union activities, for public criticism of the authorities, for participating in peaceful rallies, for publishing and sharing posts on social media, and for conducting journalistic investigations. This is so in the case of Mr Max Bokayev, a Kazakh civic activist, Mr Mukhtar Dzhakishev, Mr Iskander Yerimbetov, and Mr Muratkhan Tokmadi – political prisoners who fell victim to the lack of proper medical care. They need urgent hospitalisation, but are subject to ill-treatment and severe torture instead. So I hereby call on the Kazakh authorities to release all political hostages and cease further human rights abuses.  As I told the Kazakh Government in a letter I sent out two months ago, I believe that the fulfilment of Kazakhstan’s international human rights obligations should be a non—negotiable condition for the ratification of the Agreement, and as this condition is not yet met, I will be voting against the Agreement.

Cooperation between the European Parliament and the Central Asian states is important to promote political dialogue and to promote economic and cultural interaction.

Moreover, a collaboration that is structured around international obligations. Kazakhstan is a strategic partner in the energy sector. The EU is Kazakhstan's main trading partner. However, there is still work to be done on democracy, despite recent positive developments in constitutional and administrative reform, and Kazakhstan is now cooperating with the Venice Commission.

The cooperation agreement with Kazakhstan was signed in December 2015 two years ago and has already been ratified by 18 European Union Member States.

As Mr Kukan has already mentioned, this vote is taking place on a very significant day for Kazakhstan, because 16 December is Independence Day and 26 years is a very small year in the country's development compared to countries with hundreds of years of democratic experience. Kazakhstan is a stable, predictable and constructive partner of the European Union with a very important role in the region, with a very important role in Central Asia. Kazakhstan is a guarantor of security, stability and the fight against terrorism in the region. They ensure not only the security of our own country and our neighbors, but also, to a large extent, the security of us, the European Union. The new agreement is an important tool for both businesses and citizens. It is a new platform to develop new forms of cooperation, to invest in this country in order to receive investment in the European Union. Of course, there are still many problems, but the main thing is the direction, and the direction is very positive. I therefore call for a vote on this agreement tomorrow. The European Union wants to be at the forefront, it wants to be an influential player in foreign policy, so it needs to be more active, and the rest of Central Asia is also waiting for such agreements.

According to Human Rights Watch, against the backdrop of an economic recession, the Kazakh authorities imprisoned peaceful protesters in 2016, prosecuted independent journalists and activists, and furthermore, laws were passed in Parliament imposing unjustified burdens and restrictions on the Civil society organizations. The OSCE Election Observation Mission noted that the 2016 parliamentary elections had serious errors and irregularities during voting and counting and concluded that Kazakhstan's legal framework restricts fundamental civil and political rights.

No, it is no longer this aggressiveness because we no longer have the means to do it, especially after the repeated failures of enlargement. After the threatening stick, we now prefer the benevolent carrot of support for the countries of the Eurasian Economic Union, but to put them in our camp. We risk failure once again, because Central Asia is one of the most dangerous areas in the world, where a big game is played between Americans, Chinese and Russians.

The resolution aims to clarify the political, economic and cultural relations between the Community and Kazakhstan, based on commitments from both sides. They refer to common values ​​such as democracy, the rule of law and human rights. It should be emphasized that freedom of the media and freedom of expression are a fundamental part in creating a sustainable democracy. Unfortunately, the EU is concerned about a bill that tries to impose strict rules on journalists from above. It should be remembered that the EU countries are the first trading partner for Kazakhstan, and Kazakhstan is the main partner for Central Asia. The agreement is in line with the EPCA (European Petrochemical Association) to strengthen relations in sectors such as sustainable development, foreign and defense policy, justice and trade. In addition, it underlines the importance of the current trade relationship, which mainly covers oil and gas. The report highlights the large dimensions of the relationship with the international workforce, environmental protection, human rights including health, security, education, impartial institutions and the fight against corruption.

Commissioner Malmström and some of our INTA International Trade Committee colleagues working on this important topic cannot be here as they are in Buenos Aires for the WTO ministerial. But the good news is that both here and in Argentina we are working on European leadership towards rule- and value-based trade. After intense and fruitful cooperation among the shadow rapporteurs, I am happy that we can present a broadly supported call for an EU strategy on digital trade, and hopefully our resolution with broad support can inspire a common position from the Commission and thus the European Union. So why are digital trade rules important at all? Digitisation is becoming a key element or a layer of almost every industry or sector. Small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as larger companies, can reach customers all over the world at the click of a button. Digitisation and universal and affordable access to the internet are also key to achieving the sustainable development goals. But there are not only opportunities to be reaped; we also see challenges in growing digital protectionism. European companies that are being hindered by forced data localisation requirements and the lack of respect for people’s rights online is an increasing challenge worldwide. So what do we want to achieve with a digital trade strategy for Europe? Rules must defend the public interest. One of the trends that we see is that its private companies that are essentially setting the norms in the digital economy, from deciding what is and is not acceptable speech to proposals for entire online free-trade zones. But ensuring fair competition, protecting net neutrality and data protection rules cannot be left to private companies to safeguard. So an EU digital strategy should ensure that access to the open internet is prioritised globally, that data transfers are enabled while respecting privacy, and that encryption is understood to be essential for security. Currently, the EU relies on adequacy decisions to assess the level of data protection in third countries, and we’ve seen two such decisions with 20 of our trading partners, so there is a lot more that can be done. We need more agreements along with more predictable and transparent criteria. So I end with a note of hope. For the EU position at the WTO in Argentina, it is a related topic to this debate that we are having about digital trade. I hope that the Commission continues its efforts there towards developing a set of binding, multilateral disciplines on e-commerce and to transform the moratorium on banning tariffs on electronic transmissions into a permanent agreement. President, colleagues, the world of trade is rapidly changing and the EU has a key opportunity to lead. Not only is the USA taking a step back and China pushing forward, we also need to look at how digitisation changes the nature of the rules that we seek to ensure our principles remain leading, whatever we do in a changing world. I think here, with this EU Digital Trade Strategy, we once more have an opportunity to be rule-makers instead of rule-takers and we should take that opportunity.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 161, "date": "2017-12-11.json", "name": "Maria SPYRAKI", "mepid": "125064", "text": "- Mr President, we have a very important opportunity ahead of us, an opportunity that translates into numbers for five hundred million potential consumers.

The Commission considers your report an important contribution to the discussion on responses to the challenges brought by the digital revolution that we are witnessing all around us. Modern trade is increasingly enabled by digital technologies. Digital trade is therefore a priority for a variety of European industries.  The global e—commerce market is now estimated to be worth over EUR two trillion and continues to grow at a fast pace. The EU is the world’s largest exporter of services and is therefore in a strong position to benefit from the opportunities of digital trade. This highlights even more the role the EU should take in shaping the global rules on digital trade.  The Commission, in the Trade for All Communication, stated that the facilitation of digital trade constitutes an important part of EU trade strategy. This should be achieved within a trade and investment policy that is consistent with broader European values. Our digital trade strategy should ensure market access for European companies. It should at the same time ensure and deliver benefits from EU consumers who stand to benefit from a broader choice of products and lower prices, and always respect and fully safeguard the fundamental rights enshrined in the EU Charter. Many of the proposals made in the report concern issues that we already pursue in trade negotiations and that were tabled in the recent negotiations with Mexico and Indonesia. The agreement with Japan can also serve as a good example of the EU’s current approach on digital trade. Just to mention a few concrete examples: we included ambitious rules prohibiting mandatory source code disclosure, consumer trust enhancing rules such as disciplines on consumer protection, electronic trust services, electronic contracts and unsolicited communications such as spam. However, there are areas which will require further work. This will give us an opportunity to follow up, with you, in detail on other issues raised in the report. As regards data protection, the Commission made clear in its Communication on exchanging and protecting personal data in a globalised world that protecting personal data goes hand in hand with the promotion of free flows of data. The General Data Protection Regulation equips the EU with numerous tools to facilitate data flows, while ensuring that when the personal data of Europeans are transferred abroad the protection travels along with the data. This includes adequacy decisions, but also contractual arrangements.  We certainly take good note of the European Parliament’s position on the issue of data flows. We also took note of the European Council conclusions of October that highlighted the importance of ensuring adequate rules on data flows with third countries in trade agreements without prejudice to EU legislation. Within the Commission, a dedicated project team on data flows was set up in January. The Commission’s objective is to develop a proposal on how the EU should facilitate trade and tackle protectionist practices abroad, while ensuring that there is no possibility to use trade agreements to challenge existing and future EU legislation on personal data and privacy.  I can assure you that when it comes to privacy and personal data in trade agreements, the position of the Commission is crystal clear. Personal data protection is a fundamental right enshrined in Article 8 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. Therefore, trade agreements are not the place to set standards for, or to negotiate on, data protection rules.  Let me assure you that your observations and recommendations will be taken into consideration by the Commission so as to develop, in cooperation with the European Parliament, a digital trade strategy for the European Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 167, "date": "2017-12-11.json", "name": "Ioan Mircea PAŞCU", "mepid": "33984", "text": "The debate was closed.The vote will take place on Tuesday, 12 December 2017.", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 168, "date": "2017-12-11.json", "name": "Ioan Mircea PAŞCU", "mepid": "33984", "text": "The next item is one-minute speeches on matters of political importance (Rule 163).", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 169, "date": "2017-12-11.json", "name": "Andor DELI", "mepid": "124714", "text": "   – Mr President, the ‘roaming like at home’ rule was one of the most significant success stories of the EU this year.

Peace is not a matter of course, we must actively defend it in the face of spreading radicalism and nationalism.
