We need to secure an orderly withdrawal and put in place all the conditions for a transition period based on the status quo. We also need to outline the framework for the future relationship between the European Union and the United Kingdom. It is particularly important for us that there is no backsliding on the commitments from the Joint Report, especially with regard to the three key withdrawal issues, namely citizens’ rights, financial settlement and Ireland. The UK set itself the goal of getting the transition agreed in March, with the shared understanding that this is a part of the overall package that is to be finalised in October. During last week’s negotiations, some openings on the transition were made and there was also some movement on the area of withdrawal, but we need to treat these cautiously. We need real and sustained progress in order to meet our deadlines. Looking beyond the transition period, we are determined to build with the United Kingdom a broad and close partnership. Our commitment to seek such a partnership is shared by the Parliament, as reflected in your resolutions. In fact, even the very first guidelines adopted by the European Council already indicated the desired scope and nature of this partnership. It is also clear, at least from a negotiation perspective, that the understanding of the framework for the future relationship, which will be reflected in a political declaration accompanying the withdrawal agreement, cannot be more detailed than what we know of the UK position. In that respect, we have, in fairness, acknowledged that even though over the last fourteen months there has been a succession of speeches outlining the UK’s view on the future of our relations, we still need more concrete and more operational proposals. At the same time, there are no indications that the United Kingdom’s red lines have changed since last year. All this explains why the draft guidelines due to be adopted by the European Council on 23 March are not more detailed. This will hopefully provide the political space for broader dynamics of the negotiations with the UK.  In a nutshell, and again in reflection of the constraints set out by the UK’s position and by our principles and legal order, the forthcoming guidelines foresee that at the core of the partnership will be the elements of a free trade agreement (FTA) focused on goods, but also including services. Trade facilitation elements, such as customs cooperation, addressing barriers to trade, etc., are also envisaged. Two important sectors are also pointed out in the guidelines: fisheries and aviation, along with the basic principles that should govern cooperation on them. Then, taking into account the importance and the proximity of the UK, the guidelines foresee robust provisions on a level playing field. Securing fair competition between businesses on both sides of the channel is an important task, if we want a properly functioning and ambitious FTA. The same logic applies to governance: the closer our relationship, the stronger its governance should be. As mentioned before, the future partnership with the UK is meant to be broad. Beyond the economic dimension, it should also reflect the commonality of interests and threats we share with the UK. This is why in the proposed guidelines you see provisions on police and judicial cooperation, as well as on security, defence and foreign policy. The guidelines make it clear that a key point in this context is also preserving the autonomy of decision-making of the European Union. In that sense, the partnership we have in mind largely covers the same four pillars of possible cooperation suggested by your resolution. Let me conclude by recalling that, more than ever, our unity matters. This holds true for the unity of the 27 Member States, but also for unity among our institutions. In this respect, I am very much reassured by the broad convergence of the priorities set out in your resolution, and those flagged in the guidelines due to be adopted by the European Council. Thank you very much for your attention.

Dans 381 jours, le 29 mars 2019 à minuit, le Royaume-Uni aura quitté l’Union européenne. (Applaudissements sur certains bancs) (reacting to off-microphone comments by David Coburn and other Members of the EFDD Group) The time will come when you will regret your decision. Depuis les tout premiers jours de ces négociations uniques et difficiles, notre objectif a toujours été et restera de parvenir à un retrait ordonné du Royaume-Uni dans son intérêt propre et dans celui de l’Union européenne. Mais chaque jour qui passe, l’urgence de réunir toutes les conditions nécessaires d’un tel retrait se fait plus grande. Cette urgence doit nous inciter tous, l’Union européenne et le Royaume-Uni, à agir avec méthode, pragmatisme et transparence. Ce sont cette méthode, ce pragmatisme et cette transparence qui sont au cœur de la proposition de texte sur l’accord de retrait que la Commission a approuvée le 28 février dernier et qui ne fait que traduire juridiquement les engagements que nous avons pris ensemble, Commission et Royaume-Uni, en décembre dernier dans le rapport conjoint. Michel Barnier discute maintenant en détail de notre proposition de texte avec ce Parlement et avec le Conseil des ministres car le projet final sur l’accord de retrait, qui sera transmis à nos partenaires britanniques comme base de négociation, reflétera l’unité des 27 États membres de l’Union européenne et de ses institutions. Je voudrais remercier Michel Barnier et son équipe pour l’extraordinaire travail qu’ils fournissent depuis des mois, jour et nuit, pour mener à bien ces négociations. (Applaudissements) Mein Freund Michel Barnier, sein Team, wir alle stehen dafür, dass von unserer Seite aus strukturiert und besonnen vorgegangen wird. In diesem Sinne haben wir die Vereinbarungen, die wir gemeinsam mit dem Vereinten Königreich getroffen haben, in einen soliden Vertragstext gegossen, der vor allem die Rechte der Bürger präzisiert. Somit ist dieser Text weitaus mehr als eine Ansammlung von Paragrafen. Es geht hier um Zehntausende – if not more – Biografien. Wir stellen sicher, dass die Lebensentscheidungen dieser Menschen, der Bürger Europas, nicht dem Brexit zum Opfer fallen. Deshalb haben wir durchgesetzt, dass EU-Bürger im Vereinigten Königreich auch nach dem Brexit ihre Rechte behalten. Der Entwurf des Austrittsabkommens ist so konkret, dass sich Bürger auch vor britischen Gerichten darauf beziehen können, um ihre Rechte einzufordern.  Für die Zeit nach dem Austritt des Vereinigten Königreichs ist uns ebenfalls an einer engen Partnerschaft gelegen. Dabei muss allerdings die Einheit des Binnenmarktes gewahrt bleiben, denn Bürger wie Unternehmen müssen sich auf dessen Errungenschaft, auf gleiche Regeln und Institutionen, verlassen können. Ein Rosinenpicken, cherry picking, wird nicht möglich sein. Ebenso wenig werden wir zulassen können, dass Standards im Sozialen, Umweltstandards oder Steuerstandards unterboten werden. Mir wäre es lieber gewesen, die Briten hätten sich nicht dafür entschieden, auszutreten. Wer aber die Europäische Union verlassen will, muss ehrlich sagen, was das eigentlich heißt. Wer vier Jahrzehnte gemeinsamer Vereinbarungen und Lösungen hinter sich lassen will, muss die Verantwortung dafür übernehmen, dass nicht alles so bleiben kann, wie es ist.  Ten days ago, Prime Minister May give us some more clarity on how the UK sees its future relationship with the European Union. As my good friend John Bruton wrote in a recent article ‘the most valuable test that Ms May wishes to apply to a Brexit agreement is that it should be one that would endure and not require constant renegotiation’. I could not agree more, which means that everything that we say and that we do on both sides will require the utmost clarity to help us pass the test. It is obvious that we need further clarity from the UK if we are to reach an understanding on our future relationship.  We are preparing for this on the European Union side. Last week, President Tusk circulated draft guidelines that will be discussed by the leaders of the EU 27 next week. As the clock counts down – we have one year to go – it is now time to translate speeches into treaties, to turn commitments into agreements, and broad suggestions and wishes on the future relationship to specific workable solutions.  This is especially important when it comes to Ireland. Both the United Kingdom and European Union have agreed that there should be no hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. The Good Friday Agreement must be preserved in all its dimensions, and life for citizens on both sides of the border should be the same as it is today. Both sides agreed in December that there are three options to do this. The first is through the future partnership agreement if possible. The second is through specific solutions that the United Kingdom has said it will put forward. We are ready to work on these two options, but we need to receive concrete proposals from the United Kingdom first.  The third option is the backstop solution. It would apply only if the first two options do not materialise. This scenario would see full alignment on those tools that protect the Good Friday Agreement, North-South cooperation and the all-island economy. The draft protocol on Ireland should not come as a surprise or a shock. It translates faithfully last December’s agreement into a legal text.  The European Union, this House and the 27 Member States stand firm and united when it comes to Ireland. For us, this is not an Irish issue, it is a European issue.  (Reacting to off-microphone comment ‘it is a British issue’ by Mr Coburn) It is a European issue. It is all for one and one for all. That is what it means to be part of this Union. We pool our resources and our sovereignty to strengthen one another and to give ourselves more sovereignty when dealing with the rest of the world. We see this with Brexit. We see this with threats. We see this across the board. As we build our future together, we must continue to make each other stronger by working together and building a more united, stronger and more democratic Union. This must be our joint focus. We need to focus on our European future, not the past, not on Brexit.

Brexit is bad for all of us. What the negotiations are all about now is to limit damage. I hope that we will make the necessary progress, and I thank you for having the unity of the European Union, the institutions and the Member States. This is certainly also due to Michel Barnier, who discusses things with us in this transparent way. My group agrees with the draft withdrawal agreement, which will then have to comply with the conditions discussed in December regarding open borders for Ireland, the issue of finance and citizens' rights. We also believe that it is right to find a transitional regime, as provided for in the Treaty, if the UK is prepared to recognise the conditions of the European Union with the four freedoms with the four freedoms with the European Court of Justice for another 21 months — or whatever period. This is a prerequisite for us to have enough time to negotiate a trade agreement. It is repeatedly said — yesterday also by the Confederation of German Industries — that we should establish a customs union after all. Yes, I am in favour of a customs union, but the UK will have to meet the conditions. Britain has rejected a customs union, the UK has also refused membership of the internal market, following a solution to Norway because it is not prepared to meet the conditions for this. And that's why it's only left to negotiate a trade deal. I mean that this is a trade agreement with a third country. I think it is right that Theresa May admitted for the first time: if you no longer meet European standards, then you will have less access to the European internal market — with all the consequences of the smaller partner of the UK, what has seen there must be. We must also note that this attempt to remove individual sectors and have full access here is raisin picking. If Britain wants this only for those areas where it has particular interest, then it is not possible. If you quit a golf club and want to continue playing, you also have to pay a green fee. This is not a punishment, but a normal burden that needs to be made. After all, the Member States pay contributions and fulfil the obligations. This is an important point on how we need to move forward together. President Trump has taken action against Bombardier in the UK, is now announcing sanctions against Europe on steel and aluminium. Only if we all stand together — including the British — will we have a chance to tackle such a policy. That is why Europe's unity on such issues is a question of Europe's survival. This must also be understood by Mr Farage, who is plunging his own country into misfortune.

We are now at a decisive step in this titanic effort to secure an orderly withdrawal of the UK and reduce its negative impact to the maximum. And as it has always been, we will be constructive and demanding. Firstly, the December agreement must be legally translated so that citizens' rights are fully safeguarded, and this must apply even to the most vulnerable categories: it is not up to them, but the authority of the United Kingdom, ensure that not a single citizen is unfairly deprived of their rights. In this respect, the draft treaty, which we appreciate, should be further strengthened. Equally important is to avoid any tightening of the border in Ireland. One cannot criticise the solution responsibly outlined by the Commission: it is up to the UK Government to make compelling proposals, and this has not yet happened. Secondly, the transition must prolong the whole acquis communautaire, and therefore no discrimination against citizens is acceptable. We will not allow the goods to be treated better than people. Thirdly, for the future, we want a partnership between the European Union and the United Kingdom as close and as broad as possible, and we propose that it be defined by the framework of an association agreement. But this report will have to see an appropriate balance between rights and duties, and must ensure the integrity of the single market, the full autonomy of the legal order of the Union, the protection of stability financial. We note with regret that Theresa May has ruled out the single market and also the Customs Union. And if the UK Government revises this position, we will be ready to discuss a closer economic relationship. If this is not the case, we will work towards a trade agreement that minimizes barriers, particularly to the movement of goods, but which will not be able to eliminate them completely. It is good to clarify that the Union cannot delegate control of its customs borders to others, and that no mutual recognition of the rules exists outside the single market. Another thing is regulatory cooperation, and as far as financial services is concerned, clever use of the current equivalence system. In any case, we will not accept forms of social, environmental and fiscal dumping: the European Union must be a force that counteracts protectionism, but which protects citizens, workers and the environment. That is the challenge to which globalisation calls us, and we will be consistent with that vision even in negotiating with the UK.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "aws", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 6, "date": "2018-03-13.json", "name": "Peter van DALEN", "mepid": "96809", "text": " on behalf of the ECR Group. — (NL) Mr President, Brexit has only losers on both sides of the channel. Last week, a British report came out showing that all regions in the United Kingdom are going to be hit by Brexit. But other economies are also going to be affected. The Dutch economy is likely to cost billions. And the German BDI made it clear last week that a hard Brexit might cost an extra 9 billion. Fortunately, I see in the document recently published by Mr Tusk that the European Union is keen to maintain the status quo in a number of areas. I am thinking, for example, of fisheries, aviation, Erasmus, safety and trade in goods. That's the right direction. Let our negotiators also go for reasonableness and fairness. Do not make each other's throats, because even after 2019 our fishermen must be able to continue fishing, our companies can continue to export and import, and our students must continue to study across the border.

But it is not only a joke. Maybe you have to sort it out. As you know, I have no problem with Martin Selmayr. I think he is a very dedicated European and a very competent civil servant. No, the problem that we have is with the way the Commission handled this, and so you have to do something about this in some way, because it is bad for Europe and bad for the European Commission. (Applause) But, having said that, we are not the only ones who have to sort things out. The UK also has to do so because, as you have indicated Jean—Claude, the problem today is that we don’t have a proposal from the UK side on the future relationship with the Union. It is still lacking, and what you said is true. There was this Mansion House speech by Mrs May, but it was mainly repeating the red lines that we have already known about for two years, and I think that in the Mansion House speech what the Prime Minister did was to say, ‘Look, we cannot accept the rights of Canada and then the obligations of Norway’. Well I have to tell you that I don’t think that we have ever presented that proposal to the UK side. I think that the UK side has to understand that the opposite is also not possible. You cannot have the rights of Norway and then the obligations of Canada. That is also not possible.  So I think that, after all the speeches we have heard now, it is time that we go beyond what I would call the slogans and the soundbites, which is exactly what we try to do in our resolution. It is a long resolution, with more than 65 paragraphs, in which we present what I would call a concept, a vision and an architecture for the future because that is what is lacking for the moment, and an architectural vision that matches both sides: the red lines of the UK on the one hand with the vision and the principles of the European Union on the other side. What we do in the resolution – and can I say to the Council that this is a little different – is that we use the Treaty for that, namely Article 8 and Article 217, which say that in the neighbourhood of the European Union you have to create a special partnership with your neighbours and to do that we create an association with that country. So our proposal is to start negotiations on an association agreement between the UK and the EU, based on four pillars, one on trade and economics, one on internal security, one on thematic cooperation – for example, research, Erasmus, things like that – and, finally, one on external security and defence matters, because I think that is also a very important field of cooperation between both. For every one of these four pillars, what we do in this resolution is give the principles: what are the fields where we can cooperate, what are the different principles we have to apply, and anyway, what is the advantage of our proposal – and I hope that the Council will also recognise this in the coming days – is that we create one overall governance structure. It is not an inflation of bilateral arrangements, as we have with Switzerland, which will be a good basis for that special partnership, but one overall governance based on association. Last week I had the chance to discuss this with David Davis and also with the Prime Minister and I am quite confident that ultimately Britain will also see the advantages of such an approach, to have a decent, deep association partnership from both sides.  That brings me, finally, to the last paragraphs of our resolution on the rights of all citizens. Personally, it is my feeling that we are very near to an agreement with the UK side on citizens’ rights.

Ever since you became Prime Minister, I have carefully listened to you on Brexit. I do acknowledge your wish to make the best out of the inconvenient situation the referendum has put your country in, but I am still perplexed by the inner contradictions of your government’s positions. Indeed, arguing (a) that the United Kingdom will leave the single market and customs union; (b) that the United Kingdom Government will stand by its commitment to the Good Friday Agreement; and (c) that there will be no new regulatory barriers within the United Kingdom, is a trilemma that cannot be solved. This has nothing to do with the alleged stubbornness of the EU-27; it has everything to do with the stubbornness of facts. If regulatory divergence is real, it creates a border, and no magical thinking can ever erase it. Therefore, one of the three elements has to give, and I cannot imagine the British Government giving up on, or taking any risk with, peace in Northern Ireland. Therefore, it has to be (a) or (c). In our view, the only practical solution would be for the UK, or at least Northern Ireland, to remain fully within the single market and customs union. Taking into account your long relationship with us, and the fact that, of course, the UK would then have to apply EU law without being a part of the decision process, it would be fair to establish a privileged channel for your country to express concerns and suggestions. And I agree with you that we have to tailor the transition period to the practical imperatives, rather than align it with any pre-set dates. The end of that transition should also be the cut-off date of any change in the status of citizens, and we do welcome, as Guy just did, the very significant progress made over the last few months in that respect. A few issues remain to be tackled, however: the non-reversibility of rights, the rights of European residents with disabilities, the status of future spouses, the rights of third-country nationals, as well as voting rights. Our key concern is that no one ends up losing rights. If we want to be creative, we should consider basing citizens’ rights on residence rather than on nationality, which may provide at the same time certainty and simplicity.

I am sure you have registered over the past few months that my group has tried very hard to get involved in the discussion of the drafting of parliamentary positions to accompany the Brexit negotiations. We have done this mainly because the most important thing for us is that the rights of people, both in the UK, but also within the EU and, of course, especially in Northern Ireland, do not get under the wheels in the negotiations and cannot be abused by any side as a mass of negotiations. As far as these issues are concerned, we have already made some progress. We can no longer compare it with the first starting points. However, we will continue to ensure that, in particular, residence rights and the right of free movement for UK citizens within the EU must be respected. We should also think about this because, for example, the proposal put forward for the draft divorce agreement contains restrictions, particularly as regards the right of UK citizens in Member States to provide services to companies in other Member States. Obviously, that's something that came in at relatively short notice. We will continue to insist that the rights of citizens in Northern Ireland are respected. This is not just about rights that are simply being said, but this is really about all the existing international agreements to which we have committed ourselves and which defined democratic rights, social rights and human rights. One thing is clear: these rights are protected only by the Withdrawal Agreement, nowhere else. This is why we need this withdrawal agreement, and that is why we will keep coming to this Withdrawal agreements and join us here too. Of course, when it comes to negotiating a mandate for future relations, this also affects the ideas of the political parties, the political forces of the future of Europe, the future of the EU. That is why, of course, we as a group have a whole range of problems and also reject certain approaches, as proposed here in our resolution. They relate in particular to the proposals referred to in paragraphs 21, 22, 23, 24, on the organisation of external relations and the organisation of security relations in this cooperation. We will also be tabling amendments to this effect. Nevertheless, we have decided to co-sign the resolution because, as I said earlier, it is important for the continuation of the fight for the rights of people, of citizens in areas throughout the previous EU, but also in the areas or regions and countries that are affected by Brexit itself with emergence. We would also like to draw attention to the need for even greater protection of workers' rights, namely the rights of immigrant workers. We are also concerned with the issue of cross-border workers. Here, too, we have to follow up again, there is another need here, we still have some work to do here. In this context, I would like to signal that we will continue our group's work in a critical but very solidarity with regard to citizens' rights.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "aws", "politicalGroup": "GUE/NGL", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 11, "date": "2018-03-13.json", "name": "Nigel FARAGE", "mepid": "4525", "text": "  on behalf of the EFDD Group. – Mr President, two thirds of the British people think the European Commission is trying to bully us in these negotiations and they are right.

Of course it does, because the Europe of the Junckers, the Barniers and the Selmayrs is power without accountability. Well, at long last, you have met your match in Donald Trump. Now, you may well scream and shout about his aluminium and steel tariffs, but the EU puts tariffs on 13 000 goods coming into it, meaning that shoes and bras and food are more expensive for simple, ordinary folk who do not understand this because it has never been properly explained to them. The sheer hypocrisy of criticising Trump when you already have put tariffs on steel and aluminium amazes me, but it does show the folly of us going for a transition period. It shows the utter stupidity of the Labour Party, wanting to sign us up to this permanently, because in this USA dispute we now find ourselves trapped, impotent and unable to act. We need to be free. We voted Brexit, we voted to make our own trade policy and our own trade decisions. We could do a deal with America in 48 hours. We need to act.

Colleagues, the single market and the Customs Union are precisely the tools with which our countries have organised frictionless trade across Europe. You cannot walk out from them, abandon them and still have frictionless trade. The Customs Union also is a vital question when it comes to the Northern Ireland border.

Then there are the cracks in what holds the country together. How United really are England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland? How much are they desirous of remaining in the same state and, if so, on what terms? There is a crisis in the British constitution. Finally, there’s the centre-periphery problem. You probably all know this. London and the south-east, well that’s a powerhouse, but the further north one goes, the weaker things are economically, in terms of status, aspirations and power. That’s the way that peripheries work. Without a redistribution of power, of goods and status – status above all – the crisis of the United Kingdom will persist. And that signifies that the United Kingdom will be an uneasy partner for the European Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 34, "date": "2018-03-13.json", "name": "Pervenche BERÈS", "mepid": "1985", "text": " — Madam President, Mr President, the customs union and the internal market are behind us today in the relationship with the United Kingdom, since this country clearly leaves us only the Association Agreement as a possible way of the future relationship.

Secondly, it is important for everyone to understand that, in this extraordinary, complex, extraordinarily complex negotiation, our responsibility, yours, that of the Council and, of course, that of the Commission under President Juncker's authority, our responsibility is to preserve, for the future and for the long term, what we are, Union, our values, our identity, our single market, our common policies.

Earlier, Mr Hökmark and Mrs McGuinness also said this very forcefully. As we are in this negotiation, at the end of this debate, I want to share with you three messages. First, we must put things in the right order, as we have done from the beginning, to prepare and build a new ambitious partnership with the United Kingdom: the prerequisite — the prerequisite — is to organize its withdrawal in an orderly rather than disorderly manner. Roberto Gualtieri insisted on this point. Under the authority of President Juncker — whom I thank again for his confidence — the Commission — who is doing its job and doing the work you have entrusted to him — presented this comprehensive draft treaty fifteen days ago. Things are now clear, we can have them in your hands. The aim is, through the proposal of this comprehensive draft treaty, to accelerate and facilitate discussion with the British by now working on a legal text. As Danuta Hübner and President Juncker said very well earlier, the time is very short. It is short for the negotiation of the withdrawal agreement, it will be short for negotiation of any future relationship. It is also short — let me stress this — for the preparation that we must carry out in each of our countries and, together with stakeholders, to prepare for the inevitable consequences of Brexit, which the British have chosen. This preparation — I would like to say this and thank him — is also led, at Commission level, by our Secretary-General, Martin Selmayr. Time is short. We have points of particular vigilance on this text, which you have reminded each other in your speeches and which you recall, Guy Verhofstadt, in this resolution. Obviously, our common priority is, first and foremost, the citizens. We will stay until the end attentive — that is, until the time of ratification of this withdrawal agreement — to the guarantees we obtained in the joint report in December and on the effective implementation of all rights under simple and non-costly procedures. Mrs Miranda, you mentioned earlier, like Gabriele Zimmer, Barbara Spinelli, Jill Evans and Josef Weidenholzer, this priority issue of the rights of British citizens who live and work — and who have chosen to live and work — in one of our 27 countries, and, of course, of the three and a half million Europeans, among whom many students, who live and work in the UK. We also expect the United Kingdom to see a sincere commitment and progress in the coming days on all other issues, such as the governance of the Euratom Agreement. I could multiply the examples of the subjects that we have not completely negotiated, on which we do not yet agree, which are part of all the subjects of separation and which are essential to an orderly withdrawal. This, of course, also concerns the transition. We accept — European leaders have accepted, you have accepted — the British government's request, submitted by Theresa May, to include a transitional period in the withdrawal agreement. Obviously, in this short transitional period, in compliance with Article 50, all Union rules will have to be applied without distinction. For example, a citizen arriving during this transitional period — Mercedes Bresso mentioned this — will have to enjoy the same rights as the one who arrived before Brexit Day. There is a second point, obviously, that of our future partnership, referred to in your resolution. You draw, in this text, the architecture and content — as the European Council will do in a few days, under the authority of Donald Tusk — of this that this ambitious partnership with the United Kingdom could be. Guy Verhofstadt talked about the future association with this great country around four pillars, and I find myself in this architecture you propose. First, our business relationship. Mr. Sulík was talking about exchanges earlier. We must, of course, supervise this trade and continue to trade with the United Kingdom, including in this trade relationship — as Mr Vandenkendelaere, Mr Millán Mon or Mrs Miranda mentioned — a balanced agreement on the issue of fisheries. Secondly, thematic cooperation. Mr López Aguilar was talking about aviation, Mr Peter van Dalen was talking about research or universities — I could quote Erasmus. We will establish, in a regulatory financial framework different from today's — since the United Kingdom has chosen not to be in the Union anymore — a framework for cooperation to maintain this work with the British in the common interest. Thirdly, cooperation on justice, home affairs, police or judicial cooperation and, finally, of course, with this great country, a strategic partnership for foreign policy, security and defence. With regard to the first pillar, that of economic cooperation, as we speak, all models of cooperation with third countries are still on the table. They are available. We are open for business. It is the UK that is closing doors. I listened carefully to Theresa May's speech at Mansion House, which confirms the doors that the UK itself closes objectively by confirming red lines. Leaving the internal market, leaving the customs union, Elmar Brok recalled this red line earlier. Esteban Gonzáez Pons too. Retrieving regulatory and commercial autonomy, this was told earlier by several of you. Never be bound by the Court of Justice again, these are the red lines which the United Kingdom confirms. We take note of this, but then we have to make it clear. One cannot want both the status of a third country and at the same time ask for the benefits belonging to the Union and only to the Union, as Philippe Lamberts pointed out. We cannot and will not be able to use the à la carte internal market — Mr Lenaers earlier or Mr Danti said so — when it is an integrated ecosystem and the four freedoms, including freedom of movement, are indivisible and indivisible. We cannot want to participate in our agencies without the legal commitment to adopt and apply EU law and the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice. Mutual recognition of rules and norms cannot and cannot be sought from the outside, whereas this can only be based on trust, i.e. a common law, coherent supervision and a single jurisdiction. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, it is quite a surprising idea to believe that the 27 Member States of the Union and your Parliament could, in a way, accept convergence when the United Kingdom wishes and at the same time allow it to diverge when it comes to creating an advantage Comparative. To coin a sentence, it's time to face up to the hard facts. Mr Ferreira, Mr Lange and Mrs Scott Cato mentioned the question of standards in the United Kingdom — it will be a third and sovereign country — and then at home too. This is a very important point and it is a question I asked a few weeks ago and for which we have not yet received an answer from the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom chooses to leave the Union, chooses to leave the single market and the customs union. We take note of this. Does he also want to leave or move away from our regulatory model, the same one that we patiently built together with you and you with us for 44 years? A regulatory model that is not just a question of standards, standards or laws, behind which there are actually societal choices that we have made together: the social market economy, social protection, security and certain food models, financial regulation. I could cite other examples of these common societal choices we made at 28 which are translated, consolidated by this regulatory model. And this question is very important. Does the United Kingdom also want to move away from that model we built with it and embark on the path of regulatory competition, even dumping, against us? This issue is not only important — I say this in passing — for the economy itself, for citizens and for consumers. It is also very important for the political conditions for the ratification of any future relations agreement between us and the United Kingdom, because on that day it will be for the European Parliament to vote, for the Council as well, but also unanimously for the 27 national parliaments and perhaps even for some regional parliaments. And I recommend on this issue of the divergence, or even the risk of dumping, that we pay very close attention to the conditions for such ratification. Finally — this is my last point — there is the question of Ireland at the intersection of who we are, the European Union, and what Brexit means and means. Ms. McGuinness raised this point very forcefully. Everyone knows that the Union has played its role, has held its place for dialogue and peace in Ireland, to bring together and give a common horizon the conditions for stability and dialogue between formerly divided communities. The Union is not responsible for the consequences of Brexit, but it is accountable for this cooperation, stability and common future. That is why, as many have wished, a strong and lasting agreement on Brexit — listen to me well — on orderly withdrawal must include a solid and lasting solution for Ireland and Northern Ireland. That is the meaning of the protocol we have proposed in this draft withdrawal agreement. This option, the third option we have operationalized, is part of the joint commitments between us and the United Kingdom at the highest level, that of Theresa May, President Juncker and Donald Tusk. And this document only implements one of the options of the December joint report. I have already told you, Mrs Dodds, when we were seen in my office a few days ago, and I also tell Mr Nicholson that I always listen carefully, it is part of the options we have decided to study in order to provide concrete solutions. It is our responsibility to clarify operationally how we will avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland in the absence of alternative solutions and taking into account the decision of the United Kingdom to leave the single market and leave the customs union. And I will not stop repeating that this backstop solution, one of the three, is ready to replace it with any other better solution proposed by the British Government. This is something that Mr. Carthy or Richard Corbett mentioned earlier. In conclusion, Mr President Tajani, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, I simply want to confirm that the solidity and clarity of the Union's position, our unity on the subjects of withdrawal, as well as on the future, is what makes our strength in this negotiation. Obviously, this clarity and solidity would not be possible without the trust you place in our negotiating team and your negotiating team and we will continue to work as I said to the steering on Brexit, to Guy Verhofstadt, in a permanent attitude of dialogue and transparency with you. Mr President, I would like to thank you, Guy Verhofstadt and each member of the Brexit steering group, the chairmen of the groups and the chairmen of the committees, and your coordinators, for the quality and sincerity of our joint work, and I believe that the resolution you are going to adopt is essential for success of the steps we have before us.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "aws", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 75, "date": "2018-03-13.json", "name": "Monika PANAYOTOVA", "mepid": "116663", "text": " President-in-Office of the Council. — (FR) Mr President, since we share the same view on Brexit, following Mr Barnier's speech in French, I will also make my concluding remarks in French.

Our report also shows that the EP is still the most consistent and responsible player in limiting losses from the EU's point of view. That is why I support our negotiating directive that the future of EU-British relations should preferably be regulated in a modern association agreement, even if London's narrow-mindedness does not yet make it available. At the same time, the EP also has a major responsibility to ensure, with close supervision and complete unity, that the agreement has a balance of obligations and rights, to ensure the integrity of the single market, and to ensure the EU's legal and policy-making decisions because the non-Member State Great Britain cannot enjoy the same privileges to the detriment of the 27.

As usual for its spring meeting, the European Council will focus on jobs, growth and competitiveness. The overall picture is positive. The European economy is growing at a fast pace across Member States and unemployment is falling. Looking ahead, this robust performance is expected to continue in the coming years. The global environment, however, remains uncertain, and we need to continue to ensure the conditions to support confidence. One essential aspect, in order to foster jobs and growth and promote innovation, is to unlock the full potential of the Single Market. The European Council will address the different single market strategies, including when it comes to the Digital Single Market, the Capital Markets Union and the Energy Union, to ensure sustained progress. Delivering on these strategies in the current institutional cycle is a shared responsibility that will require co-legislators to continue to work closely on a number of legislative files and to speed up the process where necessary. Policy priorities under the European Semester also help create the right conditions for growth. We will have the opportunity to discuss this tomorrow night. The European Council will provide guidance on the priorities for 2018 and will be invited to endorse the recommendation on the economic policy of the euro area. The European Council will also return to social issues following the debate held in December. Last but not least, we know how vital trade is to our common prosperity in Europe and globally. That is why any attempts to undermine the rules-based multilateral trading system affect all of us. The European Union should play a leading role in opposing them. The European Council will discuss international trade relations following the US announcements. I know you will discuss this tomorrow and will review ongoing work in the field of trade policy and free trade agreement negotiations. Beyond the formal session of the European Council, leaders will also exchange views on taxation as part of the Leaders’ Agenda. They will hold an open debate, with a particular focus on the challenges associated with digital taxation. In keeping with the spirit of the Leaders’ Agenda, there will be no conclusions or formal outcome on this point next week. Finally, leaders of the euro area will meet in the margins of the European Council. They will hold an open debate on long-term issues that are specific to the euro area. So, altogether, the leaders next week will touch upon many aspects that underpin our economic and social future. The European Council will also deal with a number of other issues: it will address the preparations for the EU-Western Balkans summit in Sofia on 17 May 2018, since a specific priority of the Bulgarian Presidency is the European perspective and connectivity of the Western Balkans. As you know, this is a major event for the Presidency. The Council will also discuss relations with Turkey. As you just discussed, the European Council on Article 50 will meet on Friday to review the state of the negotiations with the United Kingdom and adopt additional guidelines on the future relationship with the UK.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 88, "date": "2018-03-13.json", "name": "Jean-Claude Juncker", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President of the Commission. – Mr President, just under two weeks ago, I returned from a tour of the Western Balkans. It was a memorable trip for many reasons. What struck me the most was the passion and conviction in the European Union. This gave me a renewed sense of belief and hope that if a region, a dramatic region like the Western Balkans, is so determined to reform from top to bottom in order to join our Union, then we must be a Union worth being part of. The Western Balkans clearly see much more in us then we ourselves see in our Union. I want to see the same belief in our Union across all 27 Member States.  Of course, there is a great deal of work to be done. All bilateral disputes must be resolved and more unity is needed. Each of the Western Balkan partners must continue their reform path, especially when it comes to the rule of law and fundamental freedoms and values. As I said to all leaders in the region, there will be no fast-tracking. We will put substance over speed. Each case will be taken on its own merits, with no fixed dates or firm deadlines. But I came back from the trip more convinced than ever that it is our shared future. It is about reconciling our history and geography, but it is also another reason to focus on building a stronger, more democratic and united Union. This is what the March European Council is about.  I would like to thank this House and the Bulgarian Presidency for leading the way in recent weeks. The breakthrough on posted workers will ensure that fairness comes first in our labour market. As we collectively agreed: equal pay for equal work in the same place. The agreement on 5G shows that we are serious about our digital leadership and equipping ourselves with the tools we need to thrive in the society of tomorrow.  Mr President, Europe believe in open and fair trade based on a global rule book. Our economy depends on it and our consumers expect it. But as I have said all along: we are not naive free traders. So we will not sit idly by if our industry is hit with unfair trade measures that put European jobs at risk. We will defend our workers; we will defend our industry, and we will do so while respecting the rules that the world agreed to under the WTO.  The United States has regrettably decided to impose restrictions on steel and aluminium which will impact a significant amount of EU trade. We believe in win-win trade, but going it alone on tariffs is a lose-lose for all. Yes, the global steel industry has an overcapacity problem. This is why, since December, along with Japan and the US, we have been looking at how to address this issue globally. Commissioner Malmström met with both of her counterparts this weekend to deepen that cooperation further. And she also expressed our concerns to the United States on the tariffs being imposed on national security grounds. Exports from the European Union are clearly not a threat to the United States’ national security. We are long-standing and trusted security partners and we work together to keep each other safe and secure. As their own figures show, the US only needs 3% of its annual steel production to serve the Pentagon’s needs. We will keep making this point in the run-up to the European Council next week. We are expecting more clarity from the American side in the coming days, and we will continue to work with our partners to push for an exemption from these measures.  As always, we will – and we have to – prepare for all eventualities. Should the need arise, the European Union will respond in three ways. Firstly, under WTO rules we have the right to rebalance these measures, and we stand ready to do so. Secondly, we will be ready with safeguard measures if there is a surge in imports into the European Union as a result of the US closing its market. And thirdly, we will seek dispute settlement consultations in the WTO, in conjunction with other affected countries. Herr Präsident, meine sehr verehrten Damen und Herren! Wenn wir unserer Union mehr Stärke, mehr Handlungsfähigkeit verleihen wollen, müssen wir auch in die Architektur unserer Wirtschafts- und Währungsunion investieren und sie zukunftsfester machen. Die Umstände dafür sind so günstig wie selten zuvor. Die europäische Wirtschaft wächst über Erwarten, in den vergangenen zwei Jahren mit mehr als zwei Prozent. Und sie wächst schneller als die US-amerikanische Wirtschaft. Gleichzeitig haben wir in Europa mehr Menschen in Arbeit als jemals zuvor, 236,3 Millionen – ein neuer Rekord. Das sollte uns Bestätigung und Ansporn zugleich sein, unseren Reformkurs konsequent fortzusetzen. Und genau das tun wir. So legt die Kommission heute am frühen Nachmittag ein Paket zur Bankenunion vor. Es geht darum, die Finanzstabilität zu sichern, indem wir uns noch stärker mit notleidenden Krediten beschäftigen. Dort haben wir schon einige Erfolge erzielt. Seit 2014 ist der durchschnittliche Anteil notleidender Kredite in der EU schon um ein Drittel gesunken. Dabei wollen wir es nicht belassen. Das ist umso wichtiger, weil bei der Vollendung der Bankenunion Risikominderung und Risikoteilung Hand in Hand gehen. Eine vollendete Bankenunion wäre ein wichtiger Schritt, um unsere Wirtschafts- und Währungsunion zu stärken.  Genau darum geht es beim Gipfel. Über die Vorschläge, die die Kommission im Dezember vorgelegt hat, haben wir hier im Hause und bei einem früheren Eurogipfel schon diskutiert. Wir wollen den europäischen Stabilitätsmechanismus schrittweise zu einem europäischen Währungsfonds ausbauen. Außerdem wollen wir die Mitgliedsstaaten und solche, die es werden wollen, bei den Reformen unterstützen sowie mit einer Stabilisierungsfunktion sicherstellen, dass selbst im Falle von schweren Schocks Investitionen in Bildung und Infrastruktur weiterhin gewährleistet bleiben.  Monsieur le Président, Mesdames et Messieurs, chers collègues, compléter l’union économique et monétaire n’est pas une fin en soi, c’est un moyen de créer les conditions d’une vie meilleure, d’une vie plus prospère et plus équitable pour tous nos concitoyens.  Égalité des chances, conditions de travail équitables, protection et insertion sociales doivent devenir une réalité pour tous. C’est pour cela que nous nous sommes engagés à mettre en œuvre le socle européen des droits sociaux. 16 millions de nos concitoyens, par exemple, vivent et travaillent dans un autre État membre que le leur. C’est deux fois plus qu’il y a dix ans et ce phénomène ne fera que s’amplifier. Ces personnes ont, comme tout un chacun, des droits qui doivent être respectés et effectivement mis en œuvre dans un marché européen du travail. C’est la raison pour laquelle la Commission va présenter aujourd’hui sa proposition de création d’une Autorité européenne du travail qui ne viendra pas se substituer aux autorités nationales mais qui renforcera la coopération et la coordination entre elles. Ceux qui travaillent à temps partiel, ceux qui relèvent du statut des travailleurs intérimaires ont eux aussi droit à une protection sociale convenable. C’est une responsabilité commune, celle de mettre en œuvre le socle des droits sociaux. Il faut évidemment continuer à parfaire le marché intérieur, notamment les marchés de l’électricité qui, en Europe, s’ils étaient totalement interconnectés, les Européens feraient des économies de 40 milliards d’euros par année. Si l’Europe numérique fonctionnait, cela nous apporterait 415 milliards d’euros de croissance nouvelle chaque année. Donc rien que sur l’interconnectivité de l’électricité et de la mise en place totale de l’Europe numérique, nous réaliserions un bénéfice – si je peux m’exprimer de la sorte – de 450 milliards. Nous avons tous, je crois, conscience qu’il serait essentiel, souhaitable, bienvenu que nous puissions mettre en œuvre tous les éléments dont je viens de vous parler d’ici les élections européennes de l’année prochaine.

I would like to address three issues. Firstly, following our discussion on Brexit, I would just like to make it clear once again, including in the direction of the British Government: the European Union is not a supermarket to enter, select goods and buy goods as cheaply as possible. We have the European internal market and the European internal market is not a self-service shop. Mr Michel Barnier and the Commission have put forward good proposals for future cooperation. And when we adopt our resolution tomorrow, I believe that we have also delivered and shown that we have an idea of what good partnership will look like in the future. The second issue, which will also be raised at next week's Council summit, is the issue of the digital single market and, above all, the issue of taxation. I would like to emphasise that I am very pleased with the Commission's proposals on the taxation of the digital economy. It is also a very important issue for our citizens that tax legislation in this European Union is also fair. That will also be the subject of the TAXE 3 Committee, which we will also be voting on tomorrow. And here, too, with a view to Brexit, we need to look closely at what is happening in the British Virgin Islands. We cannot allow tax havens to be set up here alongside the European internal market. Last point: Economic and monetary union. Ladies and gentlemen, we will be discussing this intensively. As you know, I'm not a friend of a liability community. I believe that risk-taking and liability must go hand in hand, and that we therefore do not communitigate the need adhesion. There are different proposals from the Commission.

In this context, the European Union needs to assert its own vision and its own way of life and to have a long—term strategy, which should be based on human dignity, fairness, democracy and a clear commitment to sustainable development. Yes, climate change is there, and we need to have a growth strategy driven by sustainable development goals. Yes, the digital revolution can change our way of life, but we want to make the best of this by framing this revolution. That is why our commitment to the European Pillar of Social Rights is so crucial. We need to tackle not only the old inequalities, but also the new ones. We are now waiting for the final content of the Social Fairness Package to be adopted by the Commission because we need to make sure that all citizens can have access to full coverage via social protection. But can we say that all citizens now have real access to all these benefits? This is not the case. We still have many inequalities across the Union, and that is why we in the European Parliament really expect a forward—looking Community budget – the financial framework – to ensure that these promises will be delivered.  The same applies to the eurozone. We need to stop the trend for divergence. That is why we expect the Commission’s proposed budget line to build up fiscal capacity for the eurozone. But then we come to the big problem. How can we finance this? That is where the discussion on taxation, which will take place in this European Council, is so crucial. Let me give a very simple figure. When it comes to large corporations, something very weird is happening. In 2000, their profits were taxed at around 34%; now their profits are taxed at just 24%. So the situation we have is that large corporations are paying less and less tax, while our governments are under pressure to make cuts to welfare and healthcare systems. Something is wrong, and we should not be surprised that citizens are now feeling insecure and that nationalistic and xenophobic positions are gaining ground. We need to reverse this trend. The only way to reverse this trend is for the European Council to say, ‘if we want everybody to benefit from this strategy and for the social pillar to be implemented, we need to have the means’, and the means will be fair taxation. If the European Council really wants to change the situation in Europe, it needs to be bold on fair taxation.

Now I want to talk about the future of Europe which must be social. We need to work towards upward convergence and make the EU a place where it is good for everyone to live. We do this, among other things, by tackling fraud and social dumping. This is rightly a priority for the Juncker Commission, although I do ask myself critical questions about how the Commission intends to achieve this social objective. Commissioner Thyssen, for example, will present her proposal for a European Labour Authority this afternoon. According to Thyssen, this new European agency should be the missing piece of puzzle in the fight against social fraud. However, I would like to stress that we need to consider the added value of new bodies. Do we really need that authority? Does she really add anything that Member States themselves cannot? Why, for example, do we abolish the recently established platform against undeclared work in order to replace it with the authority? The creation of expensive European bodies should not be an end in itself. Nor should the aim of the authority be to replace the Member States. Even though this may not be the overt ambition today, I wonder how this European Labour Authority will continue to grow in its role. Her name and permanent character in any case indicate further plans for the future. I think that we should be very careful not to increase the powers of the Member States by little, in which the Union is going to undermine the competences of the Member States. If a smokescreen of good intentions is being erected today, but the real objective is to set up a European social inspection, then I regret this maneuver.

The first is that we need from the Council a common reaction from the EU, together with our friends in the UK, on the new aggression by the Kremlin on what is still European soil – in Britain – and I am referring to the poisoning case of Sergei Skripal and his daughter. Mrs May has said that it is an attack against Britain as a country, and I think that a common reaction in the next European Council is absolutely needed and counter—measures need to be decided by the EU.  My second point, naturally, is that, regarding the type of solidarity that we need still to have with the UK, that we hope also for it to be returned. Solidarity from the UK, for example, in our policies towards Mr Trump: it should absolutely be avoided that, behind the EU’s back, they send somebody to the US to find a special deal on these trade measures. If Mr Trump finds that there are horrific tariffs from our side, there are also horrific tariffs from their side. He is talking about the 10% on the import of US cars in Europe, and we paid only 2.5%. But there are other examples: tariffs on a train carriage, for example, are 14% in the US, or for pickups – and there are a lot of pickups in the US – we have to pay 25% in tariffs. I think what the European Council should do now is say that there are two options in this starting of a trade war. Either we start a trade war and a war on tariffs by increasing them from both sides, or we do what should be the thing to do: to lower the tariffs in both cases, the tariffs on the European side and the tariffs on the US side, which both sides find so horrific. I hope that that can be the common position. We have no interest in starting a trade war. What we have to offer instead is a trade deal from the European side. In fact, there are many people who were against TTIP but now see that if we had got TTIP we could have avoided what is happening today. I hope that this measure will be taken – no trade war, but a new trade deal.

In order to provide solutions that genuinely serve the needs of the peoples, measures must be promoted to boost the real economy, policies that strengthen social and regional cohesion and address the disparities that are constantly increasing. As far as energy union is concerned, the proposals put forward, instead of solving the problems in energy supply, create new deadlocks, as they invalidate Member States' sovereign rights in shaping their energy policy. One example is the new directive on the internal market in natural gas, which seeks to manipulate states by transferring greater powers to the European Commission, and as a result there will be additional problems in creating new import and export infrastructures. natural gas.

Let's start with the priorities of the European semester. For us, the economic policies of the euro area cannot in any way continue according to the wrong recipe of this Commission, based solely on austerity and rigour, which we oppose without if and without buts, because only through investment in high-return sectors and expansive policies will it be possible to create real sustainable employment in the medium to long term. To ensure growth and competitiveness it takes a concrete commitment by the Council to allow respect for the principle of reciprocity, both in markets and in public procurement, by monitoring investment foreign and putting in place binding rules of sustainable development, maneuvers that should fall within all trade agreements and which are often sacrificed. That is why we want to know what the Council is doing on this matter, and how it is ensuring that our partners are meeting our standards, thus avoiding a trade war that It would risk damaging our businesses and “made in”, which we expect to be a priority for Europe, the Commission and the Council. Even on the digital market too often this Commission has lacked courage. At the beginning of the legislature, the completion of the digital single market was announced through 16 initiatives: many of these, however, remained in half, such as geo-blocking, where from the scope are audiovisual were excluded, the area where geographical blocks based on nationality are most evident. Priority goal is to get out of the recessionary spiral where we have swooped, and in this context, the priority that assumes the implementation of the principles and rights set out within the framework of the European Pillar of Social Rights becomes clear. And a key element of the social pillar is the implementation in the Member States of policies of minimum income of citizenship, as required by this Parliament itself which has approved in this regard, a very large majority, the resolution of the 5 Star Movement.

First of all, I want to say something about the poisoning of people in Salisbury. Just try to get your mind around this: in Salisbury, people have been poisoned by a Novichok nerve agent, which is a substance that is banned under a UN convention. A nerve gas was actively used against civilians in one of our Member States. I believe that the European Council should, in clear terms, express its full solidarity with the British people and the British Government in addressing this issue. I believe it is of the utmost importance that those who are responsible for what has happened see very clearly that there is unequivocal, unwavering and very strong European solidarity, so that those responsible are really punished for what they did. We cannot have nerve gas being used in our societies. This should be addressed by all of us and not just left to Prime Minister May and the British Government. It is a collective European responsibility, including under the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) rules. I want to thank your Parliament, Madam President, for its clear support for my words right now because it will also send a clear message to all those involved and to the European Council next week.  Yesterday, I was at Dillinger Hütte, in Saarland, to meet with representatives of the European steel industry from Saarland, from Lorraine and from Luxembourg – a very competitive steel industry, able to innovate, able to create green steel in the future, to make sure that steel remains an essential element of the European economy, in a way that is sustainable. Of course, people there were extremely worried about the measures announced by President Trump. I had a very clear message for the people there and I want to repeat it today: the Commission is working day and night to convince our American partners that there are no grounds for these measures. We are security partners. How on earth could European steel be a threat to American security? It is simply impossible, so there are no grounds for these measures. We hope we can convince our American partners of this, but if that fails, if we cannot convince them and they persist in this, the Commission will act with the support of the Member States to protect our European economy.  We do not believe in protection. No war could be predicted in terms of its outcome except for a trade war because we know that a trade war only has losers. Nobody can win a trade war. We hope that we can convince President Trump of that reality, but we will protect our interests if need be and we will help the European steel industry and the European economy to be competitive. Let me end on this. This is something that will be discussed at the European Council: jobs, competitiveness, growth. The world is changing at breakneck speed. We will need to be more competitive to keep up, but there are different ways of doing this. You can be competitive by lowering your prices, but then you will demolish the social fabric which is the very backbone of Europe. You can also be competitive by being smarter, more innovative, investing, inventing new things. This is what Europe has always been great at – all European nations – and that is why I believe that if we talk about the future of Europe, we talk about better taxation, so that people pay taxes where they make profits and that they do not get away with playing one Member State against another.  (Applause) We have to make sure that we develop the skills necessary to be able to act on the world stage. It is a delusion to think that we can protect the steel industry of individual Member States if Member States act individually on the world scale. We need the European Union to act together on this. At the end of the day, it will be necessary to build Europe on the basis of the values Europeans share: a social market economy where the values are protected, where the race to the bottom is stopped and where we make sure that through solidarity and by working together, Europe has a strong position on the world stage.

To put it blindly, to keep the advantages of Rotterdam harbour as a main gate for entrance within EU of foreign goods.

There is a trend for these development poles to drain resources and investment from the peripheral and less developed regions of the region, which intensifies already serious inequalities, and development policy has no response to this. Another serious problem is the phenomenon of emigration: on the one hand, migration to more developed regions can be observed within each region, and on the other hand, we see this at European level, not only from east to west, but also from south to north.

Commissioner! The European Parliament shall take a position on the future financial framework through its own initiative report, which sets out a certain policy position on the future multiannual budget of the European Union or the multiannual financial perspective. We recognise that the European Commission is preparing to present a draft of its future financial framework on 2 May, which is why the European Parliament is making an effort to propose to the European Commission, but also to the European Council its position on this framework. We are therefore working on both the income side, as the rapporteur will talk about, as well as the expenses side. The European Parliament considers that the European Union should maintain the level of its ambitions after 2020 and act at the level previously adopted. It matters so much that Britain's exit from the European Union — Brexit — will, of course, affect the functioning of the European Union, but we believe that the Union should nonetheless remain at a certain level when it comes to the budget. At the same time, we remember that it is important not only about 1%, but also what Member States agree among themselves for the next seven years in all policy areas. The European Parliament therefore proposed a certain size of the budget, realising that the proposal could be controversial. However, it follows specific calculations on the nominal level of agriculture and cohesion policy, as well as strengthening those policies that we consider very effective, namely programmes such as Erasmus, COSME and the unemployed youth programme. But it is important for us to find resources for new defence and security challenges. The European Parliament refers to the very way of building a financial perspective. Therefore, with huge emphasis we are talking about strengthening the mechanisms flexibility. We believe that the flexibility mechanisms in operation today are working and that they should be broadened so that the European Union can respond efficiently to new challenges. In addition, the European Parliament is strongly in favour of a clear end to the whole procedure until the 2019 election, and we are mainly concerned that the new actions commencing on 1 January 2021 are well prepared, legislatively developed and secured financial resources. Therefore, we are ready to make all possible efforts to accelerate this procedure. And we are ready to work closely with the European Commission on this issue. Commissioner!

First of all, my co-rapporteur Jan Olbrycht, with whom we have been able to work in good intelligence, with respect for our convictions and in the interests of Parliament and European citizens, and who, above all, managed to support me, and that is not over. Thanks also to the shadow rapporteurs and the secretariat of the Committee on Budgets, as well as to the rapporteurs of the specialized committees. Tomorrow the European Parliament will have its mandate to negotiate the financial future of the European Union. Based on the analysis of the current undersized financial framework, heckled by incessant cuts or redeployments, we refuse to renew the lack of ambition and seriousness that characterized the exercise of this MFF. Our message is a triptych that wants to live up to the situation. Firstly, to maintain the political pillars of the Union, namely cohesion and agricultural policy, without which we will lose the link that unites us. Secondly, to strengthen the EU's flagship policies: Erasmus +, support for youth against unemployment, research and COSME. Finally, thirdly, open up the new challenges of the ecological transition of security and defence. This triptych is based on a principle that we want to enshrined in the marble: no new policy without additional means. Together, we are making new commitments: the Paris climate agreement, which will have to translate into a target of 30% of expenditure, the European pillar of social rights, and the UN Sustainable Development Goals. These commitments constitute a pact for the reorientation of all Union policies. Building on lessons from the past, we propose to expand the flexibility instruments of the next financial framework in the need to strike the delicate balance between predictability and budgetary flexibility. It must also restore the unity of the Union budget by restoring parliamentary control and bringing order to the budgetary galaxy by integrating financial instruments and other trust funds into the Union budget. The addition is without appeal and the calculation is economical in view of the stakes and expectations of Europeans. The next framework will have to be increased to 1.3% of GDP. In this regard, and to get out of the number fetishism, I want to restore a truth that some pretend to ignore: the current financial framework is limited to 1% of the Union's GDP, compared with 1.25% in 1999. The European Union has never had so much to do with so little. To get out of the vicious circle of this budget deflation, we exchanged our vows and alliances with colleagues Lewandowski and Deprez. This joint debate and tomorrow's vote on the own resources reports and the next financial framework send a clear message: Parliament will not be able to give its consent to the next multiannual financial framework without concrete results on own resources. It's time to get out of budget helplessness. The Council and Parliament have set the objectives. Responsibility requires that the Union budget be provided with the means to reach them, and the Member States are expected to be something other than the great speeches or, in any case, that the great speeches will be accompanied by sounding and stumbling species.

However, the Treaty is clear: Article 311 states that 'the Union budget is, without prejudice to other revenue, fully financed by own resources'. We are far away. Today, contributions from national budgets account for almost 70% of the Union's revenue. Worse, since Margaret Thatcher's “I want my money back”, the drift of the system has resulted in a monster of opacity. The British rebate gave rise to discounts on discounts, which have been added over the years multiple and heterogeneous corrections, which it is totally impossible to explain to citizens. Indeed, the Union's budget is no longer the instrument of a common project. It has become a crate, heavy to feed for some, interesting to empty for others. The fair return tends to become the alpha and omega of the European budget. This situation has already been strongly denounced. Our colleague, Alain Lamassoure, brilliantly tried it. Our colleague, Janusz Lewandowski, tried to correct it when he was commissioner, in both cases in sheer loss. More recently, at the insistence of our assembly, the three institutions set up the Monti Group, which has done a remarkable job. Our report is consistent with the conclusions of this group, which were — I insist — endorsed by the representatives appointed by the three institutions. In doing so, we are pursuing a threefold objective: it is to respect — as I said — the requirement of Article 311 of the Treaty and to break the logic of fair return; it is a question of compensating for the negative effect of Brexit on the budget; and structurally, it is a matter of giving the Union the means to deal with the great and new challenges ahead of us. We therefore call for the gradual introduction of a package of new own resources in order to protect the budget from the vagaries and fluctuations of a single resource. We call for the selection, in this package, of new resources that are directly linked to the creation of European added value in the Union's strategic policies. We advocate the removal of discounts, all discounts, discounts on discounts, all existing or invented corrections. We call for a consequential reduction in budgetary contributions from Member States, which are expected to become residual in the coming years. Three key points to conclude: by voting for these two reports, you will affirm Parliament's determination when it announces that it will not approve the future multiannual financial framework if it does not include the implementation of new own resources to guarantee its financing. We also ask you to approve our request to amend Article 311 of the Treaty when it regulates the own resources decision-making procedure. The European Parliament, as a budgetary authority equal to the Council, cannot resolve itself to a simple consultative role in the introduction of own resources. This contempt for parliamentary democracy is not acceptable. Finally, parliamentary democracy also does not accommodate the situation in which the Parliament elected after the 2019 elections would have no say in the financial framework that will organize, for seven years, the use of the budgetary appropriations it provides. In conclusion of this statement, I extend my thanks to my co-rapporteur Janusz Lewandowski, and to the MFF rapporteurs Jan Olbrycht and Isabelle Thomas, my colleagues and friends, Eider Gardiazabal and José Manuel Fernandes, and to my colleague, Helga Trüpel, my budget associate, the secretariat of the Committee on Budgets, our political advisers and my friend, Pierre Verkaeren, for her valuable assistance.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "aws", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 173, "date": "2018-03-13.json", "name": "Janusz LEWANDOWSKI", "mepid": "23781", "text": " rapporteur. — Mr President! Commissioner! Designing and reconciling a multiannual financial framework is never business as usual. There are always special circumstances: either the historical enlargement of the European Union or, as with the current financial framework, the depth of the crisis and the talk of the Greek. Now the special circumstance is brexit. One of the net payers is disappearing, but the most ardent supporter of maintaining the European Union's funding way to date is disappearing. Our two reports go hand in hand. We know perfectly well that the position of the European Parliament on both issues is not the same. We have the strongest position in annual budgets. In the case of the multiannual financial framework, Parliament's consent is needed and, in the case of own funds, only consultation with Parliament. We are not just positioning Parliament. We, too, want to embolden the Commission, and particularly ermutigen Herrn Oettinger, to make an ambitious proposal on 2 May, which will not expose us to the kind of problems that I experienced myself from 2013 to 2014, when there was a shortage of money for the EU programmes implemented. Our two reports also link the will to conclude negotiations before the European elections. This is an extremely ambitious task, given that the negotiations previously lasted 2.5 years, and we have 9 months left for the final arrangements, which is to say great political will and synchronisation of the calendars of all the EU institutions, because the motive is noble, lest there be delays, so that there are no delays Do not waste the beginnings of the next perspective, just as the years 2015, 2016 and even 2017 have been wasted. On the side of the own resources I dealt with together with Gérard Deprez, we have a paradox. The system is extremely heavily criticised, but since the late 1980\"s very stable. It is opaque, incomprehensible and indeed enforces logic juste retour. Causes the perception of budget negotiations as a zero-sum game, and contributions as a cost rather than an investment in the future of their own country and the European Union as a whole. I am a kind of living memory of the last proposal, which was based on two new own funds, i.e. simplified VAT and financial transaction tax, and was also based on a fundamental simplification of the whole system. Little is left of this, but under pressure from the European Parliament, a high-level group has been set up under Mr Monti's leadership and we draw on its acquis. We draw from Monti's acquis. Knowing that we are reinstating the proposal in a slightly better climate — at the moment there is no longer such belt-tightening as in 2011-13 — we respect the fiscal sovereignty of the Member States. We know that all own funds decisions must be approved, ratified by national parliaments. But we are opening up to the possibility of rethinking the system, because here in the European Parliament, too, people elected by people in 28 countries — still in 28 countries — so you can move the principle of no taxation without representation here. We postulate our own basket of own funds. Some we repeat. Seigniorage emerges, which is the most controversial. We postulate a special provision and a move away from discounts and adjustments. But first and foremost, I thank my co-rapporteur Gerard Deprez, all the advisers and all the shadow rapporteurs who participated in the preparation of the report.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "aws", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 174, "date": "2018-03-13.json", "name": "Günther Oettinger", "mepid": "n/a", "text": " Member of the Commission. — Mr President, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen. The Commission takes note with interest and pleasure in the draft two reports under discussion today. I see Parliament's groundbreaking considerations, structures, expectations and conditions in both reports, which, if you adopt them, will certainly be further included in the European Commission's final work on the way to May this year. I would particularly like to thank the four rapporteurs — Mr Olbrycht, Mrs Thomas, Mr Deprez, Mr Lewandowski — for their outstanding work with their staff, but also for good cooperation with my services and with me. budgetary frameworks will certainly facilitate from May. It is about the future of Europe, as Mr Arthuis always emphasises, and what can then be done to shape the future with budgetary resources, financial programmes and the multiannual financial framework. First of all, the own resources — an age-old story of who reads them: they have always been unsuccessful on the road since the 1950s. But the budget from national budgets, which once amounted to 10% of total revenue, is now 70%. That is why it is time to diversify our revenues. I'm talking about diversification, which does not automatically mean increase. I would like to reduce the contribution from national budgets somewhat and build up the share of new own resources as another pillar. Several proposals have been made in your draft report — Mr Deprez and Mr Lewandowski — which are also largely in line with what the High Level Group led by Mario Monti has developed. I should like to point out that this group is not a group of the Commission, no Parliament's group, not a Mario Monti group, it is a group of all three institutions, and there were also three representatives of the Council. And unanimity at the end of the proposals should actually mean that this should not be a zero-sum game. We will be finally discussing what proposals we are making in the coming weeks. But we will certainly define two, three, four proposals on the revenue side, and this would, I believe, make it much easier for the next financial framework. The topic of discounts was mentioned. Here, too, we think in harmony. A significant part of the discounts are discounts from the British rebate to reduce the reduction of UK payments for other net payers. So, when the British discount falls, this part of the discounts automatically falls away. We now have further corrective measures and rebates, and I would like to mention as a starting point, as our Commission proposal, that we will not propose any discounts. And for the sake of honesty, I do not rule out the way from the discussions that there may be a few, unbureaucratic, moderate discounts if we are to achieve unanimity in the negotiations. So far for the Own Resources Report. With regard to the main report by Mrs Thomas and Mr Olbrycht, I would say that 90% of your 167 pages are in line with what the Commission is going to develop. We cooperated extensively, too. I have been to your Committee on Budgets on several occasions, I have been to many groups, I am going to other groups, have been on technical committees. This means that it is no surprise that your report largely coincides with the rough draft that we are now refining and that some of your proposals will be included in our proposal. With our communication of February, we have tried to give the European Council, the Council, but also Parliament and all stakeholders — the Committee of the regions, the Economic and Social Committee — to show what is at stake. It's a kind of menu. Now you need to decide, now the advice will have to decide what to order. Jean-Claude Juncker, my colleagues and I — we are cooks and waiters, we are waiting for what you order. If you want to pick up a comprehensive menu consisting of border management and social policy, which consists of research and Erasmus, if you want to double Erasmus, to increase horizons, then we deliver. And we charge and expect to pay. It's like a restaurant. Now we actually have a problem that we should avoid in the best possible way. I would like to avoid a conflict in this House and also in the Council and in public, a conflict that could exist in cohesion against migration or agrar against defence. This would once again put the European family at risk of division. We have traditional programs, but traditionally does not mean that they belong in the House of History. Traditional programmes can continue to be sustainable. I believe that cohesion policy remains sustainable. Why? Take a look at the GDP per capita in the Member States and regions. On average, GDP per inhabitant of Europe is EUR 28 000, in my own country EUR 40 000, in Luxembourg EUR 100 000 and EUR 6 800 in Bulgaria. This does not hold Europe together in the long term, which is unreasonable in the long run. We need to reduce the gap in GDP per capita, not by bringing Luxembourg down to 30 000, but by increasing the competitiveness of Bulgaria, Romania, the new Member States and regions of southern Europe through investment, thereby increasing their competitiveness and thus bringing the GDP per capita up. That is what I call a solidarity union. Modern cohesion policy must do this. I do not know if cohesion policy will still be necessary in 2050 but I know that over the next decade it will remain permanently necessary for the accession of less developed regions to the average and to increase the competitiveness of all regions, as well as for social measures and for smart environmental measures and for infrastructure measures. That is why a baluding of cohesion would be completely wrong. The same applies to agricultural policy. In our proposal we will simplify agricultural policy, we want to improve greening, we want to reconcile the agricultural sector and the environment even more, we want to give the farmer money to ensure that he has good food of sufficient quantity and high quality, in compliance with our environmental and animal welfare legislation and the soil protection, water protection and climate protection regulations. This is also why agricultural policy remains viable for the future. Now we have very different agricultural structures. We have the part-time farmer, who owns 15 hectares, and we have the large company that manages 5 000 hectares. We have to master this balancing act. That is why the willingness of all parties to compromise is part of We have two gaps, the Brexit gap and the spending gap created by new challenges. Our proposal: We close the Brexit gap with 50% redeployances and cuts and 50% additional revenue. However, if we tackle new challenges, if we believe in the interests of our citizens and Member States that Europe can act and finance more efficiently in defence research, border management, border control, migration and aid to refugees, then we need the Member States' money for this. 80% fresh money and 20% of internal shifts is our proposal for this. A second last point, the ceiling: you suggest 1.3%. I think this is ambitious, but very factual. 1,3 is not beyond good and evil, on the contrary. Parliament is proposing a very, very justifiable serve. Our formula is 1.1x because we still have some uncertainties. The inclusion of the Development Assistance Fund is an unpredictability, the question of deepening the Economic and Monetary Union and the money to be invested in structural support, for the willingness to reform and for the accession of the euro. A second uncertainty: we still expect some advice from the Council, otherwise we will translate our proposal into concrete figures after Easter. And then we'll dissolve the x of 1.1x into a concrete number. One final point: the net contributor debate. She is increasingly meaningless. At a time when CAP and cohesion were well over 80% of expenditure, it was still possible to calculate the cash return relatively accurately. Next in the MFF, however, CAP and cohesion will fall to around 60-61% of all expenditure. And soon 40% will be accounted for by Erasmus, refugee aid, research where there is no reflux in this sense. If we invest in education, safety, clothing, food and protection for refugees in Turkey and their human dignity, nothing will come back. But the refugees are spared the difficult way to reach us via the Mediterranean, and the costs are not incurred here, but are much more efficient on the ground. That is why we should convince the Member States and also the media that the view of net contributors has long been outdated and no longer satisfies the new tasks and programmes. Thank you for your preliminary work. We would be happy to hear further oral expectations from you, evaluate them, incorporate them into our proposal and then join the Commission proposal on 2 May and with all the additional implementing provisions at the end of May. We are grateful for the fact that you have made the MFF one of your priorities in Parliament for 2018, that you appoint your rapporteurs early, that you are planning an intensive meeting schedule by February to March next year. 'Cause if it failing to adopt essential decisions or the whole package before Easter next year, I predict that nothing will happen in 2019, and then the MFF will be adopted by 2020 at the end of the year. And then 2021 would be a completely lost year for farmers, researchers, regions, mayors and Europe's economic development. This should be avoided. Then we would have learned from the experience of the past. We did this wrong in 2013. One more point: if the British friends are leaving us and 27 Member States and Members of many groups are able to agree on this controversial issue, they will send an excellent signal that Europe is alive and that it is a Europe of good governance.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "aws", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 175, "date": "2018-03-13.json", "name": "Pavel TELIČKA", "mepid": "124706", "text": "  Commissioner, thank you for a very complex and balanced introduction from your side.

This long-term vision, covering the whole period of the next decade, is more of a statement of general strategic direction. The MFF translates the EU’s policy priorities into budgetary means. EU policies are implemented through a wide range of programmes and, from this point of view, the MFF is not a budget for seven years, but rather a collection of resources geared towards accomplishing the Union’s main goals. The MFF should prioritise support for the common agricultural and cohesion policies, closing the gap between the Member States, as well as the emerging policy areas related to security and migration. To provide the resources needed, the system for financing the EU budget should be reformed based on the recommendations of the High Level Group on Own Resources. Resources have to be spent more efficiently and effectively and create higher European added value. In order to achieve our goals for a strong and more ambitious Europe in a rapidly changing political environment, we should increase the MFF expenditure ceilings, foster flexibility mechanisms and special instruments and simplify the EU budgetary system.

It is clear that we need to re-have an autonomous POSEI fisheries independent of the EMFF.

Budgetary policy is generally considered unsexy. But it's not, this is the powerhouse of politics. After all, everything that will decide in the European Union over the next few years is linked to this multiannual financial framework. In principle, I think Mr Oettinger's proposal on the overall architecture is correct: slightly less for traditional agriculture, slightly less for cohesion. But policy in this area needs to be speeding up, the application procedures must be simplified, and of course — I say this as Greens — they must become more environmentally friendly. At the same time, we must respond to the major questions: defence, the protection of external borders, the fight against global inequality in the European Union, but especially on a global scale in Africa and Asia. And then, of course, we will have to take climate policy and the Paris Agreement much more seriously than we have done so far. And we need to set new priorities, and here too I agree with Mr Oettinger. We need to spend more on research, more on culture and education, on Erasmus+, more on the European Solidarity Service, and we need to provide fresh money for defence and not take it from the research programme. That's wrong. But we as Europe need to develop a common European defence policy worthy of that name in the face of Xi Jinping forever and the increase in China's military budget and the terrible Trump, who today also kicked out Secretary of State Tillerson. Now I come to the own resources. I have twice taken part in the negotiations on budgetary policy and the multiannual financial framework. We need new own resources. And this means above all a digital tax, because we are the need to ask digital monopolies for checkout. They have to pay taxes in Europe — i.e. Google, Facebook, Apple and Amazon.

We are discussing something really important, because we are drawing not only two documents of our European Union, but we are drawing the future of the European Union itself. These are documents, Parliament's own-initiative reports, and then the work that will be done by the Commission, which must give a new signal of Europe, a different signal. But in order to give a signal, an idea, a different image, there must also be different policies, that they are new policies and policies that give a vision and a future. There are two jobs we have focused on in these months, these weeks: one on the new financial framework and one on own resources. On the new financial framework, Mr Fernandes said earlier, and you said that, Commissioner, the 1.3% horizon we give ourselves is not a dream, is something that is widely achievable. I don't think this Parliament is an exose Parliament, it is a very responsible Parliament, I think. We know what people are asking for and we know what the answers we need to give, and we must be the added value for citizens and for our businesses, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises, on huge issues such as research, such as development, such as young people, such as growth, the environment, energy, agriculture: it has already been remembered, they are the huge goals we have to give ourselves. For this we need additional resources. You said that they must not be additional but they must be parallel; I say they must be sufficient resources to make these policies: ambitious resources. We have to ask for less money from the Member States, you said it well, and I think it is very corrected. But in the document prepared by the rapporteurs, whom I thank, the rapporteur of both the own resources document and the rapporteur on the economic and financial framework, these resources are there, their identification is very clear, and we have identified the areas of work on which we need to work. But we must be very careful and we must give a very clear message to the citizens, so we do not want to raise taxes to citizens, we do not want to increase taxes to citizens, we do not want to increase taxes to citizens, we do not putting new taxes on citizens and not even small and medium-sized enterprises. What we want to do is to rearrange the EU's own resources system and have a fairer and fairer Europe on the financial system, a greener Europe, a Europe where transactions financial ones are finally taxed. I'll close, President, referring to the times. You said that we need — and we absolutely agree with you — we need to close these two documents within this mandate, the one on the new economic and financial framework and the one on the own resources, but we need to close these documents quickly, but to close them well too, because we need the answers that will be given to citizens and the prospects that citizens will have Since 2021 are really sufficient perspectives and answers, which are in abundance for the demands that businesses and the world of research, development, and the citizens themselves make to us.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "aws", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 196, "date": "2018-03-13.json", "name": "Bernd KÖLMEL", "mepid": "124824", "text": " Mr President, on behalf of the ECR Group. The new multiannual financial framework is the test of which EU we want to have in the future. More or less everyone here is talking about more subsidiarity, de-bureaucratisation and austerity. But the present draft does not correspond to this right now. And the previous speaker from the Socialists said that we need more money because we know how to boost the economy, we know how to make startups successful, and so on. My honourable colleagues, I do not believe that. I don't think we know this any better than the real leaders of companies. They know how to drive the economy forward. We should create the right framework conditions, but we should not collect money in the Member States and then redistribute it via Brussels. This is exactly the opposite of a lean EU. We should create space here. Debureaucratization starts with less regulation and no more. And if I want to regulate less, then I can't provide for more budgetary resources. I always have to wonder what I can actually achieve. First of all, it is quite clear that the EU budget is mostly a programme budget. And in a programme budget, the most natural thing in the world should be that the programmes should be reduced accordingly if a Member State leaves. But instead, it is proposed to increase Member States' contributions to gross national income by 30%. This is the opposite of a lean and economical EU. Citizens, however, want a lean and economical EU. That is why I would only call for new funds if we have a genuine political approach to resolving crises, for example in the area of migration, for example in the euro crisis. But the political will for this must first be defined. Instead, we see that now the funds for the former ESM should be transferred to its own budget line, a temporary element...

That being the case, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we must keep a margin of flexibility. We see how difficult it has been during the implementation of the current multiannual financial framework to deal with certain crisis situations. Globalisation puts Member States face unprecedented challenges in terms of security, defence, migration, the digital economy, climate and the fight against globalized terrorism. We must prepare ourselves to take on these issues collectively because we have European common goods to defend, and it is clear that a number of States at national level are now unable to cope with these challenges. It should therefore be possible, Commissioner, in the aftermath of the European elections in 2019, if we have a majority, if the Member States agree, to go beyond 1, 1.1, 1.2 or 1.3. A European world power with a budget of 1.3 will not shudder the continental states, nor the multinationals of digital or financialisation. Therefore, it should be possible to transfer expenditure that was incurred at national level, to make it available to the European budget, and there, Commissioner, you will have the means to demonstrate what European added value is because we will be more efficient by putting national resources into the European budget.

If we need to fight against growing populism and euroscepticism, the worst thing we could do would be to adopt proposals from populists and from eurosceptics, because with a small budget the European Union will be unable to deliver. Thus it would be even more meaningless to those many people who already don’t see what the EU is here for. In other words, to demonstrate the added value of the EU, we need to invest more and more efficiently in policies where the EU can really make a difference. This has to be the first key message to the Member States: Don’t use Brexit to make further cuts in our budget and diminish our ambitions.  Secondly, the next MFF needs to focus more on delivering results in sustainability and in the fight against climate change. The EU must translate its commitment to the Paris Agreement into a real budgetary majority. That’s why our Group stressed so much the importance of aligning the EU budget with the sustainable development goals and to significantly increase climate-related spending to reach at least the 30% target as soon as possible.

The best proof is that the European budget has already exploded.

There is the old moon of the European Development Fund, there are four various emergency trust funds, two aid funds for Greece, the European Stability Mechanism, the Eurozone Lending Facility, the Juncker Fund, etc., and 2018 opens with the announcement of an impressive new satellite: the Defence Fund.

This is not only a budgetary debate, but above all a political debate, because where we put the resources will be the real priorities of the Union. In this legislature we have signed many far-reaching agreements: the Paris Agreement to combat climate change, the Gothenburg agreements for a true social pillar; we have even signed the Sustainable Development Goals. And it is now when we have to decide how we are going to finance them, and therefore it is now when we are going to demonstrate the degree of our commitment. In recent months, we are hearing great philosophical phrases when we talk about the budget — Mr Omarjee also said — some say that it needs to be modernised and, others, that more must be done with less. This may look very well on a headline, but this, budgetarily speaking, is not possible — more with less, it cannot be done — and that we want to modernise a budget does not mean that we can cut it down, but rather the opposite. And this Parliament has the very clear ideas of what we want for the future financial framework and we could define it in three blocks. The first block: maintaining the financing of traditional policies, i.e. agriculture and cohesion. We are asking our farmers and livestock farmers to produce with environmental criteria; to offer us quality products at affordable prices; to keep the population in rural areas and to encourage young people to enter the sector. And all this cannot be done with less budgetary support. And we also advocate a strong cohesion policy so that Europe continues to maintain competitiveness, so that its regions reduce inequalities, so that it is invest in innovation and, above all, to ensure that competitiveness is not at the cost of wages and social rights of workers. Second block: the policies that we might call 'for the future'. Here we not only want to maintain funding, but we want to increase Erasmus grants, research programmes or investment programmes. And the third block — and this is a very clear message —: new needs need a new budget; and we do not want to counterpose, as the Commissioner said, some priorities against the other. In conclusion, I would like to highlight two ideas which I hope the Commission will listen carefully. First proposal: the conditionality of funds with regard to compliance with the rules, because we propose a system of sanctions for those countries that do not comply with the rules or their commitments, but we completely detach these sanctions from the cohesion funds — municipalities, regions or the unemployed are not responsible for the fact that and second proposal: taking into account the Union's commitments in the fight against climate change, many European regions will have to make a radical energy and productive transition. The Union needs to help these regions, and we therefore propose a fair transition fund that emphasizes not only the regions but also on the social challenges of this transition. And how do we finance all this? It has already been said here: with new own resources; with taxes on sectors that do not now contribute to the public sector; with taxes on the financial sector; and taxes on large companies that take advantage of that there is no European regulation to evade their taxes. And I end, Mr President, because I really want to thank the four rapporteurs for the excellent work they have done, for the negotiation and for the generosity in negotiating, because in this way we can have a strong, supported agreement by most groups in this House.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "aws", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 205, "date": "2018-03-13.json", "name": "Zbigniew KUŹMIUK", "mepid": "28389", "text": " - Mr President! Commissioner! When taking the floor in this debate, I want to stress very strongly that the Polish delegation in the ECR group is in favour of filling the financial gap after Brexit and also providing additional resources for new EU priorities. In our view, premium charges may reach 1,3% of Member States' GNI. We postulate the elimination of all rebates in connection with the elimination of the UK rebate, the cessation of reimbursement of unused funds in a given year to individual Member States, the introduction of the UK's access to the EU market into the budget and, finally, possible establishing an EU financial burden in the form of a digital tax. It is necessary to ensure in the Union budget beyond 2020 at least at the previous level of cohesion policy and CAP measures. As part of the latter, we demand an end to the discrimination against agriculture of Central and Eastern European countries for nearly 15 years and the level of direct subsidies in new and old Member States. We strongly oppose making contributions from the future Union budget subject to compliance with the values set out in Article 2 of the Treaty because it is impossible to establish any objective criteria in this regard. Even the existing conditionality for adherence to the discipline of public finances, although based on a hard, objective criterion, the so-called Maastricht criterion, is applied selectively by the Commission: for another six years France did not follow it and was never punished. consequences arising from the Stability and Growth Pact...

But there are internal imbalances in the eurozone, which should be resolved before we go, in fact, to ask for other resources and manage these budgetary issues. So the heads of state on this need to find a solution or the situation risks a total implosion precisely because unemployment and demand problems cannot be solved only by a European budget which has a very low budget. And on our own resources, here too, we cannot have new taxes, because European citizens do not want new taxes, they want financial speculation to be taxed, rightly, they want them to be taxed You tax large multinationals, but they do not want to charge them with additional burdens that some bureaucrats here in Brussels have in mind.

It is about helping the least developed regions of the Union. To these traditional priorities, new priorities are being added. The citizens of Europe expect us to do more on security, defence, tackling the migration crisis and combating terrorism. If, at the end of the day, we expect the Union to do more, it is not normal to offer it a smaller budget. Commissioner, we also have to stand together in the negotiations with the Member States and the Council and tell them that, if we expect a more robust Union which has more tasks, then a smaller budget is not realistic. We have to spend money well, and we have to update and modernise our policies, reform them and convince citizens that the money is well spent, but at the end of the day, new competences also mean a robust budget. We have to tell those Member States who are concerned that paying more does not mean that you are in a worse situation.

We are faced with a very important decision for the future of the European Union. Because — as we say in Germany, a budget is a policy cast in figures. And what is the point now: what policy should this European Union pursue in the years 2021 to 2027 and how do we intend to finance it in the end? Here we are also waiting for feedback from the Member States so that they can finally tell us which Union they really want, and then hopefully also provide us with the necessary resources for this. It is good if we create regulations here in this House to implement the EU's policy objectives. But these objectives must ultimately also be reflected in EU spending. This is no less important. The withdrawal of the United Kingdom is declining revenue and some Member States and, as we have also heard, some Members of this House believe that, as a result, expenditure should also fall. In view of the divorced tasks assigned to us not least by the Member States, the question arises: do more with less money? This can be done at best in LalaLand or perhaps in interviews in Scandinavian, Dutch or Austrian newspapers — and since I am shown a blue card, and certainly in British — but not in European reality. Unless, Mr. Oettinger, you have the famous gold donkey from the fairy tale of the Brothers Grimm in the basement, which eats straw in the front and leaves gold on the other side. But since this is probably not the case, the question is: how will we finance all this in the future? Frontex — this agency is to be converted into a genuine border management agency, the European Defence Research Fund is called for, we need the European Employment Agency to: finally being able to monitor compliance with the Posting of Workers Directive. We want to increase mobility for young people, we want to do more to tackle the causes of flight, and in research policy, the EU can only really fund every seventh promising research project. There is a lack of money in front and back. I could continue this list. If all this is wanted, where are we going to take the money for it? Therefore, if we want to have a strong Europe, then this can only be done with more resources, either from national budgets or — which I would support — with new European Union own resources.

Programming lines such as COSME and the Connecting Europe Facility are also important drivers for growth and jobs. Of course, there is resistance from net contributors on the revenue side.

We have listened and written down intensively over the last two hours and will evaluate all your arguments, speeches, expectations, but also your criticism and will include them in the further process of preparing a draft MFF by 2 May. In particular, I would like to pay my respects to those who, like me, have been and have remained present from the beginning to the end: Mr Arthuis, the chairman of the committee, colleagues Thomas, Lewandowski, Deprez and Olbrycht. Because I believe that the overall picture of all speeches is important. Why do I say this? You can't get a budgetary framework if you give your own opinion, but you don't see that democracy needs a majority or even unanimity. I need a majority of MEPs in this House at the end of the day, and I need unanimity in the Council: 27 finance ministers, 27 ministers in the General Affairs Council, 27 heads of state or government, all parliaments at national level. That's why I say to myself and you: friends, let's go in with dedication, but let's stay relaxed. If not everyone offered flexibility, we would not have a chance of a next budgetary framework for the next decade. I would like to propose that we go through the tasks that we have to carry out in the interests of European citizens — be they citizens in Rome, Stuttgart, Dublin, Warsaw, be they Italian, Polish, Irish, German or European citizens — in any case they all live on the European continent. Even those who do not like Europe so much live on the European continent. My suggestion is that we should have the tasks carried out where they can be best, most efficiently accomplish. We need a clear system of competence. Therefore, we offer the argument of surplus value. I don't want to promote a project, no program propose not to invest a euro unless we can demonstrate the added value at European level. And vice versa, I expect you to show that if the added value is demonstrated, we will also get the money for it, because it is spent in the interests of our citizens and taxpayers. Investing in Europe and realising added value is more cost-effective than 27 times in parallel, or 100 times or 200 times in parallel regions. Can we agree on that? We need the money to realize the added value — no less and no more. This is the best form of investment in the interests of our taxpayers. Let me give examples: we do not dream of a European army. We don't want militarism. But we know that for every dollar an American receives far greater consideration in the form of weapons and security systems than an Austrian, a German or a Frenchman, because we lack the scales because the economies of scale are not achieved. Would it not make sense for us to put some money in the European budget, standardise classes of arms, call out together, realise economies of scale and thus save money? Realize no more, but with less in return. My grandfather served in the army of Württemberg. I dream of a European security strategy, not a European army, a security strategy. Because in the era of America First, we must jointly ensure the external and internal security of our citizens. Secondly, I believe that the added value can be presented in the field of research. You in the House and we in the Commission are always talking about 3% for research — 3% of our GDP. We're close to 2%. I am from Baden-Württemberg and am proud of one one: 4.9%. 4.9% for research in my home country. And I say to our Italian friends — I love Italy — 1% is not enough. This will not be possible to compete in the competition in the long term. 3% would be equivalent to EUR 450 billion for a GDP of EU-28. We are at just under 300 billion. Horizon accounts for 12 billion. Would it not make sense to invest more in European research projects? That is why I want to avoid cuts in two programmes. I want to increase the Horizon Europe, Horizon Post 2020 and Erasmus+ programmes in the interests of our children so that they can learn and see the culture, languages and diversity of the European continent at a young age. Apart from that, I realize that Brexit is a game changer. I'll say it sporty: if a rich uncle no longer comes for Christmas, there won't be as many presents under the Christmas tree. But, converging everything through cuts would severely damage programs like agrar and cohesion. I was previously accused that the Commission wanted to punish farmers. This is exactly what we do not want! We want to help farmers to ensure that the next generation in rural areas also produces clean and good food for our food security, including on steep slopes in the Black Forest, in the Alps, while at the same time meeting requirements for climate protection, the environment, groundwater, soil and sustainability. We need money for that. My cut will be at 5 -10% — no less and no more. With a cut of 5 to 10%, we are closing part of the Brexit gap, but we are not destroying the Common European Agricultural Policy. Cohesion: If you look at the backlog of infrastructure, standards, refurbishment of buildings, the social and environmental situation in some Member States, for example in rural areas of Romania or Bulgaria, then I think that cohesion policy remains important. And we can demonstrate, using the example of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Slovakia: cohesion policy is working to: the countries are increasingly on average in the European GDP per Capita. And if we give money to economically weaker regions and bring it to us, I believe that this is a contribution to a meaningful Union of solidarity. Basically, you have to see that everyone has a perspective, and not just some regions alone. Border protection — a very specific question. I always hear from national governments: we no longer need border management in Austria, then no longer in Germany, then no longer between Italy and Austria, and no longer those of Hungary if the external border management is effective, if the outer shell in Bulgaria, Greece, Malta, Cyprus, Italy and Spain is effective protects. It would be much cheaper to have a strong European Border Guard Authority that provides effective support to Bulgaria, Greece, Italy, Spain, Malta and Cyprus, and internally we would have free movement again. Yesterday I came from Kehl to Strasbourg and was in a traffic jam for half an hour. Impossible! I call for free movement within Europe for goods, goods and people, and border protection on the outside. But then we also need the money to be able to pay the employees accordingly. That is why my question, especially to the House: if I demonstrate added value, will you support me in spending the money at European level, which will be more efficient and cost-effective than 27 national or 250 times regional? But one thing can't. To tell me: no reduction in cohesion, as nine provincial capitals in Austria do and present signature folders to me, no reduction in agriculture, as the Minister has done, more pre-accession aid for the Western Balkans, more for research, and 1.0 as ceiling. So, Adam Riese should be a colleague of ours and advise us. Neither you nor me can't square the circle. And just, if you say we can cut in heading V. Dear friends, let us seriously! We should try to see the budgetary framework as a priority from 2 May. For our part, we offer all transparency. Also in the next few weeks we will present what you need to know so that you can prepare yourself. Because the election will give us a two-way period for the budgetary framework to enter into force. The worst would be that we do not have a budgetary framework. Because no matter where you stand, farmers, researchers, regions, municipalities need clarity. The sooner they have clarity, the better they can plan, the better prepared every citizen — whether he is a German, a Pole or feels like a European — goes into the next decade. We will evaluate your speeches intensively; thank you for that. And we look forward to the discussions that will begin on May 2.

What is it supposed to rely on, what sources will the resources come from, and how is it to be placed in the budget?

This is the question that the European Parliament is taking today. We look forward to a response on May 2. Third, we await a response regarding one mutual fund.

Provided that the devil does not hide in the remaining 10%. And for example, cohesion, Commissioner, at random, is good to reduce the wealth gap per country, but to reduce the wealth gap between cities and rural areas and also in the poor neighbourhoods of our rich countries is even better. Do you know that in your country 100% of the Länder have signed an open letter to maintain the amounts of cohesion policy. Imagine that 1.3% is little, it's even economical on our part, and we must be aware that if we were to go below this threshold, there would be sacrificed policies.

The European flow of sources had a great effect on the economic and social circumstances of most of the new Member States. There are various discussions on the efficiency and effectiveness of the cohesion policy, which included suggestions to link cohesion policies to conditionalities related to the rule of law, to the participation in certain common European policies or to the EPPO. However, that cohesion policy is an economic tool rather than a political one and that the potential suspension of payment will punish first and foremost the citizens, thus leading to an unfair situation.

And of course I wish Commissioner Oettinger good work, with whom I imagine we will work in the coming weeks and months throughout the year. It is difficult of course to summarize in a few minutes the content of the guidelines we have worked on in recent weeks with colleagues, and I also take advantage of this to thank the shadow speakers with whom we have been there a fruitful work and also a frank and fruitful work in recent weeks to arrive at a document that can have the widest vote in this House. I will mention only a few themes, because it is impossible of course to re-read all the document and all the text. Of course, we have a duty, as Parliament, as the European Union, to turn our attention especially to those who are still suffering from the economic and financial crisis that has affected our continent, which has affected the whole world in past years and on which probably not enough has been done. I am thinking in particular of workers and women workers, I think in particular of young people, I think of small and medium-sized enterprises, who have often had to close or who are still in difficulty today and with great courage try to move on despite the crisis and despite few reassurances and few interventions that have been made towards them. I also think, and I would like to summarize especially on the youth issue my content attentions in particular. We've talked about it until now, compared to the debate on the forthcoming multiannual financial framework and the subject of own resources: we absolutely need, as Europe, to aim all our possibilities, all our efforts, all our efforts and all our resources, not just economic, on the younger generation. That is why we need that from next year, beyond the new financial framework, the young initiative is an initiative that has a full endowment and has a real endowment, Commissioner, so that initiatives can truly be implemented in the Member States. And I am thinking of Erasmus and Erasmus+, on which we must give assurances to all young people who ask for access, because you said it very well, responding to an Italian colleague who has a little vision. distorted the European Union: we need as many young as possible as possible to become part of this continent. I am moving quickly on two other elements: one is the issue of defence, on which the European Union is doing a great deal, and we must, of course, commit ourselves to this and on the issue of migratory phenomena. We must, yes, look from within the migratory phenomena, and therefore be able to accommodate how right it is to accommodate and have the resources to be able to accommodate, but we must also look outside and be capable of preventing migratory phases in the long term. Two final points: I would like to talk again about the environment, of course, 20% of our financial framework to be devoted to the environment, and I would like to talk above all about a social Europe. There are two budgets that go hand in hand: one is the Europe of investment and the other is Europe which must stand alongside the citizens who do not make it, who are poorer, who have difficulty even in access to health, or they are in the process of unemployment. Our states are unable to give answers and we must be close to our Member States. The Ultimate Two Considerations: the first is a principle that we must give ourselves, which is a cornerstone principle of our Parliament and which we want to bring ourselves back in the next negotiations. New resources and new money must be provided for each new project. You first made the example of cooking, European Commissioner, we are only the cooks and we are the kitchen. Well, if more courses are asked for this kitchen, if more dishes are asked for this kitchen — I arrive at the conclusion, President — this kitchen must also have a galley that has many more resources. Finally, on the negotiation: if the Commission — and I end — if the Commission is an ambitious Commission, it will find this Parliament, as you know, absolutely ally. If the Council wants to deal from the outset, it will find this Parliament very ready to deal from the outset. Popusms don't fight — look, President — populisms are not just fought with words, but you fight with policies and we can fight them with next year's budget as well.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "aws", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 274, "date": "2018-03-13.json", "name": "Günther Oettinger", "mepid": "n/a", "text": " Member of the Commission. — Madam President, ladies and gentlemen. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking Mr Viotti and to express my respect for the valuable technical and substantive work with which he has prepared Parliament's guidelines. And I am pleased to say to you, Mr Viotti, my interest in a regular exchange of views over the next few months, because we should try to maximise the Commission's work and parliamentary priorities from today, from March to the autumn, when decisions between the Council, Parliament and also the Commission are to be taken. to vote. On the one hand, I would like to say that your priorities and those of the Commission for the 2019 budget are largely comparable to those of 2018, and what was important to you this year will remain important to you next year. On the other hand, it is a budget in which British friends are no longer members all year for the first time — Brexit is likely to take effect from the end of March next year. However, following the consultation of the negotiators and my contact with our chief negotiator Michel Barnier, we believe that the British are ready to participate constructively not only in the advisory process in the Council as one Member State, but with all the rights and obligations of the budget next year also for the whole of the year. to participate. This can make the work easier. Our main focus is on our priorities. It is about growth and employment and thus about combating unemployment, which is still too high in many regions of Europe, including youth unemployment. Secondly, we also fund approved measures and say precisely that we keep our word where we have programmes. Our partners have expectations for the programmes and need to fund their programmes in such a way that the funding will be included in the commitments made. is guaranteed. This applies to Horizon 2020, which applies to the Connecting Europe Facility, it applies to COSME, to small and medium-sized enterprises, and it applies to Erasmus +. Just one example: Connecting Europe, an infrastructure, whether road, rail, energy, is applied for, tested, approved, awarded, built and billed across borders. This means that we have large projects that we reviewed and approved a year, two or three years ago and which will now have to be served with a corresponding financial share next year. This is the expectation of the Member States, has the investors and has the corresponding construction company. Keeping word on the commitments made is part of our budget proposal and what you will then have to approve later. The aim is for us to use the possibilities of flexibility next year to finance the performance of tasks, especially where new tasks are becoming increasingly important: providing humanitarian aid, migration measures, strengthening controls at the external borders, support for the most affected Member States, when it comes to refugee tasks. I can tell you this morning that the Commission intends to propose to you this morning the Facility for Refugees in Turkey in a second tranche. Now the time is right. The three billion that you and the Member States provided two years ago are now fully occupied by commitments and payments will soon reach the three billion. We now need to discuss and decide on a second tranche of these three billion. Just one example: we have school offers for hundreds of thousands of refugee children, classes in the appropriate accommodation centres and camps. We now need to prepare the salary bases for 5000 teachers for the next school year, which begins in September, so that you can get their contract for the will be able to sign accordingly next school year. For this we need clarity, the second tranche, and proportional co-financing will be included in the Draft budget for 2019. We propose that the European budget should allocate one billion on the way to the end of the MFF and that the Member States should be ready to add two billion. The Council, your partner, our partner, adopted its guidelines on 20 February this year. If we compare the Council's guidelines and Mr Viotti's draft, there are no too many differences. There are bridgeable differences between the position of Parliament that you are discussing today, that of the Council that has been adopted, and what we are preparing, which should be reconciled on the way to October/November, given the goodwill of all parties, although the day of European elections is slowly approaching . In order to reach this joint decision for a 2019 budget in a timely manner by November, we want to make every effort to provide you with information on what you need to know in more detail in the coming weeks for your discussions on the implementation of the budget for 2018 and our budgets for 2019. We will probably present the Draft Budget 2019 to you and the Council in May. The timetable until autumn is already being prepared by all of us accordingly.

Commissioner, I am pleased that we have such a broad common ground, particularly with regard to Horizon 2020 and Erasmus. At Horizon 2020, you mentioned the topic of COSME in particular. I would also like to mention Future Emergence Technologies — a great program, but which is quite underfunded and has a lot of outstanding project proposals, where we also need to consider whether we can provide assistance in any way in 2019. We have also placed a very intensive priority on how to avoid young people being unemployed. I hope that, together with the Commission and the Member States, we will be able to further strengthen the Youth Employment Initiative so that young people can really find permanent jobs and not just temporary accommodation. Our aim is to permanently qualify young people and then to give them a secure workplace or promising jobs in the long term. We also continue to deal with security and migration. Security will continue to play a very, very important role in the context of the ongoing terrorism and will challenge us.

Two regrets that are all alarms for future procedures. The first concerns the European Commission, which did not play full transparency during the last conciliation for the 2018 budget by concealing that it planned to turn the increase on the Youth Initiative into a simple advance of the 2019-2020 budgets. We remind the Commission as the budgetary authority that this is indeed a cash increase in this programme. We expect our partners to be more sincere in the forthcoming negotiations. I would also like to alert to an ambiguous wording which suggests that Parliament would abandon its historic position, on which new initiatives could be financed by cuts in other programmes. For my group, this is not the case. Thus, the new security programmes will in no way be a substitute for solidarity programmes. Parliament must stay on course and thwart all sorts of manipulations.

Budgetary priorities mean that we need sufficient money, at different levels. On the one hand, we need to strengthen Frontex, for example, because we need to secure the external borders. We also need sensible procedures for all arriving people. At the same time, however, we must, of course, also set priorities for expenditure in the countries where these people come from, because every euro we invest there is invested much better than if we wait for these people to make a dangerous crossing across the Mediterranean and we invest here first. There are also investments in cross-border projects. The EU can clearly deliver added value. Nevertheless, I believe that the overall structure of our budget is still wrong. We are giving citizens completely wrong impressions when we pretend that we can definitely fight unemployment in Europe with an EU budget. We can take individual measures, but they are not as sustainable on a regular basis as if we were actually rid of many bureaucratic shackles if we were to create the framework conditions for the economy to grow.

' But this is remarkable, Mr Viotti. So I will not take this opportunity to repeat what my colleagues and the Commissioner have said in terms of priorities, but I simply want to stress two things that I think are important at this stage. Firstly, young people, all young people must experience concretely, in their lives, that the European Union is made for them, that it invests in them, that it relies on them. That is why, as we all reiterate, the resources available to Erasmus + must be considerably strengthened and it should be extended to young people from the popular backgrounds by apprentices. Measures taken to support youth employment should be evaluated and the most successful programmes should be strengthened. The European Solidarity Corps must be rapidly implemented in order to strengthen the values of mutual help and solidarity among young people. Secondly, the popular classes that have gradually been won by Euroscepticism and populism must be reconciled with the European idea. Europe — and you are told by a member of the ALDE Group — cannot be just the business of leaders, entrepreneurs, academia and the intellectual middle class.

Young unemployment has values that are unacceptable. The budget of the European Union, through the amounts it makes available, even in cohesion policy, through Erasmus+, the strengthening of the Youth Employment initiative, should help to make this scourge undermined.

Firstly, Commissioner, please take into account the main elements from the guidelines drafted by our colleague, Daniele Viotti, that will be approved by a large majority in plenary when you put forward the draft budget in May. I can say, speaking as a general rapporteur for the 2018 Union budget, that last year, when you presented the draft budget, you took account of the conclusions in our guidelines in a more than satisfactory manner, and that made the budgetary procedure much easier. The more you take into account, the higher the likelihood that we can find a good agreement in the conciliation procedure at the end of the year. My second message is that trust is important. Trust between Parliament and the Commission and all of the Commission departments is important. Let’s use the beginning of this budgetary procedure to establish such trust. Thirdly, Commissioner, last year we jointly decided in the conciliation procedure to increase the amounts for heading 1A – research, innovation, Erasmus scholarships, and small and medium—sized enterprises – because money was needed there. But in the 2019 budget guidelines the Council is now asking you to try to find ways to redeploy – and hence reduce – the budgets for 2019 and 2020 in those areas. Please stand together with us in defending the increases. The amounts were needed for that heading, and any reductions are a move in the wrong direction.  My fourth and last message, very briefly, is let’s find ways in the budget for next year to finance measures to tackle fake news and disinformation propaganda.

Finally, a mention of the fight against climate change and the green economy: at a time when the United States is no longer willing to meet its commitments to fight climate change, I believe that the 2019 budget should strengthen the EU's frontline role by providing for example additional financial support for the LIFE programme.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "aws", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 287, "date": "2018-03-13.json", "name": "Arne GERICKE", "mepid": "124815", "text": " Mr President!

On the last speech, I can say that I see this the same way. Europe must do more for its external and internal security than in the past, because the dangers and risks to our European citizens have not digged, but have increased. PESCO is an approach to this that is widely supported by the Member States and we will use a pilot phase 2019/2020 to test the added value in the field of defence research and defence industry and will include significantly more money in our proposal, building on the experience of the next 2021ff budget, with the request to: to advise and support them accordingly. Several colleagues have referred to the subject of youth work. I very much agree with you that the sustainable and further fight against youth unemployment is crucial for many young people in many regions of Europe. That is why we will also propose appropriate funding within the 2019 budget framework for the continuation of our projects. We note two points here: firstly, the concern that in some Member States where these European funds should actually be highly welcome and are also welcome, absorption is far from 100%. This means that it is not possible to call up the funds and translate them into projects, into jobs. Either because the capacity and absorption capacities in the market do not exist or because the administrative force is insufficient. That is why this issue of absorption, the levy, is at the forefront of me, because more resources only make sense if it is also called up and can be implemented through projects in jobs for young people. We still have a significant difference between the appropriations and the use of funds in many Member States. The second topic is discussed in the course of the Negotiations must be discussed with the Council. You know, before I became responsible for the budget, there was the midterm review; that's your credit. And in this midterm review and revision, we agreed €1.2 billion on the way to the end of 2020 in additional funding together with the Youth Work Council. In 2017 — this was also before my time — 500 million were entered into the budget for this purpose. On the way to 1.2 billion, we now have the balance of 350 million. If you divide these into the two years, you can not increase a lot of funds. If we use them next year, we will have a problem in 2020. So the question remains: is the capping of 1.2 billion fluent by the Council, or can we reconsider changes, redeployments or increases here? We will certainly come back to this in the trilogue and in the conciliation in the autumn. A small addition: a box of red house beer, fir suppositories, costs 19.60 euros.

You might remember last December I came to Strasbourg and here in this hemicycle we talked about the detention centres in Libya. I took, in front of you and most of all in front of all those people suffering inside these detention centres in Libya, a commitment to bring back to their homes 15 000 migrants from within the detention centres to their countries of origin in a safe manner, with assisted voluntary returns made with our assistance through the International Organization for Migration (IOM). At that moment we had just reached an unprecedented agreement between our European Union, the African Union and the United Nations, in particular the United Nation’s agencies for migrants and refugees, at our EU-Africa Union Summit in Abidjan. Thanks to these agreements, in the first two months of this year, January and February, we managed to rescue and free more than 16 000 people from the camps in Libya. In two months we managed to achieve more than in the previous year and already in 2017 the results were 10 times better than the previous one, than 2016. Now, in the detention camps there are still some 4 000 to 5 000 people. That is far too much and we are going to continue our work with the United Nations and with the African Union to empty the camps. We’ve managed to bring 16 000 people out of there in two months. I believe we can make it and empty them completely within the coming maximum couple of months.  This has been possible for one reason. We joined forces, first of all within Europe, second with our African partners and friends and, on a global scale, within the UN system. I’m glad to start with this positive note, acknowledging that again still the work to be done is a lot but because sometimes we forget to focus on the achievements we managed to build. I think that humans are important to lead us towards the solutions and the way.  This is only one piece of the puzzle we are trying to put together. The work on safe and dignified returns goes together with saving lives and arresting human traffickers both at sea and on land, it goes together with our Trust Funds to tackle the root causes of migration and with our new External Investment Fund to create jobs and growth in the most fragile regions of origin. The challenge of human mobility in our century is huge. We have experienced it directly, but continents like Africa experience it every day even more. But experience tells us that it is manageable. No country can manage this alone, but together we can set up a humane, dignified and secure mechanism for governing human mobility.  This is the spirit of the New York Declaration that we approved two years ago – solidarity, shared responsibility, multilateralism and engagement. Around these four pillars we have built a common ground. This should be also the spirit of the two Global Compacts on Refugees and Migrants. It is not by standing aside or pretending we can put a wall between us and the rest of the world that we will shape common solutions. We remain convinced that all states can benefit from closer international cooperation, be they countries of origin, transit or destination – and some countries are all three at the same time. Some countries are experiencing the situation of being at the same time countries of origin, transit and destination.  Work on both Global Compacts has now concluded on the consultative phase, and negotiations and formal consultations on the actual text started last month. I believe this is a unique opportunity to bring forward the European vision on migration and bring there, at the global level, the experiences, the lessons, we have learned and the partnerships we have built. It is a vision grounded on human rights, responsibility and mutual solidarity; a vision where traffickers and smugglers and the connected criminal organisations find no place, where we reduce irregular migration and instead we have the courage to invest in more regular and safe channels for migrants. To achieve this we will need strong UN coordination under the leadership of the IOM and the UNHCR, under the respective Compacts.  The first and second negotiating sessions in New York on the Global Compact on Migration are now behind us, showing a strong concordance of voices across the globe. There is still a lot of work to do but there is a good basis to develop a common understanding on how to humanely and efficiently manage migration together now and in the long term.  Also, on the Global Compact for Refugees, formal consultation has started in Geneva and it is important to ensure a balanced and inclusive outcome for refugees and also for the host communities. For the past 18 months the European Union has established strong leadership in the process, thanks also to the partnerships we have developed in these years. Now with the withdrawal of the United States from the Compacts back in December, the Compacts need more than ever a strong and united Europe.  Let me say that I regret that one of our Member States has recently presented a position that is not in line with the position of the 27 other Member States. Here our common work and also your contribution as a Parliament will be essential because together we can push towards inclusive and balanced Compacts to improve the lives of millions of people, to address the concerns of European citizens and to turn migration from a common challenge into a shared opportunity for human development.  I will now move from the UN to the Korean peninsula. For months and years now we have been working as a European Union to avoid the nightmare scenario of a nuclear crisis on the Korean peninsula and we have, let’s say, gained some experience in work on nuclear negotiations. Since the Winter Olympics, the news coming from the Far East has given us some hope. The situation on the Korean peninsula could turn from a potential catastrophe into a demonstration of the power of multilateral diplomacy and, let me add, wise leadership. I especially want to thank and recognise the efforts that the President of the Republic of Korea, President Moon, has exercised over this month.  Last week, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK) communicated, through the voice of the South Korean special envoy, its willingness to enter into negotiations on denuclearisation. Reportedly, North Korea would refrain from testing nuclear weapons or missiles during these negotiations. If these announcements were to be confirmed they could create the necessary conditions towards a negotiated solution.  The summit meeting between President Moon and Kim Jong Un in April could start to build the necessary trust, de—escalate tensions and improve inter-Korean relations. President Trump’s potential readiness to accept the invitation to a summit by the month of May represents another possible element of a breakthrough towards a diplomatic solution.  The unity of the international community will be an essential factor to determine whether we collectively succeed or fail. We Europeans, the European Union and the Member States, are ready to do our part, as we always did. Our policy of critical engagement with the DPRK is more valid than ever. We stand for maximum pressure and dialogue. Both are necessary to avert the danger of war. We have always stressed the need to come to full denuclearisation – irreversible, verifiable denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula – through peaceful diplomatic means.  The European Union sanctions regime on the DPRK is currently the most restrictive towards any country in the world. We implemented all the UN Security Council resolutions on the DPRK and we adopted additional autonomous measures. We also worked with third countries to help enforce the full implementation of all resolutions and we will continue this approach and shortly will launch a new outreach to third countries. We will maintain, in this way, the direct and indirect pressure on DPRK.  But we have always believed that sanctions are a tool and not a goal in themselves. Our objective is, has always been and remains, to help open the political path for a peaceful, negotiated solution of North Korean denuclearisation. That is why we encourage and support this new high-level diplomatic initiative.  I would like again to praise the leadership and courage shown by the Republic of Korea, President Moon and the entire government. I am happy and proud to say that next Monday in Brussels, I will welcome the Korean Foreign Minister to our Foreign Affairs Council to discuss together the way forward and how the European Union can continue to support their work to accompany these efforts, as we have constantly done during this month, in an even more effective manner.  Our goal, as I said, is the complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. I believe this is a goal that we can achieve with wisdom, unity and the determination that I think we have shown together with our partners internationally in this month.

It has been seven years and the war is not over yet. After some encouraging signs of de-escalation in the second half of last year, we have been warning, as the European Union last month, about the risks of a new escalation, and we have tried to prevent it, mainly with our work in the Security Council of the United Nations that led to the adoption of the Security Council Resolution 2401.  What we see today is a dramatic re-escalation of military activities. Afrin first, then the tragedy of eastern Ghouta. With every new escalation a new level of horror is reached. In eastern Ghouta we have witnessed the intentional bombing of civilians and medical facilities and snipers shooting at those who are trying to flee. There is only one rational and moral thing we can do. We can only keep working together with the United Nations to achieve what has not been achieved so far: a political solution in Geneva as the foundation of a just and lasting peace.  We believe the most urgent task now is to stop the fighting and bring relief to the civilian population. At the end of February, as I mentioned, the UN Security Council adopted unanimously, thanks also to our work, the work of our Member States in the Security Council, the Resolution 2401, demanding a 30—day cessation of hostilities all around Syria, with the only exception of operations against Daesh and al—Qaeda.  At our meeting of the EU Member States Foreign Affairs Ministers, our Foreign Affairs Council on 26 February, we were united in calling for a full and immediate implementation of the Resolution. And right after we met, the same day, I wrote to the Foreign Ministers of Russia, Iran and Turkey, the three guarantors of the Astana Process, because they have committed to creating four de-escalation zones in Syria – and let me recall that eastern Ghouta is one of these four zones. So they have taken a clear responsibility and we expect them to fulfil it. In my letter I called on them to contribute to the full and immediate implementation of the Security Council Resolution, and this includes taking all necessary steps to ensure that the fighting stops, that humanitarian access is ensured, and to allow for life—saving deliveries of assistance and medical evacuations. In eastern Ghouta over 1 000 people are now in need of evacuation as doctors, medicines and medical appliances are lacking. Thanks also to our work, together with the United Nations, on the first days of March a UN aid convoy was finally allowed to enter Duma. It was the first aid convoy since November and it brought some much—needed relief to thousands of people trapped in eastern Ghouta. Our first concern is always saving lives; it is always the humanitarian needs. But the shelling resumed while the operations were still ongoing and the convoy had to leave before the aid could be fully unloaded. This shows that a daily five—hour truce can be a first step, but it is clearly not sufficient. Syria needs a full cessation of hostilities as agreed by the UN Security Council, and it is also unacceptable that the Syrian regime removed critical medical items from the convoy in clear violation of international humanitarian law. As our diplomatic work for a truce continues every single day, as our humanitarian support to Syrians continues, we must also keep focusing on peace talks, on a political solution in Geneva. I know it is difficult to talk about peace negotiations, and even more to engage in peace negotiations, while thousands are still dying, but let us keep in mind two things. First, that peace is all the more urgent when the fighting gets worse; and second, that peace can only come from a comprehensive political agreement under UN auspices. I believe we should have learned that by now. Limited agreements do open windows of hope, and bring limited improvement, but have always collapsed owing to the lack of broader political agreement on the future of Syria.  The new escalation of violence in eastern Ghouta, but also in Afrin, can push further away the chances for a political solution to the conflict and can easily lead to an even more dramatic escalation, even in these hours. We need to concentrate all our energies in supporting and revitalising the UN—led negotiations in Geneva in a determined and consistent manner, gathering the efforts of all the partners in the region and the international community.  Support in Geneva will be one of the key goals of the second Brussels conference we will host on the future of Syria and the region at the end of April. We will gather the international community, the regional players, around three objectives. First, to renew our humanitarian support to the people of Syria, both inside Syria and in the neighbouring countries. Second, we will work on the recovery of areas where the fighting has ended, particularly the areas liberated from Daesh, bringing back services and normal life to communities, men, women and children, that aspire to a sort of normal life. Reconstruction, as we said several times and very clearly – and we will repeat in Brussels at the end of April – will only begin after a credible and inclusive political agreement has been reached, but the perspective of reconstruction can help the Geneva process. This is why we continue to work also to prepare for peace as the most powerful leverage we have to encourage a positive dynamic and outcome of negotiations.  This is the first objective of the Brussels conference in April: use our convening power, which is quite remarkable, together with the United Nations, to unite a real international and regional consensus, to give a political push to intra—Syria negotiations in Geneva. This is not because we are naive or blind – on the contrary, after seven years we know how difficult it is to end this war, and even those that have tried partial political avenues to gather different formats have realised very clearly the limits of this exercise. It is only through collective UN effort that we can get there.  But we know that it would simply be impossible to bring peace to Syria without everyone’s contribution. This is why we are insisting on strong political commitment to negotiations to be expressed in a united manner at the Brussels conference coming up in a couple of months from now, because we cannot afford to stop working for peace, and it is exactly in the darkest moments that the work for peace is most needed. We, the European Union, are not giving up on the Syrian people and will call on the rest of the world to do the same.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 301, "date": "2018-03-13.json", "name": "Cristian Dan PREDA", "mepid": "96838", "text": " on behalf of the PPE Group. — (FR) Mr President, High Representative, we cannot really talk about a civil war anymore by referring to Syria.

Children now account for a quarter of civilian deaths. The humanitarian situation is only worsening and the humanitarian aid cannot get in. It is unbearable to stand by in front of such a human tragedy and suffering. Russia is continuing to undermine UN credibility and mocking the international community, while every day we are watching the ‘Butcher of Damascus’ exterminating his own people. There is no peace process without a ceasefire all over Syria, including in Afrin, Ghouta and Idlib. The only result from what is happening in Syria is more and more suffering, war and radicalisation spread all over the region. This is why we should we acknowledge the impressive solidarity demonstrated by the neighbours of Syria towards the refugees.

The impact of this resolution in the field: null. Assad's offensive in East Goutha and Idlib and the Turkish one in Afrin did not stop even for an instant. The latest news tells us about thousands of civilians fleeing the Afrin region, with Turkish troops set to besiege the city. A possible disaster in the city of Duma, with the imminent attack of government troops and shelling on residential areas of Idlib, including a nursery. At the same time, policy initiatives rage. The Geneva process is effectively blocked, the détente zones envisaged by that of Astana have never been implemented. More like they are asserting themselves of the real division zones; not one, but many Siries, all looking for the biggest slice. And while I hope that the Brussels conference on 4 and 5 April will help to somehow unlock the situation, I am afraid that it will prove to be a mere reminder of the inability of diplomacy and the international community, ineffective and hitherto irrelevant. The truth is that the various forces on the ground in Syria are playing a deadly chess game, each pursuing their own strategic interests, united only by the fact that they have a complete disinterest in the lives of civilians. Under the false premise of fighting terrorism, alliances and realities change swirlingly. Just think of the paradoxical relationship between the United States and Turkey, until yesterday, historic NATO allies, of which they are the first, the second army, now in a geopolitical opposition such as to induce generals of an America less and less superpower to thunder admonitions to a possible Turkish advance, beyond Afrin and towards Manbij. In Syria, the end justifies the means, the cannons are thundered, and the reason is silent in this tragic and chaotic situation, where diplomacy has so far conspicuously failed. With the specter of an involuntary escalation always looming, I want to issue an appeal and an admonition: to Assad and Erdogan, I ask to demonstrate a shred of responsibility and also of humanity; they suspend immediately all military activities and allow humanitarian aid to reach those in need.

This was a fateful start to a ceasefire that was declared this week a failure by the US ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley. I note her warnings that if a solution cannot be imposed by the UN, then the US may be forced to take action independently.  Further comments from Russia suggesting that it would retaliate against the US directly in the event of any attacks against the Assad regime must be a cause for the gravest of alarms. As tensions between the UK and Russia increase following the recent assassination attempt of a former Russian spy on British soil, such high stakes diplomacy come at the worst possible time. The dismissal today of one of the most sensible voices in the US administration by President Trump – that is US Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson – is also of grave concern for what’s going on in the world.

In your words I found the same frustration, the same horror, the same atrocities, the same counting of victims and years, and I think the analysis is clear and broadly shared. Not unanimously, but broadly. We also indicated all the same things that need to happen to bring peace: a ceasefire, humanitarian access, accountability not impunity, political negotiations and the preservation of diversity. I could continue with a list that I am sure is reflected in the documents you are going to discuss and vote on and on which the European Union is, and continues to be, the first player. I have heard different tones and different accents, but I have not heard different proposals on things we should do differently. What are we doing? We are, and will continue to be, the first humanitarian donor. I put this first because I keep insisting on this. It is about saving lives We are the convening power that for more than a year now has been the one gathering the international community, keeping – as some of you said – Syria on top of the international agenda – there are not many others doing that at this moment – and continuing to work with the United Nations to unite the international community in sustaining, or trying to sustain, intra—Syrian talks. We are the only ones supporting the united Syrian opposition in Geneva, in Brussels – everywhere – and giving concrete support to their preparation for entering into direct negotiations in Geneva. We are the only ones that talk to all the international and regional players. Some of you said that it is time that we started talking about this or about that with this actor or with that actor. We are already doing that. What do you think I discuss when I discuss with the Turkish Foreign Minister, the Iranian Foreign Minister, the Russian Foreign Minister, the Saudi Foreign Minister, the Jordanian Foreign Minister or the US Secretary of State? I could continue. We are doing this every single day and we are the only ones, apart from the United Nations – and this is why we are working so closely together – who are talking to everyone with the same agenda, which is not our agenda. It is the Syrian’s people agenda. We are the only ones that have no hidden agenda other than the end of the war in a way that is possible and inclusive, which means with a transition. Because everybody knows that without a comprehensive political agreement any solution would last for what, one week, one month, six months? And then things would start again. So it is out of realism and also out of European interest because we share the same region that we are continuing to do this. Let me say that sometimes I feel we have remained – I am not sure if this is proper English, but the interpreters will help me – the only voice of reason in this conflict. I don’t know if you noticed but common sense is not necessarily the natural thing to apply in this world today. So are we doing enough? We are doing all we can. Is it producing results? Not all the results we would like to see. I think we are doing the right things, the things that are in our capacity to do and there are many of them. I am not saying the European Union role is limited. No, we have a huge role. If you took away all the things we are doing on the political, diplomatic and humanitarian side, the situation would be so much worse. It is not a justification. It is a tragedy, but it is like this. Are you asking me if this always works? No, this doesn’t always work. Some of you said this or that leader is not listening to us. I don’t know if you have noticed but we are not living in times in which many people listen to many others. We live in difficult times. We’re doing our best. I think we are achieving some results. It is frustrating because we have achieved many results, especially on saving lives and on stopping the fighting. We are far from reaching what we want, but we have to insist because we have been left with a big responsibility. Again, our work does not always bring results but this is what we have to continue to do with unity, because this is something I am quite proud of. Many say that we are divided, not only on this crisis but on most, if not all, the other things we are doing on external action and foreign policy. But not only have proved to be united as Europeans, if you look at the UN Security Council resolutions, we have helped build the unity of the international community. It is thanks to the European Union Member States and the work we have coordinated in New York that unanimity was reached in the Security Council. Not only were the Europeans united, but we managed to unite the international community, as we will do again in Brussels on 24 and 25 April. We have to continue playing this role because there is no one else left doing this. Is it enough? I repeat, no it is not enough. But we live in difficult times and we have to insist on doing this for as long as we do not manage to gather a sufficient international consensus and enough international support under the UN umbrella to find a solution to this conflict.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 350, "date": "2018-03-13.json", "name": "Rainer WIELAND", "mepid": "2323", "text": " — I have received seven motions for resolutions pursuant to Rule 123 (2) of the Rules of Procedure.

As Europeans we have always believed and invested in dialogue. I would say even more so when we have differences and difficulties. Last summer this Parliament voted to open a new phase in our relationship with Cuba. We decided, all the European institutions together, to continue to build, or to undertake to build, new channels for a deeper and stronger dialogue with Cuba. Because we believe this is the best possible way, not only to build a more peaceful and cooperative international environment, but also to improve the daily lives of our people, both in Europe and, crucially, inside Cuba. It is quite clear that we do not see eye-to-eye on all issues, we do have several disagreements with the Cuban Government. But only through dialogue and engagement can we address our differences, explore avenues of cooperation in different sectors and accompany Cuba in its modernisation, in particular in these times of change, with the end of President Castro’s mandate coming up. Today, we are here to discuss the preparations for the first joint Council between the European Union and Cuba and the way ahead. But let me start with a quick mention of what has happened since we signed our political dialogue and cooperation agreement. Our cooperation has started to make a positive difference for the people, and this is, I believe, what counts the most. I have seen it during my visit to Cuba at the beginning of this year. I have visited the centre for Cuban youth that we have opened in old Havana, together with UNICEF, that is providing young Cubans with the skills they need to live better lives and the space to meet and work on common projects in many different fields. I have also seen the new Centre for EU-Cuba Cultural Relations in the historic Palacio del Segundo Cabo. International cultural relations for the people of Cuba are an opportunity to meet the world and to look beyond their island, as well as to strengthen their own cultural tradition. And finally, while there, I heard the stories of 180 000 men, women and children who were hit by Hurricane Irma. We, the European Union, intervened immediately with our humanitarian aid in their support, and we are also helping them restart their farms and rebuild their homes in a more sustainable way so that the next hurricane will be less devastating than the last one. These are three examples of concrete projects that have already improved the life of the Cuban people thanks to our cooperation. For me, this is the sign of how promising this new season in our relations can be. The first joint Council meeting which we plan to hold in mid-May will be the opportunity to consolidate and expand this work. Together with the Foreign Minister Bruno Rodríguez, we expect to launch a number of sectoral dialogues in new areas of cooperation. Let me mention just three of them. First, renewable energy, which is key for both of us. Second, sustainable agriculture, especially for the areas hardest hit by the hurricane. Third, culture. I mentioned that already. Let me stress in particular as we mark the year of European Culture and in the year when the City of Havana celebrates its 500th anniversary. This is a field where I see enormous potential for our relations to be increased and deepened. Of course the Joint Council will also be an opportunity to discuss other issues, for instance the US embargo and its extraterritorial effects. As you know, the European position is very clear. We have already expressed it several times, we believe the embargo does not achieve the goal of improving the lives of the Cuban people. On the contrary, it is only damaging the Cuban people and the Cuban economy. As we prepare for the Joint Council, we are also working to formalise our annual human rights dialogue. As you know, such dialogue already started informally in 2015. Since then, it has allowed us to exchange on human rights issues directly, in a very open, frank, constructive manner with the Cuban authorities. And let me say if we care about human rights in Cuba – and we in this room all care – if we care about widening the space for civil society, this is the best path to follow, to the benefit of the Cuban people. Our political dialogue and cooperation agreement is the tool we need to better accompany and support a process of economic and social reform. It is the best tool we have to work for sustainable development, social justice, democracy and human rights. We do have disagreements as I said, and I am sure our Cuban friends would say the same. But there is also a lot that unites the European people and the Cuban people. We both believe in international cooperation and dialogue as the best way to address international disputes. We believe that a multilateral global order is possible and it would help us build a more sustainable development world-wide. And I won’t mention here all the cultural, historic links, the social links that are there between our people. So let us continue to engage, aware of the differences, ready to address them, in a spirit of dialogue, respect and frankness, aware also of the opportunities for our common work in different sectors of cooperation, and continuing to work on our side in unity. The European Parliament, together with all other European institutions, continues to invest in dialogue respectfully, without hiding the differences and the difficulties, but also while taking all the opportunities that this dialogue can bring about.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 355, "date": "2018-03-13.json", "name": "Luis de GRANDES PASCUAL", "mepid": "28393", "text": " on behalf of the PPE Group. — (ES) Mr President, Mrs Mogherini, it seems that, although relations between institutions continue to advance normally, Cuba is not fulfilling its commitments. It is true, Madam Vice-President: the path of dialogue is the best way to address disagreements, but I think there is no political will. The Cuban regime continues to use arbitrary arrests, dismissals of officials and harassment to silence criticism. It's not my words. With this forcefulness begins the report Amnesty International published a few weeks ago on Cuba. At a time when the country is facing an alleged generational shift, the reality is that 605 members of the National Assembly have been elected from 605 members previously appointed by the regime. Despite Cuba's alleged opening to the world, the island maintains internet censorship, as well as undue restrictions on access to information and freedom of expression. Last year alone, the Cuban Commission on Human Rights and National Reconciliation recorded at least 5,155 arrests of opponents. Meanwhile, Eduardo Cardet, a member of the Christian Liberation Movement, has been in prison since 2016. We believe, Mrs Mogherini, that, along with diplomatic forms, you should, at least, demand compliance with the agreements on the regime. Many believe that the end of Castroism opens an opportunity for the new generations of the Cuban people. And this despite the fact that there are indications that nothing is wanted to change. The European Union cannot look aside. Realpolitik has boundaries, and not everything should be red carpets. Let us remain hopeful that all dictatorships come to an end.

That approval was difficult. A few months later, at the beginning of the year, the High Representative traveled to Cuba. I think it was an important journey and demonstrated the European Union's willingness to establish a constructive dialogue with Havana. Sure, things aren't going to change in such a short time, that's obvious. But our impulse from the beginning has been that: to try to build a relationship that essentially aims to improve the lives of Cubans and Europeans, because it is a relationship that has to be symmetrical. Certainly, there is still a political blockade in Cuba that will have to be resolved, probably in the coming months. And then, when the exchange has been resolved in Cuba and the Joint Council meeting has been held in May, then I think it will be time to tell Mrs Mogherini to come to this House and explain how much we have made progress. I have not quite understood the obsession of any group with holding the debate today, when that Council has not yet met, that is, when the mechanism has not yet been implemented.

There was talk about the benefits of this Agreement to increase European Union trade and investment, but what about the human rights situation? Where is that modernization you were talking about in your first statements? Cuba remains a politically closed society, where political parties and independent civil society organizations cannot function legally. Annual human rights reports from international associations, such as Human Rights Watch or Amnesty International, warn us that the situation has not improved. The latest victims of the Government's practices have been, for example, Mrs. Dulce Amanda Durán, threatened to go to jail if she does not give up her work at the Cuban Commission for Human Rights and National Reconciliation; Mr. José Díaz Silva, leader of the opposition movement for a new republic; and priest Jonniel Rodríguez Riverol, who has also suffered physical violence by regime forces.

The agreement attempts to support human rights, to improve the living conditions and social rights of Cuban citizens, and to strengthen trade between the EU and Cuba. So far so good. But, obviously, the success of this agreement depends on its implementation and compliance with it. In my opinion, we should not just focus on economic relations, but work systematically in promoting the values of democracy and human rights, including the rule of law and good governance. I would like to point out that, in the past 15 years, this European Parliament awarded the Sakharov Prize three times to Cubans who fought for fundamental human rights. The Castro regime represses nearly all forms of political dissent; its rank of freedom of expression is among the worst in the world. Just to point out one recent example: last Wednesday, the former Presidents of Colombia and Bolivia, Andrés Pastrana and Jorge Quiroga, tried to travel to Havana to receive an award on behalf of a democratic initiative of Spain and the Americas. They were detained at Havana airport and denied entry to Cuba. With these actions, the Castro regime once again unsuccessfully tries to silence the voice of freedom and democracy in the country. A final remark: I regret, especially after the adoption of the European Parliament’s July 2017 resolution, that it has so far not been possible to organise a visit of a Committee on Foreign Affairs (AFET) delegation to Cuba.

In my view, the changes in the top offices should go further: they should entail, promote political and economic changes in Cuba, changes that bring it closer to the principles and standards that Europeans consider universal and which, in any case, are already the majority in Latin America — I mean multiparty democracy, respect for fundamental rights, the rule of law, the open economy and also the social State.

Indeed it is not true and it has never been true that we do not have bilateral relations between the European Union and Cuba. There is a Cuban Ambassador in Brussels who is accredited to the European Union, and our delegation is active in Havana and all over the island, not only for diplomatic exchanges, but also for running the various projects, including the humanitarian and development projects that we run on the island. We definitely have a strong and active diplomatic channel and presence, both of Havana in Brussels and of the European Union in Havana. Through our delegation in Havana, the role of civil society is constantly being encouraged. Meetings and regular exchanges take place. I myself, during a recent visit and previous visits, have always managed to meet members of civil society, although my visits were always extremely short. As many of you have said, that it is clear that our ideas, principles and practices in terms of human rights and democracy are different. This is no mystery. Isolation has never proven to be a way to encourage positive development. What can encourage positive development and channel our approach, our principles and our expectations is a strong, open, frank and constructive dialogue based not only on respect, but also on very clear messages that we never hide. It is more communication and more cooperation that will bring about positive developments, including in the area of fundamental freedoms. It is no mystery that Cuba, the Member States and the European Union as a whole have different political systems; this is obvious to all of us. The role of civil society and the issue of human rights and fundamental freedoms are part of our dialogue and our common work. One key element of the agreement we have is also the formalisation of the human rights dialogue. This is also one of the reasons why this Parliament approved and backed the agreement we negotiated. As I said, isolation has failed over decades to bring any positive developments, either in the island, or in our relations, including as regards relations between the European Union and the region. Some of you referred to the fact that Cuba also has a regional role in the Caribbean and in Latin America. Having this channel of dialogue open can be useful and helpful. Isolation, on the contrary, has traditionally strengthened conservative forces. This is why we all consider it important that this agreement has entered into force and why this Parliament gave its consent last year to adopt this historical agreement, which the Member States by unanimity adopted it. This is the expectation with which we enter into this process. Some of you rightly mentioned: now we have the agreement and the institutional backing on the European side to this agreement, we know all the opportunities and challenges are still in front of us. We simply have the instruments to enter into a different phase. The point is now to implement this agreement using this instrument, and I count on this Parliament to accompany this process as we proceed with the implementation of the agreement in all its different sectors, which also means holding the first Joint Council in May. When I was in Havana in January, we also discussed opening different sectoral dialogues, exploring the different opportunities that open up, as well as addressing the difficulties we might have, including the formulation of the human rights dialogue. I would expect that this Parliament will accompany us in this implementation phase, keeping clear our perspectives, our differences and our points of convergence. Let me finish by supporting very much what David McAllister, Chair of the Committee on Foreign Affairs (AFET), mentioned about the opportunity to have an AFET delegation visiting Cuba. I raised this personally with the Cuban authorities during my visit in January, including with the President of the National Assembly of the Parliament there, who welcomed this idea. Obviously, I will continue to encourage a move in this direction, because I believe that contacts need to be deepened in respect of the differences and in openness of the differences at all levels – institutions, civil society, human rights activists and the Parliament have an important role to play here.

As you might know, a few months ago, during my second visit to the region, I visited three of the five Central Asian countries. I was in Samarkand, where we had a very positive EU-Central Asia ministerial meeting. We have that ministerial meeting every year, which proves to be extremely useful and I am glad for the European Parliament’s continuous contribution to our work and also for your efforts to put this issue on the agenda, where it should be. Central Asia is often perceived as a remote part of the world but, in fact, Europe and the five Central Asian countries are now closer than ever. I believe this is more important now than before. Their neighbourhood is our neighbourhood. The Silk Road is not only a literary memory of the past, but one of the most important global infrastructure projects. Central Asia is, even more than in the past, a crossroads between Europe and the Far East, between Russia and South East Asia. Events in Afghanistan or in the Middle East are as important for us as for our partners in Central Asia. Their security is clearly also our security. We see clearly that, as the world is changing, this region is changing, too. Free elections and peaceful transitions of power are becoming a more regular feature. Central Asia has become more independent and stronger, a partner for the East and for the West, not the chessboard for some great game among empires. Today, Central Asian countries are seeking a closer partnership with the European Union. This is the clear message I got from all the leaders and ministers I have met from the region, especially in the last year: they are eager to deepen and increase cooperation with the European Union in all the different sectors. I believe this is a political will and the political signal we should get. They see us, the European Union, as a reliable, predictable, cooperative power with no hidden geopolitical agenda. And they see us as an indispensable partner for sustainable development and for modernisation. I would like to focus on three aspects of our relationship where we have already achieved a lot and where I see a lot of potential for greater progress. First, we are partners for change. For instance, we have supported Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Kazakhstan on their way to joining the World Trade Organisation, and we want to do the same for Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan. European companies are keen to invest in the region, to the benefit of both the European Union and Central Asia, and improving the business environment is an interest we share. Also, to this end, we have launched a new generation of enhanced partnership and cooperation agreements. We signed one with Kazakhstan, we are negotiating one with Kyrgyzstan, and we look forward to opening negotiations soon with Uzbekistan. These agreements are also an incentive for domestic reforms, in line with international values, norms and standards, so I hope that the European Parliament will soon give its consent to the ratification of our Partnership and Cooperation Agreement with Turkmenistan. When we talk about change, it is not just about business. I want to be very clear on this. It is, first and foremost, about expanding rights all around the region for the sake of the people of Central Asia. With independent media and an open space for civil society, institutions in Central Asia will be more credible, states will be more resilient in times of crisis, and economists would be more solid and attractive. Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan are engaged in important reform processes. We want to accompany them on this path. This is what I discussed during my visit last December, if I am not mistaken, to both countries and we want to work for that example to be followed by others in the region. Second, we are partners for regional cooperation. Central Asia remains one of the least integrated regions in the world. In Samarkand I saw great interest in our European experience on how to solve common problems through regional cooperation. Central Asia faces many challenges that no single country can address alone, from water scarcity to the fight against international trafficking, from trade to the issue of foreign terrorist fighters and the radicalisation of, especially, the younger generations. When it comes to intercontinental trade routes, Central Asian countries want to be more than just transit countries. They hope that these big infrastructure projects will bring sustainable development to their countries and support trade within the region, not only through the region. These are demands we can only support. It is also for this reason that I intend to present to the October Foreign Affairs Council a new strategy on connecting Europe to Asia. It will highlight the key principles which we believe should guide international work to promote connectivity. This new strategy will aim to give our partners, including Central Asian countries, more than one choice. It should help them avoid the debt trap and the trap of poor-quality projects. Last, but not least, the third sector of cooperation. The European Union and Central Asia are partners for security. We have a shared interest in supporting, for instance, an Afghan-led and Afghan-owned peace process. Uzbekistan will co-host a regional conference on Afghanistan at the end of March, in a few weeks from now. This is essential for our own security, and I will be there, personally, with the Afghan Government, with our Central Asian partners and with all our international interlocutors. International cooperation is the only way to tackle challenges that are cross-border by definition, such as radicalisation or the phenomenon of foreign terrorist fighters. We cooperate on border management with Central Asian countries and we have recently decided to deploy an EU counter-terrorism expert to Central Asia, who will be based in Bishkek in Kyrgyzstan. We will also participate in the high-level regional conference on counter-terrorism which Tajikistan will be hosting in early May. It is quite clear, also from the debates we have had previously, that we live in a world that is moving fast but not always in the right direction, which is quite dangerous and challenging. We are probably living in the most delicate moment since the end of the Cold War and there is very little space for positive news. Still, when I travel to a region like Central Asia I see more opportunities to take than threats to tackle: opportunities for change, for democratic perspectives, for economic growth and for cooperation on the different sectors I have mentioned now.

It would also help to respond adequately and timely to current challenges such as the ongoing democratisation processes in the region, fighting terrorism and extremism, as well as environmental issues.  In general, over the past years the geo-political environment has changed significantly in the region. The US has lost prestige, and its presence and its interest is decreasing in the region. The European Union, in spite of losing a bit of attraction because of the financial and refugee crisis and Brexit, can stay as active as China and Russia in the region – of course, not in a similar scope yet, but the EU is still key to Central Asia and its future.  Two new regional initiatives, China’s OBOR and the Russian-led Eurasian Economic Union, are taking the lead in investment and could potentially transform Central Asia’s political landscape, so the necessary instruments should be implemented in Central Asian countries in order to keep Russia’s and China’s political and economic influence under control. The EU should focus on realistic initiatives that fit with the existing regional projects, and the EU needs to be more actively present in each country of Central Asia in order to address the emerging geopolitical challenges and expand cooperation with the countries of the region.

I am determined to continue to do so. I have seen, as I said in the beginning, clearly a trend in these last three years in all our ministerial meetings, in all the bilateral meetings I’ve had with them – Presidents and Foreign Ministers – that the intention from their side is to do more with us in all fields.  I will only say that I count on your support to continue doing this. I commit to doing this more and more in all the different fields from the economic to human rights and rule of law, to security and to regional developments, including the security issue, the geo-political dynamics, the crossroads between east and west and north and south, and obviously also on sustainable development and own resources, including water.  There is one question I would like to answer: what can we offer? What I have seen, what they expect us to offer, is the European way, is the standards, is the quality. They know I believe that this comes in a package. It’s European standards on human rights and rule of law. It’s European standards on economic investments and business climate and rules of the game for the economic environment. It’s European standards and the European way on the way in which institutions work. It’s the European way in which society develops.  The feeling I have is that they would like to take the European Union as a model for their societies, for their economies, for their regional relations, for their security models. They know it’s a long way, but this is the direction I feel they intend to follow, without necessarily being trapped into the geo—political spheres of influence competition, but being able to move towards that kind of European way that we could offer. It is somehow a declination of the soft power we have, but it’s also very concrete. It’s true that from other places money could come more easily, but I think countries around the world, and in Central Asia included, are starting to realise that it is not necessarily the money that comes easily which is the best investment long term. I think this is the thing we can offer, which is sometimes complicated but always worthwhile trying.

Thanks to Tom, Bernd, Caroline, Miguel and Bas. As you know, the report on the European Semester that we are going to vote tomorrow is a breakthrough on the economic and budgetary policy to be pursued and provides solutions in order to reduce the increase in socio-economic inequalities within the same country and to limit the growth of the phenomenon of poor workers or to move towards a stronger convergence between Member States. I think we can rejoice: the economic situation is improving and a new course is beginning to emerge. This is obviously what is requested in this report and the Commission — which I thank — has included some of our remarks in its country-by-country recommendations. It decided to place more emphasis on integrating the social rights pillar and environmental issues into the guidelines of its recommendations. As we know, the European citizen is in need of a stable and healthy socio-economic climate, the main objective of which must be full employment. Europe remains the richest continent in the world, with still significant development potential, such as energy transition, but it is essential that our socio-economic instruments serve the cause of citizens, their jobs and their well-being. Workers face the impact of the rapid change in the economy every day and, as politicians, we must be able to respond to these changes and accompany them to prevent them from being the first victims of them. That is why we have included in this report a whole series of points, but I would like to highlight five points that I think are major. The first point focuses on the importance and need to increase private and public investment in order to invest in the real economy. Private investment only reaches the 2008 level, public investment is still 40% below the 2008 level. We have also asked the Commission to assess the obstacles to the implementation of major investment projects, which are often public-private partnerships, and to their depreciation over time. Without public investment, for example in terms of infrastructure or health care, there is unfortunately no private investment, and if these two factors are added, there can be no job creation. The second point relates to responsible public finances. Indeed, we insist that the budgetary guidelines, at national and euro area level, must ensure the long-term sustainability of public finances and their sound management. This good management must go hand in hand with an increase in wages. This is a proposal that is also supported by ECB President Mario Draghi, in order to enable workers to have higher purchasing power and thus to revive the economy as a whole, perhaps more effectively than the current measures. Secondly, we discussed the issue of structural reforms, in particular to strengthen the youth guarantee, the importance of education policies, support for microenterprises and to guarantee the sustainability of social security systems. In short, everything that makes the added value of our continent in the face of the rest of the world. Let us not hide, this added value is in danger and we must not only preserve it, but also intensify it so that Europe is once again synonymous with hope for these millions of young people. Of course, we are talking about European tax harmonisation, all the work that has already been done by Parliament and the need to go further, towards a common system of fair corporate taxation and, finally, the last chapter deals with greater integration in the Semester negotiations of the various actors, such as the European Parliament, but also national and/or regional parliaments and the social partners. I really believe that the ownership of the Semester by these different actors is a sine qua non prerequisite for better implementation of country-by-country recommendations. This is obviously just a first step. Other measures still need to be taken, such as reforming the Stability and Growth Pact in order to enable States to reinvest in services to citizens and boost employment. But I think we are on the right track for real economic and social change in Europe, and I hope that this report will have a large majority tomorrow.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "aws", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 403, "date": "2018-03-13.json", "name": "Krzysztof HETMAN", "mepid": "124895", "text": " rapporteur. — Mr President! The annual growth analysis formally begins the implementation of the 8th cycle of coordination and management of economic policy of the European Union, the European semester. In its Communication, the Commission proposed priorities on which Member States should focus their attention in implementing national policies and reforms in order to achieve sustainable inclusive growth within the framework of the so-called noble triangle, increasing investment, implementation structural reforms and the provision of adequate budgetary policy. The main signal from this year's report on the annual growth analysis indicates that the European economy is strengthening. After many years of economic slowdown, GDP growth is greater than forecast. Unemployment is falling steadily. The situation in the public finances of the Member States has improved and we are seeing an investment recovery. These positive signals show optimism, so the European Union and individual Member States must seize this favourable moment to continue reform and strengthen the positive trend. There is no doubt that there is still a lot of work ahead. Youth unemployment remains worryingly high at more than 16% all the time. As many as 6.3 million people aged 15—24 are not working or studying. Poverty and social exclusion levels remain high, too. There is an apparent problem with long-term unemployed people returning to the labour market, while as many as 44% of workers lack basic digital skills. We also face a mismatch of employee skills to employers' needs. Please note this paradox. On the one hand, in many places we still have high levels of unemployment, and on the other, entrepreneurs are increasingly reporting the problem of having no hands to work. So far it has been an employer market, now it's an employee's market. And this problem, that is, people still without work and employers seeking workers, it occurs in regions both rich and peripheral. We are also not making the most of the potential of SMEs and new technologies. Meanwhile, we need to be aware that rapidly changing labour markets will require reform and new developments in both education and training and labour organisations. Challenges also include demographic problems and a broad balance between private life and work, including parental leave and childcare, but also a return to the labour market or care for the long-term ill and elderly. I believe that the issues I have listed should be the most important priorities on which Member States must focus their attention in implementing national policies and reforms in order to achieve sustainable inclusive growth. Further intensive action is needed to improve the competitiveness of the European economy and increase the productivity of our businesses. However, we must not forget that a man must be at the heart of our actions, so work to improve the health of the European economy must go hand in hand with the work to strengthen our social policy. I believe that the inclusion of a pillar of social rights in the European semester cycle can be an effective tool for achieving this objective. I therefore hope that the pillar's assumptions will be permanently combined with the recommendations for Member States during the semester. However, I would like to emphasise that even the best formulated objectives and recommendations will not be translated into real positive change if they remain solely on paper. It is therefore essential that Member States improve the level of implementation of the recommendations made during the semester.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "aws", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 404, "date": "2018-03-13.json", "name": "Nedzhmi ALI", "mepid": "34250", "text": "  rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Budgets. – Mr President, strong economic governance and better policy coordination between the Member States could not be done without the European semester.

In this regard, a real synergy between budgetary and monetary policies should be introduced in order to stimulate growth and job creation as well as to revive investments. Ambitious reforms of the euro area governance should be proposed, including the introduction of a special instrument to support the adoption of the euro by the non-euro Member States who have committed themselves to adopting the euro. Important is the evolution of the European Stability Mechanism towards the European Monetary Fund. Public and private investment in infrastructure, research and development, innovation and education should be encouraged in order to achieve the goals of budgetary growth and employment policies.

The Council attaches great importance to the Semester, and I am pleased to exchange views with Parliament on this subject.  If we are to make Europe relevant to peoples’ daily lives, we need to achieve good results on growth and jobs, high-quality education, social protection and inclusion, as well as environmental sustainability. We should stress here that it is question of ownership. Implementation of structural reforms under the European Semester is key for strengthening the resilience and potential growth of Member States and the European Union as a whole. An agreement on common objectives is therefore important. Your reports show that we see these common objectives, and I am glad that we have this opportunity to discuss them with you today and that you have done so recently with national parliaments. To start on a positive note, evidence suggests that Europe’s economy is strengthening, employment is growing, investment is recovering and public finances are improving. Yet, clearly, many challenges remain. You have identified a number of them in your reports. While the recovery is turning into expansion and is becoming more broad-based, some Member States still face major structural challenges. High debt levels and high youth unemployment rates remain a source of concern. Also, investment activity has not yet reached the levels we aspire to.  Boosting investment remains a priority in order to promote a more robust recovery and to secure healthy growth rates in the long run. The extension of the European Fund for Strategic Investment in terms of financial capacity is an important step towards achieving this goal. Let us continue to work together to stimulate social investment and human capital, to lift the remaining barriers, and to foster a truly favourable investment climate. Furthermore, we need to support growth with smart fiscal policies while paying close attention to the long-term sustainability of our budgets and debts.  We also need to implement the necessary structural reforms on our product and labour markets in order to prepare our economies for the challenges ahead. We must provide our young citizens with high-quality education and invest in their skills today. The Single Market is a great EU asset, and we should join forces for its further development. During the presidency, we plan on making progress on the initiatives of the Digital Single Market Strategy, as we think digitalisation is crucial for the competitiveness of the industry in the European Union. In view of these challenges, the Bulgarian Presidency has outlined the digital economy and skills for the future as one of our four priorities. We are committed to contributing to the process of completing the Digital Single Market as a source of growth and competitiveness, while also focusing on the development of skills and competences of the 21st century. As we are now leaving crisis times behind us, the legacy of the crisis remains a concern. Some citizens are trapped in a cycle of poverty and social exclusion from which they cannot easily escape. This is an important issue for the presidency. Our policy efforts need to be geared toward those with the most disadvantages. They also need to be geared towards those regions and sectors which are undergoing the most difficulties. We need to think of new solutions to new problems whilst seizing the opportunities ahead of us.  The collaborative economy represents a huge potential, but it cannot be a reason to backtrack on employment and social rights. Employment and social policies need to adapt to the changes in the labour markets, but at the same time workers’ rights should remain protected. Environmental policy, together with the greening economy and greening the European Semester can contribute in a very significant manner to the broad policy objectives of stimulating sustainable growth and creating jobs. The environmental implementation review initiative will be again on the Council’s agenda next year. What is key is to focus on the full implementation of the reforms and to carefully monitor the progress in each Member State. We should share our experiences and use best practices examples to learn from each other. Only by closely working together to constantly push for reforms, and to continuously support inclusive growth and job creation, will we be successful in creating tangible benefits for every citizen and in rebuilding trust in a strong and prosperous European Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 406, "date": "2018-03-13.json", "name": "Marianne THYSSEN", "mepid": "1832", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, it is a pleasure to talk this House today, and a special pleasure because it is nice to be able to bring some good news. This year’s Semester takes place amid steady economic expansion. Europe is seeing the highest growth rate in a decade, investment is picking up, employment is at record levels and the unemployment rate is almost where it was before the crisis. The share of people at risk of poverty or social exclusion fell to the pre-crisis level. Public finances are improving and the banking sector is well capitalised. Our strategy of investment, structural reforms and responsible policies is working.  Still, in some Member States the legacy of the crisis is visible in the high levels of debt and non-performing loans, and in the unemployment rates. Indeed, also, the risk of poverty and social exclusion remain high in some countries and 18 million people are seeking a job. We need to use the current good times to strengthen our economic foundations, improve resilience and support convergence.  I take from the two reports on the Annual Growth Survey which we are discussing today, that we share views on the challenges and where the European Union and Member States should focus their efforts. We must make sure that today’s growth is inclusive and sustainable and that our economies and societies are prepared to harness the opportunities and address the challenges that technology and globalisation bring.  So let me thank the two rapporteurs, Mr Bayet and Mr Hetman, and the rapporteur for the Committee on Budgets for these excellent reports.  Raising productivity is the only way to achieve higher living standards and greater prosperity. For this we need investment, not just in infrastructure but also in human capital, research and innovation, and this requires ensuring an investment-friendly environment including by tackling corruption and ensuring respect for the rule of law. Beyond that, only an educated, skilled labour force can seize new opportunities when the labour market changes, and only with proper social security can people make the necessary transitions in the new world of work. Human beings is indeed what Europe is about.  In terms of fiscal policy, we stress the need for the right balance between supporting growth and ensuring sustainable public finances. Good times should be used to build buffers and reduce high debts. Fair, growth-friendly taxation and well-targeted spending remain crucial. The European Semester has proven instrumental for the coordination of policies in the Union. We run it in a spirit of cooperation and partnership. We engage in discussions with the national authorities and stakeholders at national and at European level, including the national parliaments and social partners.  Last week, the Commission issued its assessment of the economic and social challenges for 27 Member States, including the relevant detailed analysis of macroeconomic imbalances. We see that the imbalances are receding in the context of a favourable economic environment. We de—escalated the macroeconomic imbalances procedures for four countries. Slovenia has successfully corrected its imbalances and left the procedure. France and Bulgaria were de—escalated from excessive imbalances to imbalances. So was Portugal, which still needs to address the high levels of public, private and external debt.  We also see that the implementation of country specific recommendations has slightly improved as compared with last May. Since 2011, Member States have made at least some progress on more than two-thirds of their recommendations. When implementing reforms, Member States can count on the support of our Structural and Investment Funds as well as our Structural Reform Support Service.  Last week we adopted the Annual Work Programme for the Structural Reform Support Programme to support 24 Member States, with more than 140 projects.  Maybe the most important message of this Semester is that economic growth and social progress go hand in hand. This year’s Semester is a landmark. Our country reports have never been so social. You know that we proclaimed the European Pillar of Social Rights at the Social Summit a few months ago, and this is our joint political commitment by the Commission, by the European Parliament and by the Council to move forward with the stronger social Europe. But the success of the pillar depends on the extent to which we implement it at European level, but especially at national level. The Semester is our key instrument to make the principles and rights included in the pillar a reality on the ground.  Following the proclamation, for the first time the principles of the pillar are now embedded in the Semester. To help with monitoring and implementation we have developed, together with the Member States, a social scoreboard with 14 headline indicators that cover the three dimensions of the pillar: equal opportunities and access to the labour market, to education also, dynamic labour markets and fair working conditions and public support, social protection and inclusion.  Ladies and gentlemen, we need to use the good times to build a resilient economy – one that is less vulnerable to economic shocks and more able to respond to them. For this, we need reforms that combine the goals of stability and efficiency with a strong focus on fairness and inclusiveness. That is why we are now starting the second phase of the 2018 European Semester by taking the dialogue to the Member States on the basis of the country reports, and such strengthened dialogue will be very valuable in the preparation for the 2018 set of country specific recommendations in May.

Investment can stimulate demand in the short term, which is crucial in the current economic context. Secondly, responsible fiscal policies are essential for sustainable economic growth. If we want to keep public finances under control, we really need to start preparing for the elephant in the room: the growing ageing population. If we do not take our responsibility now and do not make the affordability of pensions and care priority number one, then this is guilty of absenteeism towards every young person in Europe. Thirdly, structural reforms. Productivity-enhancing structural reforms will not only attract investment, but also increase real incomes. Digitisation and technological progress ensure a thorough redesign of our labour market. We must go for dynamic labour markets, supported by accessible social security systems.

Mr President, I should like to begin by speaking on the Rules That's why I just made the mark. So if you wouldn't count that on my speaking time yet. On a point of order, I would like to comment and request that the German translation of the report be reviewed and corrected. I don't think it's right. I would like to refer here to paragraph 18 of the report. According to the German translation, “points to the fact that the rise in real wages has recently lagged behind productivity growth, even though there have been improvements in the labour market;” This is not the English original. I would like to point this out because the English original wording was intensively negotiated in the shadow rapporteurs meetings. In the original in the original, the simultaneity of these two developments has been recorded, i.e. productivity growth was stronger than wage growth, and at the same time the situation in the labour market has improved. In the German translation, on the other hand, the impression is given as if this is somehow a contradictory development or as if there is a backlog in real wages. This is exactly what we wanted to prevent in the report. I therefore believe that a German translation should mean 'during this improvement'. Thank you for your patience with this point of order. If you will allow me, I will start my speech now. Ladies and gentlemen! We have heard two very different opinions here, on the one hand from the Bulgarian Presidency and on the other from Mrs Thyssen, and I wondered how different that has been. Mrs. Thyssen, you have painted everything in the most rosy colors. Did you really say: “The banks are well capitalized”? I think there are a lot of people who see this very differently. Did you really say that unemployment is back to pre-crisis levels? I'd like to ask you to take a look at the statistics. In Italy, Spain, Greece, unemployment is now more than twice as high as ten years ago, more than twice as high as before the start of the crisis. I do not understand how you can draw such a picture. What Mrs Panayotova said was very interesting. She said: 'The internal market is a big trump card in the EU. 'I fully agree with you. But what you didn't say is: 'One big trump card is the EU's other major integration project: the euro. 'Why didn't you say 'the euro is a big trumb'? Have you forgotten to say that, or do you agree with me that the euro is not a big asset, that the euro may even be a barrier? If we look into this report that has been adopted here, paragraph 2 says exactly what is suffering in the euro area. It says: 'We have structural problems, we have insufficient growth in production potential, productivity, competitiveness, we have a lack of ambitious and socially balanced structural reforms.” Yes, you cannot talk about these things without saying at the same time: we have a currency that does not allow depreciation and thus makes it very, very, very difficult to restore competitiveness.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "aws", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 414, "date": "2018-03-13.json", "name": "Caroline NAGTEGAAL", "mepid": "190519", "text": " on behalf of the ALDE Group. — (NL) Mr President, where I come from, Rotterdam, the largest port in Europe, we have a very clear moral: say what you think and do what you say.

If we have a problem together, we should not talk about it endlessly, but solve it together. Only then will we be stronger. Only then will we really help Europe forward. As far as I am concerned, 'deal is agreement' should also apply to the economic policy of the European Union. Because economy is also being able to rely on each other. In order to prevent another crisis, the Member States must reform so that their economies are very resilient, even when it is down. They must put the hell to the nering and prepare for the future. Above all, let us keep each other to these agreements. Then we pull each other up instead of down. I am convinced that this is the way forward for Europe.

The dizzying rise in inequality is the real challenge facing Europe. This inequality is the result of the current economic architecture of the European Union, the Stability and Growth Pact, the European Semester or new institutions, such as the European Monetary Fund, which are part of the problem and not the solution. And these are elements that are precisely separating us from this report. Because this is not settled with a small reform of the governance mechanisms. Ladies and gentlemen, in order to end the deep inequalities that are affecting Europe, we need urgent reforms, which will allow a change in the productive, socially and ecologically sustainable model, capable of creating quality employment in all Member States. A plan that cannot be implemented within the narrow frameworks of the Stability and Growth Pact or in projects, such as the Juncker plan.

Since the so-called independence of the ECB, the power of democratic control has been withdrawn from states and peoples. The 2011 debt crisis was the direct consequence of this, as the monetization of public debt has become impossible. Secondly, the irrevocable exchange rate fixing has led to deep and growing macroeconomic differences among euro area States. No corrective mechanism exists, which explains Germany's super-surpluses! Thirdly, with banking union, the power of control of banks is based in Frankfurt. Blackmail to the financial stability of banks can thus be exercised without the State being able to intervene. Cyprus in 2013 and Greece in 2015 are the cases of school. Finally, States' budgetary margins for manoeuvre are being phased out. Since the Maastricht 3% criterion, Germany has obtained both the fiscal pact and the European Semester: a tank tank that does not work.

It has caused permanent damage to Europe, and more specifically to the eurozone Member States. It has shown that, in a very heterogeneous economic area, a single currency does not make sense for all countries and regions. States and regions have specific problems and need specific solutions to them. My committee's proposals go in the opposite direction. All demands are aimed at increasing competences and responsibilities at EU level. Wherever there is a problem, the call for centralisation and intra-European redistribution is being voiced. Examples include calls for European unemployment insurance, more skills for the new European Labour Market Authority, and more resources for the social pillar. In no case is there any need to reduce EU competences or even save resources. This is the wrong signal with regard to the lack of cash flow due to Brexit.

Among the goals of the European Semester are structural reforms to create more jobs and growth. The pillar aims to provide equal opportunities on the labour market to improve social protection and inclusion.  The challenges of balanced economic growth and social protection are closely interconnected, since poverty undermines economic development. In addition, poverty is a security risk. Poverty reduces the people’s trust in the European project and prevents support for important reforms. Poverty degrades human dignity and is not compatible with the European values that we defend in this institution. Poverty distorts democratic processes and gives a chance to irresponsible populists. Therefore, the pillar should become an important and necessary tool for ensuring a better future for Europe.  At the moment, the 20 principles of the pillar are important, but not legally binding declarations. To start the work of the pillar, we need legislative initiatives from the Commission. The progress of the country-specific recommendations shows that the Member States are reluctant to implement advice that is not based on legally binding norms.

However, please note that every recovery has its end, and the current period of economic recovery in the United States is already over 103 months. This is, at the moment, the second ever longest period of prosperity. Therefore, sooner or later there will be a slowdown. And in this context, I want to say that Europe is not quite prepared for this economic downturn, which will surely be affected by the European continent in four, six, eight quarters. I see two threat areas. Firstly, investments where we see weak momentum. The level of investment is still below the level of the 2007-08 period, which is 10 years ago. And that's the first cause for concern. The second reason is very high debt, especially the private sector. I would like to point out that the ratio of borrowing to GDP in the private sector in the European Union has increased by 10% over the past seven years and 20% in the euro area.

This is at a time when unemployment has been at its lowest level since 2009, at 10.5%, and we had the lowest interest rates.

Yes, we are improving the European Semester. My third point is that the European Semester is essential for economic policy coordination in the Member States, and for addressing the challenges and the need for action. However, it does not replace the development of monetary union into a full economic and social union. I therefore call for the House of the Banking Union to finish the House of the Banking Union, adopt the new missing measures of the Capital Markets Union, and deepen the Economic, Social and Monetary Union.

But now is the time for increasing convergence and strengthening resilience for bad times. Now is the time to implement reforms, including those linked to the pillar, to strengthen social resilience, to support and empower entrepreneurs and workers and other citizens, women and men, young and old alike, wherever they are born so that they can embrace the changes of the 21st century, and no longer have to fear them. We can only succeed if we act together, and thus our dialogue does not stop today. Our intention is to pursue dialogue with you, the European Parliament, with Member States, with national parliaments, with social partners and all relevant stakeholders throughout the cycle of the Semester. Likewise, we encourage Member States to involve social partners and civil society in the definition and implementation of major reforms. The European Parliament’s active participation in the debate on the annual growth survey is important. I salute the work done by the rapporteurs, by the committees and the Members involved in the drafting of the reports. Your insights and views are very valuable to feed into our work on the European Semester. In recent years, at the height of the crisis as well as in the current more favourable conditions, the European Semester has proven instrumental to foster, guide and support reform processes in Member States. I look forward to continuing our constructive dialogue in the coming months.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 442, "date": "2018-03-13.json", "name": "Monika PANAYOTOVA", "mepid": "116663", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Mr President, honourable Members, before making my concluding remarks I would like to respond to the questions specifically addressed for my attention by Mr Lucke.  I would like to say that the future of the European monetary union is a question of interest for all European citizens, so we will work on creating optimal conditions for strong and sustainable economic growth in the European Union, through initiatives to strengthen the European monetary union. In March, leaders of the euro area will hold an open debate on long—term issues that are specific to the euro area, and work on the follow-up to the December Euro Summit is ongoing, with a view to a first set of decisions by the leaders in June.  Concerning my concluding remarks, I would like to thank you very much for your remarks. You addressed important points and your remarks will provide valuable input for discussions in the Council that touch upon many aspects of the European Semester, such as education, employment – with particular accent on youth employment – competitiveness, environmental and social policies. The Country Reports published by the Commission last week represent the next important step in the current European Semester. They formed the basis for the work which will eventually lead to the adoption of this Semester’s country—specific recommendations during the summer. When working on the European Semester and debating the country specific recommendations, we should always remember the importance of reaching as many citizens as possible, to increase national ownership.

In conclusion, I would like to say that while economic expansion is stronger in 2018, inequalities between our fellow citizens are still far too present and therefore within the framework of the Semester coordination tool and with this marked economic improvement, I think we cannot be mistaken. I believe that we really need strong actions — as you said, Commissioner — balanced and inclusive, and there is still much to be done on this, but I am particularly pleased — and this is partly thanks to you, Mrs Thyssen — the full integration of the social pillar and its 14 indicators into the full integration of the social pillar and its 14 indicators into the European Semester because, contrary to what some people think, social is not just an expenditure but can also be an engine of the economy. There have been numerous studies which have shown that an investment of 2% of European GDP in the social sector would create nearly 20 million jobs in Europe, including women's jobs. So it was more than time, if we really want to be effective, to analyze our economic policies from a social and environmental perspective, and of course I welcome that.

First of all, I would like to thank you for today's interesting debate, the European Commission for preparing a comprehensive and balanced annual growth analysis, as well as my colleagues and fellow Members from other political groups for working together on this important report. Today's debate has clearly shown that all of us is a single goal of an economically strong European Union, which cares for its citizens and wants to ensure a decent life, stable employment and access to quality social services. I am very pleased that today during the debate, the issue related to care and children in general has resounded several times. Personally, however, I am a proponent of the pragmatic approach and the so-called golden measure. For I believe that by setting ourselves too ambitious and unrealistic objectives, we risk simply not being able to achieve them, by which means we will remain in the same place instead of moving closer to the goal. On the other hand, by focusing too much on one aspect, be it the economy or social issues, we can neglect the latter, which will also cause a valuable balance between the two. For we must remember that the economy and social issues are closely intertwined and dependent on each other. We can't have strong social policies if we don't have a strong economy, and vice versa. I think in the report on the annual growth analysis we have been able to reflect this need for a balanced approach.

The rise in employment growth is more significant among older workers, high-skilled workers and men, while it is weaker among young, low-skilled workers and women, whose advancement should continue to work. However, despite the slight improvement in employment, the youth unemployment rate remains worryingly high and is 16.6% and 18.7% respectively in the euro area.
