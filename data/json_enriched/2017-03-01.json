However, this will not simply be a birthday celebration. It should also be the birth moment of the European Union of 27, and as we turn the page and commence a new chapter in our history, it is time we sought new answers to a question as old as our Union is young: quo vadis Europa at 27? Europe’s founding fathers were visionaries. Altiero Spinelli and Ernesto Rossi, imprisoned by a fascist regime, dared to dream of a place where allies and adversaries would unite. Unable to speak freely, they penned the manifesto for a free and united Europe, which had to be circulated secretly in Rome among the Italian resistance movement in 1943. In writing this manifesto, this new chapter, Spinelli and Rossi decided not to cling to the darkness surrounding them in their Ventotene prison cells. They stretched out their arms to the light instead. They dreamed of a better future and paved the way towards it. Sixty years later, this should be an inspiration for us. With nothing to dim our voices, would we be forgiven for not speaking up? In 60 years’ time, what will our grandchildren say of our legacy? I want them to be proud, as Spinelli and Rossi would probably have been today. Now is our time to be pioneers and to carve out a vision so that we may work hand in hand, united at 27, towards our future. Dear Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, dear colleagues! The world around us changes every day. The changes and changes are rapid. Globalization, terrorism, migration, the effects of new technologies on society and jobs are profoundly changing everyday life for Europeans. Circumstances, Relationships and relationships do not change annually, monthly or weekly, they change daily - so much and so quickly that we sometimes get out of breath. There are great challenges and high hurdles ahead of us. They are tall and tall, but by no means insurmountable. Either we are overtaken or rolled over by such developments, or we get involved in them, shape them and seize the new opportunities that they bring with them. Europe must not get tired. Europe must be wide awake and actively, sometimes proactively, use opportunities and opportunities. As my friend Frank-Walter Steinmeier said: If we want to encourage others, we need some ourselves. The future of Europe must not be held hostage by election periods, party politics or short-term reports of success in domestic politics. Brexit, as regrettable and painful as it may be, will not be able to stop the European Union on its march into the future - we will continue, we must continue! Where are you going europe Quo vadis, Europe? Where is the Europe of 27 headed? There is really no better time or time than now to have this admittedly difficult debate. All deliberations and debates about which path to take must have an essential task in mind, and the solution to this task must determine the actions of all of us. Let's be honest: for far too long what people expected from Europe was too far removed from what Europe could offer and achieve. Our task will be to make it clear what Europe can and what Europe cannot. Take, for example, the fight against unemployment and, in particular, youth unemployment. We meet summit after summit and promise to lower the number of unemployed, especially youth unemployment. However, this is far beyond what Europe can do alone. On European level we cannot work miracles if national measures fall short. We can finance training programs, stimulate investments - the latter not without success, incidentally - but that does not automatically and per se lead to a systematic decline in unemployment. The EU budget only contributes 0.3% to European social budgets - 0.3%! The Member States contribute 99.7%. To say that Europe has sole responsibility when it comes to combating unemployment is simply wrong. Then we shouldn't pretend that Europe alone can solve the problem. We and the member states should finally admit this. We shouldn't make people believe that we can conjure up the sun and moon if at most we can provide a telescope. We should stop announcing intentions and instead focus more on the areas where we can deliver tangible results. The starting point for the Commission's White Paper that I am putting to you today is this: it is time - I repeat myself - that we clarify what Europe can and cannot do. Far too often the debate about Europe's future is reduced to more or less Europe. But this approach is misleading, just as all over-simplification is misleading. In the White Paper we present different paths for the future of the EU-27: five scenarios for the European Union of 27, although in reality there may be more possibilities. Not all scenarios find the spontaneous approval of the Commission, but all five scenarios are under discussion, so we have to deal with them. We need to explain what consequences each of these scenarios can lead to. Let's look at a first scenario that is based on a continuation of the previous policy. When this commission took office, I promised this House that things would be different to regain people's trust, and to a large extent, hopefully, we will. The Commission has already made great strides in breaking the long-standing reflex of regulating every aspect of people's daily lives and getting involved in everything. People don't want us to regulate toilet flushing or the height of children's swings. We have withdrawn hundreds of proposals and are proposing only 23 new initiatives per year instead of 130 initiatives per year, as was the case in previous years. We focus on the big things that are really important to people. And yet the Commission is accused of over-regulation in all capitals, in almost all national parliaments, sometimes here too, in almost all of the press. This permanent Brussels bashing makes no sense because this Brussels bashing has had no basis since this Commission took office. Incidentally, it would do us all good if we stopped bashing this Brussels, this European Union bashing. This is very often a substitute for national failures. We can go on and on, putting all our energies into achieving results in key areas and moving forward on our positive agenda, which this House has approved. Completing the Single Market, the Digital Single Market, the Energy Union, the Capital Markets Union and the Defense Union. We do that too. And we will do that. But the question must be allowed whether that is sufficient. We could also take the opposite path and, as the European Union of 27, limit ourselves exclusively to the internal market: Scenario 2. If the member states cannot agree on a common position in more and more political areas, if more and more governments degrade the Commission to a simple internal market administrator would like, this might be the only one viable solution. It's not our solution, my solution. The European Union is more than a more or less sophisticated free trade area. Europe is more than a market, goods and money. The single market and the euro are not goals in themselves. You have to serve man and man. Nevertheless, there are governments who want to reduce the role of the European Union and therefore of the Commission to internal market administration. I am strictly against it! Then there is a third option, a third scenario. Do all member states of the European Union always have to move forward at the same pace? If we cannot reach agreement among the 27 on goals or pathways, then those who want to move forward in different areas should be allowed to make further progress where they feel necessary. At the same time, the others who cannot be at the start or who do not want to be at the start must have the opportunity to join the intentions and deeds of the first-time starters later. But how would such a system work? For a small number of countries, this approach could bring great advances. This would undoubtedly be a viable option for countries that wish to exchange, for example, all information on the fight against terrorism, to set up a real European asylum system and to pool defense capacities. However, it could also create a complex system of concentric circles in which many countries would orbit outside the orbit of central political strategies. That would make Europe even more difficult to understand than it already is. How do you explain to people, for example, that Europe is responsible for harmonizing frequencies on which autonomous vehicles can call the emergency services in the event of an accident, but only in countries X, Y and Z, and therefore they would not get any Help when you are in country A. We are already seeing the difficulties of this approach when we try to explain that Europe is partly responsible for monitoring the Schengen external borders, but only partly. And yet: The idea that some Member States are making progress in some areas and breaking the path for those who want to join later cannot simply be put aside. This form of the avant-garde does not aim at exclusion, but at later inclusion. To be honest, I can get a lot from this approach. The goal must remain to march forward to 27. If this turns out to be impossible, the coalition of those willing to integrate must be given permission to continue. European successes were almost always the work of leading pioneers. See Schengen, see Euro. (Applause) But there is a fourth possibility: the EU-27 could jointly decide to do more in a slightly smaller number of areas. In other words, in areas where our European measures would add real added value and where people rightly expect more from us: scenario number 4. Ultimately, this would mean that we are operating on the principle of “less is more”. Examples of areas in which citizens expect more from us are security policy and the so-called diesel gate. A real European Counter-Terrorism Agency, exchanging information across borders and systematically monitoring suspects, could - I am convinced - offer tangible added value for the security of all of us. In the same way, European consumers who are misled by the technical manipulation of car manufacturers must be able to rely on an EU agency that can enforce sanctions against companies who are deceiving and ensure that they also have to pay compensation - everywhere. Instead of the To disappoint people by sending out sharply worded letters calling on Member States to act, we have to make sure that those calls are met. Finally - Scenario 5 - Member States could also choose to share more powers and resources and make more decisions together. In this way you could give full throttle, shape the newly organized common ground into the future and ensure the leadership of the European Union. Climate protection: Europe must continue to play a pioneering role here, regardless of what is on the other side of the Atlantic. Sustainable development: a permanent European task. Defense: Here, further independent contributions from Europe must be listed. Toutes ces perspectives, toutes ces esquisses, tous ces projets théoriquement possibles sont des choix qui s’offrent à nous. Tout en ayant récusé l'idée qu'il faudrait réduire l'Union européenne à l'état de zone de libre-échange, ce qui n'est pas mon concept et qui ne correspond pas aux ambitions de l'Europe, je ne vais pas vous dire ma préférence absolue aujourd'hui parce que, en fin de compte, ce n'est pas à moi seul - et je le regrette - ni à la Commission de faire ces choix «in splendid isolation». Je n’ai pas voulu présenter les vues définitives de la Commission. Je ne procède pas, alors que c’est devenu la mode, par “executive audace”. La parole sera à votre Parlement, aux parlements nationaux, aux gouvernements, à la société civile, bref, aux citoyens. Contrairement à ce qui, jadis, fut la règle, la Commission ne prescrit pas, ne dicte pas, n’instruit pas. Elle veut être à l’écoute avant de se prononcer définitivement. Pas de dictat - cela ne correspond pas à mon tempérament - mais de l’écoute. Je ne suis pas un dictateur, mais j’aime dire les choses comme je les vois. J’aimerais annoncer la couleur, ma conception de l’Union européenne dès aujourd’hui, et je mesure la déception de ceux qui auraient voulu que je le fasse. Mais nous préférons écouter avant de dire. À ceux qui voudraient qu’avant le débat, la Commission dise ce qu’elle voudrait être, je dirai qu’il ne faut pas confondre leadership et diktat. Contrairement à ce qui a été fait jusqu’à présent, nous voulons d’abord écouter avant de nous prononcer. Cela peut conduire - je l’ai lu - à des déceptions majeures, mais c’est une méthode qui fait honneur à la démocratie non seulement representative mais aussi entière. Parler d'institutions, de révision des traités, de procédures institutionalnelles - débat qui agite ceux qui sont installés dans le confort de la bulle bruxelloise, qu'il faudra, à tout prix, que nous quittions tous ensemble - ne m'intéresse pas pour l'instant. D’ailleurs, un tel discours n’intéresserait pas les citoyens. Vous, qui faites des réunions dans tous vos pays, vous a-t-on jamais posé une question sur l’équilibre des pouvoirs entre le Conseil, la Commission et le Parlement? Jamais! Jamais je n’ai eu à répondre à une telle question! C’est donc un débat typiquement bruxellois qui, mis à part ceux qui sont installés dans le confort de la bulle bruxelloise, n’intéresse personne. Il ne faudrait donc pas conduire ce débat. Viendra, j’en suis certain, le jour où les traités devront être adaptés à une volonté collective, mais à une volonté collective à naître. Car elle n’existe pas aujourd’hui. Pour pouvoir donner corps à cette volonté collective, il nous faut un véritable débat, un débat honnête sur l’Europe et sur ce que les citoyens attendent de l’Union européenne. Cette conversation vertueuse ne doit pas avoir lieu seulement à Rome or encore à l’occasion de nos nombreux sommets or de nos nombreux débats ici même. Elle doit avoir lieu dans les villes et les régions, partout en Europe. C’est avec vous, Mesdames et Messieurs les députés, et avec les États membres que nous tiendrons une série de débats sur l’avenir de l’Europe. Chaque voix, même minuscule, à peine audible même, doit être entendue. Les citoyens nous diront ce qu’ils attendent de l’Union européenne. Ils exprimeront vraisemblablement leurs doutes, leurs interrogations, mais aussi leurs espoirs. À nous d’y répondre. Le Livre blanc, que je vous invite à lire, y comprised son introduction et l’échange des arguments pour et contre, nous aidera à formuler les bonnes réponses. Au cours des prochains mois, la Commission apportera de nouvelles contributions à ce large débat avec une série de documents de réflexion et de propositions plus précises portant sur les grands enjeux dont demain sera fait. Nous présenterons nos idées sur le renforcement de la dimension sociale, débat à mes yeux essentiel et auquel j’apporte toute mon attention. Ceux qui applaudissent, lorsqu’on parle d’Europe sociale, ne font pas la majorité dans cette salle. Honte à vous! Parce que l’Europe sociale est un enjeu principal pour les décennies à venir. Nous présenterons nos vues sur l’approfondissement de l’Union économique et monétaire et, notamment, sur les mécanismes qui amélioreront la très nécessaire coordination des politiques économiques. Nous présenterons nos vues sur la maîtrise de la mondialisation et nos réflexions sur l’avenir de la défense de l’Europe et l’avenir des finances de l’Union européenne. En matière de défense, il est évident que les États européens devront augmenter leur budget militaire, mais la stabilité planétaire n’est pas seulement fonction de l’ampleur des budget militaires. La stabilité internationale, mondiale, planétaire est aussi fonction de la dimension des budget d’aide au développement et du financement de la lutte contre le changement climatique. Réduire les budgets de l’aide au développement, remettre en cause les engagements qui furent les nôtres et ceux des autres en matière de changement climatique - je parle de la COP 21 - nuira gravement à la stabilité intégrale. L’Union européenne doit porter et continuer à porter ces messages. La stabilité, ce n’est pas seulement l’affaire des armées, c’est also l’affaire de ceux qui veulent aider ceux qui sont en retard à rejoindre ceux qui sont en avance. La stabilité, ce sont les dépenses militaires, mais pas exclusivement; c’est also l’aide au développement et la lutte contre le changement climatique. Mesdames et Messieurs, vous vous êtes déjà penchés sur toutes ces questions et nous nous réjouissons à l’idée de continuer à travailler avec vous et notamment avec les rapporteurs qui ont vu leurs rapports adoptés récemment. Je prends rendez-vous avec vous en septembre, lors du discours sur l’état de l’Union, où je développerai davantage ces idées, pas avant, mais après avoir écouté les uns et les autres. J’aimerais que le Conseil européen donne en décembre ses orientations pour un processus qui atteindra son apogée lors des élections européennes en 2019. In 2019, nous avons rendez-vous avec le suffrage universel européen. Ce sera d’abord un rendez-vous d’explications. Explications entre les forces politiques, c’est-à-dire entre les familles politiques, qui devront dire comment elles voient l’Europe de 2025 et au-delà. Je voudrais que le processus démocratique engagé en 2014 connaisse son prolongement, c'est-à-dire qu'en 2019, les partis européens présentent au choix de l'électeur des têtes de liste, exigence qu'il faudra que nous respections pour que la démocratie européenne fonctionne et reste crédible. En 2019, nous ne pourrons pas renoncer à l’acquis que nous avons réalisé en 2014, ensemble. Je salue d’ailleurs amicalement les candidats qui n’ont pas eu la chance que j’ai pu avoir. (Jean-Claude Juncker replied to M. Verhofstadt qui disait hors micro: “La prochaine fois”.) Les citoyens européens doivent pouvoir décider qui sera le prochain président de la Commission européenne. Les citoyens doivent pouvoir faire leur choix, pas les officines gouvernementales. Je ne serai pas candidat à un deuxième mandat, comme je l’ai dit dès le premier jour. (Applaudissements venant de la droite de l’hémicycle.) (En réaction à ces applaudissements) J’avais pour intention de ne jamais décevoir l’extrême-droite, j’ai réussi. Je ne serai pas candidat à un deuxième mandat, mais, croyez-moi, je ne suis ni fatigué ni à court d’idées, au contraire, et vous allez le voir. Monsieur le Président, l'Europe s'est relevée des cendres de la Seconde guerre mondiale pour réaliser l'impossible: mettre fin à cette éternelle tragédie européenne qui, en fait, nous obligeait - les peuples, leurs dirigeants - à choisir entre la guerre et la paix. Dans le monde d’aujourd’hui, plus de quarante guerres et conflits militaires font rage, mais pas un seul ne se déroule sur le sol européen proprement dit. Vu de plus loin et à partir d'autres continents, l'Europe continue à rester une chose magnifique: avoir réuni tout un continent, avoir mis un terme à ce funeste décret d'après-guerre qui voulait que l'Europe, à tout jamais, soit scindée en deux blocs, y avoir créé un espace de stabilité, de prospérité et d'égalité nous vaut l'admiration du monde entier. Très souvent, j’ai l’impression que les autres nous admirent et que nous-mêmes, il nous arrive de nous détester. Mais cette Europe, celle que je décris, n’est pas un acquis, ni une évidence. L’Europe a toujours été et reste aujourd’hui et pour toujours un choix délibéré, qu’il faut défendre contre vents et marées, contre l’assaut de ceux qui ne veulent pas comprendre le cours de l’histoire. Les choix que nous faisons maintenant, aujourd’hui, demain, dans deux ans et d’ici 2025 doivent tenir compte de leurs implications, non seulement pour nous, mais surtout pour les générations à venir. Parce que nous serons jugés, non pas sur ce qui nous a été légué, mais sur ce que nous laisserons en héritage. Nos citoyens nous disent souvent que nous devons faire les choses différemment. Oui, nous y sommes prêts, mais il ne faut pas vouloir tout changer. Nous devrions essayer de mieux comprendre les contraintes et les chances d’une application correcte du principe de subsidiarité, qui ne doit pas devenir un ersatz pour la solidarité, laquelle doit, elle, rester le principe directeur de toutes nos actions européennes et nationales. Très souvent, en écoutant ceux qui se font l’avocat du principe de subsidiarité, j’ai l’impression que, comme ils ne veulent pas parler de solidarité, ils préfèrent parler de subsidiarité. Il s’agit de bien comprendre la signification exacte du concept de subsidiarité. Monsieur le Président, nous n’avons pas le droit d’être - comment dire - patriotes contre les autres. Le patriotisme du XXIe siècle se décline en deux dimensions: un patriotisme heureux, accepté et acceptable vers l’intérieur, et la solidarité, qui est le prolongement du patriotisme heureux vers l’extérieur. Il ya des valeurs qui doivent continuer de nous unir: la paix, la démocratie, la solidarité, l'état de droit - qui doit être la règle qui sous-tend notre vivre-ensemble très souvent menacé -, la dignité et l'égalité de tous les êtres humains, ainsi que la liberté de la presse. Regardez ce qui se passe en Turquie où l’on emprisonne, sans raison aucune, of the journalist allemands parce qu’ils ont osé dire ce qu’il fallait dire! Les valeurs, oui, ce qui inclut le refus du rejet de l’autre, de celui qui est différent de nous, mais qui n’est pas moins noble que nous-mêmes. Nous ne pouvons pas accepter que les voix de ceux qui défendent ces valeurs, dont je voudrais qu’elles soient universelles, soient noyées dans le vacarme des slogans nationalistes qui font du patriotisme une poor contre les autres. Le patriotisme n’est plus un patriotisme lorsqu’il se dirige contre les autres. L’Europe, elle, doit rester une force mondiale positive. Nos sociétés européennes sont bâties sur l’ouverture et nous devrions en être plus fiers. D’autres préfèrent se refermer sur eux-mêmes et tourner leur regard vers l’intérieur. Le nombrilisme fait des progrès angoissants à travers la planète. Mais une telle attitude n’est ni dans notre nature, ni d’ailleurs dans notre intérêt. La démocratie - la démocratie entière - est un produit européen et nous la défendrons partout et de toutes nos forces. Alors, ayons le courage, la patience et la détermination qui sont nécessaires aux longs trajets et aux grandes ambitions. L’Europe continues à être une grande ambition. Une ambition qui a derrière elle et devant elle un long trajet. Nous avons aujourd’hui le choix entre plusieurs chemins, certains plus pernicieux que d’autres, d’autres plus porteurs d’avenir que d’autres. Monsieur le Président, quel que soit le choix que nous ferons, la destinée de l’Europe à Vingt-sept est entre nos mains. Entre nos mains, oui, mais elle est d’abord et avant tout une affaire de cœur et une affaire de valeurs, de valeurs qui donnent sa véritable dimension à la raison d’État européenne. Je ne suis pas en train de citer un poème européen, je décris une nécessité continentale.

The anniversary of the Treaties of Rome will be something other than a celebration: it will be a farewell to the United Kingdom and it will be the birth of the Union with 27 Member States. We have done many things wrong before arriving at this point. Brexit is not the cause. Brexit is the last consequence and we must be sure it remains the last consequence. If Brexit is a divorce, the anniversary of the Treaties of Rome should be a time to renew the commitments between us and the Union. We are all facing serious challenges: globalisation, terrorism, migration and the refugee crisis, climate change and so on. The question is simple: how do we want to deal with those challenges? How do we move forward? But also, do we want to move forward? This is a legitimate question too because I know that I want to move forward, but we cannot simply blame those who do not want to go further than we are now, by calling them anti—European. We are all Europeans. Europe belongs to all Europeans, no matter whether they come from the north, the south, the east or the west. Europe belongs to all of us. That is why I thank the Commission for having presented five different scenarios, even knowing that none of them will be fully accepted. For my Group, for example, a sixth scenario could also be possible: merging the other five because they are not mutually exclusive. I agree with President Juncker that the time has come to align expectation with reality. It is time to say what you can do, and not promise what you cannot do. It is time to defend Europe because it is the best bastion against nationalism and populism. What Member States must do is to stop blaming Europe for what Europe cannot do because it does not have the tools. This is a wrong and dangerous game and Brexit is one of the consequences. Whatever road we take, we must take it in unity and with consensus because these two words have given us 60 years of peace. We may have forgotten where we come from. We come from war, death, poverty and hunger. We come from lack of freedom. We may have forgotten why unity is so important. We may have forgotten to explain that there is no alternative to the Union – not in the past, not now, and not in the future. The Union was – and will be – the best instrument for peace. So, when a country as important as the United Kingdom leaves us, we have to ask ourselves the question: are they leaving us because peace is already consolidated or because peace is no longer important? I cannot understand it. To conclude, this debate is necessary: a debate about the future that we want for ourselves and for our children. This debate starts today, right here, right now, in the European Parliament. This Parliament must be fully involved from now on. Every single Member, every single Committee and every single body of this House must be involved. Europeans must be the owners of their own future, and this Parliament is the way forward for them. This debate means that the Council, the Commission and the Parliament have realised one thing: that the Union is built from its citizens and not from the institutions. As Manfred Weber said today, it is now or never. Well done, Mr Juncker.

But the White Paper the Commission is now presenting has disappointed us now that Europe is faced with unprecedented challenges: a protectionist US President, Russia and China on the rise, and the bloody war on our doorstep from which millions of people are running for their lives; now that populists show their ugly face in every corner of Europe; now that hardworking families all over Europe are struggling to make ends meet and are worried about their children’s future; now that our common European House, which has sheltered us for decades, has to weather the toughest storm ever. Now you are presenting us with a reflection paper and scenarios instead of a clear plan to fortify our House to weather this storm. You are right, President Juncker, in showing all the political difficulties, because the difficulties are real; but it is necessary, it is essential, to indicate one political priority, one political option, because the European Commission is not a bureaucratic body but a political body, and you know very well that we support you for this reason. I can only see one option, the fifth option, because it is the only viable option: to work together as Europeans and to do much more together, because together we are stronger.  There is so much left to do. Our House needs a strong Social Pillar to protect our citizens. And it needs European fiscal capacity. We must complete the European monetary union and build a sustainable Europe capable of fighting climate change and creating jobs and growth. We must combat tax fraud, and the project of a common European army is now more important than ever. We have to defend our inclusiveness without leaving aside the eastern countries. We can only achieve this if we stay united as Europeans. President Juncker, I call on you and on your Commission to take on your responsibility. You are the guardians of the Treaties, the guardians of the common European good and our common European future at this time. We ask you to show leadership and urge the Council to take on their historic duty.  In a couple of weeks, we will celebrate the anniversary of the Rome Treaties. Only some years after a terrible world war in Europe, political leaders had the courage to commit to European unity and explained to their citizens why we Europeans are stronger together. After decades in which Europe has brought us peace and prosperity, is it really too much to ask of this generation of leaders to commit to Europe and make it stronger for the future? Let us not give up. Let us show political leadership in the fight together for a Europe that is better and stronger, so that our children and their children will have a good future.

The EU and the euro area face challenges that they cannot master. Particularly noteworthy are the repercussions of the common currency, the euro, which has inflicted epochal damage on Europe's citizens. The crisis continues to swell and the previous policy - namely to buy time - does not work. Yes, the EU made peace, but now only peace is conjured up in connection with the EU. Let us remember: one day the EU and especially the euro zone should also ensure prosperity and growth - these hopes have failed. This is not an industrial accident, but the result of centralism and megalomania. The failed concepts of social and economic centralization belong in the moth box. Unfortunately, such ideas can still be found in your paper, Mr Juncker. For example in scenario 5, where politics is to be moved into the innovation cluster modeled on Silicon Valley. Mr. Juncker, you are already a little way on the right track to say goodbye to outdated ideas. You have to go a little further. Innovation and change work by themselves if politics creates good framework conditions. If states want industrial policy, then they should do so at their own risk and expense. Your scenario 2 of restricting the EU to the common market is therefore not unreasonable! The peace effect of economic integration would thus be preserved. But I admit that there are other concerns for the EU to play a functional role - for example counter-terrorism and border protection. Your concept 4 is under the heading “do less and do it more efficiently”! This idea is fundamental, the EU towards some areas restrict, well and the right approach. At this point we should move on. We can see from the rapid succession and change of the crisis scenarios in recent years that we can hardly tie down policy areas forever. Flexibility is necessary. It must be clear that the cooperation mentioned in Scenario 4 means voluntary participation in individual programs and that the nation states are given the opportunity to withdraw from programs or to insert new cooperations as required. Times are changing and the EU needs institutional rules that allow it to adapt to new challenges. Nobody here in the company can foresee where cooperation will make sense 10 or 20 years from now, and we should - as you rightly mentioned - give future generations this freedom. Mr Juncker, you are perhaps one step further than our colleague Verhofstadt, who has not yet learned his Brexit lesson and would like to continue to impose a centralized feel-good happiness on European citizens. Please communicate that! It is high time this Parliament abandoned wishful thinking. And finally: Your five scenarios suggest a certain flexibility. What a shame, Mr Juncker, that you did not express this flexibility to David Cameron in this way, because then the British would certainly still be a member of this European Union.

I thought it was more or less an internal catfight within the Conservative Party that was the reason for Brexit. It is crazy how some people then blame this House here and say that it is the cause. But that said, I welcome the contribution from the Commission and I certainly welcome your introduction, Mr Juncker, because you made mention of the founding fathers: Altiero Spinelli, and I could add Paul-Henri Spaak, I could add Heinrich von Brentano, founding father of the German Grundgesetz, and I could add Jean Monnet and Robert Schuman. I could even add Winston Churchill, because from 1946 to 1951 – a part that was forgotten by Mr Boris Johnson in this biography of Winston Churchill – he was the leader of European integration and of the future European Union. That said, it is important to recognise one thing here, which is that, before we go to Rome for the festivities, what we want today is something different from the Treaty of Rome, because the Treaty of Rome was a customs union. It was maybe the right answer in 1957 but, let us be honest, it is not the answer to the challenges we are facing today. I think it is very important to talk about the founding fathers because they had more ambition than just the Treaty of Rome. The Treaty of Rome was a fall-back option, a fall-back solution, because they were not able – because of the ‘no’ vote in the French National Assembly – to make a defence union, to make a political union, and to make an economic union. It is wise to remember what they wanted after the Second World War, which was to create a Union that was capable and decisive. But what is our problem today? You will find it in your five scenarios. You have given us five scenarios but what I remember from your introduction is that we can forget the first three. Let us talk about scenarios four and five, and I think that is the right decision to make, but, let us be honest: what is lacking in the European Union of today? Why are we not capable of stabilising our neighbourhood? It is because we do not have the capabilities to do so. Why are we not capable of finding a solution to the migration crisis and the refugee crisis? Because we have no capabilities to do so at European level. Why are we not capable of cleaning up our banks, eight years after Lehman brothers? Eight years after, we are still facing problems with an unrealised banking union, with no recovery fund and so on. Why? Because we have no European capacities and capabilities. And finally, why do we not have big European internet companies? If we talk about Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Samsung, they are all American or Asian. And why? Because we do not have a completed digital market in the European Union: no European capacities, for example for a European telecom authority or a digital authority, as you propose in your fourth scenario. That is the lesson. We are still a loose confederation of nation states based on the unanimity rule, and if there is one country blocking – and you know this better than I do, Mr Juncker, having been a Member for a long time of the European Council – if only one member says ‘no’, then we apply the unanimity rule and we do not go forward. Too little, too late – that is the consequence of the absence of the European capacities and European capabilities that we desperately need.  So we do not need to start asking whether it is four, five, or three, because we are already familiar with the different circles in the European Union. We have 50 exceptions in the European budget. There are 50 different circles in the European Union. The question now is how can we overcome that? How, for one, do we convince European leaders at national level to make the jump forward that we desperately need? That is the question, and therefore our proposal from Parliament, in our papers and in the reports that have been discussed and approved two weeks ago, is to start an interinstitutional reflection. We alone cannot decide this. You alone, Mr Juncker, cannot decide from your side in the Commission. Even the Council cannot do that – and maybe they do not have the inspiration to do it. So our plea, Mr President of the Commission, is that you back our proposal for an interinstitutional reflection from day one, from now on, so that we are not only talking about Brexit here in this House, but we also open an offensive – a positive, optimistic reform of the Union in parallel with Brexit. And it is not only a negative story of one country leaving us, but also a story of 27 who know that their destiny in the future will be in unity, together, in the European Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Liberals and centrists"}, {"id": 15, "date": "2017-03-01.json", "name": "Patrick LE HYARIC", "mepid": "96735", "text": "on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group. - Mr President, let us take note of your profession of faith that your Commission, Mr President, does not impose, does not prescribe. If this is true, then you will need to build on what citizens are living and saying - workers, peasants, unemployed, young people - and organize a major European citizens' debate; kinds of states-general for a refoundation of the European Union. The challenges are too great, too worrying not to change course. The challenge is not to simply groom the facade: we have to rethink, we have to redesign ourselves and we will have to take stock of the application of the treaties. As long as the European Union is not the concern of the peoples themselves, as long as it does not take into account their aspirations to live better, as long as it is not a project for justice, equality, solidarity, democracy, human and environmental well-being, it will continue to be rejected. As long as it is seen only as a strangulation system for Greece or a sort of public expenditure police, as long as it is a fortress for migrants, but a paradise for the free movement of capital, it will continue to grow. to be rejected. As long as it carpools with business circles and financial funds to the detriment of workers, it will be rejected. That is why, Mr President Juncker, we can imagine another scenario, a scenario that starts with the people themselves, the employees, the creators, the youth. Launch a major European popular public debate preparing a European conference on democratic, social, ecological, feminist overhaul, with a view to building a new European project. Failure to do so will condemn the European idea itself. Besides, between us, start by consulting the people on the free trade project with Canada: this would be an act showing that Europe is an asset for transforming globalization. Replace the concept of generalized competition with that of cooperation, austerity by a new distribution of wealth and a new way of producing it, unemployment and precariousness by professional social security, the current common agricultural policy by a new agricultural policy and food which would take into account employment and health. Imagine a new policy for tomorrow's industry and digital technology, a major cooperation project with the countries of the South. Action can be taken to ensure that the billions of cash provided by the European Central Bank are used for employment projects and new public services. Let’s launch a big plan against tax evasion and a tax and social harmonization project aimed at justice.

You try in your document to answer the question of \"how\". We believe that before answering this question, we should ask ourselves the \"why\", and in particular why an increasing number of our fellow citizens have become defiant, even openly hostile to the very idea of ​​European construction. It is clear that in their eyes, the European Union has lost its legitimacy. There is obviously the question of institutional legitimacy: the Union would be too distant, too opaque; decisions would be taken there too concealed by policies that do not sufficiently assume their responsibilities. If this were the diagnosis, one would expect ambitious proposals in terms of transparency and democratic control, and all of this is necessary. But I think that mistrust has deeper roots, because if it is legitimacy that it is, it is legitimacy by the result. Indeed, what can a large single market and currency, combined with fiscal and social competition, lead to? What can free trade treaties and regulatory standards lead to that set the right to profit as an absolute and superior standard, if not to the enrichment of the owners of capital to the detriment of all others? It is this, I think, which is at the source of the big battalions of our fellow citizens who join the Eurosceptics, even the Europhobes. If the European Union were a vehicle, today it would be less a question of discussing its shape, the number of seats or even the speed of this vehicle than its engine and, above all, its direction. Mr. Juncker, if I may, you suggest that we stand still, reverse, move before together or in differentiated groups, but always in one direction, as if the idea of ​​a change of course was just unthinkable. You had the courage, Mr Juncker, to give us the correct diagnosis when we were faced with the challenge of asylum and immigration. You told us - and you were right - that, if we want to keep this area of ​​free movement that we value so much - and we do want it - we cannot fail to have a common asylum and immigration policy and common management of our borders. You had this courage. Strangely enough, in the face of exploding inequalities and a rocking single currency - and that's saying something - you don't have the courage to tell the historical truth. There is no - I mean no - monetary union in the history of mankind that has held without fiscal union, without social union, and therefore without political and democratic union. It is this contradiction that we must resolve today if we are to maintain the single market and the single currency, and we do so. If we want to win back, Mr President, the hearts and minds of our fellow citizens, we believe it is urgent to reconnect European construction to what was its initial ambition, that is to say to ensure peace. on this continent - and this remains relevant today - by the extension of democracy and by shared prosperity. If we want to reconnect Europe to this objective, we must abandon this idea of ​​fiscal and social competition in order to move towards convergence, in other words put the dignity of all, and not the prosperity of a few, at the heart of the European project.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "Verts/ALE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Greens and regionalists"}, {"id": 17, "date": "2017-03-01.json", "name": "Gerard BATTEN", "mepid": "28497", "text": "  on behalf of the EFDD Group. – Mr President, the White Paper on the future of the European Union follows the usual format that we are used to.

The solution is always the same, namely for the EU to have yet more power in order to solve the problems that it created, and that always means yet more integration – political, fiscal and economic. The Paper acknowledges that the current economic crisis particularly affects the younger generation. It quite rightly wants to ensure that every generation is better off than the previous one. It acknowledges that the effect on the young is particularly felt within the euro area and, in the same paragraph, it goes on to say ‘this highlights the need to complete economic and monetary union’. It defies belief that Mr Juncker, or anybody else, can fail to understand that the European single currency is the single biggest reason for the catastrophic levels of youth unemployment in countries like Portugal, Spain and Greece. The austerity measures designed to keep the euro alive just make things worse.  The Paper does not once mention the British referendum. If Mr Juncker tried to understand the reasons why the British voted to leave, it might help him understand what is needed to reform the European Union.

If we do, I believe we have a future as a European community based on common values. If, on the other hand, one moves in the federal direction towards a European superstate, I am sure that Brexit is only the first in a number of countries that would rather seek their happiness outside the community than inside.

Workers, from their own experience, can conclude that the European Union is a union of capital and that the goals it has been serving all these years are deeply unpopular.

We all agree: Europe has achieved great things. Nobody actually denies that. And that's why it's important. But it is also undisputed that Europe has obviously lost approval in the approval of the people and even of a state. It doesn't help to pray that well, or to swear how great this project is. It also doesn't help to break down what's good from morning to evening and only talk about the bad. And that is why, Mr President of the Commission, I am extremely grateful to you for the type of approach that you have now chosen: at last, not just a proposal from the Commission that says: 'This is how it is done', but a thoughtful paper with alternatives. This gives you the chance to take people and all of us back with you on a future project, to bring people together, to think about what is the advantage of path A, path B, path C or D, just weigh what you want then in the end you want what you can still manage, where the common denominator is. That's what it's about at the moment. And if only another piece of paper is presented and everyone prays down their things that are important to them, we will race in front of the wall again. I find it extremely intelligent and super helpful that this path is chosen. I think that's right, because of course you have to answer a few questions about what Europe can and cannot do - you can't avoid the question. The subject of youth unemployment is constantly being talked about here - and rightly so. And President Juncker has described precisely that precisely this example is suitable for explaining why we hit the wall: Because we are overwhelmed, because we cannot do what we are supposed to do, because we are not responsible are. It is much smarter to say: What are we doing? We do what all states consider feel wise what Europe can do together because one state can no longer do it alone.And everyone at home has to take care of the other things a bit.With that in mind: Mr President Juncker, I am extremely grateful to you that this attempt is being made.Of course, that only makes sense if we all embark on this path now.If everyone downgrades their programs again, it hits the wall.And if at the next piece of advice everyone just tells what they want and what they don't want, it's over.Thank you very much, this is a huge opportunity!", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 29, "date": "2017-03-01.json", "name": "Kathleen VAN BREMPT", "mepid": "5729", "text": "   – Mr President, President Juncker, today in Belgium it is Complimentendag.

Three of the paths or scenarios described would hardly withstand a reality test under the current political framework, while two of them require a closer look: The first scenario, called “Those who want more do more”, outlines a Europe of the willing, which work more closely together in certain policy areas in order to move faster together. A procedure that is already possible today through the instrument of \"permanent structured cooperation\" provided for in the Treaty of Lisbon. In the second scenario, called “Doing less more efficiently”, the European Union focuses its resources on a selected number of “large”, i.e. H. important topics and leaves others to the member states. One of these topics could, for example, be a common foreign and security policy.

None of the presented variants is final. In the future, the European Union should focus on a positive agenda that brings concrete results to citizens and businesses. Examples are the Energy Union and the Digital Single Market. The integration of the common market should also be deepened and the compliance mechanism within the euro area strengthened. Europe also needs to face together the current challenges, such as mass migration, the security risks posed by terrorism and Russia's expansion, and the threat of global trade wars.

I believe that the most important stake is to mobilize citizens, to motivate them to take part in consolidating the new EU, which, for the first time in its history, will see one of its members leave. In order to have a future, the EU must regain the trust of its citizens, the European project must become a generator of adhesion, hope and even love. Of the five scenarios, I believe in the materialization of the sixth: the European Union of its citizens. This is a union of regions and communities. Rebuilt in its regions, the EU will become more efficient and able to enhance local economies. By sincerely valuing all its national, ethnic and linguistic communities, the Europe of Communities will truly place the citizen at the center of its reconstruction.", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 66, "date": "2017-03-01.json", "name": "Mairead McGUINNESS", "mepid": "28115", "text": "  The next item is the debate on the Council and Commission statements on preparation of the European Council meeting of 9 and 10 March 2017 (2016/3019(RSP)).", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 67, "date": "2017-03-01.json", "name": "Mairead McGUINNESS", "mepid": "28115", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Madam President, honourable Members, the 28 Heads of State or Government will be meeting in Brussels next Thursday, 9 March. On Friday, 27 leaders will discuss their own preparations. I know you had intensive discussions last month on the future of Europe, and I am aware of your contributions. Today, however, I will concentrate on what is expected to happen next week. The discussions will focus on citizens’ main concerns, namely growth, external security and migration. Let me take these subjects one by one. The emphasis will be, first and foremost, on economic issues with a number of important subjects featuring under the title Jobs, Growth and Competitiveness. Against the backdrop of the latest forecasts, leaders will have a political discussion on the economic situation in Europe. The outlook overall is positive. The European Council debate will certainly look at how best to use this positive momentum.  The leaders will also touch upon trade. This subject has come to the forefront lately, not least because of recent declarations on the subject by one of our transatlantic partners. It is therefore a good time for Europe to send a clear signal and reaffirm its belief in free and fair trade and the greater good that comes from sharing its benefits. I will take this occasion to thank you for giving your consent to the deal on the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA). It was an important step forward for all of us, and it is crucial for the credibility of the Union. The last element under this economic chapter is the single market. The leaders will look at efforts to deepen the single market in all its dimensions. Together, Parliament and Council have made good headway – most recently concerning the digital single market, with breakthrough agreements on roaming and portability. But a lot remains to be done and, if we are to meet the deadline we have set for ourselves of completing the single market by 2018, there is no time to lose. The second item on the agenda will be external security and defence. This topic was already discussed last December, as leaders are determined that Europe needs to do more for its own security. A new momentum has developed: in March they will want to reinforce that message and ensure that the whole agenda moves forward as quickly as possible. Another topic that leaders are following closely is migration. It was added to the agenda after discussions at the last informal meeting in Malta. The leaders want to review what has been done to implement the decisions taken in February and to keep the pressure high, so that efforts are pooled to tackle the Central Mediterranean route. With the start of spring around the corner, leaders want to avoid any repetition of the tragedies of last year. Of course, in parallel, work continues on all elements of the EU’s comprehensive approach and we will maintain vigilance on other migratory routes. There was also another outcome of the Malta summit. The leaders decided to have a political discussion in March on the Western Balkans. Signs coming from that region in recent months are increasingly worrying. Leaders want to dedicate time to discussing the situation in detail and to send a strong signal of EU commitment to the region. Lastly, the European Council is expected to note the absence of consensus on the European Public Prosecutor’s Office proposal, paving the way for reinforced cooperation on the issue. Thank you very much for your attention. I am looking forward to this debate.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "PPE", "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 68, "date": "2017-03-01.json", "name": "Mairead McGUINNESS", "mepid": "28115", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission. – Madam President, if you will allow, we would like to share this introduction from our side. Commissioner Avramopoulos will go deeper into the migration issue. But first, we had a very interesting discussion just a little while ago about the future of Europe. It was quite a visionary discussion and next week’s Council will not, hopefully, be as visionary because the purpose of next week’s Council meeting is rather to concentrate on short—term delivery, which is very important from the point of view of our citizens. The first priority for the Commission next week will be to see the meeting of the leaders in the European Council take concrete steps forward to deliver on jobs, growth and competitiveness. Unemployment is still too high across Europe, but it is now at its lowest level since 2009. We are moving in the right direction, but risk persists and we are not yet where we want to be. To continue our good progress, the Commission would like to see the European Council give its support next week to the swift extension of the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI). This will allow us to keep investing across Europe in projects which stimulate economic growth and create jobs for Europeans. In one and a half years EFSI has already financed projects worth EUR 30 billion, and this is expected to trigger around EUR 170 billion in additional investments throughout Europe.  The European Council will also talk about trade policy, which is another important policy area from the point of view of job creation. We need more rule—based trade. We hope that the European Council will acknowledge the important vote in Parliament on the approval of our progressive trade agreement with Canada and I take this opportunity to praise you for this important decision. Even those in this House who voted against the Agreement with Mr Trudeau’s Canada were quite impressed by his presence. So let me remind you of his words on this issue: ‘We must choose to lead the international economy, not simply be subject to its whims’. You know by now that this Commission does not believe naively in trade. This is why we want the European Council to give political impetus next week to our efforts to equip the Union with modernised tools to tackle unfair trade. When others step back from rule—based trade, the European Union must step forward and we have others, such as Japan, Mexico, Mercosur and India, willing to do likewise and make sure that the rules of the game are the rules which best serve and protect our citizens and our societies. Rule—based trade is the way to govern globalisation and that is why Europe must move on with this agenda.  I would now like to ask Commissioner Avramopoulos to continue on the other subject.

Even if we make progress in the management of the migratory flows, the situation is still very fragile. We all need to be committed to implementing the agreed – I repeat, the agreed – measures and finding a way forward to complete the structural reforms. The credibility of our actions inside the Union, at our borders and in our migration management, is central to building mutual trust and to enabling us to act in a collective way. Our comprehensive European agenda on migration contains elements of solidarity and responsibility. It demands that we take forward each element in parallel with the others. The success of one reinforces the others. In all areas we must both show solidarity and assume responsibility. Now is the moment to prove what we really mean whenever we make reference to this basic principle upon which Europe is built. And the more effectively we work with third-country partners on tackling the root causes of migration, the greater our capacity to ensure a fair and effective system of asylum and migration management here in the European Union. March 2017 will be a month when many people look to Europe’s past, and many people look to Europe’s future.

In addition, it comes at a crucial and highly symbolic moment since, in this month of March, we are going to celebrate the sixty years of the Treaty of Rome and we should also open the Brexit negotiations, symbol of the crises facing the EU. European Union. Tensions with Russia, terrorism, the war in Syria, the economic crisis, the migration crisis, the new policy of the United States ... The world lives on a volcano which, far from being extinct, can at any time to wake up. In the face of these threats, Europe is a last island of stability which must be preserved. For that, we need to implement a common defense policy, an essential prerequisite for protecting our borders and defending our values ​​in the world. Yet the European Union appears to our fellow citizens less and less as a community, but more and more as a collection of national egoisms. It is high time that the heads of state or government face up to their responsibilities: do we want to continue building Europe or unravel it? This was the subject of the previous debate. In this regard, I congratulate the Maltese Presidency for working hard to push for an ambitious agenda. This is the case, for example, with regard to investments: Mr Vice-President, you spoke of the efforts of the EFSI, the Capital Markets Union, all these investments which should enable us to support the industry and innovation and to create the jobs our citizens demand. I am also pleased that an agreement has been reached on the structural reform support program 2017-2020. This program must now be implemented as quickly as possible because, make no mistake about it, the convergence of our economic, social and fiscal policies is essential for strengthening the euro zone. To this end, it is urgent that fundamental reforms be carried out in many Member States, particularly in France. The euro must be an instrument of European power, but we will not be able to build anything without confidence and without solid economic and social foundations, at the risk of seeing our common home collapse on its foundations. While withdrawal into oneself and protectionism seem to have become the rule since the election of Donald Trump, in particular, Europe must continue to carry, without naivety, a message of openness. Our continent can make the development of trade a formidable economic asset. Europe must be there, the world is watching us. The European Parliament, on behalf of the citizens, must continue to be the driving force to initiate a European leap forward.

I can see that this European Council is trying to put into practice Scenario 5, namely working together to come up with better European solutions.  This is the case with regard to investment and to completing the single market with the digital and the energy union. This is also the case regarding the need to manage migration and to build up a real European asylum system. This is also the case regarding the trade agreement which was completed with Canada and which paves the way for a new generation of trade agreements, if some new concerns are introduced. This is also the case with regard to defence.  So on this European Council agenda you have many critical issues where we need to deliver better European solutions. Nevertheless, let me underline that when it comes to growth, we really want more of it because the current European Semester clearly shows that there is a limit to the growth strategy we are following in Europe. Up to now we been driven by exports. We have nothing against this, but we feel this is the right moment to bet on domestic demand, which means reducing social inequalities. This is the second source of growth in Europe which should be strengthened.  Then, if this is the case, all these outcomes of the European Council should pave the way for a good declaration at the Rome Summit. Let me underline this: we should not just commemorate the 60th anniversary. We need to use the opportunity to pave the way for the future, which means having a declaration that highlights the importance of the European social pillar and of a real reform of the euro area to deliver upward economic and social convergence, as well the need to come up with a European defence strategy and to make Europe a central entity for cooperation at the level of good trade agreements and good strategic partnerships and support for the multilateral system.

As the United Kingdom will undoubtedly be leaving the European Union in the next two years or so, and given the intensity and importance of the economic relationship between the UK and its continental neighbours, it is clearly in the interests of both the EU and the UK that the new strategic partnership, based on amicable and sensible arrangements, is agreed as quickly as possible. We start from a position of regulatory equivalence and mutual recognition of standards – maximum continuity and deep mutual market access will therefore be a great economic reassurance on both sides of the Channel. In terms of internal security, it is clearly in the interests of all our nations that the opportunities for cooperation between our police, security and intelligence agencies is maximised. Many of the problems that have been identified following terrorist attacks in recent years concern the workings of security agencies within States, rather than between them. Bilateral and multilateral cooperation between countries has generally been good, and Europol has often played a useful role in this. The United Kingdom has highly effective and internationally respected security and intelligence capabilities. They have proved their value across Europe and beyond, and it is very much in the interest of the EU in particular, as well as the UK, that arrangements are put in place to ensure that these operational relationships are maintained in the years ahead. On defence, while some transatlanticists here suggested EU defence ambitions are about reinforcing NATO, the reality is different. The ambition is for an autonomous military capability and just at the time when the democracies need to be standing together in solidarity, when that great transatlantic security bond of NATO should be revitalised, the EU is pursuing a separate agenda. This is dangerous. Some have suggested that the new US administration was anti-NATO and this underlined the need for some separate agenda.

As far as the question of security is concerned, let us be honest. What has the European Union achieved in diplomatic terms in recent months and years? How strong and heavyweight a player have we been? I must say that it is not too optimistic and it is a matter of fact that you can hardly be a heavyweight diplomatic force without having defence and military capacity. That is the reality. That is also why we are not present in a number of important negotiations on critical conflict issues, which have had an impact on us, but which we have certain limits in influencing. So in this respect I do not agree with the previous speaker. It is a question of our credibility and I believe that a European defence is necessary to assert true security with goals, means and a strategy. It is crucial that together we pool our political will and capabilities. On the second issue, economics and especially on trade, I agree with Vice—President Katainen that CETA has to be ratified. I also believe that we need necessary and finely-tuned defence mechanisms. But what I believe even more is that we, as a heavyweight in economic terms well beyond our demography, should use that. It is not just a question of negotiating with Japan and other countries at a time when we are at, shall we say, a standstill with the US. Why do we not have our own agenda that we impose on the Americans? Our negotiating position is already influenced by that. There will of course be limits to it and we will have to see. Finally, on migration, this is not the end of it. The migration problem will still be with us for many years to come. I believe that we need a true migration policy that will provide all the incentives and the tools that we need, but at the same time will take into account our own interests and also the specifics of the individual Member States. So I expect that the European Council will deliver on this. To be honest, what the Presidency has told us today is not convincing.

For us, a sixth is missing, a rupture with this process of neoliberal integration, a rupture that opens the door to the construction of another Europe, at the service of populations and workers, a Europe of cooperation, without CETA, where all peoples be respected in their sovereignty and in their right to decide on their own development model.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 76, "date": "2017-03-01.json", "name": "Ernest URTASUN", "mepid": "124972", "text": "on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group. - Madam President, I think we are aware of the very difficult year that the integration project is going to go through, in an already deep crisis, and I have to say that the impression is of a worrying paralysis of the institutions.

This White Paper seems to confirm, in some way, what Mr Juncker already hinted at in the last State of the Union debate: that the Commission is increasingly a secretariat of the Council and has less and less political role, which It is very worrying. Look, we need a clear direction and it is clear that, at the moment, we have a very clear block in the Council of certain directions that we need to take. But we do expect the Commission to give some clear directions: reform of the eurozone, social pillar, democratization.

The President of the Commission, Mr Juncker, has rightly urged that we should stop Brussels-bashing; in exactly the same way we should stop Member State-bashing. We should be clear. A Europe based on mutual respect, on parity of esteem, is the Europe that works. It follows that the European political system has three components: Brussels, the citizens, and the Member States.

After all, from the words of the Commission President that means nothing other than that the European Union has so far been bogged down. She's done way too much, she's done unimportant things, and she hasn't done important things well.

Beyond the EFSI, I believe that for the European Union, what we also need today is an investment that is maintained in the service of social investment and ecological transition in which the European Union must commit to. In addition, for the first time, this European Council will have to adopt a specific recommendation for the euro zone.

We need a serious integration of security and defense policy. The Union's inability to provide security for its citizens can permanently distance them from common ground and focus exclusively on national solutions. I welcome the Council's debate on escalating tensions in the Western Balkans. The stability of this region depends on the outcome of the confrontation of two processes: the progress of countries on the path to joining the European Union and the processes that threaten this due to interests contrary to the values ​​of European integration.

By securing the future of children, Europe is securing its own future and not only that. Children in migration need to be protected, assisted and offered durable solutions at all stages of migration. We have to ensure that they are not exploited, abused or trafficked. This challenge is becoming even more pressing given that, in 2016, children represented 26% of the arrivals by sea. This is an almost tenfold increase since 2010. Many of them are unaccompanied minors. Moreover, shortly after their arrival in Europe, an increasing number of minors abscond or disappear. In spite of the efforts taken at European and national level, the situation of minors remains unsatisfactory and protection gaps must still be filled. Ensuring adequate assistance, in terms both of material supply, adequate reception and care and of legal information and psycho-social support, is key to building trust and avoiding absconding. The Commission is working on concrete and comprehensive actions to ensure the protection of children in migration. The European Agenda on Migration and the Action Plan on Unaccompanied Minors constitute our starting point. The Commission will also follow up on the conclusions of the 10th European Forum on the Rights of the Child, organised in November 2016, and on the outcome of the recent ‘Lost in Migration’ conference organised by Missing Children Europe in Malta in January. In Greece, the Commission is actively supporting the appointment of a child protection officer in each hotspot. Here, the availability of sufficient dedicated reception facilities remains a challenge both on the islands and on the mainland. Over 1 000 unaccompanied children are still awaiting a shelter placement. EU funding is available under the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund to support capacity building, provide relevant infrastructure and develop operational actions in frontline Member States. Additional funding is also available under the Rights, Equality and Citizenship Programme to improve child protection in migration. In 2017, priorities on combating violence against children and women explicitly include children in migration. Funding under the Emergency Support Instrument has also been made available for child protection activities. The European Asylum Support Office (EASO), the European Border and Coast Guard and Europol are also supporting frontline Member States in identifying unaccompanied minors and providing information on relocation. They offer capacity-building activities and collaborate with public security departments for investigations on smuggling and trafficking. Ensuring legal means of transfer is another key aspect to prevent minors absconding and falling into smugglers’ traps. The Dublin system, including transfers and family reunification, and the relocation schemes must work efficiently and fast. All those involved need to collaborate better to implement these procedures smoothly. For the moment, only 205 unaccompanied minors have been relocated from Greece and Italy and, as we all understand, this is unsatisfactory. However, the Commission is working closely with Member States in this respect. It has deployed dedicated teams in frontline Member States to address this matter. Moreover, last year’s proposals to reform the Common European Asylum System aim at strengthening the guarantees available for vulnerable persons, including children. The proposals include provisions on safe accommodation in suitable reception facilities, and prompt and effective guardianship for unaccompanied minors who apply for asylum. In the absence of travel documents, fingerprinting is one of the very few options for identifying a person. For this reason, last year’s reform proposals also aim to lower the minimum age for fingerprinting from 14 to six years old, with a view to reducing the risk of minors going missing. Swift progress on all asylum proposals is now needed in the European Parliament and the Council. If children go missing, they have to be found, and they have to be found fast. Existing instruments to report and record child disappearances must be fully used. The Schengen Information System (SIS) constitutes the only Europe-wide information exchange on missing persons in general. For this system to be useful, missing children must be reported to the police and other relevant responsible authorities. They, in turn, should immediately record the disappearance in the Schengen Information System, attaching photographs and fingerprints and indicating that the child is unaccompanied. Currently the information system stores information on about 100 000 missing persons in 29 European countries, out of which about 65 000 are children. In 2016, 5 687 persons were found on the basis of SIS. In addition, the Commission has recently proposed to improve the information system. For instance, we suggest having a new type of preventive alert for missing unaccompanied children, to be issued in cases when a child is particularly at risk. Better use must also be made of the existing ‘Missing Children’ hotline (116 000). For instance, all reception centre managers should report all cases of children going missing via this hotline. As you can see, many actions are ongoing to protect children better in migration, and the European Union will step up its efforts. The migration crisis has been exploited by ruthless criminal networks, involved in trafficking in human beings, to target the most vulnerable, in particular women and children. It is our duty to protect children. We need to focus on prevention, the quality of care and protection. We must reinforce our fight against the criminals, mobilise and inform public opinion and put pressure on Member States to use all tools available to protect children in migration. Let us live up to the challenge and address it by using all resources in a united and coordinated manner.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "ECR", "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 109, "date": "2017-03-01.json", "name": "Anna Maria CORAZZA BILDT", "mepid": "96674", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his commitment. A real tragedy is unfolding in Europe, which needs urgent and concrete action. More than a year ago, Europol sounded the alarm when tens of thousands of migrant children went missing. They had been trafficked, abused, exploited and exposed. It is happening today in Europe. We are far away from a zero tolerance policy against traffickers and smugglers. With the Intergroup on Children’s Rights in this Parliament, together with Missing Children Europe, we have been at the forefront in putting this emergency at the top of the EU agenda. We call on the police to prioritise missing children, without double standards between European and migrant children. We need effective rules for cross-border cooperation and increased cooperation with Europol, filling the existing gaps. We need to allocate more resources to hotlines, to help report disappearances and build trust with migrant children to prevent them from running away, to make sure children remain in the protection system and to provide them with a safe environment and decent living standards. Children must be registered when entering the European Union and I support the Commissioner’s reform proposal for EURODAC, moving to take fingerprints from the age of six, to be able to protect them and to trace them.

One hundred unaccompanied minor asylum seekers are in wooden shacks, without care, without education and without seeing anyone to submit an asylum application. That's the Europe of 2017! We must not tolerate that. I am officially asking you for a real action plan with good reception and short procedures. In doing so, a real effort must be made to combat human smugglers and to ensure the exchange of good practices. Where children sit, authorities must take photos so that they do not send an e-mail if a child is missing after 8 or 9 days. You know, Commissioner, if my dog ​​does not come home tonight, I will search harder for my dog ​​than Europe is looking for the 10 000 missing children. Come up with that action plan. I am happy to bring you the recommendations of the conference in Malta. I was there myself and I want to hand them over to you personally.

As the Commissioner said, the offers are pretty poor at the moment and even those offers made are not always taken up. So I think we need to think seriously about how we improve that. But we do need, as others have said, a system that works in reality. It is no surprise that kids will believe smugglers’ promises to reunite them with family when we see the reality of what many of those minors currently face and the lack of information they get. We only have to look at the scandal of Calais in terms of child protection: children identified there by civil society organisations, not the authorities, a Supreme Court judgment to remind the British Government of their obligations, a totally inadequate system of cooperation and transfer between France and the UK, and still poor delivery even now. The French are closing the centres that they took unaccompanied minors to and the British Government thinks it has done its job, although there are still at least 1 000 who have, potentially, the legal right to be there under Dublin.

As was said at the \"Lost in migration\" conference held in Malta, in order to protect minors on European territory, we must ensure that they can apply for asylum in the State where, possibly, a person with family ties. And if, in order to protect minors, the proposal included in the Eurodac system to introduce biometric data for minors is appreciable, even from the age of six, it is however necessary that this happens in the presence of adequate guarantees, with specialized personnel and with all the necessary precautions to avoid trauma to children.

A few of you, I believe, did not hear my introductory remarks, but most of you were here, and I believe that the common conclusion is that we share the same concerns and objectives. I can assure you that the Commission is working on concrete and comprehensive actions to protect children in migration and offer them a future.  Tomorrow the Commission will adopt a package of reports that show that all actions are interlinked. Relocation – and this was underlined by some of you earlier – is the key solidarity measures also for migrant children, and I agree with you that that this situation is unsatisfactory. All migrants eligible in Greece and in Italy should be relocated before September. It is a deadline for all Member States, and I believe that all of them will take up their responsibilities and will move swiftly to the implementation of this relocation scheme. Relocation of unaccompanied minors should increase as a matter of absolute priority for us and for all of us. I said at the beginning that detention is a tool of last resort that should not be excluded per se, but only used in cases where it is in the best interest of the child.  Let me stress that the European legislation requires Member States to place minor migrants only in specialised detention centres that are adapted for migrants so that they have access to leisure activities. Sometimes, as I said before, this is for their own protection because let us be clear: the reality out there on the ground is not ideal. We have to prevent minors falling into the hands of unscrupulous smugglers and traffickers that wait outside open detention centres, so closed centres can be appropriate in some cases.  Some of you, like me, have been visiting these places. Children are the easiest victims of smugglers and traffickers. Colleagues, our primary, common goal is to protect children and I would like also to call on NGOs with expertise to support the authorities of Member States under pressure even more. The protection of children of course needs to be regulated, but it is the responsibility of our societies, of all of us as a whole, and the Commission has taken the lead on that but, as was said very correctly before, Member States should take their share and I fully agree with the proposal to sensitise and mobilise your colleagues in the national parliaments. We have to address this issue together, united, and I do not think there is one person among you, or among the Members of the Commission or among your colleagues in the national parliaments, that does not share our determination, our commitment, to safeguard and support this vulnerable group of the migrants that have decided to cross rough seas, fire, dictatorships, difficulties and dangers in order to come to Europe.

They seem to benefit from information on the special conditions of children who come to the EU as migrants. Due to the fact that they do not have any personal documents and the age cannot be determined really reliably, many of these migrants are classified as minors on the basis of their own declaration. In the famous \"jungle\" near the town of Calais, they were nominally adults and nominally minors. Adults were relocated to various refugee facilities throughout France, while \"minors\" eventually arrived in England. I'm not sure if a similar policy is right, but I understand that younger migrants are more likely to influence their attitudes through education. Nevertheless, I cannot defend the belief that the country of origin should take care of its citizens, and not the country of their choice and \"probably recommended by someone\".

Equality between men and women is a fundamental principle of the European Union. It is enshrined both in our Treaties and in Article 23 of the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights.  In 1975, the Treaty of Rome was successfully invoked to defend the rights of an air hostess who worked for the Belgian national airline, Sabena. She felt it was unfair that she was paid less just because she was a woman. She demanded equal treatment and won her case in the European Court of Justice. That groundbreaking European Court ruling more than 40 years ago opened the way for the first European directives on gender equality. Mainstreaming this principle in all our activities represents an important mission for the Union. Promoting equal economic independence for women and men, including by closing the income gap, is a crucial element necessary to ensure de facto gender equality. However, as we all know, equality on paper does not always translate into factual equality. The principle of equal pay for work of equal value has long been enshrined in European law. Nonetheless, women in Europe continue to earn, on average, around 16% less than men. In some Member States, the gender pay gap is over 20% and when it comes to pensions the situation is even bleaker, with a gap of 38.5% on average across the European Union.  The causes of the gender pay gap are many. However, an important underlying problem is that society seems to value women’s work, paid or unpaid, less than the work of men. Firstly, the sectors employing a majority of women are also those sectors where pay tends to be the lowest. These include care work, cleaning services, casual work and so on. Secondly, women tend to be employed in more junior positions compared to men, a phenomenon we call the glass ceiling. Thirdly, women often have less continuity in their careers, as compared to men. This is because they so often give up their jobs or reduce their working hours in order to work at home. Finally, there is the crucial issue of lack of transparency in pay. It is hard to fight unfairness when unfairness is hidden. These challenges are common in all Member States, however their extent, dimension and context all differ from one Member State to another. This is why the actions that need to be taken in order to address this complex issue of the gender pay gap vary accordingly. Gender equality policies are essential instruments in economic terms. They also lead to greater prosperity, competitiveness and employment. They increase inclusiveness and social cohesion.  Honourable Members, what measures should be taken to close the gender pay gap? Greater pay transparency can help the underpaid fight for their rights. Jobs should be classified mutually and fairly. Also, we must focus on the quality of jobs: while flexibility is important, it should not be forcibly imposed on workers, for example, in the form of precariousness or involve involuntary part-time work. Moreover, more women are needed in company boardrooms and in other decision-making groups. Finally, we must ensure that both sexes can benefit from the opportunities offered by the digital economy, the green revolution, robotics and by the many other transformative developments in the labour market. To achieve this, we should start with education, as gender stereotyping starts very early in our lives. We should encourage more girls to study science, engineering, technology and maths. The IT sector, of course, is another area where women are under-represented and where their talents are needed.  We also need to take a closer look at the concept of a correct work-life balance. This can be addressed through a variety of measures, which include better access to childcare and child services for dependents, as well as flexible work arrangements or leave provisions. This is true also for men. In this context, the Council looks forward to the forthcoming initiative from the Commission on improving the work-life balance.  I would like to thank the European Parliament for its continuous commitment to maintaining the issue of the gender pay gap on the European agenda. I believe this is an issue on which our two institutions have much common ground. The Council has, in particular in the last two years, worked on the gender pay and pensions and on women in poverty. On Friday, the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council will discuss measures to enhance the skills of women and men in the labour market. In this context, ministers will also consider further measures aimed at addressing the gender pay gap. Moreover, in the context of the European semester, the Council will adapt recommendations to improve women’s labour market outcomes and to reduce the gender pay gap. To summarise, we must continue to work together. Only by turning words into actions will we succeed. Thank you very much for your attention.

The Treaty of Rome, whose 60th anniversary we will remember in a few days, already included a provision on equal pay, opening the way for a broader gender equality policy in Europe later on. Over the last 60 years, women have reaped the benefits of education and massively entered into the labour market. Sixty per cent of new graduates today are women. Yet, after undeniable encouraging developments, the gender pay gap seems to have stabilised at 17% in the EU. Compared to men, women are also less likely to be in paid employment, to sign permanent and stable work contracts, and they tend to work fewer hours. The glass ceiling still exists: although women have made inroads into economic decision-making positions, less than 5% of company leaders in the EU are women. So it is clear that to finally erase the gender pay gap, we have to do much more. We know the gender pay gap has various root causes and my aim is to have a set of different measures to effectively tackle these roots. In other words, each of those sources of pay gap requires different solutions. In 2014 we adopted a Recommendation on strengthening the principle of equal pay between men and women through transparency. We proposed a package of measures which could be adopted by Member States to effectively fight the direct discrimination in pay for work of equal value, and we work with the Member States to assess how these measures were implemented and how it works in practice. Ladies and gentlemen, I can only share with you that our assessment is that transparency is very important but it does not do magic. Discrimination, which means different pay for the same work, is already prohibited by EU law, so we are pushing for better enforcement of the legislation in force. But discrimination is unfortunately not the only cause of the gender pay gap. We witness the horizontal segregation of the labour market. Women tend to be grouped in sectoral jobs which are under-paid and valued less, such as the social care sector, for instance. It is our intention to support both women and men to go for the less and non-traditional jobs. A good example is the digital sector, already mentioned here by the Presidency, where there are only 30% of women, and we know it is the sector of the future. We pay for projects to get more girls and women into this sector. And, yes, education is the way to solve this problem as well. There is also an issue of part-time jobs. It is clear that during some period of time people might need to use the working arrangement to better reconcile work and private duties. However, it should not be a rule that only women are going for part-time jobs, and there needs to be a guarantee for employees who choose the temporary arrangement to resume full-time work. It is one of the provisions we intend to promote in the package of measures to improve conditions for working parents and carers, the so called ‘work-life balance package’, which is a joint initiative with Commissioner Thyssen. The Commission should adopt this package of legislative and non-legislative measures on 21 April. One of the big challenges is the unequal sharing of care responsibilities between women and men. Among the working population, women spend on average 21 hours a week on caring and household activities compared to nine hours spent by men. It has a lifelong effect on women’s careers, earnings and unfortunately also pensions, where we now have a harmful 40% gap as a reward to women for their lifelong care for their families.  All this shrinks their economic independence. This is not acceptable: all talents must be properly valued and recognised; and a better work-life balance should be sought for both men and women. When providing parents with choice and opportunities, we also aim to eradicate the negative lifelong effect of ‘no-choice available’ on women’s careers, earnings and pensions. I already said in one of the plenary sessions when we discussed the pay gap and work-life balance initiative that it is our duty to remove the barriers for working parents to combine better work and family duties and it will be the free choice of people to use these opportunities. This is the philosophy which you will see in the package on work-life balance which we are preparing. This is, as you know, one of our initiatives for 2017, and this is also an initiative related directly to the European Pillar of Social Rights. The Commission is also undertaking a number of policy and awareness-raising actions to address the gender pay gap. As you know, we initiated the European Equal Pay Day; we encourage the exchange of best practices among Member States and we co-finance Member State initiatives through the Structural Funds and actions by civil society. Talking of Structural Funds, there will be a very rich chapter in the new package on work-life balance to encourage the Member States to use better and more intensively the EU Structural Funds for creating more and better and affordable social care facilities, whether it be crèches, kindergartens or facilities for caring for seniors, because this money should serve people. I cannot imagine many more and better opportunities to use this money for a really good purpose.

Equal pay for equal work must be a matter of course in the 21st century. Unfortunately - and you in particular, Commissioner, have already said it - these income differences still exist, and we are all really challenged to tackle the causes within Europe and thus to really contribute to closing this income gap can. I am of the opinion that this lack of women in some technical professions also makes a significant contribution to this, and we also - and it has already been mentioned - especially in the field of education, must start very strongly here in order to encourage women, especially to work in those professions that are actually very much in demand across Europe. However, women very often take a back seat in their professional lives because they are exposed to multiple burdens with family and children and, very often, also with the care sector. Here, too, I think it is very important to provide different opportunities in the social area and to relieve the women more. Or rather, I would like to point out that very many women choose this life concept for themselves and stay at home as housewives, for example.

The difference in gross hourly wages in Austria is 22.2 percent - that is a third more than in the EU. This means that women in Austria earn an average of more than a fifth less per hour than men. So much for the topic of “equal wages for equal work.” The difference in income extrapolated to annual income is even more serious. Austrian women have an average annual income that is 44.5 percent or more than two fifths lower than that of men. The reasons for this are diverse. We have already heard a few things today: there are fewer women in management and leadership roles, women perform important unpaid tasks such as housekeeping, child rearing and care for the elderly to a much greater extent than men, and therefore often have to take on part-time jobs.

This is essential, because it is intolerable that, for the same job, the pay gap between men and women is around 9%. Futile, because the 9% figure only reflects part of the grim reality. In fact, the net annual pay gap is 25% if part-time work and occupational segregation are taken into account. In March 2015, I already denounced the scandal of these women forced to take part-time work to earn 700 euros per month, which is less than the poverty line.

This is the indicator that we use to monitor and that we use to evaluate both the European Commission and the Member States when it comes to the situation of women. I would like to point out that the wage gap illustrates and diagnoses only a fragment of the wage and economic differences between women and men. The gap we use in our statistics, the wage gap, only reflects the differences in the hourly wages of the wage base in a given sector of the economy. This means that this ratio does not include allowances for internships, functions, positions, overtime and additional projects. It does not take into account measures such as awards, it does not take into account non-wage benefits such as company cars, cell phones, laptops, etc., which are usually associated with high-level positions that very rarely belong to women. So if we wanted to really compare the earnings of women and men within the industry, we should actually compile their annual PITs submitted to the tax offices. Such an overall wage gap would be a better measure of the differences between women and men in the labor market. We know that such a comprehensive gap, because it is measured, amounts to about 38% in the European Union, so similarly to the pension gap, which also seems to include more salary components than the wage gap.

As Marian Harkin said, however, actually making sure this happens is only half of the problem. The reasons behind the gender pay gap are complex. They overlap and there is no one solution to this issue, but there is absolutely no doubt at all in my mind that the gender pay gap is caused by direct discrimination: segregation in the labour market, traditional gender stereotypes and work-life balance issues. When combined, all these serve to reinforce gender inequality on a much broader scale. The impact of the pay gap extends even beyond retirement, as we have heard. The at-risk-of-poverty rate is around 22% for women over 65 – reflecting the inequality of pay. What can we do? It is time that we took real action. We must extend the right to flexible work to all jobs. We must create a more effective policy on shared parental leave, with fathers getting at least three months’ paid leave, and we must provide a mandatory scheme that includes funded training for women over the age of 40 who have done their duty in society, as they see it, to get back to work.

So we need to be smart in introducing a combination of legislative and non-legislative measures in order gradually to change the situation and the conditions. Yes, we heard here from several men – and the one who offended all of us reminded me of a discussion I had last year in New York with an African minister who had very similar opinions, and I realised how happy I am to live in Europe, even though we have all the problems we have discussed here. This is a good address for women, because the vast majority of us agree that there must be full respect for women, and that there is no reason for keeping the pay gap. This is a matter of fairness, but keeping the pay gap and keeping the barriers for women who want to combine better family duties and work is also a matter of alarming economic short-sightedness, because we have very telling figures showing that not enabling women to go to work if they want to combine work with their family duties – with better help from men, of course – is a great waste of talent. I am in frequent contact with IT companies and they desperately need talent, they need innovation, they need fresh thinking, and they are seeking women in this sector. They are also seeking women because women are more in tune with consumer thinking. Women comprise up to 70% of consumers, as measured by the volume of money invested, so there is a demand to have more women better educated for this sector. Speaking also about those economic factors – and we need to speak about them because when we speak about this only as a gender problem it will not fly because the argument of unfairness, and I do not know why, is still not strong enough – in economic terms, society needs children. We heard the figures today in our new White Paper: the demographic trend in Europe is really alarming, and we need to think about it. Our societies, our economies, need to harvest what has been invested in the education of women. It is so short sighted not to help women to use their education in better jobs. I could continue this economic argument but I will give you just two figures. We can see that keeping the barriers for women going to work if they so wish costs, in some Member States, up to 5% of GDP. This is a telling figure. There is another figure which I do not use very often but which is relevant, understanding that women’s economic dependence on men leads to violence against women: that figure shows how much this horrible phenomenon in the EU costs. We have calculated that it is EUR 260 million a year in Europe. This is the cost of violence against women. I could continue. I know we do not have much time, so I will conclude by saying that I take this gender pay gap very seriously, I understand all the complexity, and I can only repeat that we need to address all the sources of the pay gap and to come up with smart, well-targeted measures to get rid of it as soon as possible. Maybe we could discuss further whether there is a need for bigger sanctions, whether there is a need to encourage victims of discrimination to complain more often, and so on.

Unfortunately, the reality is different and shows that women earn on average 17% less than men, which later affects a lower pension by 40%. I must note that stereotypes and prejudices based on gender discrimination have a big impact on the pay gap. For example, women are often grouped into sectors that average lower wages, lower social prestige, and are considered traditionally female occupations, such as care-related jobs. Also, women spend an average of 21 hours a week on unpaid jobs, such as caring for the household and children, while men only 9 hours which leaves long-term effects on women’s careers, earnings and pensions. The problem I want to focus on is the poorer continuity of work experience in women. Women are less likely to be permanently employed and to sign long-term contracts because of the responsibilities they have around family and children.

It seems completely unrealistic to me that in the 21st century, women still have to work up to 10 years longer to do the same job, only to achieve the same pay as male representatives at the end of their careers. This senseless social injustice must be eliminated as soon as possible. Gender-based artificial discrimination is not just a mere sign of intolerable discrimination, but results in a much higher percentage of women than men at risk of poverty, even though women are statistically attaining higher education. I believe that transparency is a necessary tool with which we can successfully combat discrimination based on sex.

Whether women or men predominate varies from sector to sector, but unfortunately it is common for fewer women to take up leadership positions, regardless of sector. Unfortunately, the Hungarian government has not done much to end the shameful situation, although it should have contributed to it. It should take immediate action, such as pushing employers to eliminate pay discrimination through appropriate regulation, or, for example, guaranteeing the recognition of care institutions and work from home.

While no country is immune from domestic violence, unfortunately not even in the EU, the Russian Federation has always lacked comprehensive measures to prevent violence against women and children. Currently, according to statistics from the Russian Interior Ministry, about 40% of grave crimes in Russia are committed within the family. In 2006, the United Nations Committee on Elimination of Discrimination against Women recommended that Russia adopted specific legislation on domestic violence, stepped up its efforts to protect victims of violence and promoted gender equality. In 2010 and 2013, the Committee under the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women found that Russia failed to implement these recommendations, and urged it to give priority to this issue. Russia is one of only three members of the Council of Europe that have not signed the Istanbul Convention, that is, the Council of Europe’s Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence. Most countries in Europe are taking measures to stop domestic violence and raise awareness of this serious violation of human rights. On the contrary, Russia’s recent actions send the wrong message about the country’s commitment to tackling violence against women and children. They also go against its responsibilities as a member of international organisations. The recent law – adopted by the parliament and signed by President Putin – reduces ‘battery within the family’ from a criminal to an administrative offence for first-time offenders, and it weakens the sanctions. This is a clearly regressive step. It reverses some amendments to the criminal code adopted by the Russian Parliament itself in 2016, which treated violence against relatives as a criminal offence. The law was passed just weeks after the decision by the Russian Ministry of Justice to list the ANNA Centre as a ‘foreign agent’. The ANNA Centre is a Russian NGO renowned for its work on combatting domestic violence, including its reporting for the United Nations and the Council of Europe. The European Union expressed its concern about this bill right after it was voted by the parliament, and before it was signed into law by President Putin. We addressed this issue in the Council of Europe on 1 February and in the OSCE on 2 February. After the law was signed, on 7 February, we confirmed our criticism through a statement. We now repeat our call on Russia’s institutions to reverse this law and to respect international human rights standards, implementing in full the recommendations of the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women. The ratification of the Istanbul Convention would also be a very positive step. There can be no excuse for domestic violence. Social norms can be no excuse; family culture can be no excuse. Social norms can change, but we need to work hard for this to happen. We need to work on education and on good laws, so that violence can be eradicated from family life. Reducing sanctions is clearly a step in the wrong direction. It can only leave those who need protection more vulnerable and weaker than before.

It's also an indication of how society is evolving. Why is there a committee for soldier mothers in Russia in the next phase of life? Because they have to worry about their sons, because in many cases they are treated there just as brutally, up to and including death. This is an expression of brutalizing society as a whole and also the language in this country. And I believe and fear that in general the sensitivity to violence should be weakened, the sensitivity to the fact that society is actually being militarized in many areas - in the curricula, in the exercises in schools.

So, rather than thinking about Russian children receiving an education and, admittedly, sometimes spanking from their parents, it might be wiser of you to try to understand the reasons for the monumental election spankings than the European Union. will receive within a few months.

The new Russian law trivialising domestic violence is a serious setback in combating violence against women. It sounds chilling that beating up your wife, your partner or child becomes simply an administrative offence, like wrongly parking your car, unless permanent damage is caused. It is even absurd to think that this kind of abuse by a loved one would not cause permanent damage to the victim. Domestic violence is violence. It is not a private issue, it is a crime, and it has to be treated as such. Traditional sexist maxims never justify this violence. Women’s rights are human rights. These are universal values under the United Nations Charter. It is not the West versus Russia. Or is it about ideology, patriotism, nationalism, a way to disempower women? We are not interfering in domestic affairs, but standing up for humanity. Russia is a member of the United Nations and the Council of Europe, and should behave as such, first of all by signing and ratifying the Istanbul Convention on Violence against Women.

Like many other MEPs I receive heartfelt emails from citizens living in the UK and across Europe. There are tens of thousands of EU citizens in the UK. They have paid their taxes, they have paid into our pension pots, and they are paying down our debts. They contribute to our society and our economy. The threats from Mrs May’s government must be stopped now. No ifs, no buts. They are doctors, nurses, shopkeepers, students, teachers and others – they are not political bargaining chips. There are many examples. There’s the Romanian electrician forced to resign after threats and bullying. There’s the Italian beautician who has been resident for 20 years, married to a Brit, but now threatened with deportation as she has no private health insurance. And the lists go on and on. They are real people, with real lives, who are worried and fearful. Is that how we should be treating people we promised we would welcome? My government needs to guarantee the rights of these people immediately and stop uncertainty. We need to protect the UK that I know: open, tolerant and united. But it is for this House and its MEPs to speak for all European citizens. We are the ones who must fight for the rights that need to be protected.

Now, and once Article 50 is triggered, will you, as the guardian of the Treaties, take action to ensure that the Free Movement Directive is properly applied in relation to both EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens in other EU countries? Why must we ask this today? Because there is compelling and growing evidence, since the Brexit vote, from our constituency casework, responsible journalism and the voices of EU citizens themselves, that some EU citizens in the UK are experiencing great uncertainty about their position. There is suspicion that, far from protecting their rights in the sensitive transition period, the UK has already begun to use them as bargaining chips. We can detect this from the approximately 28% of EU citizen applicants for UK citizenship since the referendum who have had their applications rejected or declared invalid. It is well known that the procedure for some who have been living in the UK, sometimes for decades, involves having to fill in the notorious 85-page forms, which can often trigger delays and panic. I do not have time here to recount the stories of heartbreak and stifling bureaucracy but we must ask if this amounts to a UK policy or to negligence in respect of individuals and families whom we are legally obliged to protect. The European Parliament will hold hearings to gather our own evidence and do our job, but the Commission can act right away. The UK Government has a moral, political and legal duty to protect the rights of all EU citizens, not least because they contribute to our communities and our economy. They are vital. As Article 50 is triggered, hundreds of thousands of UK citizens in other EU countries will want the same equality and dignity that is afforded to EU citizens in the UK: not a negotiation, but a guarantee.

We will discuss the others when the Petitions Committee brings forward their resolution. However, many EU 27 nationals do live in the UK and over a third of them live in my region of London. Some of them are my neighbours. And the lack of certainty over their future is causing huge concern, just as it is for UK nationals living in other Member States. You only have to read the testimonies on the ‘Brexpats’ website. Much of this uncertainty could certainly be removed by the British Government. I think many of us will welcome tonight’s vote in the House of Lords on the Article 50 bill, asking the government to introduce proposals within three months of the triggering of that Article, to ensure that EU citizens in the UK have the same residence rights after Brexit. In the meantime, as people have said, there are people in the UK from EU countries who have lived, worked, studied and retired there. Some have caring responsibilities and there I think we have an issue with the long-term residents directive. They do not want to be used as bargaining chips; they feel it is insulting and demeaning, and it is. Our government could at least be clear that these people are valued and it should strongly condemn the rising racism and xenophobia we are seeing in the UK. A lot of the stress and the fear that we are seeing is also being caused by the attitude of the authorities. Certainly in terms of sickness insurance we know there has been a shift in position by the British Government over the last few years on the role of the NHS. We really hope that the Commission will get on, please, and introduce the infringement proceedings that have been hanging for so long.

The correct application of EU rules on free movement by all Member States is of fundamental importance – correct application by all Member States. And for as long as the UK remains a Member State, all rights and obligations continue to apply.  I am fully aware that EU citizens living in the United Kingdom are concerned about their future rights; EU citizens residing in the United Kingdom deserve to know what their rights will be in the UK after the UK leaves the European Union and, vice versa, the same applies to UK citizens residing in the other 27 Member States. The authors of the oral question are absolutely right: people need certainty and stability and they deserve respect and fairness. That is why I hope that this issue can be addressed as soon as possible. However, it is first for the UK to give effect to the outcome of the referendum vote. There can be no negotiation before notification, as you know. It is therefore not possible to be more precise at this stage. Let me now refer to the individual questions. On the first question, concerning the statistics on the number of residence applications, residence refusals and expulsions from the UK, the Commission does not have up-to-date statistics on this matter. EU law on free movement of EU citizens does not oblige Member States to collect such data and share them with the Commission. Some data on numbers of issued residence documents are in the public domain, but there is little data on refused applications, and there is almost no publicly available data on expulsions and appeal rates. Ever since the entry into force of the Free Movement Directive in 2006, the Commission has been working closely together with Member States to improve their ability to collect statistical data and share it. Unfortunately, progress is limited due to a lack of commitment on the part of Member States.  With regard to the infringement procedures, I would like to underline that the Commission takes appropriate action to address failures of any Member State to comply with their obligations under EU law. There are currently infringement procedures in this area against eight Member States. The two pending infringement procedures against the United Kingdom relate to access residence rights of economically non-active citizens, and rights of UK nationals returning to the United Kingdom after residing in another Member State. I would like to inform you that the Commission is assessing these cases carefully.  As regards the residence rights of economically non-active citizens, the Commission will take into account in its assessment the recent case law of the Court of Justice concerning the conditions to which Member States can subject the access to welfare benefits by economically non-active EU citizens in order to protect public finances. Please allow me to underline that the Commission is also carefully assessing the compliance with the provisions of the Free Movement Directive of the latest amendments to the UK legislation that came into force in February 2017. With regard to your last question, the Commission attaches great importance to providing guidance to Member States in order to prevent breaches of EU law. Therefore, since the Free Movement Directive entered into force, the Commission adopted five official guidance documents: in 2008, the report on the application of the Directive; in 2009, guidelines for better transposition and application of the Directive; in 2010, the Handbook for the processing of visa applications; in 2013, the report on free movement and in 2014, the Handbook on marriages of convenience.  In addition to official guidance, the Commission has met experts from Member States twenty-four times in an expert group dedicated to the application of the Free Movement Directive. These meetings are a useful tool to communicate the Commission’s interpretation on issues of practical application of EU law. Last but not least, I would like to inform you that a few weeks ago, the Commission has made available an e-tool on free movement for national administration, together with its citizenship report issued by the Commission in January 2017. The Citizenship report sets out a number of actions to raise citizens’ awareness of their rights and how to seek help if their rights are not respected.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "Verts/ALE", "partyIdeology": "Greens and regionalists"}, {"id": 232, "date": "2017-03-01.json", "name": "Roberta METSOLA", "mepid": "118859", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Madam President, free movement is one of the cornerstones of our European project and we need to be vigilant in order to ensure that there are no unnecessary limitations to it by any Member State.

In this respect, it is crucial that the Commission provides Member States, including the United Kingdom, with proper guidance to ensure the correct application of the Free Movement Directive and protect the rights of EU citizens.

That is why securing the status of EU nationals residing in the UK, and of UK nationals residing in the EU, is a top priority for the Prime Minister. Any delay in reaching guarantees on this issue is a consequence of timing and procedure, not of political will. Why are we not now debating how we can make freedom of movement work better? Why are we not debating how we can rebuild people’s confidence in the principle? Why are we not debating how we can address the concerns regarding its implementation across the whole of Europe? For example, we could be addressing the concerns in Germany about access to public services and benefits. We could be addressing the demographic challenges that many EU countries face. Our debates do nothing to convince people that we have solutions to the challenges we face – and then we wonder why voters are turning to the fringes of our political system for answers. Debates like this just fuel the scaremongers and spread fear amongst our citizens, who are already unsettled by the changing political landscape.

I am glad that we are discussing this point today, because at a time when the United Kingdom is part of the European Union, the Commission needs to do everything in its power to ensure that the British comply with European legislation. That, I think, is the basic postulate that applies, and the other debates that have taken place here between the various British Members are not so much related to that fundamental problem. In short and well, there is a clear directive on free movement, and it is clear that the United Kingdom is not fully complying with this directive, that it is partially emptying its content. It is a bit of a pity, Commissioner, that we have no further information, that we do not have more statistics on how many European Union citizens have been expelled from the UK in recent years, as this would clearly confirm that current British legislation restricts freedom of movement as regulated by a European directive. I therefore call on the Commission, like my colleagues in the Group of the European People's Party, to pay special attention to this issue, because the European Union stands on four fundamental freedoms, freedom of movement, freedom of capital, freedom of services and freedom of goods. If we were tolerant of restricting one of these freedoms, we would be undermining the principles of the European Union, regardless of how Brexit itself turns out and what rights after Brexit the citizens of the European Union will have in the British Isles.

In a way, it symbolizes the rule of law, the European area of ​​justice, which is one of the pillars of our democracy. The European Parliament is very attached to the proper functioning of the Court of Justice. It has demonstrated this in the past by ensuring that it has the necessary resources. As proof of this, the goodwill of the vast majority of members of parliament when it came to reforming the tribunal. Without enthusiasm, but in order to allow the proper functioning of the tribunal we accepted, in October 2015, the Council's proposal, which consisted in doubling the number of judges of the tribunal, whereas the Council had not succeeded in agree on a smaller increase in the number of judges or a system of rotation. Parliament has therefore never failed to support the Court when asked to do so, because we believe that in a democracy, citizens must be guaranteed access to justice and fair trials within reasonable timeframes. and effective justice. But our democracy is also distinguished by respect for human rights and our values, including, of course, the principle of equality. I would like to recall here that, during the reform of the Court of Justice of the Union, Parliament insisted on respect for equality between men and women. In the trilogues, the Council had promised and pledged to nominate more women for judicial posts in both court and tribunal. We even introduced by amendment a sophisticated calendar which allows Member States to appoint two judges each time, which should have made it easier to maintain parity. We obviously know that the appointment of judges is not the competence of the European Parliament, but I expected Member States to honor their commitment. Now that do we see today? Of the 28 judges of the Court of Justice, only 5 are women. Among the 44 judges of the court, there are only 10 women. That is 15 women out of a total of 72 judges. Barely 20%. Council officials will tell me that this is the legacy of the past. Is. But how can we explain that out of the 15 newly appointed judges, only three are women? It is scandalous and unacceptable. I cannot believe that in our Member States there is no way to find women judges capable of sitting in the Court of Justice or in the tribunal. Moreover, I cannot believe that the Member States do not commit to equality between men and women. It seems elementary to me. I remind you that we are living in the 21st century. Our grandmothers were ridiculed, but they fought for the right to study, to access positions of responsibility. We're still not there. We have European justice rendered mainly by men and a judicial system lacking the crossed gaze of women. Therefore, my question is for the representatives of the Member States: what do you intend to do to meet the commitments you have made to promote gender parity when appointing judges to the European Court of Justice? Do you not think that balanced representation of men and women is an asset for the Court of Justice and for quality justice? Finally, I would like to congratulate the Member States which proposed women and thus ensured a better gender balance in the Court and the tribunal, and at the same time, I mean my disappointment, even my contempt, for countries that have not done so.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 260, "date": "2017-03-01.json", "name": "Mady DELVAUX", "mepid": "124776", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Madam President, equality between women and men is a fundamental principle of the European Union, as we said earlier today in our debate on the gender pay gap. The equal participation of women and men in decision—making is a matter of justice, respect for human rights and good governance. This was underlined by the Council in its conclusions of December 2015. On that occasion the Council also noted that there is still a need to achieve de facto gender equality in the European Union, which requires a multifaceted approach, including legislation, awareness—raising and positive action programmes.  The Council thus called inter alia on Member States’ governments to promote a balanced representation of women and men in the political sphere, including nominations to high—level positions in the EU institutions. Against this background, it is not surprising that the importance of ensuring gender balance in high judicial functions was also reaffirmed in the context of the reform of the General Court, which was adopted in December 2015 and is currently being implemented.  As you know, this reform foresees an increase in the number of judges at the General Court in three stages. The first stage, the appointment of 12 additional judges, is currently being completed and the second stage is also in the process of being implemented with a view to reaching the number of 47 judges. Two appointments are still outstanding.  The final stage, in which the Court will comprise two judges per Member State, will be completed by 2019 and only then will it be possible to assess whether we have come closer to the objective of gender balance in the composition of the General Court. At present, out of a total of 44 judges at the General Court, ten are women and, among the 22 judges who were newly appointed in 2016, six are women. This is of course not yet satisfactory, even if there is a slight upward trend, which hopefully we will further consolidated.  What can we do in order to reinforce an equal gender representation among judges at the Court? Of course under the Treaty the appointment of judges and, by implication, the nomination of candidates, is the exclusive prerogative of the governments of the Member States. Neither the Council nor Parliament have any role in this respect. What the legislator can do – and has done in the context of the reform – is to create a legal framework which facilitates the nomination of one woman and one man by the Member States. The phasing in of new judges has been conceived in a way which ensures that over time the regular terms of office of the two judges of each Member State end at the same time. The idea is that this should make it easier for Member States to propose one woman and one man. Regarding the selection procedure, the decisive criterion for the appointment of judges is not gender but merit. The Treaty provides that judges are to be chosen from persons whose independence is beyond doubt and who possess the ability required for appointment to high judicial office. Candidates are screened and interviewed by an independent panel of eminent persons, which has set very high standards in terms of qualification and independence and whose opinions on the candidates’ suitability have so far always been followed by Member States’ governments.  This has led many Member States to introduce internal procedures with an open call for candidates and an objective selection to identify the best candidate. This is a welcome development to ensure the highest quality of judges, but of course there is no guarantee that there will be a sufficient number of women among the candidates nor that the best candidate for a given position will be a woman. This brings me back to my initial point, the Council conclusions of December 2015 on equality between women and men in the field of decision—making. In order to achieve de facto a more balanced representation of women and men in the General Court, we now need to concentrate on different aspects, such as awareness—raising and regular monitoring of progress made. These are no doubt the very legitimate objectives behind Ms Delvaux’s question and I am confident that the views expressed in today’s debate will be carefully examined and taken into account as much as possible in the capitals of the Member States.

This is not the first time that we are talking about gender equality in various areas of life.

Indeed, in December 2015, we concluded such a gentleman's agreement with representatives of the Council in order to complete the legislative basis for the next reform of the European Court of Justice - a reform we deemed necessary. We are fully aware that this is not a clause that obliges anyone to do anything, but it is nevertheless a gentleman's agreement, an agreement that we will demand to be kept. And here thank you very much Mady Delvaux for preparing this question. My conclusion is that, when we look at employment in the field of justice in the Member States, we can see that the majority of judges are women.

For example, after a divorce from a partner, women find themselves on the brink of poverty. Another huge problem is the lack of available services for mothers with children, which leads to a reduction in the employment of women in the labor market.

That principle goes back at least to Roman times, to the Roman goddess Justitia. Since the 16th century, Lady Justice has often been depicted wearing a blindfold, that shows that justice, true justice, is blind to wealth, power or other status, and in today’s society we might well add gender, amongst other characteristics. I do not think it is in any way a stretch to suggest that the same principles should apply to the appointment of judges. Equality of opportunity should exist for all.

While in the most recent appointments at the General Court we have seen a slightly higher percentage of women than before, there is clearly still scope for improvement.  We could ask what else could be done to promote gender equality in the composition of the General Court. It is difficult to understand that, while in many Member States women are well represented in national judicial functions, this is still not the case in the European Union’s Court. Perhaps it is due to the fact that, for judges at the General Court, relevant experience of at least 12 to 15 years is requested, and that women are less represented in this category of experienced lawyers and judges. Some paths towards improving the situation have been outlined, as I have already mentioned, in the Council conclusions of 7 December 2015 on equality between women and men in the field of decision—making, in which the Council called on governments and the social partners to establish far—reaching equal opportunities policies and to set targets and timelines to further develop and implement effective measures aimed at ensuring the balanced representation of women and men in decision-making and leadership, including training, mentoring and sponsoring schemes. This could be food for thought, inter alia, as regards the preparation of suitable female candidates for judges’ posts at the General Court, and might contribute, over time, to improving the overall gender balance among judges. Finally, I think that we could again take stock of the situation once the last stage of the reform has been completed, which should be sometime in 2020. In the meantime, I am confident that discussions like this one contribute to the public debate on the issue and to awareness raising in the capitals.

Commissioner! Ladies and gentlemen! The overriding goal of the Energy Union is to ensure energy security for its members, which largely depends on the diversification of supplies. Compliance of intergovernmental agreements in the field of energy with EU law is one of the conditions for the proper functioning of the internal energy market, increasing security of supply and diversification. However, as we all know, so far the Commission has not had an effective tool to prevent the conclusion of agreements that are incompatible with EU law, incompatible with the objectives of the Energy Union. More than a year ago, in December 2015, in the parliamentary resolution on the energy union, we highlighted the low transparency of intergovernmental agreements, the supply and transit of energy resources from third countries, or the construction and use of the necessary infrastructure, and highlighted the ineffectiveness of existing control mechanisms. In February last year, the Commission presented a proposal to modify the decision on this matter. Since then, we have worked intensively within the Committee on Industry, Energy and Research to establish verification mechanisms for these agreements. I must emphasize here that without very good cooperation with the shadow rapporteurs of the individual political groups and their advisers, such a fast legislative path would not have been possible. I would like to thank everyone very much. This period of intense negotiations coincided with the final period of the Slovak Presidency. We have also worked very well with the Slovak Presidency on this document. I would also like to thank the President of ITRE, Professor Buzek, for his commitment, cooperation, not always obvious among politicians of different political orientations, but I think it was indeed a very good cooperation. I am convinced that the draft decision we are about to adopt tomorrow can provide citizens and states with greater energy security. This it will also be the first legislative act implementing the assumptions of the joint energy strategy of 28 member states. Obviously, this project is the result of a compromise reached in negotiations between the political groups in the committee and in negotiations with the Council, and, like any compromise, it implies some concessions. The most important provisions of this document are the fact that draft contracts relating to the supply or transmission of natural gas and crude oil will be verified by the European Commission before they are ratified, i.e. ex ante. So far, we have only dealt with ex ante verification and only in terms of existing EU regulations; now, broadly defined energy security is becoming an additional verification criterion. However, it was not possible to include the ex ante verification of electricity contracts in the current form of this decision. It is worth emphasizing, however, that in accordance with the provisions of the review clause, they could be included in the scope of verification in the next update of the regulations. The ex ante verification clause also excludes so-called non-binding instruments and hybrid contracts. As for non-binding instruments, the notification criteria are much less restrictive in this case, but the important thing is that they have been defined in this decision, which opens the possibility of introducing more detailed verification of these instruments in the future. The draft also omits hybrid agreements, but in the framework of trilogue negotiations, the Commission has undertaken to issue a declaration that the review clause in Article 10 of the Decision allows the Commission to propose in the future to include such contracts in the scope of the review. These are agreements concluded by states, governments with formally non-governmental entities, but in which third countries play a dominant role.

With this, we have reached a major political success that we have built together over the last months. I want to congratulate the rapporteur, Professor Krasnodębski, and the Members of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy for their excellent work. I also want to congratulate the Dutch and the Slovak Presidencies for their support. The review of the IGA decision takes place in the context of the Energy Union Strategy, the objective of which is to give European Union consumers – households and business – secure, sustainable, competitive and affordable energy supplies. In the current geopolitical climate, the Energy Union is essential to stimulate the production of renewables, improve energy efficiency and deliver a more integrated energy sector, which can ensure the security of supply and a successful energy transition, while promoting investment, growth and jobs. With the agreement on the IGA decision, the first act to be agreed from the security of supply package we presented one year ago, we are giving a very powerful signal. We are showing that jointly, Parliament, the Commission and the Council attach great importance to bringing more coherence to our external energy policy, and that this external energy policy should be guided by respect for our internal rules and principles. The current rules on intergovernmental agreements were agreed in 2012, and they require Member States to notify the Commission of their energy agreements with non-European Union countries only after they have been concluded (ex-post). The Commission has been notified of some 124 intergovernmental agreements under the 2012 rules. One third of the agreements related to energy infrastructure or energy supply contained provisions that were not compliant with European Union law. Moreover, it has proven very difficult to renegotiate or terminate intergovernmental agreements once they have been signed by the parties. In fact, no intergovernmental agreement has been successfully renegotiated as yet. The review therefore has two main objectives: to ensure full compliance of IGAs with European Union law, thereby ensuring the proper functioning of the internal energy market, enhancing competition, and ensuring energy security. And to increase the transparency of IGAs in order to increase the cost-effectiveness of European Union energy supply and increase solidarity between Member States. The deal is very relevant: for the first time, the principle of a mandatory ex-ante assessment by the Commission of gas and oil IGAs has been accepted, while electricity IGAs are still subject to a mandatory ex-post check. For the first time the role of non-legally binding instruments has been recognised, in full respect of the principle of subsidiarity and proportionality. This will allow for more transparent and fully compliant IGAs in the future. This will increase our energy security and the functioning of our internal market. Of course, there should be no complacency, and the Commission will continue monitoring the development of the information exchange in the future. By 1 January 2020 we will issue a report on its implementation, to monitor the situation, notably regarding agreements between Member States and undertakings but also regarding electricity IGAs.  At the last trilogue in December, the Commission made a statement in that sense that will be attached to the Minutes of today’s debate. On this basis, I am confident that the vote in plenary tomorrow will give a strong backing to the important agreement that we have achieved together. WRITTEN STATEMENT BY THE COMMISSION 1. The review clause of this Decision (Article10) covers the possibility for the Commission to assess whether it is appropriate to address agreements between Member States and undertakings from third countries, in the future, and to assess whether all instruments in this Decision are sufficiently addressed. 2.

This mechanism will allow Member States to be aware early enough about non-conformity with EU law and to have the Commission’s expertise on their side. I would highlight the fact that this is the first dossier from the Energy Union strategy on which an agreement with the Council has been reached, and securing this agreement in a record time is a significant political achievement towards establishing the Energy Union. The key objectives of the decision are to increase transparency of the energy market, to guarantee that intergovernmental agreements in the field of gas and oil are in line with EU law, and to strengthen the EU’s resilience to gas and oil supply disruptions. It will equally increase Member States’ negotiating power with third countries, as they benefit from the political and economic weight of the European Union. Subsequently, a high degree of transparency will also contribute to closer cooperation between Member States in the field of external energy relations and the achievement of long-term objectives relating to the functioning of the internal energy market.

Europe must respond to this with a clear and strong position in the energy supply negotiations. Therefore, a greater degree of transparency in the negotiation of international agreements, in particular on oil and gas supplies, is more than necessary. The intensified exchange of information and the possibility for the Commission to participate in these negotiations as an observer is the way that must lead to an improvement in our position. By notifying these contracts, the Commission must also ensure that they fully comply with the rules of the European Union's internal energy market. I consider it a positive change that this will not happen until after the agreements have been concluded, but during their negotiation.

We welcome, for example, the deletion of the proposal for a mandatory participation of the Commission in the negotiations. Unfortunately, however, the main objective of increasing the Commission's powers to the detriment of the sovereign rights of the Member States remains. The various proposals that remain, for greater involvement of the Commission in the process, even before the conclusion of intergovernmental agreements, with the obligatory ex ante evaluation, are problematic and involve risks. It is not possible for Member States not to be able to sign, ratify or conclude draft intergovernmental agreements without the approval of the Commission, as required in the proposal tabled. Especially since the European Union has not yet been able to deal with the serious problems that exist in energy supply, as many Member States (and regions) of the Union are isolated from the major energy networks.

I agree with Prime Minister Buzek that the most important thing is implementation, what we will do with this legislation. Here, I would also call on the Commission to be bold and consistent, because certain decisions that are made, such as the decision on the OPAL gas pipeline or the lack of a decision on Nord Stream 2, mean that in many countries whose citizens were very convinced about the European Union and its merits, there is growing skepticism.

However, the real effect is currently negligible. The problem is that the control is carried out ex post, that is, only after the conclusion of any agreements. For example, countries primarily dependent on a single fossil fuel supplier may be pushed into various disadvantages. However, once the agreement is reached, it is too late to make amends. Up to 17 intergovernmental agreements have been identified as problematic. However, entering them after signing was useless. In addition, in many cases, specific related investment projects have begun to be implemented. Given the EU's high dependence on fossil fuel imports from third countries, instead of a bureaucratically complex assessment, it would suffice to say to what extent those intergovernmental agreements contribute to the diversification of sources and transport routes.

However, these crises have entered European history not only as threats, but as the beginning of a new era.

The real integration of the Energy Union has begun, the interconnection of the networks of the neighboring Member States has begun and we have taken significant steps to develop the market.

But they face challenges, such as sustainability, due to the aging of the population, the increase in chronic diseases, the emergence of new technologies. But today, fundamentally, the increase in pharmaceutical spending brings us here: 17% of all health spending - 1.4% of the European Union's GDP. The fact is that the high prices of medicines have put us, developed countries, in a scenario that we did not consider could reach us one day: hepatitis C - a disease with serious consequences, but today with curative treatment. It has not yet been able to aspire to its eradication, but we are prioritizing, based on guidance, its treatment, which is difficult to justify from an ethical point of view. But cancer also threatens 24 million new cases by 2030, an increase of 68% compared to 2012. But this is not a question of ethics, it is also a question of rights. Article 35 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights protects the right to health. The drug, as such, cannot be considered another consumer good, but must be specially regulated so that the patient is at the center of access to it. But, in addition to prices and sustainability, we have the problems of shortages, the lack of adaptation to needs due to lack of commercial interest - in aspects such as antimicrobial resistance - or the need to put incentives - as is the case with medicines orphans—, problems with competition for generics to enter, or lack of innovation with minor modifications in many cases. The price of Medicines are established by the industry on the basis of value, lacking other balances that guarantee access to citizenship. Orphan drugs are increasing in a number that suggests that the criteria are being applied incorrectly, because they generate a fast business, a fast return on investment. As I say, the disputes in the competition that make it difficult for generics to enter are concerned. All of this seems that it may end up leading or is leading to a business model that hinders access to medicines by European citizens. The Member States, with confidential agreements, with co-payment, in short, with different measures, try to find a solution, but, finally, what we have is a more fragmented and unequal market. The Commission implements public incentives, but they do not guarantee that return to society through a fair price or access. This balance of powers is crucial to us and, for this, the added therapeutic value is crucial and has to be established by the Commission and the Member States in a coordinated way. We need, Commissioner, a legislative framework in this regard; also analyze other criteria, of course, economic and social to guarantee it. We need to assess the true impact of intellectual property in promoting innovation and in its quality and, ultimately, in access to medicines, the social purpose that really justifies this fundamental right as well. We have to evaluate the public incentives put in place and also guarantee a fair return on investment with an adequate price and guaranteed access. We need a better framework that guarantees competition and entry of generics and a rational use of the drug. But, very especially, today I want to vindicate —and it cannot be delayed any longer— a plan that will eradicate hepatitis C. It is immoral, it is unsustainable that, today, When we have drugs that save people's lives, we are not able to coordinate enough to eradicate this disease.In short, this report proposes measures and actions - these and others - and I ask the Commissioner to take this initiative and, before the end of the year, show us a legislative proposal.Parliament joins the Council, the UN and the OECD.It is a popular cry that we have to respond to this just demand.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 1, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 2, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 299, "date": "2017-03-01.json", "name": "Soledad CABEZÓN RUIZ", "mepid": "125041", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, I would like to thank the House, and in particular the rapporteur, Ms Cabezón Ruiz, and the shadow rapporteurs, for your enormous efforts in preparing the report on access to medicines in Europe. I fully share your concern about the need to improve patients’ access to medicines and to help ensure that all patients have timely access to innovative and affordable medicines everywhere in the EU. There should be affordable and innovative medicines for each and every European citizen. The key question here is, of course, how do we balance the objectives of innovation, quality and affordability? On the one hand, we need to ensure that the industry develops truly innovative products that respect the strict rules of safety, quality and efficacy while, on the other hand, we need to make sure that this innovation remains affordable, and thus accessible, to patients throughout Europe. I support Member States’ initiatives to help reduce the price of medicines and increase transparency, and the Commission has published a study on enhanced coordination across countries in this area. Together we can all do more for European patients. Your report addresses the entire life cycle of an innovative pharmaceutical’s initial research, regulatory approvals, market launch and, ultimately, entry into the market of generic competitors. Let me concentrate on two aspects which figure prominently in the report: first, health technology assessment and, second, the incentive schemes aimed at encouraging pharmaceutical companies to develop innovative products for unmet medical needs.  I would like to start with health technology assessments. As you rightly state, health technology assessments help Member States to ensure the sustainability of their health care systems, encouraging pharmaceutical companies to develop products with clear therapeutic value-added benefits for patients. In 2016 the Commission announced its intention to propose an initiative on strengthening European Union cooperation for health technology assessment in 2017. We are working intensively on this initiative, analysing the results of the public consultation and preparing the impact assessment. In that context, I welcome the input provided by Parliament on health technology assessment. Concretely, your report recommends the harmonisation of health technology assessment tools and methodologies and that consideration be given to compulsory relative-effectiveness assessments at EU level, with a focus on medical and therapeutic aspects. I cannot, of course, yet indicate what the Commission will propose, as we need to finalise our analysis first. Your input will contribute to shaping the initiative. My aim is to come up with a proposal that has clear benefits for all – for patients firstly, for all European citizens and for Member States. Secondly, let me turn to the incentive system for pharmaceutical companies. A key component of this system is patents. The aim of patents is to allow companies to recover long—term investment in the research and development of new products through exclusive rights. In the pharmaceutical sector these patent rights can be extended by so—called supplementary protection certificates. This extension can be used when research and development has taken a very long time. In addition to patent rights and the supplementary protection certificates, companies can also benefit from regulatory data protection and sometimes market exclusivity periods, for example to develop orphan drugs. You will also remember that we announced our intention to improve the patent system in Europe in the Single Market Strategy. Let me reassure you that this work includes a reference to supplementary patent certificates for pharmaceuticals. It is currently ongoing. Let me add that we will soon launch a comprehensive study to look into the complex incentive system for pharmaceuticals, in line with the recent Council conclusions. This study will investigate the impact of the current regime on innovation, availability and accessibility. We expect to have the final results of the study at the end of this year. In the meantime we published, earlier this month, an inception impact assessment announcing an evolution of the supplementary protection certificates legislation. This assessment also identifies legislative and non—legislative options for the way forward, and we intend to launch a public consultation before the summer. Let me stress that your own-initiative report will provide a very important contribution to this work. I would like to emphasise that, when it comes to incentive schemes, we already have, as you know, dedicated European rules which apply for specific types of products such as advanced therapies, paediatric medicines and orphan medicines. First, in the field of paediatric medicines, as I explained last December in Strasbourg, we are currently preparing a second implementation report showing how the sector functions. We are currently analysing the results from the consultation so I am not yet in a position to draw conclusions at this stage.  Second, in the area of advanced therapies and orphan medicines, our current focus is on the effective implementation of the legislation. In particular, for orphan medicines, let me recall that the legal framework has, for the past 17 years, enabled a strong increase in research and development activities for rare disorders. Investment in this field was previously too scarce due to the very small numbers of patients concerned. I recognise that, besides health technology assessments and the incentive schemes, there are many other very important aspects covered by your report. For example, you touch upon research pricing competition and international matters. You also comment on the new forms of regional cooperation between smaller groups of Member States, such as the one involving Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Austria. Your report additionally calls on the Commission to submit a number of reports and to organise follow—up actions such as the creation of a new pharmaceutical forum. Be assured that we will carefully analyse these suggestions. I believe we need to capitalise on the work already carried out in other forums. This is the case, for example, on the collection of pharmaceutical prices in the European database or on the guidance documents produced by international organisations. Very often this work is conducted in close cooperation with the Commission and Member States.  Let me conclude by expressing once again my sincere appreciation and gratitude for the strenuous efforts put into this important report. Let me remind you that the Commission is also working with Member States, in the Expert Group on Safe and Timely Access to Medicines for Patients, to optimise the use of the existing regulatory tools. I am encouraged by the fact that we all share a common vision, namely maintaining a favourable environment for real innovation in the EU, while ensuring that all European patients have timely access to truly innovative and affordable medicines of good quality and safety. In the light of that, I look forward to hearing your views.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 8, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 300, "date": "2017-03-01.json", "name": "Piernicola PEDICINI", "mepid": "124844", "text": "draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Development. - Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank the rapporteur Cabezón for the work she has done here, also on behalf of Mr Corrao, of the Development Committee, since the work they have done in that committee and in the environment committee has been well received, especially for the issues that have been identified and highlighted with regard to developing countries. However, I want to bring the subject back to what is happening here in Europe and above all with regard to the abuse of fundamental rights, such as that of health. I quote Sofosbuvir, the rapporteur mentioned earlier, which can lead to complete recovery from hepatitis C and which is sold in the European Union at 277 times the production price; the pertussis vaccine is produced for less than a dollar, but in the European Union it is sold for 120 dollars; Erlotinib, for pancreatic cancer, costs 15,000 euros per treatment and produces an average survival increase of only 15 days; Cetuximab, for lung cancer, costs € 80,000 per patient and produces an average survival increase of only one and a half months.

But the worst comes from those shameful amendments by the EPP and ALDE which even want to promote \"incremental innovation\". We are absurd.

Ensuring the stability of health care systems in times of increased spending and an aging population requires many activities, including activities related to access to drugs, their prices and availability. It is mainly a question of using Health Technology Assessment (HTA). This use should mainly concern generics and biosimilars, because nowadays these prices are sometimes inadequate to the production costs. Mainly, it is necessary to take advantage of the competition in the off-patent drugs sector, because they generate specific savings. In the field of drug technology, I support the improvement of information exchange.

I would like to say one thing here now, because that was a bit of an open question: I think it is wrong to deny researchers any ethics. That sounded a bit. There are many researchers in the pharmaceutical field who are determined to help people. It is an important thing. Of course, it is then about making arrangements to see across borders how you can support each other, for example if there is a shortage of medical care somewhere, if a particular epidemic or something else has broken out where you can actually see which other Member State may have something in stock where one can help oneself out. It is also a matter of coordinating with research and also seeing that the prices do not go wild. But I would like to address one thing that I also consider to be very important: the OECD has determined that at least 20% of health costs would not be necessary because unnecessary treatments and unnecessary medication must be taken into account. Digitization can bring a lot, that has already been mentioned. In Greece it has been noticed that e-prescribing has reduced drug costs by 40%.

The most fundamental from my point of view is the problem of the so-called parallel re-export, which afflicts especially states like mine. Both the European Union institutions and the Member States need to make every effort to prevent parallel trade in pharmaceutical products in the most lucrative markets, as this leads to a shortage of medicines, leading to extremely high health risks for citizens who are often even forced to discontinue treatment. . I believe that the report makes this clear. I also believe that we have succeeded in calling for a solution to fully control the invaded intellectual property right, which today allows for the new patenting of a product that has been only slightly modified, in order to extend the term of drug protection at the expense of finding new ones. That is why I am shocked by the amendments tabled by the right, which seeks to further protect these heinous practices of the pharmaceutical industry. I hope that colleagues will take reason into their own hands and not participate in something like that. What should be emphasized again in connection with yesterday's Rare Diseases Day is that the development of new innovative medicines cannot be governed solely by market rules and the mantra of the cost of profit, as the Commissioner has already said here today.

I believe that there is a clear need to step up European cooperation, for example, on the issue of prices or the fight against falsified medicines, as well as the exchange of information. I do not agree with referring to the economic crisis or the negative effects of austerity policies on the state of health systems. This is a one-sided approach. Regardless of the economic crisis, the health situation in Central European Member States is still worse than in the West. Catching up takes time, but we must seize every means to avoid that patients ’recovery and health depend on which country we live in. At this point, I mention the parallel trade in medicines, which is also a problem in our countries and leads to a shortage of medicines. To prevent this, the EU institutions and the Member States must also take action, because quality and affordable medicine is not a luxury. It is also very important that Member States share information, expertise and best practices in order to prevent overpricing of medicines and to ensure that generic products reach the market.

Inequalities in access to quality healthcare are widespread throughout the European Union and, unfortunately, innovation is not reaching all Member States at the same pace. Although the powers in the field of drug policy are at the national level, I think there are also European solutions to improve the current situation. Medicinal products are one of the main pillars of the healthcare system, not just a commercial commodity. Public health and patient interest considerations must take precedence over economic considerations. Therefore, the European Commission must closely monitor the situation with parallel trade in order to prevent it from leading to a shortage of medicines in some countries, such as Bulgaria. I think it is counterproductive to talk about harmonizing drug prices in the European Union. The economic situation is different in each country and prices should adequately reflect this. However, what we can do is harmonize the assessment of the therapeutic added value of each medicinal product in order to speed up the marketing process and avoid duplication. Twenty-eight different national agencies are currently evaluating, but some countries are experiencing serious difficulties due to a lack of administrative capacity. Ultimately, this affects patients who are at a disadvantage because they do not have timely access to the necessary treatment.

This debate shows we share the aim of helping patients gain access to truly innovative medicines at affordable prices across the European Union. I would like to pick up a couple of points raised in your report and in the debate.  I support Member States’ initiatives to help reduce medicine prices and increase transparency in the setting of such prices. Small countries have lower negotiating power and face particular difficulties. I welcome the ongoing cooperation amongst European Union countries in this regard. In addition, our European Union Joint Procurement Agreement enables Member States to buy medicines together under the same conditions. In fact, most Member States will buy pandemic vaccines together this year. Thinking about vaccines, vaccine shortages are indeed a major challenge. This is why we are setting up a joint action on vaccines with the Member States to help them forecast and manage vaccine needs.  Last and most important, the report provides a contribution to our ongoing work on health technology assessment. Once again, my aim is to come up with a proposal that has clear benefits for all, including, above all, European patients. Finally, I fully agree with the need for a strategic breakthrough on disease prevention to reduce the need for medicines, as expressed in your report.  Let me conclude by expressing again my gratitude to Ms Cabezón Ruiz and the shadow rapporteurs.

As such, one of the basic objectives of the EU and the WHO, namely Sustainable Development Goal 3, is precisely to ensure that individuals (patients) have access to medicines. Obviously, access to medicines is dependent on the timely existence of medicines and their degree of accessibility for all citizens, without discrimination. But there are still major discrepancies between public health systems, as well as between pharmaceutical systems in the Member States, to which are added the challenges posed by the aging EU population.

In 2008 and 2015, Portugal and Spain signed protocols for consultation on cross-border projects, so this supposed agreement does not add anything new. Ironic is that the Spanish Minister of Environment now promises all transparency to Portuguese neighbors and friends, in a rhetoric that convinces no one, claiming that ATI is a pool that has no major environmental impact and that even improves the current situation.

But nothing is done. The problem is deeper anyway. The CAP is responsible for the agricultural disaster because it recklessly abolished customs duties and deliberately encouraged the concentration of farms.
