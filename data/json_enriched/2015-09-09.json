Ladies and gentlemen! The State of the Union debate is taking place today for the fifth time in the European Parliament. But this is the first time that it has been a debate that has been presented by a President of the Commission, who has been decisively influenced by this House. That is why this is also the first speech made by a President of the Commission named after a European election by this Parliament. I think it is rare that a speech has been more eagerly awaited in this House. We should also be proud today that this first State of the Union address is being delivered by a President of the Commission who has been elected to office under a new procedure, with a procedure that has made our Union more democratic. This House is also the place of European democracy this morning. We certainly face an epochal challenge in dealing with the refugee crisis, in dealing with the extremely difficult situation in some Member States, also in view of the part that Europe must have in helping to resolve the wars that are taking place on our doorstep and helping to put an end to them. The State of the Union debate is also an inventory of industrial relations between the Commission and the European Parliament. But it is also the hour when the two Community institutions can show together that they – the Community institutions – are ready to tackle the challenges in a spirit of Community action. Jean-Claude Juncker will present the State of the Union report here for the first time this morning. President Juncker, I am now giving you the floor to present the proposals you have for the European Union in the House of European Democracy – here in the European Parliament.

Herr Ratspräsident! Meine sehr verehrten Damen und Herren Abgeordneten! Es ist mir eine angenehme Pflicht und nicht nur eine Pflicht, sondern auch ein Vergnügen, als Präsident der Europäischen Kommission, zum ersten Mal in meinem kurzen Leben, eine Rede zur Lage der Europäischen Union hier in diesem Hohen Hause vorzutragen! Ich habe als Luxemburgischer Premierminister sehr oft – ich glaube zwanzig Mal – eine Rede zur Lage der Nation vorgetragen. Man hat mir nach der Rede immer bedeutet, dass sie gut war, im Tonfall, in der Rhetorik – inhaltlich gingen die Meinungen auseinander – aber dass sie zu lang war, und genau dies wird mir heute auch in diesem Hause passieren. Ich habe die Rede nicht unter normalen Umständen vorbereiten können, aus Gründen, die einige von Ihnen erahnen können. Aber ich werde mir alle Mühe geben, diese Rede zu einem guten Ende zu bringen. Diese Rede findet im Rahmen der Rahmenvereinbarungen statt, die die Beziehungen zwischen dem Europäischen Parlament und der Europäischen Kommission festlegen. In diesem Regelwerk heißt es, dass der Präsident der Europäischen Kommission in der ersten Septemberhälfte dem Parlament Rede und Antwort stehen muss zu dem, was im vergangenen Jahr vollbracht wurde, erledigt wurde, abgearbeitet wurde und zu dem, was in den nächsten Monaten ins Haus, also auch in Ihr Haus steht. Es geht um die Prioritäten für die zukünftigen Arbeiten der Europäischen Kommission und ergo auch teilweise der Europäischen Union.  Ich habe zu diesem Zweck dem Präsidenten des Europäischen Parlaments, Martin Schulz, und dem Luxemburgischen Premierminister, als Vorsitzenden der Ratspräsidentschaft, die Prioritäten der Europäischen Kommission in schriftlicher Form zukommen lassen, und ich habe diesen Brief auch Ihrem Hause zugestellt und diesen Brief begleiten lassen von einer Darstellung der Abarbeitung der zehn Prioritäten, die der Arbeit der Kommission vorstehen. Ich werde nicht alle diese Fragen heute hier behandeln. Ich verweise Sie – das ist zwar unhöflich, aber trotzdem notwendig – auf die schriftlichen Angaben, die die Kommission unter meiner Unterschrift und derjenigen des ersten Vizepräsidenten Frans Timmermans, dem Präsidenten und dem Ratsvorsitz hat zukommen lassen.  Und ich verweise Sie auch auf die begleitenden Dokumente, die diesen Briefwechsel verständlicher zu machen versuchen. Ich bin der erste Präsident der Europäischen Kommission, der nicht auf Umwegen, sondern auf direktem Weg, via Wahl und via zustimmendes Votum des Europäischen Parlaments ins Amt gekommen ist. Ich habe von Anfang an, auch bei meiner Bewerbungsrede hier im Europäischen Parlament am 14. Juni vergangenen Jahres, deutlich gemacht, dass die Kommission, der ich die Ehre habe vorzusitzen, eine politischere Kommission sein wird und ergo der Präsident dieser Europäischen Kommission aufgrund des prozeduralen demokratischeren Ablaufs seiner Ernennung auch ein politischer Präsident sein wird. Wenn ich sage politisch, dann meine ich ausdrücklich politisch im noblen Sinne des Wortes!  Nous sommes des hommes politiques. Nous ne sommes pas des politiciens. Je n'aime pas cette expression française qui parle de politiciens. Nous sommes, vous et nous, vous et moi, des hommes politiques. Wenn ich sage politisch, dann heißt das nicht, dass wir alles politisieren möchten. Aber ich möchte damit zum Ausdruck bringen, dass ich der strikten Auffassung bin, dass jetzt nicht die Zeit des Business as usual ist. (Beifall) Deshalb würde ich Sie sehr herzlich bitten, nicht darauf zu achten, wie oft ich das Wort „sozial“ in den Mund nehme – mein Herz ist voll von sozial –, nicht darauf zu achten, wie oft ich „nachhaltig“ sage, nicht darauf zu achten, wie oft ich „ökonomisch“, „finanziell“, „budgetpolitisch“ sage. Dies ist nicht die Stunde derartiger sehr oft hohler Reden. Dies ist die Stunde der Ehrlichkeit. Die Zeit für mehr Ehrlichkeit in Europa ist gekommen, und deshalb ist dies eine Rede über die großen offenen gewaltigen Fragen, mit der die Europäische Union konfrontiert ist. Und darauf werde ich mich jetzt konzentrieren. Unsere Europäische Union – obwohl ich nicht zu Pessimismus tendiere – befindet sich in keinem guten Zustand. Es macht keinen Sinn, dass der Kommissionspräsident vor den Vertretern der europäischen Demokratie, also den Vertretern der Völker Europas, hier in Schönmalerei macht. Die Europäische Union ist nicht in einem guten Zustand. Es fehlt an Europa in dieser Europäischen Union, und es fehlt an Union in dieser Europäischen Union. (Beifall) Das müssen wir ändern. Und wir müssen das jetzt ändern, in gemeinsamer Kraftanstrengung. Dies gebietet das Mandat, das Sie von den europäischen Wählern erhalten haben, das gebietet auch der Mandatsauftrag, den ich von diesem Hohen Haus erhalten habe. (Zurufe von der EFDD.) I don’t know why you are becoming nervous when you are speaking about the European Union. (Zurufe von der EFDD.) You can interrupt me from time to time. I will not at each time respond to what you are saying, because what you are saying is worthless. (Starker Beifall) Mr President, Ladies and Gentlemen, whatever work programmes or legislative agendas say, the first priority today is, and must be, addressing the refugee crisis. Since the beginning of the year, nearly 500 000 people have made their way to Europe. The vast majority of them are fleeing from Syria, the terror of Islamic State in Libya or dictatorship in Eritrea. The most affected Member States are Greece, with over 200 000 refugees, Hungary, with more or less 150 000, and Italy, with 120 000. The numbers are impressive. For some they are frightening. But now is not the time to take fright. It is time for bold, determined and concerted action by the European Union, by its Member States and by its institutions. First of all, before other considerations, it is a matter of humanity and of human dignity. And for Europe it is also a matter of historical fairness. (Applause) We are all Europeans here –  (A UKIP Member: ‘No!’) OK, I note that you think that you are not Europeans, well said, but not well done. This is not a time to take fright. It is a time of humanity and of human dignity. We Europeans – all of us, I thought before the interruption – should remember well that Europe is a continent where nearly everyone has at one time been a refugee. Our common history is marked by millions of Europeans fleeing from religious or political persecution, from war, dictatorship, or oppression: Huguenots fleeing from France in the 17th  century; Jews, Sinti, Roma and many others fleeing from Germany during the Nazi horror of the 1930s and 1940s; Spanish republicans fleeing to refugee camps in southern France at the end of the 1930s after their defeat in the Civil War; Hungarian revolutionaries fleeing to Austria and elsewhere – everywhere in Europe – after their uprising against Communist rule was suppressed by Soviet tanks in 1956; and Czech and Slovak citizens seeking exile in other countries – including mine – after the oppression of the Prague Spring in 1968. Hundreds of thousands were forced to flee from their homes after, and during, the Yugoslav wars. That was by the end of the last century – not centuries ago but by the end of the last century – in the last decade of the 20th century. Have we forgotten that there is a reason there are more McDonalds living in the United States than the entire population of Scotland? That there is a reason the number of O’Neills and Murphys in the U.S. exceeds by far those living in Ireland? Have we forgotten that 20 million people of Polish ancestry live outside Poland, as a result of political and economic emigration after the many border shifts, forced expulsions and resettlements during Poland’s so often painful history? Have we really forgotten that after the devastation of the Second World War, 60 million people were refugees in Europe? That, as a result of this terrible European experience, a global protection regime – the 1951 Geneva Convention on the status of refugees – was established to grant refuge to those who jumped the walls in Europe to escape from war and totalitarian oppression? We Europeans should know, and should never forget, why giving refuge and complying with the fundamental right to asylum is so important. The fundamental right to asylum is one of the most important international and European values. We should not forget that. (Applause)  I have said in this House and elsewhere in the past that we are too seldom proud of our European heritage and our European project. Yes, in spite of our fragility, of our weaknesses – our self-perceived weaknesses – today it is Europe that is sought worldwide as a place of refuge and exile. It is Europe today that represents a place of hope, a haven of stability in the eyes of women and men in the Middle East and in Africa. This is something – I have to say this here – to be proud of and not something to fear. (Applause) Europe today, in spite of many differences amongst the Member States, is by far the wealthiest place and the most stable continent in the world. Those who are criticising Europe – European integration, the European construction, the European Union – have to admit that this is the place of peace and that this is the place of stability and we should be proud of this. We have the means to help those fleeing from war, terror and oppression. I know that many now will want to say that this is all very well, but Europe cannot take everybody. It is true that Europe cannot house all the misery of the world. But let us be honest and put things into perspective. There are certainly a large and unprecedented number of refugees coming to Europe at the moment. However, they still represent just 0.11% of the total European Union population. In Lebanon, by comparison, refugees represent 25% of the population in a country which has only one fifth of the wealth we enjoy in the European Union. Who are we that we never make this kind of comparison? Who are we? (Applause)  Let us be clear and honest with our citizens, who are often worried: as long as there is war in Syria and terror in Libya, the refugee crisis will not simply go away. We can build walls, we can build fences, but imagine – without being demagogic – imagine for a second if it were you, your child in your arms, the world you knew torn apart around you, there is no price you would not pay, there is no wall you would not climb, no sea you would not sail, no border you would not cross if it is a war of barbarism and the so-called Islamic State that you are fleeing. We are fighting against Islamic State. Why are we not ready to accept those who are fleeing Islamic State? We have to accept these people on European territory. (Applause) It is high time to act to manage the refugee crisis because there is no alternative to this. There has been a lot of finger pointing in the past weeks. Member States have accused each other of not doing enough or doing the wrong thing and, more often than not, fingers have been pointed from national capitals towards Brussels. Brussels is always accused if Member States are failing. If Member States are not doing their job, Brussels, the Commission, the European Parliament, are accused of not doing their job.  (Applause) We could all – not all, but the majority of this House, myself and my Commission – be angry about this blame game. But I wonder who that would serve. Being angry does not help anyone. Blaming others does not help the refugees and the migrants, and the attempt to blame others is often just a sign that politicians, policy-makers, sometimes lawmakers, are overwhelmed by unexpected events. Instead, we should rather recall what has been agreed that can help in the current situation. It is time to look at what is on the table and move swiftly forward. We are not starting anew. Since the early years of this century, the Commission – not mine, the Commission of José Manual Barroso – has persistently tabled legislation after legislation to build a common European asylum system, and Parliament and the Council have enacted this legislation, piece by piece. The last piece of legislation entered into force only in July 2015, two months ago. Across Europe we now have common standards for the way we receive asylum seekers, in respect of their dignity, for the way we process their asylum applications, and we have common criteria which our independent justice systems use to determine whether someone is entitled to international protection. But these standards need to be implemented entirely and respected everywhere in Europe in practice. This is clearly not the case. Before the summer – not after the summer, but before the summer – the Commission started the first series of 32 infringement proceedings to remind Member States of what they had previously agreed to do. That is a matter of credibility. We are legislating and we are not implementing. It is a matter of credibility that Member States implement and respect commonly agreed international and European laws. (Applause)  A second series of infringement proceedings will follow in the days to come. Common asylum standards are important but they are not enough to cope with the current refugee crisis. The Commission, Parliament and the Council said in the spring that we need a comprehensive European Agenda on Migration. We proposed this as a Commission in May, and it would be unfair to say that nothing has happened since then. We have tripled our presence at sea. 122 000 lives have been saved since then. Every life lost is one too many, but many more have been rescued that would have been lost otherwise – an increase of 250%. We should be proud of that performance. Twenty-nine Member States and Schengen-associated countries are participating in the joint operations coordinated by Frontex in Italy, Greece and Hungary: 102 guest officers from 20 countries; 31 ships; three helicopters; four fixed-wing aircraft; eight patrol cars, six thermos-vision vehicles and four transport vehicles. This is a first measure of European solidarity in action, even though more will have to be done. We have redoubled our efforts to tackle smugglers and dismantle human trafficker groups. Cheap ships are now harder to come by, leading to less people putting their lives in peril in unseaworthy boats. As a result, the Central Mediterranean route has stabilised at around 115 000 arriving during the month of August, the same as last year. We now need to achieve a similar stabilisation of the Balkan route, which has clearly been neglected by all policymakers. The European Union is also the number one donor in the global efforts to alleviate the Syrian refugee crisis. Around EUR 4 billion have been mobilised by the Commission – that means by Parliament too – and Member States in humanitarian, development, economic and stabilisation assistance to Syrians in their country and to refugees and their host communities in neighbouring Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq, Turkey and Egypt. Indeed, just today we launched two new projects to provide schooling and food security to 240 000 Syrian refugees in Turkey and, by the way, I would like to applaud the efforts of Jordan, of Turkey and of Lebanon.  (Applause) These countries, far poorer than we are, are making efforts we should applaud and recognise in moral and in financial terms. We have collectively committed to resettling over 22 000 people from outside Europe over the next year, showing solidarity with our neighbours. Of course, this remains very modest – too modest – by comparison to the Herculean efforts undertaken by Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon who are hosting over four million Syrian refugees, but I am encouraged that some Member States are now showing their willingness to significantly step up our European resettlement efforts. This will allow us very soon to come forward with a structured system to pool European resettlement efforts more systematically. It has to be done and it will be done. Where Europe has clearly under-delivered is on common solidarity with regard to the refugees who have arrived on our territory. To me, it is clear that the Member States where most refugees first arrive – at the moment, these are Italy, Greece and Hungary – cannot be left alone to cope with this enormous challenge. (Applause) This is why the Commission already proposed an emergency mechanism in May – not now, back in May – to relocate initially 40 000 people seeking international protection from Italy and Greece. This is why today we are proposing a second emergency mechanism to relocate a further 120 000 people from Italy, Greece and Hungary. This has to be done in a compulsory way. (Applause) I call on Member States to adopt the Commission proposals on the emergency relocation of altogether 160 000 refugees at the Council of Interior Ministers on 14 September. We are not talking about 40 000, not 120 000, we are talking about 160 000. That is the number Europeans have to take in charge and have to take in their arms, and I really hope that this time everyone will be on board. No poems, no rhetoric, action is what is needed for the time being. (Applause) What is happening to human beings – we are talking human beings, we are not talking about numbers – coming from Syria and Libya today could easily be the case in Ukraine tomorrow. Are we making selections? Are we distinguishing between Christians, Jews, Muslims? This continent has had a bad experience of drawing distinctions on the basis of religious criteria. There is no religion, no belief, no philosophy when it comes to refugees and to those we let in. (Applause) Winter is approaching. Do we really want to have families sleeping in railway stations in Budapest and elsewhere, in cold tents during the night, or on shores on Kos? We are in charge of the winter period for those who have to flee their countries for the reasons I have mentioned.  Of course, relocation alone will not solve the issue. It is true that we also need to separate better those who are in clear need of international protection and are therefore very likely to apply for asylum successfully, and those who are leaving their country for other reasons which do not fall under the right of asylum. This is why today the Commission is proposing a common EU list of safe countries of origin. This list will enable Member States to fast-track asylum procedures for nationals of countries that are presumed safe to live in. The presumption of safety must, in our view, certainly apply to all countries which the European Council unanimously decided meet the basic Copenhagen criteria for EU membership – notably as regards democracy, the rule of law, and fundamental rights. It should also apply to other potential candidate countries in the Western Balkans, in view of their progress made towards candidate status. I am aware that the list of safe countries is only a procedural simplification. It cannot take away – and I would act strongly against that – the fundamental right of asylum for asylum seekers coming from Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Kosovo, Montenegro, Serbia, and Turkey. But it allows national authorities to focus on those refugees who are much more likely to be granted asylum, notably those from Syria. And this focus is very much needed in the current situation. A list of safe countries does not take away asylum rights from those people coming from the countries listed. That is important. We are not neutralising the Geneva Convention. Asylum is a right. (Applause) The countries on the list of safe countries have to know that, if they are taken off this list because fundamental rights are not ensured in these countries, they are losing their chance to join the European Union. These two things go together. Safe list, yes, but it is time we prepared a more fundamental change in the way we deal with asylum applications, and notably the Dublin system that requires that asylum applications be dealt with by the first country of entry. We need more Europe in our asylum policy. We need more Union in our refugee policy. A true European refugee and asylum policy requires solidarity to be permanently anchored in our policy approach and our rules. This is why, today, the Commission is also proposing a permanent relocation mechanism, which will allow us to deal with crisis situations more swiftly in the future. That means more swiftly than in the past.  A common refugee and asylum policy requires further approximation of asylum policies after refugee status is granted. Member States need to take a second look at their support, integration and inclusion policies. The Commission is ready to look into how EU funds can support these efforts, and I am strongly in favour of allowing asylum seekers to work and earn their own money whilst their applications are being processed. (Applause)  Labour, work, being in a job, is a matter of dignity. Those who are working are finding again the dignity they had before they left and so we should do everything to change our national legislation in order to allow refugees and migrants to work from day one of their arrival in Europe.  A united refugee and asylum policy also requires stronger joint efforts to secure our external borders. Fortunately, in the European Union we have given up border controls between the Member States of the Schengen area to guarantee free movement of people, a unique symbol of European integration and this Schengen system will not be abolished under the mandate of this Commission. (Applause) But the other side of the coin to free movement is that we must work together more closely to manage our external borders. This is what our citizens expect. The Commission said it back in May, and I said it during the election campaign, together with Martin, together with Guy and with… (Suggestions from the Floor) …no, no, I am not pointing at Mrs Keller; I was just thinking of Mr Tsipras. I am not confusing the two! José Bové est là? Oui, je l'ai vu tout à l'heure. Salut José! We need to strengthen Frontex significantly and develop it into a fully operational European Border and Coast Guard system. That is certainly feasible, but it will cost money. The Commission believes that this is money well invested. This is why we will propose ambitious steps towards a European Border and Coast Guard before the end of this year. A truly united, European migration policy also means that we need to look into opening legal channels for migration. But let us be clear: this will not help in addressing the refugee crisis we are currently in. But if there are more, safe, controlled roads opened to Europe, we can manage migration better and make the illegal work of human traffickers less attractive. Let us not forget that we are an ageing continent in demographic decline. We will be needing talents, talents coming from everywhere in the world. Over time migration must change from a problem to be tackled to a well-managed resource. To this end, the Commission will come forward with a well—designed legal migration package in early 2016. This is highly important. Migration has to be legalised. It is not sufficient to protest against illegal immigration. We have to organise legal ways to Europe. (Applause) A lasting solution will only come if we address the root causes, the reasons why we are currently facing this major refugee crisis. Our European foreign policy must be more assertive. We can no longer afford to be ignorant or disunited with regard to war or instability right in our neighbourhood. We have to find a solution. Maybe we are too weak to achieve a solution to the Libyan problem. We have to address the Syrian crisis in a more solution-oriented way. I call for a European diplomatic offensive to address the crises in Syria and Libya. We need a stronger Europe when it comes to foreign policy. I am very glad that Federica Mogherini, our highly determined High Representative – she is High Representative because she is highly determined – has prepared the ground for such an initiative with her diplomatic success in the Iran nuclear talks, and I would like to congratulate Federica on that extraordinary performance. (Applause) In order to facilitate the work of our High Representative, Federica, the Commission is today proposing to establish an emergency Trust Fund, starting with EUR 1.8 billion from our common EU financial means to address the crises in the Sahel and Lake Chad regions, the Horn of Africa, and the North of Africa. We want to help create lasting stability, for instance by creating employment opportunities in local communities, and thereby addressing the root causes of destabilisation, forced displacement and illegal migration. I expect all EU Member States to pitch in and match our ambitions. We need this emergency Trust Fund in order to prevent future crises. (Applause) And we need higher development aid budgets. I do not like the expression development aid – cooperation budgets. It is abnormal that Member States of the European Union are reducing their budgetary efforts when it comes to development aid. They have to be increased. (Applause) I do not want to create any illusions that the refugee crisis will be over any time soon. It will not and we have to be aware of that. But pushing back boats from piers, setting fire to refugee camps, or turning a blind eye to poor and helpless people: that is not Europe. (Applause) Europe is the baker in Kos who gives away his bread to hungry and weary souls. Europe is the students in Munich and in Passau who bring clothes for the new arrivals at the train station. Europe is those standing at the Munich railway station applauding and welcoming refugees.  (Applause)  The Europe I want to live in is illustrated by those who are helping. The Europe I do not want to live in is a Europe refusing those who are in need.  The crisis is stark and the journey, of course, is still long. I am counting on you, in this House – in the House of European democracy – and on all Member States to show European courage going forward, in line with our common values and history. Monsieur le Président, Mesdames et Messieurs les Députés, et pour beaucoup d'entre vous, très chers amis, je me rends compte que j'ai déjà dépassé le délai qui est normalement accordé au président de la Commission lorsqu'il parle de l'état de l'Union; mais vu l'état de l'Union, il me faut du temps et je voudrais donc dire quelques mots sur la Grèce, qui m'est très chère. Le débat que nous avons eu sur les problèmes grecs, qui sont aussi les nôtres, fut un débat difficile parce que je n'avais de cesse d'expliquer au Premier ministre d'alors que, dans la zone euro, il y a dix-neuf démocraties et pas seulement la démocratie hellénique. Les opinions publiques, les opinions parlementaires, les convictions des uns et des autres se reflètent aussi dans l'expression, notamment parlementaire, dans les dix-huit autres démocraties qui forment l'ensemble de la zone euro.  La Commission fut très souvent rudement attaquée par certains États membres pour s'être investie dans la solution, si j'ose dire, puisqu'il n'y a pas encore de solution définitive au problème grec. Je voudrais redire ici ce que je vous ai déjà dit lorsque je me suis présenté pour la première fois devant vous, à savoir qu'il est du devoir de la Commission européenne de veiller à l'intérêt général.  Ne pas s'occuper du cas grec eût été une faiblesse impardonnable, une erreur à répétitions multiples, si la Commission n'avait pas fait ce qu'elle a fait. Nous avons payé, moi d'abord, de notre personne puisque nous avons été attaqués par ceux qui savent toujours mieux que la Commission et le Parlement européen comment il faut faire. Je n'ai pas voulu laisser la recherche d'une solution au problème grec aux seuls soins des bureaucrates bruxellois, comme on dit vulgairement, stupidement et bêtement, bien que leur travail fût extraordinaire même pendant les vacances. Nous nous sommes attelés, Frans Timmermans, le vice-président Dombrovskis, Pierre Moscovici et d'autres à la recherche d'une solution au problème qui nous était posé. Certaines disent que la Commission et son président n'auraient pas dû dire que le grexit n'était pas une option. En effet, ce n'était pas une option. Il fallait dire sans cesse que le grexit n'était pas une option. Sinon, le grexit serait arrivé. (Applaudissements) J'ai dit à M. Tsipras et aux autorités grecques qu'il ne faudrait pas qu'ils considèrent cette phrase comme voulant dire que, de toute façon, ils seraient sauvés. J'ai dit à Alexis Tsipras que je n'étais pas le magicien qui sortirait un lapin blanc de son chapeau si rien n'allait plus. Non! Il savait, il devait savoir et il savait que le grexit était une option, mais pas une option à mentionner publiquement. Donc, sur ce point, nous avons fait ce que nous devions faire et j'ai toujours considéré, vous le savez, que le problème grec n'était pas seulement un problème de consolidation des finances publiques. Ce n'est pas seulement un problème de réformes structurelles, bien que tout cela soit très important, mais c'est aussi un problème qui a trait aux perspectives de croissance de ce pays, que l'Union devrait se réjouir de compter parmi ses États membres. Je n'ai pas aimé ces commentaires tout au long des derniers mois selon lesquels il fallait que la Grèce sorte de l'euro, sorte de l'Union européenne et soit considérée comme un pays qui ne serait pas sérieux. Les Grecs, surtout les Grecs à faible revenu, sont des gens qui travaillent et qui font tout pour que leur pays puisse progresser. Nous devrions d'ailleurs mieux respecter les efforts de la nation grecque que nous ne l'avons fait jusqu'à présent. (Applaudissements) Je voudrais que le programme sur lequel nous nous sommes mis d'accord soit respecté par tout gouvernement grec, passé, présent et futur. Si, cette fois-ci, les règles communément convenues ne sont pas respectées, la réaction de l'Union européenne et de la zone euro sera différente. Cette fois-ci, il faudra qu'on fasse ce qui a été convenu. Dans ce programme, il y a 35 milliards que la Commission est en train d'organiser pour relancer la croissance économique, et donc sociale, de la République hellénique et je voudrais que cette offre, qui n'est pas un don de générosité, soit acceptée par toutes les parties prenantes en Grèce.  La crise n'est évidemment pas finie avec la solution apportée au cas grec tant qu'il y aura 23 millions d'Européens au chômage dans l'Union européenne et plus de 17 millions dans la zone euro. La crise n'est pas terminée. Elle sera terminée le jour où l'Europe sera revenue au plein emploi.  Parfois, je me demande pourquoi un continent aussi riche que l'Europe prendrait ses distances par rapport à cette règle normale qui devrait être respectée par tous les hommes et toutes les femmes. Les jeunes d'aujourd'hui et les adultes de demain ont droit au plein emploi. Ne nous éloignons pas de cette ambition de faire de l'Europe un continent où le triple A social a toute sa valeur. Il faudra donc tout faire pour que l'Europe puisse revenir au plein emploi. Ce n'est pas impossible si nous le voulons.  (Applaudissements) Cela présupposera que nous restions fidèles à ce triangle vertueux: la consolidation budgétaire – essentielle, irremplaçable ou alternativlos, comme dirait une autre –, les réformes structurelles et l'investissement. Nous avons proposé à votre Assemblée et au Conseil un plan d'investissement qui porte sur 315 milliards. Ce plan d'investissement est en train d'être appliqué en détail et d'une façon générale. Je crois que tous ceux qui dirigent les pays européens, tous les acteurs économiques, les entreprises, les chefs d'entreprise et les syndicats doivent devenir des combattants, au nom de l'Europe, de la croissance.  Je ne voudrais pas que le plan d'investissement, qui porte malheureusement mon nom –pour des raisons de facilité, on a choisi de dire que le plan d'investissement est le plan Juncker afin qu'un responsable soit désigné en cas d'échec – soit un échec. Je voudrais que tous les acteurs économiques et sociaux et que tous les acteurs politiques s'impliquent dans l'application de ce plan d'investissement, qui est un plan pour l'Europe, pour l'emploi et pour la croissance.  (Applaudissements) Mais tout cela, Mesdames et Messieurs les Députés, n'est pas suffisant. Il faudra que nous déterminions la route, le chemin, la voie à emprunter et à suivre. C'est la raison pour laquelle nous avons proposé le programme des \"cinq présidents\" sur l'approfondissement de l'Union économique et monétaire. Je dis \"cinq présidents\" parce que j'avais choisi, non pas dans un moment de faiblesse autobiographique mais pour des raisons de principe, que le président du Parlement, en son nom personnel, devait être associé à la rédaction de ce rapport. Le Parlement européen, tout de même, est un parlement et faire comme si l'avenir de l'Europe et de l'Union économique et monétaire pouvait se faire sans la participation directe et immédiate du Parlement européen est un leurre. J'avais donc choisi d'associer votre président, Martin Schulz, à nos travaux durant lesquels il a présenté ses points de vue personnels. Je ne les ai pas tous appréciés, mais il a fait aussi entrer dans le débat interinstitutionnel les positions si souvent exprimées par votre parlement et notamment celles exprimées par notre ami Othmar Karas dont le rapport, qui porte à juste titre son nom, explique que la présence du Parlement européen dans le devenir de l'Union économique et monétaire devrait être plus prononcée qu'elle ne l'a été jusqu'à présent. Oui, il faut à l'Europe un gouvernement économique. Je ne le dis pas aujourd'hui pour la première fois. Je le dis depuis 1991, lorsque jeune ministre des finances, avec Nicolas Schmit – qui est d'ailleurs de toutes les combines dans mon pays et au-delà –, j'ai dirigé la conférence intergouvernementale sur l'Union économique et monétaire. Quatre personnes se prononçaient pour le gouvernement économique: Jacques Delors, qui reste un modèle, Pierre Bérégovoy, dont je ne cesse de pleurer la disparition, Philippe Maystadt, qui est là pour nous éclairer à chaque instant lorsqu'il le faut, et moi- même, qui suis toujours là puisque je suis un peu éternel dans cette fonction. Nous quatre étions en faveur d'un gouvernement économique de l'Europe. Nous voulions inscrire dans les traités les règles qui, économiquement, devaient gouverner la zone euro. Nous ne fûmes pas entendus par ceux qui réclament aujourd'hui que le gouvernement économique – wirtschaftliche Steuerung, en allemand – soit appliqué immédiatement. Welcome to the club. It was proposed 25 years ago.   Nous allons vous proposer, dans le cadre de cet approfondissement de l'union économique et monétaire, un système de garantie des dépôts. Je crois que ce système commun de garantie des dépôts est nécessaire. Nous allons certainement le faire sous la forme d'un système de réassurance, pas une mutualisation intégrale, mais il faut tout de même une dose de sécurité supplémentaire pour les épargnants et pour les déposants européens et nous y veillerons. Je suis en faveur de l'institution d'un trésor européen. Il faudra évidemment discuter de tous les détails, puisque c'est un slogan dépourvu de tout contenu précis, mais il me semble essentiel que la zone euro dispose d'un trésor européen qui prendra appui sur les moyens du mécanisme européen de stabilité. En ce qui concerne la politique fiscale, les politiques fiscales, la désunion fiscale de l'Europe, la Commission aura l'occasion de faire en sorte que le principe d'échange des informations en matière d'impôt direct soit rapidement adopté par le Conseil. Je garde la conviction depuis l'âge de 17-18 ans – même si certains pensent que je l'ai perdue provisoirement – que les bénéfices doivent être imposés dans les pays où ils sont réalisés. La Commission fera en sorte que ce principe de bon sens trouve application partout en Europe. (Applaudissements) Tout comme nous devons agir en faveur de cette règle simple qui a prouvé ses mérites et dont le non-respect a mis à nu ses défauts, il faudra que partout en Europe la règle retrouve toute sa valeur, à savoir que pour un même travail sur un même territoire, il faut un même salaire; c'est une ancienne règle qu'il faudra revigorer. (Applaudissements) Sous la conduite de la commissaire aux affaires sociales, Marianne Thyssen, nous avons proposé un socle européen de droits sociaux au cours du premier semestre 2016. L'Union européenne, ce n'est pas seulement la monnaie, l'Union européenne ce n'est pas seulement le cas grec, l'Union européenne ce n'est pas seulement l'Ukraine, l'Union européenne c'est aussi un socle commun de valeurs sociales que nous devrons adopter ensemble et nous le ferons! (Applaudissements) Mr President, I  have a serious problem because I know you would like me to stop, but I am in the middle of my speech.  J'ajouterai donc rapidement que, d'après moi, le Parlement européen doit rester le Parlement de la zone euro. Ne continuons pas ce débat! (Applaudissements) Je crois qu'il est nécessaire d'améliorer la représentation internationale de la zone euro. Il est anormal que dans les institutions de Bretton Woods, et notamment au sein du Fonds monétaire international, l'Europe se présente comme un poulailler, une basse-cour où tout le monde court dans la direction qui lui semble opportune. Il faudra que le président de l'Eurogroupe représente, et lui seul, la zone euro. Il faut une représentation unique au Fonds monétaire international! (Applaudissements) Il faudra que les recommandations par pays formulées par la Commission et le Conseil soient mieux respectées dans les États membres de la zone euro. Je crois que nous avons diminué au nombre de trois les recommandations par pays que nous avons proposées au Conseil. Il n'est pas logique d'exiger des États membres qu'ils entreprennent vingt réformes au cours d'une année. Ce n'est pas crédible, c'est idiot et c'est stupide! Nous nous sommes donc mis d'accord sur trois réformes à mettre en œuvre par les États membres. Mais il faut que ces derniers les entreprennent et qu'il y ait une appropriation nationale des réformes proposées par le Conseil et par la Commission. I would like to say a word on the United Kingdom because, when campaigning, I was advocating a fair deal with Britain and I am totally convinced that we will have a fair deal with Britain. I have established in the structures of the Commission a specific group for the negotiations with Britain under the leadership, by the way, of a British citizen who is a European. That is not a contradiction.  (Interjections from UKIP Members) I was hesitating between Jonathan Ford and Nigel Farage and then I made the choice, I went for Jonathan Ford – and Nigel of course will, of course, be his greatest supporter, because one is British and the other is British and European so you have to come together, and you will, of course.  Of course the United Kingdom and the British Government and British policymakers are right when they criticise the European Union for being too bureaucratic and for the overdoses of regulation. It is my Commission’s programme to reduce regulation and, under the leadership of First Vice-President Frans Timmermans, we are doing everything we can do in order to make sure that regulation in the European Union will be better. But that better regulation does not mean destruction, does not mean no rules, does not mean that the European Union should stand away from everything which has to be organised in a proper way in Europe. We have launched the digital single market and the Energy Union. We are, step by step, progressively completing the internal market – because the internal market is not complete. We are taking initiative after initiative in order to promote entrepreneurship in Europe. These are all requests of the British Government – and, more loudly than that, of the British policymakers. The problem is that this Commission cannot be asked to do that because this Commission is doing exactly that, and I would like our British friends to support the initiative of the Commission in that very field. The same applies to the need we see to conclude as many trade agreements with leading nations in the world, including the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP). I am in favour of the TTIP Treaty. (Applause and boos) But, as in the case of Britain, I am not in favour of giving up European standards and European principles. The freedom of movement of workers cannot be touched. The same applies to the Transatlantic Partnership Agreement. We have our basic values, we have our principles and these principles cannot be given up during these negotiations with the United States. I am strongly in favour – as is Cecilia Malmström, our excellent Trade Commissioner – of a maximum of transparency, but I am against publicly rehearsing negotiating positions of the European Union. The more we tell those we are negotiating with what we intend to do if our positions are not accepted, the weaker we are. In national negotiations I am in favour of transparency, but I am also in favour of seriousness, and negotiations have to be conducted in a serious way.  I should say something about Ukraine. We support the democratic efforts of the current President of Ukraine. We have to support this man because he has the courage of action, and in that country this is not an easy thing to do. Those who have doubts about our involvement and our engagement in the Ukrainian case will be proven wrong because we have offered to cover, in so many talks, to President Poroshenko, all the needs Ukraine was asking for, and we will continue in that way. We have lent EUR 3.41 billion in three network financial assistance programmes to Ukraine, we have helped to broker a deal that will secure Ukraine’s wind and gas supplies, and we are advising our friends there on the reform of the judiciary. I will do everything to enable the European Council to give visa-free travel rights to Ukrainian citizens. If the conditions are fulfilled, it has to be done.  As Guy Verhofstadt was saying months ago in this House, the Maidan worries were not only about democracy, about the membership of the European Union. People there, and people living in Ukraine now, do not want to have a country where corruption is playing the role it plays in Ukraine. The Ukrainian democrats want a corruption-free country and so we have to attend to them in that field.  I would like to say – because I am very attentive and I have these things on my radar all the time – to our eastern Member States, notably in the Baltics, that the security and the borders of EU Member States are untouchable. I want this to be understood very clearly in Moscow. The Member States of the Baltics and of other countries have to know that solidarity is not an empty word. We are there now and we will be there if ever this is needed. The Baltics, Poland and others – mainly Poland and the Baltics – are very important members of the European Union and they should not think that we would not be there if in any way their security and their borders were in danger. We have an obligation to protect, if needed, the security of everyone. (Applause) (Interjection from the floor: ‘With what army?’) I do not know if you meant the Luxembourg army when you said army. The Luxembourg army is an excellent army with 771 soldiers, including the Defence Minister. The Luxembourg army will not be a great help but others can be if needed. I wonder why I like your interruptions, but I like them, because they are inspiring. They remind me what I should have told you before. I will never forget the meeting I had, before being appointed, with Nigel Farage and his Group. It was very supportive, open and frank and not without humour which, by the way, is the only quality we share, but it is something! (Laughter) Could I have the permission of the President of Parliament to distribute the text on climate change, because that is important and I am running out of time. I have been speaking for 72 minutes and 15 seconds, so really I do not want to speak any more.  (Interjection from UKIP Members: ‘More!’) I have new friends!

The European Parliament is the place where you can meet everyone. Unity in diversity.  (Applause and laughter)  I would like to say a few words, given the time constraints we have, on climate change. The text of my speech will be distributed to a larger audience in the coming hours. I simply wanted to say that I think that we have to be very ambitious, as the European Union, on our way to Paris. I think we are making major efforts in the EU, probably not enough, but more efforts than others are delivering. We are tackling the root causes of the next migration wave in the coming decades if we address climate change problems in a proper way, because tomorrow we will have climate refugees and we have to be aware of that. We should not be surprised and astonished if the first climate refugees come to Europe. We have to act now because we do not have any time to lose. That is why I want the European Union and the Member States to be as ambitious as possible on our way to Paris. But I would like to say here that I do not think that the European Union should sign just any deal. The EU's priority has to be to adopt an ambitious, robust and binding global climate deal. That is a European duty and we have to fight for that and to raise our voice against those in our Member States who do not share that view. Europe is not neutral when it comes to climate change. Europe has to be an example and a model for others.  (Applause) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is the state of the Union but not in its entirety. I did not want to give you a poem about the European Union. At the end of a speech, which I admit was too long, although it was brutally cut short, I repeat to you: I believe that the European Union is not in a good state, but I also believe that it is not my duty to do nothing but criticise the state of the European Union.  We have also made a number of reforms over the past year that I believe are substantial. We have adopted, I want to talk about the Commission, a European agenda on migration. I do not accept that the Commission has been inactive on migration. Just this morning, I heard Bavarian but federal ministers on German television criticising the Absence of the Commission. I was on vacation, that's right. Weren't you on vacation? You were right! On my ten-day vacation, I worked for four days on the Greece file and three days on the migration file. The Commission had made proposals in May. We don't say it enough! We are not discovering today a problem that we discovered in May. Others are discovering this problem through terrible images. We knew him! (Applause) We have adopted a number of complementary measures to be taken in the internal market, particularly in the area of energy and the capital market. I warmly thank my colleagues in the Commission for the good agreement we have had. It is not obvious, those here who were Prime Minister know that the agreement within an executive knows its limits. At the Commission, friendship, collegiality and even complicity are very high. I am proud of the Commission that I have the honour of chairing because, during the first months of our mandate, we were able to send to the two legislators the major legislative and regulatory projects, which were among the ten priorities on which I was elected by this august assembly, an election of which I remain proud.  Not everything is perfect, we do not live in the best of worlds. The world would be a better place if we were better, and so that is the task we have to do.  Listen! I know the weaknesses of Europe, but I know what the enormous continental weakness would be if the European Union did not exist. So, old Europeans, let's not give up! Continue!

And I would like to say thank you for this political speech. A year ago, we elected a President of the Commission, who presented an analysis of the situation in Europe today and put clear proposals on the table. Thank you for that.  I would also like to start with the most pressing issue at the moment, the migration issue. When we were in Milan with the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, Mr Alfano, the Italian Minister of the Interior, was our guest, and he told a story: he visited a refugee shelter in the south of Italy and spoke to a family, a mother who reported that she had started in Africa with five children and had arrived in Italy with a living child. He reported that he looked into empty eyes, destroyed.  That is why it is important to make it clear when we talk about figures, behind each of these figures are people! That is why Europe must live up to its humanitarian aspirations. We must help people who are knocking on our external border, we must guarantee aid. As the President of the Commission said, if poor countries, such as Lebanon and Jordan, succeed, then a rich continent such as Europe must also be able to fulfil its humanitarian responsibilities. Ladies and gentlemen, we have heard and I would like to underline once again that, for example, the Slovak Prime Minister, Mr Fico, has said that he wants to accept only non-Muslims in his country, only 'Christians'. That is why I would like to make it clear once again, on the part of the Christian Democrat Group, for the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Group), that we in Europe are not proud of the fact that we have invented rights for Christians, For Christians. We in Europe are proud that we have invented human rights, and they must be defended no matter where someone comes from. In the last few days, there has been a lack of Europe, as we have all been able to read in the newspapers! I was allowed to give an interview in the Corriere della Sera a few days ago and then I received an e-mail from Franco Frattini, the former Commissioner for the Interior of Europe, who pointed out to me that ten years ago he had proposed the concept of safe third countries in the Commission and that it was not possible to win support from the Member States at that time. Ladies and gentlemen, what is failing here is not Europe, as we see from the Commission's proposals. It is not Brussels that fails, it is not Strasbourg that fails, but that national selfishness on this continent is failing!  Nevertheless, we must keep an eye on the realities. Last year, two-thirds of all people arriving in Europe were turned away under a constitutional procedure and were not accepted as refugees. That is why my group is also in favour of not losing sight of the issue of 'return', the question of external protection control, including safe third countries.  People expect us to apply and implement existing asylum law and to combat abuse. Ladies and gentlemen, that is the task of migration.  I would like to say a sentence on the second mega-theme of our parliamentary term, namely the economic situation on our continent. We need jobs, we need an economic future, especially for our young people. The internal market has been mentioned. It has always created growth and prosperity, and that is why we should be ambitious. We need free trade, we should not discuss free trade taking something away from us, but we should see that free trade, global free trade, has always helped us as Europeans.  We must fight against youth unemployment, which is why we expect the Commission's mobility package. I would also like to say a sentence to our farmers, who are currently working in difficult circumstances. We, as a European level, stand by our farmers and will help them to set the right priorities even in this difficult market situation.  And a final thought on the economic situation is still allowed on Greece. If you want to learn how to create a future, you should look to Ireland, Spain or Portugal. We have great growth rates there. And if you look at Greece, you can see that we have now lost months. We have also had tough debates here in Parliament about the future of Greece with Prime Minister Tsipras, but I say very clearly that he now deserves respect for his change of course, and he has made it clear that the country has no future without reforms and without a stable budget. And Politically, I can say that Tsipras has proved that left-wing ideologies have failed on this continent, and that is why Podemos is also backing down in Spain.  Ladies and gentlemen, there is still much to be said! With regard to the Ukraine issue, I would like to make it clear that we must not forget this conflict. We are open to the visa issues that the President of the Commission has indicated, and we obviously need more investor protection so that investment is also made in Ukraine in the stable regions. We cannot accept Putin's frozen conflict.  And on the United Kingdom, I would just like to send out the signal that we, as the PPE-DE, are open to the proposals. We believe that they can make Europe better and will engage constructively in the discussion. Ladies and gentlemen, one year Jean-Claude Juncker, one year Commission is a political commission. Mr President of the Commission, you have managed to focus on restricting Europe to the essential issues. You have managed to make progress in the political approach and, above all, to achieve results.  The best figure is that 1.65 million new jobs were created on this continent last year. And that is also linked to the work of the European level. Thank you very much. You have submitted an election programme, you are working on this programme and you will continue to have the support of your Group in the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats for this programme.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 6, "date": "2015-09-09.json", "name": "Gianni PITTELLA", "mepid": "4436", "text": "  , on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I see the empty chair of the President-in-Office of the European Council, rhetorically speaking, paradoxically who is causing the delays in European responses, and this contradiction must be resolved once and for all. You, on the other hand, Mr Juncker, are here, with pain in your heart, as Mr Schulz has just said. With his presence and his speech he gave a great test of love for the institutions. Thank you and thank you for your nice speech. I too will speak frankly about immigration, as you said, Europe must return to europe, rediscover itself as a project based on solidarity: refugees fleeing war must be welcomed. To those who say that Europe does not exist as a Community, as solidarity, I say: go to the streets and you will touch the solidarity of the citizens. There is often talk of the distance between the citizens and Europe. Today, Europe can bridge that gap if it learns from its people.  We must not be timid about immigration, the Commission is doing well: the permanent compulsory mechanism for the distribution of refugees is good; the dublin crossing is a good thing; our group is with you in this battle. Immigration is there for everyone, but there is another emergency: the social emergency. On this continent there is a silent secession that divides rich and poor. You, Mr President, have often spoken of a social triple A. We are asking you for concrete commitments on this. I. The rules in force must be applied and controls on abuse strengthened. II. Social dumping must be defeated, which is why we want an overall review of working resilience and also strong measures against the precariousness and monstrosity of zero-hours contracts; III., we want a commitment to tax justice, as you mentioned, taxes are paid where you make the profits and that means having a common tax base is a country by country reporting. IV. We cannot forget what happened in Greece. You don't forget that. This economic and monetary union is not working, we support your idea of putting into practice the report of the five Presidents as soon as possible, but it must only be the beginning. We must not overlook the indications that have come from the Pervenche Berés report adopted by this House, we also want to talk about fiscal capacity and there is the boulder of sovereign debt. It may no longer be fashionable, but for us Socialists and Democrats, the time has come to return to talking about Eurobonds. V. We must continue along the path of the investment plan, which must really support the European economy and society, an economy that needs to be rethought and must become sustainable and circular. For this reason, we cannot miss the meeting with the Paris Conference.  Finally, as President Schulz pointed out in his introductory speech, war is on Europe's doorstep. Syria, Libya, partly Ukraine, everywhere around the Eu ropean Union is war. Compared with a year ago, in foreign policy – thanks to Federica Mogherini – the Union has taken important steps, moving from an objective weakness to a recognised and esteemed presence, but we must attack the root causes of global imbalances, and here too Europe must return to europe, that is to say, invest in solidarity and cooperation between peoples, return to bet on Africa with a long-term agenda.  Mr President, you know better than I do that we will not have a second chance, if we do not act the crisis will be irreversible, European democracy will have to resume its greatness and centrality with regard to the hegemony of the market and the excessive financialisation of the unscrupulous economy. It is up to us to choose – I concluded – whether to be remembered as those who managed the decline or as the only ones who managed to reverse course!", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 7, "date": "2015-09-09.json", "name": "Syed KAMALL", "mepid": "33569", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Group. – Mr President, before I start I would like to address Mr Juncker and echo the President’s words in terms of paying tribute to him personally for his courage, and also his sense of duty, in coming here today to address us. Mr Juncker, we may not always agree, but actually I think we have to pay tribute to your courage and your sense of duty. Thank you very much. (Applause)  I am not softening you up for a number of blows, do not worry about that! Year after year I sit in this Chamber, and we hear a lot of rhetoric from all sides. After all, that is the point of Parliament: to discuss. We hear a lot of ideology, a lot of idealism. I hear some people say that only more Europe is the answer. I hear others say that the EU is the cause of all our problems, and I fear we will hear that same debate all over again today. That is why we never get anything done. That is why the EU is seeing crisis after crisis. I know that many of us from across the political spectrum came into politics because we wanted to help people, but in this Chamber we are paralysed in this debate and this continent by ideology and dogma. Dogma that has caused fair—weather EU policies, like castles made of sand that fall into the sea or eventually melt into the sea. At times, the debates verge on serialism, for example when you see someone walk down with an Angela Merkel mask. At other times what we need is realism. We need some euro realism and the migrant and refugee crisis is one example.  Many people on the edges of this Chamber deliberately seek to confuse economic migrants with refugees, either to let them all in or to keep them all out. But we need to be clear about the distinction: people running for their lives, seeking sanctuary as refugees. We need to understand what they are running from. For those not fully in persecution or famine, we have to understand that it is only human nature to want to seek a better life. But we must be clear, in that case, that the correct rules must be followed. There are currently legal migration systems that we have to adhere to. However, we also need to be honest with our voters. The effects of the war in Syria and conflicts in Libya, Eritrea, Ukraine and elsewhere will be long-lasting and those who say that there are easy solutions are just plain wrong. But in the EU, rather than trying to find common solutions, we now find our countries and institutions trying to find someone to blame rather than trying to find solutions.  Some countries are unilaterally rewriting the rules; others are clearly flouting them, undermining trust. But if there is one thing that the EU should be useful for, whatever our ideological views, surely it should be about bringing countries together to cooperate and to find solutions that we can all find together, and so let us sit around a table – and I do not mean just the countries of the EU. This is an international crisis that needs an international response. Of the four million refugees from Syria, 90% are in camps in Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey, and yet some Middle Eastern countries take absolutely no-one. Let us work out what each country can do to help those fleeing for their lives, but let us be clear: telling countries what to do, forcing a plan on them, only risks more finger pointing. It might make some of you feel better, but I fear it could actually make the crisis worse and push us further away from a solution, because different countries can help people in different ways: let us recognise that. Yes, some countries might wish to take migrants already in the EU. That is their choice, but others will rightly say that they want to help the most vulnerable in the camps around Syria.  We have an obligation to help the millions of people displaced by conflict, not just the thousands who managed to reach our shores. That is why some countries, including my own, are focusing their efforts on these camps and on the ground, tackling the vulnerable, delivering over a billion euros of aid to Syrian camps, helping hundreds of millions of African refugees and actually keeping our commitment of 0.7% of GNI to build an economic infrastructure in poorer countries around the world. Let us not dismiss that sort of assistance. Other countries can also make a contribution with more funding and assistance, setting up application centres closer to where people are fleeing from so that vulnerable people do not have to fall into the arms of the traffickers. Others can commit the hardware intelligence to take out the traffickers completely, and for all of us stabilising the situation will mean investing in resources to detain, swiftly process and return those who do not have a legitimate claim. In the ECR, we want a realistic, holistic and practical response. There should be no sacred cows if we are going to solve this problem together.  President Juncker, over the last year, we have seen an unprecedented amount of sticking plaster placed on Europe’s cracks, not least the euro crisis. We need to start finding some real solutions: we need to tackle these problems in realistic ways. The time to point fingers is over, and I hope there will not be any more of that today. It might produce headlines, but it will not produce solutions, so let us sit down together and work together. Europe does not need a new Iron Curtain; Europe needs iron will to discuss together, work together and find a solution together. I hope you will listen.

Maybe next year we can hold a slightly different debate, and perhaps invite the 20 heads of states and government. There is enough room on this side of the House. Mr Juncker does not have 90 minutes to speak in the Council during his State of the Union address. This would also enable Mr Tusk to be here, because we all accept now that there should be a permanent President of the European Council, and he has to be here. I know he is in the Middle East in Ramallah in Jerusalem, but he has to be in Europe, going from capital to capital to develop a common European policy on asylum for immigrants. That is his task for the moment. Here we come to the heart of the problem, namely the lack of political will and – I say to Mr Kamall – the lack of unity between the Member States. What Mr Kamall was defending here a few minutes ago is a system of ‘pick and choose your strategies’. This amounts to Britain doing it one way, Germany doing it another way and Hungary certainly doing it another way: with a fence and a wall. That is not the way to deal with such problems! A refugee crisis is the collective responsibility of the European Union, that is what is at stake. What we have to do is to stop, act and react. Our Member States are merely reacting, they are not acting. In April we got a strategy for the Mediterranean. What did we do? We increased the Frontex budget a little bit, thinking that would solve the problem. The problem was not solved! Fifty days later, there were all these refugees blocking the entry of the tunnel to Britain and what did we do? We gave a little bit more money for tents and for food for these poor refugees in Calais and we thought the problem was over and we could go on holiday. Well what did I tell you?  Then in Budapest there was the incredible sight of refugees being herded to the train station, treated without any respect. And then we say, ‘let them go, let us put some of them on trains so they can go to Austria and to Munich’. And we think the problem is over. This attitude is disgraceful for Europe because it is not the right way to treat refugees. (Applause) We have to recognise that some countries, Germany for example, are accepting their responsibilities. In Munich they accepted 20 000 refugees in five days. But some countries are saying that they will not accept them for five years and other countries are simply saying ‘no way, not for us’. Fortunately, in sharp contrast, thousands of ordinary people have shown solidarity, more solidarity than our national leaders in the Member States of the European Union. And so my message – not to you Mr Juncker, I apologise – for the Council in particular is: stop saying it is a crisis of Europe, it not a crisis of Europe. It is in fact a crisis of a lack of Europe! Let us tell the truth to the people. Dublin is not Europe. Dublin is the negation of Europe. All it is saying is ‘it is up to the Italians, it up to the Greeks to take responsibility’. The Commission took a very important step in May by sharing responsibility. I hope that the Council can accept, in a matter of days rather than months, a number of these proposals, including perhaps the idea of a legal migration system, because many people are saying that refugees and economic migrants are not the same. This can only be solved with a legal migration system, a blue card, rather than the 28 systems we have today in Europe. Like the Americans have a green card, we have a blue card. But the blue card in Europe is the 29th system, on top of the 28 existing systems. It is only Germany that uses this blue card. We have to change that, and I was pleased to hear Mr Juncker announce that in 2016 there would be a package on legal migration to solve that problem. In conclusion, the most important lesson that the Council can draw is that we cannot look away from a crisis in our neighbourhood. We will always pay the price for it. Do not think that we can have a conflict in the north of Africa or the Middle East and Europe can be unaffected since it is outside Europe. We are paying the price for this. We in this House were convinced that the Syrian war was not our problem. Numerous times we had debates here and people said ‘no, let us do nothing; there is no need to help the democratic forces’. Well we created two things: first of all the spread of Islamic State and, secondly, a huge refugee crisis. So we need to do something. If this debate concludes by merely repeating our point of view it will not be enough. We need a new initiative within the framework of the United Nations to end the bloodshed in Syria, to stop terrorism and to make Syria safe again for the refugees so that later on they can return to their homes. My plea to Mrs Mogherini, my plea to the Presidency of the Council, is that we should call on our representatives on the UN Security Council to launch such a new initiative as soon as possible to end the conflict in Syria because it is the only sustainable solution for this crisis.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 9, "date": "2015-09-09.json", "name": "Gabriele ZIMMER", "mepid": "28248", "text": "  Mr President, I would like to like to sanendour sto -- on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. Mr President, Mr Juncker, I would like to thank mr Juncker for his work on this On behalf of my group, too, we sincere condolences and, with it, our sympathy for you as a human being, as Jean-Claude Juncker. I would like to assure you of this here, and I believe that I am not alone in the European Parliament. But now to the speech that has been made here today, which was about describing the state of the European Union and addressing the most important key issues. On the issue of migration, I would simply like to put two things beforeme: it is well known that Zeus kidnapped the Princess of Asia Minor. And if we are honest, we would have to admit that this princess was the first migrant in Europe. It has given us the name for the continent. These are our roots for us as Europeans. You yourself pointed out earlier that it would be an illusion to believe that the refugee problem would end in the foreseeable future. Yes, it is true: it is an illusion. We are dealing with one of the biggest problems in this century, and I assume that it must be treated equally as our fight against climate change, as a whole problem, as a global problem. We must act together on this. I have understood your proposals primarily as a message, as a message to all those who – whether in this Chamber, whether in the responsibility of the Member States – take covertly or even clearly and openly racist positions and believe that Europe must be further closed off, that Europe must not be open to the world, and that Europe must above all take care of its own interests and must return itself, above all, to national and nationalist positions. We will examine your proposals in detail, some of which seem to me to be a good step, some do not go far enough. But we will have the opportunity to move on in the discussion. In any case, I support all the demands that we must create legal immigration opportunities, that there must be a fair, solidarity-based attitude and that we do not stop at a quota system that overrides the individual life needs of people. Family reunification and the like must be taken into account. We take at your word that it is a question of enforcing the Geneva Convention on Refugees, of the personal right to asylum, that nothing can be scaled back here, on the contrary, that they must be defended. That will remain our ambition throughout the debate. But I would now like to address Greece and our way of trying to resolve the problems within the Union, particularly because a connection is being imposed here. It is precisely on the refugee issue and on the Greek question that it culminates. The images of the island of Kos and other Greek islands have made it clear how closely connected there is with whether a state can function at all, whether a state can assume its responsibilities, including towards refugees. Taboos have been broken in dealing with Greece, its people and its government. Demonstratively, a country was humiliated. It has also become clear that the round of euro finance ministers has taken over the government in the European Union. The Heads of Government are the leaders, the European Parliament is sitting in the auditorium, and the Commission has, if I may say so, become a dissled from the government's point of view. We must put an end to this state of affairs! And if you take serious action here, you have us on your side, because we do not want the Heads of Government to impose their nationalist and petty views here and, ultimately, to destroy the European Union. (The President asked Mrs Zimmer to conclude) You said that we should not count every word. I did not do that in your speech. But I've looked at what's in the priorities. There is nothing about the social priorities in the priorities. That is our problem. Please change that! Change that because this is our common mission.

Mr President, Mr Juncker, I am whole-hearted with you in the difficult times you are going through today. I am also whole-hearted with you in the ambition you have wanted to show for the European Union. The European Union, ladies and gentlemen, is founded on the values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, including the rights of people belonging to minorities. These values are common to Member States in a society characterized by pluralism, non-discrimination, tolerance, justice, solidarity and equality between women and men. That is the union we are discussing today. What kind of union are we talking about when the only growth that has returned to Europe is that of exclusion, precariousness, poverty, inequality and unemployment while the Member States are fighting tax wars? What kind of union are we talking about when, in the face of the refugee tragedy, some heads of government have nothing but barriers and refoulement in their mouths? What union is referred to when the European Council becomes the theatre of the expression of national selfishness, from mutual resentment to the humiliation assumed of a head of government by his co-ordge colleagues? Ladies and gentlemen, the Lisbon Treaty, which I was quoted at the time, speaks to us of an ever closer union between the peoples of Europe. In fact, I see her more and more narrow in heart and mind. Yet the Union described by Article 2 of the Treaty I was calling you is alive and well. It lives by all those who, where they live, take the measure of the humanitarian, social, environmental and democratic state of emergency to stand up and act together. I think of all our fellow citizens who invent daily ways of life in accordance with the ideal of equality and dignity and respecting the limits of our planet of which we are an integral part. I am thinking of those teachers who give our young people the tools to forge their lives. I am thinking of those farmers who want to win the bet of feeding us in harmony with the land that saw us born, those researchers who draft just and lasting solutions to the problems of our time. I am thinking of those entrepreneurs who dare to think outside the box to implement these solutions. I am thinking of those bankers who want to put finance back at the service of society. I am thinking of those investors who are turning their backs on fossil fuels. I also think of these artists who, against all odds, want to awaken in us the most beautiful thing in the human soul. I also think, of course, and these are often the same, to all those who resist the dictatorship of short-term profit at the price of the exploitation of man and nature by man. In this time of humanitarian emergency, as you said, Mr President, is there a greater demonstration of this European spirit than the magnificent citizen impulse that we see flourishing in several Member States to welcome and help refugees fleeing death and destruction? The European Union, dear friends, is the opposite of retreating into oneself in the rejection of the other. Wanting Europe against the rest of the world is inevitably, in the long run, pitting Europeans against each other. The Union is solidarity in openness and it is the actors and actors of change who today bring this ideal and these values to life. It is with them, Mr Juncker, it is with them, ladies and gentlemen, that we must build alliances, build bridges, re-create hope. If Europe loses them, Europe is lost. So, in the face of the challenge of refugees and migrants, remember, it was a year ago, Pope Francis in this assembly said that Europe has two responsibilities: to welcome and act on the causes of conflict.  Mr Juncker, you have had the right words and you have said them since last spring. You didn't wait. The proposals you have made here point in the direction: yes, we need a permanent distribution key for refugees in Europe. Yes, we need legal paths to the European Union, which are the only way to put an end to the deadly business of smugglers.  This Parliament, Mr President, and I conclude, can also propose concrete and immediate action in response to the emergency. On behalf of my group, I am submitting a very concrete proposal: this parliament in which we meet today, we occupy it less than 50 days a year. For the remaining 300 days, the 750 offices of MEPs that are heated and equipped with individual showers remain empty and unnecessary. We therefore propose that this second home of the The European Parliament, fully equipped, is used for the temporary reception of migrants and refugees and that plenary sessions are held in Brussels for the necessary time. (Applause) This, ladies and gentlemen, is a concrete measure that would allow our Assembly to join the gesture to the word and demonstrate through practice our commitment to the principles of solidarity and human dignity.

As I warned in April, the European Common Asylum Policy sets its terms so widely as to say that anyone setting foot on EU soil can stay: I said it would lead to a flow of biblical proportions, and indeed that is what we are beginning to see. This has been compounded by Germany saying last week that basically anyone can come. It is a bit too late now to draw up a list, by countries of origin, of who can stay and who cannot stay. All they have to do, as they are doing, is throw their passports into the Mediterranean and say they are coming from Syria. As we know, the majority of people who are coming – and the Slovakian Prime Minister has been honest enough to say so – are economic migrants. In addition, we see, as I warned earlier, evidence that ISIS is now using this route to put their jihadists on European soil. We must be mad to take this risk with the cohesion of our societies. If we want to help genuine refugees, if we want to protect our societies, if we want to stop the criminal trafficking gangs from benefiting as they are doing, we must stop the boats coming – as the Australians did – and then we can assess who qualifies for refugee status.

Mr President, it is simple to sum up in one word the state of the Union: the crisis.  First, the economic crisis, which is killing our industry and our agriculture.  Then comes the diplomatic crisis. As always, the European Union has a finger on the seam of the pants in front of NATO, in Ukraine, Syria, Libya, to the great misfortune of those countries that you have destroyed and the nations of Europe overwhelmed by an unprecedented influx of illegal immigrants and Islamists. Let me express my great concern at the crazy injunctions that you have just issued to the States: 160,000 illegal immigrants to be compulsorily distributed as early as next week and you are threatening financial sanctions having the recalcitrant states, as if we were talking about common offenders. People can't take it anymore, they don't want it anymore, they who are already overwhelmed by unemployment, poverty, immigration. There is no pressure on the wealthy petromonarchies of the Middle East, who have these migrants on their doorstep. The peoples of Europe are being asked to accept immigration, this demand of the big employers. As for our farmers, they will appreciate to benefit from you only crumbs: 500 million, while we reserve 4 billion euros for illegal immigrants. Finally, the democratic crisis, of course, which is accompanied by the clear demonstration every day that your monster despises peoples, curtails their freedom, acts against their interests. So instead of thinking, you hop on your chairs like cabris, bleating: \"Europe, Europe, Europe\", as if increasing the cause of a problem could reduce its effects.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President of the Commission, commissioners, on behalf of the Council, I would first like to thank President Juncker for his State of the Union address, for his lucid analysis of the situation, for his vision of what is at stake for the Union, for saying things as they are, but above all for his important proposals and for his initiatives in the various areas. You are right, Mr President, this is not the time for routine but for the courageous, exceptional and innovative actions which call upon this capacity in our Union, which we Europeans are capable of at truly historic moments. Alas, we are living in a historic moment, as we experienced, for example, at the time of the fall of the Wall and the reunification of the European continent.  Europe is facing a major crisis that requires it to have a real capacity for action, a real political will, a solidarity that characterizes the European spirit. President Juncker highlighted the migration and refugee situation. This is a critical moment for the Union. Recent events confirm this and are on a scale we did not suspect. They seemed to surpass us, they challenge our values and, it is true, put our instruments and rules to the test, and certainly do not allow us, today, to procrastinate or procrastinate. In the context of the Justice and Home Affairs Council in July, the Presidency has devoted all its efforts to the implementation of measures concerning, in particular, a temporary and exceptional relocation and resettlement mechanism. I do not hide from you that this task has not been easy and has not yet been sufficient. We need to go further and faster. The new proposals presented today by President Juncker are an important contribution to the ongoing process and further Council meetings are planned. We must all be aware of the urgency and the need to join forces and not divide ourselves. Europe is perfectly capable of controlling this refugee crisis which, as has been said, represents 0.11% of the population, which is not huge. Europe is able to control this crisis if it acts in accordance with its values, exceeds the downturns, in short, if it is able to show a genuine common political will.  The Presidency is working tirelessly to find solutions with all Member States. It will do everything to bring them together in close cooperation with the institutions, first and foremost, the Commission of course. This will not happen without everyone's efforts, and I will come back to it in a moment during our debate on migration and refugees in Europe. Mr President, we have had the opportunity to present the other priorities of our Presidency, which are very much in point with those mentioned by the President of the Commission. It is true that we must not forget the issues of unemployment, the recovery that must be encouraged and supported, and the problem of youth unemployment. We have an investment plan that must now be implemented courageously and quickly, as the chair said. The Luxembourg Presidency is very keen - on this point, I know that we are on the same wavelength, Mr President - to the deepening of the European social dimension. I listened well to what you said about social dumping: \"for the same job, the same salary\". It is important that free movement is preserved, and in order to preserve it, we must of course create this balance between social rights on the one hand and economic freedoms on the other.  We support the Commission in its efforts to stimulate the internal market, particularly in the digital sector, but it is also true that this sector will transform not only our industries and services but the way we work and, therefore, our labour market. It will therefore have a fundamental impact on the qualifications and skills that we also need to deal with urgently.  In terms of major challenges in sustainable development, i.e. the fight against global warming by mobilizing our efforts in the run-up to decisive international conferences, COP 21 is a crucial event because the stakes are high.  Let us not forget, and this has been said, that this refugee crisis is fundamentally the result of other terrifying conflict crises in the European neighbourhood. Besides, when I look at our neighbourhood, we cannot say that it is very stable. It is a neighbourhood that is plagued by crises and conflicts. Europe must therefore be an international player. Politics (CFSP) plays a fundamental role with Federica Mogherini and I believe that we must commit ourselves but also invite the international community to engage, especially at the UN level.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 16, "date": "2015-09-09.json", "name": "Herbert REUL", "mepid": "28225", "text": "   Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for his First of all, thank you very much, Jean-Claude Juncker, for making it clear that Europe is more than any project, but that there is a concern, that it is fundamental, that it is about values. And perhaps this refugee problem is an opportunity to put it back in the spotlight a little bit. There is history, there are orders, there are values. That is why we must help, not only in words, but also in concrete terms. It is also true that the Member States certainly still have a great homework to do. It is also right – and I am also grateful for this – that it has been pointed out that there is a second page, namely safe countries of origin. It is also necessary to ensure that repatriation is organised, to combat smugglers. It is also true that it has been pointed out that the issue is complicated and that it is not just done with such an answer. For example, even with legal immigration, legal immigration does not solve these problems, but that this is also seen in a differentiated way. Thank you for that. Now the time was too short, and therefore I was missing something. I did not have the part that must give the answer as to how we actually finance this huge challenge and how we ensure that the citizens of Europe follow this path. This will only work if prosperity takes place in Europe, if full employment is organised. This is not just a problem for Greece. That is why we should also find another opportunity to reflect on: how do we organise growth in Europe, what about the internal market, what about our regulations, what about our energy prices, what about the question of promoting business, what about the question of promoting innovation and research? I just asked these questions, I didn't have more time. But the concern is an important prerequisite if we want to solve the other big problem.

This kind of crisis can only be solved by real European solutions.  So, do you have this tragedy unfolding on our borders with a humanitarian crisis out of proportion? The only solution is a real European asylum system. Do you have this increasing pressure of migration across our borders? Yes, the only solution is a real European migration agenda and stronger European development cooperation. Do you have these mounting tensions in our labour markets? You need to come back, as you thought, to an agenda for full employment in Europe, and the investment plan is certainly the main engine for this purpose.  But can we say that all Member States have the conditions to implement such an agenda? I do not think so. I do not think so as long as the euro zone is an area of divergence and not an area of convergence. That is why your plan of completing the economic and monetary union is also so important.

It yields to the dictatorship of urgency and, sometimes, emotion at the expense of long-term choices. Finally, it does not care about the application of its own decisions.

Vielen herzlichen Dank, Herr President! Ich habe so lange geredet, dass ich den presidialen Wunsch, der mir zugetragen wurde, jetzt nicht zu lange zu antworten, in vollem Umfange respektieren werde. Ob mir das gelingt, ist eine andere Frage. Auch der Kommissions, president darf vom Presidenten of the European Parlaments unterbrochen werden. Ich ordne mich der Befehlsgewalt of the President dieses Hauses gerne unter. Ich wollte zwei, drei Sàtze - vielleicht auch vier oder funf - der Debatte nachschieben und zuerst einmal darauf hinweisen, dass es nicht stimmt, dass die Ratspràsidentschaft und der Rat hier nicht vertreten gewesen w.ren. Es ist ein luxemburgischer Minister yesterday - Arbeitsminister, lange Jahre zust-ndig for Migrations-, also auch Integrationsfragen. Wenn es in der luxemburgischen Regierung jemanden gibt, der wei, worber hier geredet wird, dann ist es der hier anwesende Ratspresident. Ich bin ihm auch dankbar dafar, dass er hier ist. Zweitens, weil ich zu Verteidigungsreden aufgelegt bin: Es ist nicht korrekt, den Ratspresidenten, Herrn Tusk, zu kritisieren, dass er nicht hier ist. Ich bin ja nicht sein Sprecher. Aber wo war Herr Van Rompuy denn in den letzten Jahren, als diese Debatte stattfand? Dies ist eine Debatte zwischen der European Kommission und dem European Parlament, und so ist sie auch festgelegt in den Vereinbarungen zwischen Kommission und Parlament. Herr Tusk, mit dem ich mich in den vergangenen Wochen 'ber meine Rede lange unterhalten habe ' die entsteht ja nicht einfach so, wenn sie einfach so hette entstehen messen, w're sie 'berhaupt unter den gegebenen Umst-nden nicht zustande gekommen Die Turkei hat doch etwas mit dem Problem zu tun, 'ber das wir yesterday reden. Die Anwesenheit von Tusk in der Turkei ist wichtiger als die Anwesenheit des Ratspràsidenten in einer Debatte zwischen der Kommission und dem European Parlament. (Zwischenruf) Doch, das ist so. Ich habe mit dem Presidenten des Europeischen Rates diese Debatte vorbereitet, er hat seinen Besuch in der Turkei intensiv mit mir vorbereitet, und ich mechte ihn yesterday ausdr-cklich ausnehmen aus der Kritik, die hier vorgetragen wird. Ich finde die nicht berechtigt und der Sachlage absolut nicht angemessen. Since some have mentioned the problem of Greece, I wanted to say that this 35 billion scheme, which the Commission has proposed, is obviously fuelled by the Structural Funds. Greece, under all governments, has not been able, for lack of administration and lack of sense of state, to absorb the funds that have been made available to it. What the Commission has done, under the chairmanship of Vice-President Dombrovskis, is to bring together all the Commission's administrative energies and human resources to help Greece absorb the funds over a very short period of time and according to co-financing rules that differ from those that were in force previously to enable it to do what it did not do for years and should have done. , including in recent months. On this subject, I could expand indefinitely.  I accept a lot of criticism. I am not saying that the programme that was negotiated is an aesthetic example to be replicated, but still, for the first time, as I promised the European Parliament, we have done a social impact study of the Greek programme. It was not mentioned. Not a word! If the Commission had not done so, you would of course have rightly criticised it for not doing so. We did it about Greece. It needed a political look. Do you really think that the question of whether a higher VAT rate is applied to restaurants and food chains is a technical or political issue? It was political, so we decided as politicians. It is still incredible, you must know - and if you do not know it, it is because you are not told - that the President of the European Commission had to make the basic and common sense demand to reduce the Greek defence budget. The Greek government had not proposed it. I have proposed on behalf of the Commission that the shipowners sector should be imposed in a fair and correct manner. The Greek government had not proposed it. I, a conservative and reactionary Christian Democrat, was still very surprised to have to make a two-hour argument against the Greek Prime Minister to demand that Greece properly tax the richest rather than the victims of the crisis. It was me! It was not Mr Tsipras. Yes, I talked about honesty; it's never \"real\" since you listen to one and not the other. I do not want to dwell on the Greek case, because otherwise you will tell me that I intervened in the Greek domestic policy debate, which I do not want to do. I salute, for the rest, good many of the remarks that Mr Tsipras made towards me, much more polite than yours, at his press conference in recent days.  Yes, the Commission is part of the former troika, but I say to you that if the Commission had not been there, the adjustment programme that would have emerged would have been much more burdensome than the one which, thanks to the Presidency of the Commission, now appears to be the most nuanced of the programmes we have concluded so far.  I would also like to pay tribute here to other countries. Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Latvia have shown, with supporting evidence and analysis of the results, that when you make the right reforms, your results are better than if you did not.  With regard to the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, I have heard what has been said. I'm not naïve!  Also, ich bin nicht naiv, wenn es um das Freihandelsabkommen mit den USA geht. Ich sage nur: Wir brauchen dieses Freihandelsabkommen. Die Bedingungen, unter denen dieses Freihandelsabkommen zustande kommt, und der Inhalt der Verhandlungen, die zurzeit stattfinden, sind ja Sache nicht nur der Kommission, sondern auch der Mitgliedstaaten. Aber diese Einstellung, dass wir ab initio sagen: \"Dieses Freihandelsabkommen brauchen wir nicht,\" dieser Darstellung kann ich mich beim besten Willen nicht anschlieen. Wir sollen anst-ndig verhandeln und auch durchverhandeln. Aber wir brauchen dieses Abkommen, und wir werden es auch haben zu Bedingungen, die dem europeischen Geist und den europeischen Prinzipien absolut entsprechen. Zur Landwirtschaft mechte ich noch etwas sagen, weil ich dies in meiner Rede nicht sagen konnte. Aber das wird Ihnen irgendwann irgendwo von irgendwem ausgeteilt werden. Ich fehle mich den europeischen Landwirten sehr verbunden. Ich habe immer zu denen geh-rt - auch als freherer Premierminister und auch als Finanzminister -, die die gemeinsame europeische Landwirtschaftspolitik verteidigt haben, weil Europa ohne die Bauern, ohne die Landwirte, ohne die Winzer, ohne die Landschaftspfleger nicht das Europa Wir derfen die Bauern jetzt nicht im Regen stehen lassen! (Beifall) Die Europeische Kommission wird das ihre dazu beitragen, dass wir diese Milchkrise - das ist eine echte existenzbedrohende Krise fer die Milchbauern - so schnell wie meglich beheben kunnen. Erste Vorschlàge haben wir gemacht, und wir hàren jetzt auf Rat und Parlament, um weitere Vorschlàge machen zu kunnen.

Even as Europe suffers an unprecedented social, agricultural, diplomatic and economic crisis, the Commission is forcing Member States to take in \"migrants\" who have been turned into 'refugees', who will become permanent. The solution would have been to act courageously and go to Syria or Iraq and fight (as Russia is about to do) the terrorist group Islamic State. The peoples of Europe no longer want these policies, especially since nothing is being put under pressure on the wealthy petromonarchies to take in refugees as well.

The words spoken today by the President of the Commission rightly emphasise the delicacy of the moment we are going through. It has some effect to hear Juncker say that 'Europe is missing and there is no union in this European Union'. In recent weeks there is a lack of values of solidarity without which the very idea of Europe is lost and there is a lack of responsibility and awareness that only together can we be able to manage situations, such as that of migratory flows, which are now structural. Today, the Commission takes on many of the reflections that characterised President Renzi's speech on the occasion of the opening of the Italian Presidency.

This influx is obviously the clear result of the crazy destabilization policies carried out for several years in Syria and Libya, encouraged by the EU and THE RPS officials in France.

The refugee crisis is a priority for the European Union because it is a test for our humanity. However, there is a need to make a distinction between economic and war migrants. To say that all migrants are economic is wrong and in line with populist policies that must not be supported in Europe. However, opening the doors of the European Union to all is also not right. Unfortunately, Europe does not yet have a strong enough foreign policy as other superpowers in the world. Even in solidarity, we must not forget about other important issues to which the Union is obliged to pay attention.  The Juncker Plan should be seen as a plan to revive an economy that will benefit everyone, both the population of the European Union and war refugees who need our protection.

Today we see how mass movements and demands for democratization of authoritarian regimes in North Africa and the Middle East have been, for the most part, a prelude to new and renewed conflicts. Worse, developments in many countries in this large area have extended the list of so-called failed states. Persecuted people, refugees, are becoming more repulsive to many European environments, and their rights are increasingly scarce. The war in Ukraine has, no doubt, become a turning point in the European security system. In the event of a further deterioration of the economic and security situation in Ukraine, a wave of refugees from the European east can also be expected.

As reality shows, the CAP and its market-oriented liberalising trend, with the progressive abandonment of all public regulatory instruments, with emphasis on the end of milk quotas, has benefited agriculture and farmers at all, leading only to the sinking of the prices paid to production and the bankruptcy of thousands of farms. It is therefore a matter of concern that european governments and, in particular, the Portuguese government, which approved the end of milk quotas a few months ago, are not able to assume the need for a thorough review of the CAP and merely adopt in haste and under pressure from the struggle of European farmers a €500 million aid package which falls far short of what is needed.

Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, we have just listened to President Juncker and we all know that the situation, which was already very difficult before the summer, has taken on dramatic proportions with record numbers of refugee inflows on the three main routes: central Mediterranean, eastern Mediterranean and western Balkans. The current situation is different from the previous ones in its magnitude, the very rapid sequence of developments on the ground and the confusion in which they occur. The pressures on our reception capacities, our linguistic and administrative capacities are considerable, but beyond the numbers and institutional considerations, it is elementary to remember, in this debate, that the situation is, above all, revealing human tragedies, all different, which affect people and affect families.  In the face of such a complex situation, there is no simple answer. The situation requires a firm and coherent response from Europe that combines responsibility on the one hand and solidarity on the other. In addition, we must implement a sustainable common migration policy.  We must be prepared in the most hurry, while preserving the future and preparing global and sustainable solutions. Given the external dimension of the problem we are facing and given its impact on Europe, the Member States and the relations between them, it is essential that we realize that we will not be able to manage the situation by moving in scattered order. I can only repeat what I have already said in the previous debate. Our first concern will be people and their safety. It's a moral obligation. This obligation also falls to us under international law as well as to all other state actors present in the conflict zones from which migration movements originate or through which they transit. Second, we will need to ensure a dignified welcome for all those who could benefit from the international protection regime. I would just like to briefly recall what the President of the Commission has said about the thousands, the tens of thousands of Europeans, the European citizens who have shown a tremendous outpouring of solidarity. I believe that this illustrates Europe's capacity for solidarity and it also shows, in my opinion, a fine formula of the German President of this Europe of Enlightenment, ein helles Europa, as ein helles Deutschland. I believe that this is the Europe that we support, that we love and that we must move forward.  It will also be necessary, of course, to put in place reception capacities that are up to the challenge, both within the territory of the Union and in third countries. It will take a common effort to do this, which will not be without budgetary implications and this concerns you, of course, first and foremost. It should be remembered that on the Balkan route, the vast majority of people are eligible for international protection. On two occasions in recent months, heads of state or government have addressed the complex challenges of migration and refugees. They rightly called for the development of a comprehensive approach, focusing on three key dimensions that must move forward in parallel: relocation and resettlement, return, readmission and reintegration, cooperation with countries of origin and transit. During the month of July, the Council made progress on relocation and resettlement, and since we are already talking about emergency tools, I would like to take this opportunity to thank your Parliament for adopting the Keller report today. This adoption allows the Council to adopt next Monday the decision to relocate and, above all, and most importantly, to start relocating people who have arrived since 15 August.  But let's be clear, this is insufficient in the face of the scale of the crisis and the human tragedies we are experiencing. And that is why I welcome the Commission's presentation of these new proposals which take into account these developments and the scale of the phenomenon. I can assure you that, in the weeks and months ahead, the Presidency will do all it can to move forward on all the proposals. That is why the Presidency has convened an extraordinary Justice and Home Affairs Council next Monday, 14 September, which will review all the measures to be taken. I will not go into detail here, but there are immediate priorities: the implementation of access points (hotspots), the strengthening of the effectiveness of our return policy and our readmission instruments and above all the fight against against the smuggling of migrants by smugglers.  At the international level, we must work to strengthen cooperation with our partners in managing migration flows, particularly with Africa, the Western Balkans and Turkey. In this effort, each Member State and the Union must make their contribution in a spirit of responsibility and sharing because Europe must find a solution that touches on all issues and problems, one that truly addresses the challenges we face.  I don't hide the differences. We have stories, we have situations, we have different traditions between the Member States, but we now have a duty to overcome obstacles and focus on what we have in common. What we have in common is stronger than the differences that separate us.  (Applause) In this context, we are also counting on the active contribution of the European Parliament and I am pleased to be able to listen to your debate which will be reflected in the discussions in the Council.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 80, "date": "2015-09-09.json", "name": "Frans TIMMERMANS", "mepid": "129141", "text": "   First Vice-President of the Commission. – Mr President, I do not have to speak for a long time, because President Juncker has given you the full explanation of the plans of proposal of the Commission. I just want to use this opportunity, when three institutions are coming together to talk about this issue, to call upon the European Parliament to strongly support the Commission’s proposals today. That would be a clear signal in the preparation for the Council on Monday, where we know that some Member States still have a number of steps to take before they can agree with the Commission’s proposal. The stronger Parliament can be today in coming out with its position, the better we are prepared for the Council on Monday. There are those who sell the illusion that simply by closing all the borders and sending everybody back we could solve this problem. There are also those who maintain that by simply opening all the borders and letting everybody in we could solve the problem. These are illusions. They have the advantage of being clear in terms of proposals, but the disadvantage of being completely impossible in terms of practicality. Closing the borders and sending everyone back would mean that we take leave of our most fundamental values as Europeans. It would also mean acting in clear violation of our legal obligations. Opening the borders and letting everyone in would mean that we would put an end to the European social model as we know it, because it could not support people coming from all over the world in great, endless numbers.  For that reason, we need to make a clear distinction between those who deserve our solidarity because they flee from war and persecution, and those who might have genuine feelings about seeking a better future but should not abuse the asylum system to attain that goal. To do that, we need a combination of solidarity and responsibility: solidarity with those who need refuge, solidarity with the States who are now burdened to excess because they are the States of first arrival, notably Greece, Italy and Hungary. There needs to be European solidarity with these States – solidarity with the refugees and solidarity with the States in Europe who need it today.  That is the basis of our proposals, but also a call on responsibility: the responsibility to better guard our borders; the responsibility to make a swift registration of those who arrive at the borders so we can distinguish between those who have the right to asylum and those who do not; responsibility to create a list of safe third countries so that we can be swifter in returning people who have no right to stay; responsibility to organise the reception of refugees in a way that respects their human dignity. The combination of all these things is what the Commission proposes.  Let me end on this, before handing the floor to Federica: what we do today, and what we will be doing next Monday, is closely linked to the destiny of Europe – not just of the European Union – but to the destiny of Europe as a community of values, where we need to respect what we see is being done by countless European citizens today. We need to respect the basic humanity that makes me so proud of being European.

Words are important, I believe, and the refugee crisis we are facing – not only us, but the region and the world – puts our deepest values, and indeed our identity, to the test. It is a moment of truth, to see if we are really Europeans and if we are really a Union. That is what it is about: our responsibility to protect the lives of human beings, and human rights and solidarity among Member States and towards those in need. But this is also a test for our international credibility. Do not think that we can go around the word promoting human rights if we do not guarantee the highest asylum standards inside the Union. Do not even imagine that we can promote peace and cooperation among parties currently at war if we do not accept the others inside our own communities, and if we do not manage to find unity among ourselves. Our external credibility depends largely on our internal coherence and consistency. We have to be aware of that. Do not imagine that there is only an external response to the crisis, just as there cannot be only an internal response to the crisis. The two dimensions of our action – and of our identity and our response – reinforce one another or weaken one another. This is the truth, like it or not, and we have to face it. To be credible, preaching well is not enough. We must act well, we must act fast, and we must act unitedly. Today, we are presenting a communication setting out the way forward for all the external action needed to address this crisis. We all know there is no magic fix to the crisis around us, and most of the external action we can take – and we are taking – will give results in the medium and long term. Still, it is important that we do act now. I know it is difficult for politicians to explain the reason for taking actions that will pay back, in some cases, in years, but if we do not do that responsibly, generations coming after ours will face the same problem again and again. Let me say that our external action finds us united for once. While this is not enough, because we also have to find internal unity on domestic policies, it is crucial for our action. The first priority is saving lives. Commission President Juncker outlined how much we have stepped up our work in this respect, noting the many lives that it has thus been possible to save. The second task is addressing the root causes, and I will come back to that. The third, and it is just as important, is to fight smugglers and traffickers of human beings, not only at sea but all along the routes, because this is a security issue too. The financial flow around the criminal organisations and networks can finance all kinds of activities potentially relevant in terms of European and international security. Our strategy has been clear and consistent since the beginning of our mandate. We cannot focus only on the last mile of the tragedy: we must also consider all the steps of the refugees’ odyssey. Most of the people we see today coming to Europe are fleeing from conflict and persecution. This is the first issue we need to address. Four million have fled Syria. Between Syria and Iraq, more than 10 million have left their homes and are internally displaced. Let me say one thing: we have rightly focused in recent months on minorities in need of protection in the Middle East – Christians, Kurds or Yazidis – supporting their right to stay on the land, and go back to the communities, where they have been living for centuries. But let me also say clearly that it is not sufficient to protect them only when they are far away from us. We also have a duty to protect them – and all their fellow countrymen – when they become close to us. The long-term answer obviously is putting an end to the conflicts and the wars, facing the threat of Daesh, starting processes of national reconciliation. The deal we reached with Iran, although primarily a non-proliferation deal, can open the way to new possibilities, and the work in this direction, with all our international and regional partners and all the international and regional powers, has already started. Secondly, we are working with the international community – mainly with the UN agencies, with the countries of origin and transit and those who host an impressive number of refugees. We have mobilised almost EUR 4 million in humanitarian and development aid to assist displaced Syrians within Syria itself and in Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey and Iraq. There is a very specific case, which is Libya: not a country of origin, but a country of transit, and, more than that, an open corridor. That is why, as you know very well because we have debated it several times in this Chamber, so much daily and nightly effort is being invested, with the UN and Special Representative Bernardino León Gross, in trying to achieve a national unity government in Libya that could allow us to partner the Libyan authorities in the management of this corridor. Let me say too that it is going to be very important – and we are looking very much in this direction – to work to the south of Libya. If we focus only on the Libyan sea border, forgetting about the Libyan land border, we will never manage to solve the issue of the corridor. That is why I have started an unprecedented dialogue with the countries of the Sahel, and in particular – although not exclusively – with Niger. Today, as you know, we are putting forward a proposal for a trust fund for Africa to promote economic opportunities, development, security and better management of migration in a context of equal partnership with the African countries and our partners. The institutions will provide EUR 1.8 million to this fund and I expect the Member States – all of them – to do their fair share. You cannot ask for international cooperation at European level and then not put up the money for it. Remember this when we come to discuss the budget. (Applause)  We have to show coherence in our decisions. A regional trust fund for Syria has already started in recent months, and the first contract opened through the fund deals with schools and education. Let me stress this, because I believe that – as we see Syria losing an entire generation to war and exile – we have to invest in Syrian children. That is an investment not only for the future of the country and the region but also for our security, because it is the best investment we can make against terrorism and radicalisation. Thirdly – and I shall finish – we are fighting those who trade in human life: the smugglers’ and traffickers’ networks. We are doing this in partnership with countries of transit and we are doing this in the Mediterranean. Our naval operation in the Mediterranean Sea has now fulfilled the objectives of the first phase. We gathered intelligence and information on the smugglers’ routes, assets and strategies. In this first phase alone, and in the space of just five weeks, we identified 16 cases in which we would have been able to go after the smugglers, bring them to justice and capture the vessels. That is why I proposed last weekend in Luxembourg, where the Defence and Foreign Ministers were meeting, that we move to Phase 2 on the high seas, in full observance of international law, and I asked Member States to contribute to the mission, because this is also an opportunity for us to show that, when we have political will and a sense of urgency and unity, we can use the military and security tools that we already have to hand. But there is something else of which I am proud: that in these very first weeks of common action in the Mediterranean we have saved the lives of 1 500 men and women at sea through our operation. This is not the main purpose of the operation but it is an important component of it. With regard to the way forward, we will have the Valletta Summit on migration in November, bringing together leaders of the European and key African countries – those that are part of the Khartoum and Rabat processes as well as the African Union Commission and the Economic Community of West African States Commission. We will also have the high-level conference on the Western Balkan route, bringing together EU Member States, Western Balkan countries and Turkey. Both have to be addressed with the same degree of attention and urgency. To conclude, we need to realise as Europeans that this is not just a time for emotion: that is the easy part. Let me be cynical: as politicians we are not asked to express our emotions; we are asked to take decisions that are consistent and coherent with our emotions, and to be strong in so doing. Emotions are not enough. We need to act and this is the time.

The President of the Commission was clear, and I want to be clear, too. The management of migration is a crash test for Europe and for the Union’s credibility. I want to express my thanks to both First Vice-President Frans Timmermans and Federica Mogherini for their opening remarks and for the excellent cooperation we had throughout the last month in putting together this ambitious and much-needed package. Today’s package is our response to an unprecedented refugee crisis happening right in front of our eyes. As the refugee crisis around Europe becomes bigger, our answers need to become bolder, more comprehensive and more ambitious.  This is the Europe we want. This is the Europe we must have. So today we are putting forward four very concrete measures that in the short- and medium-term can help tackle all the major challenges we are confronted with. The significant increase in arrivals over the summer cannot be managed by the Member States of entry alone. To address this migration we need a coordinated European approach. That is why we are now proposing to relocate 120 000 people fleeing war, persecution, oppression and chaos from Italy, Greece and Hungary according to a distribution scheme. This new proposal comes in addition to the measures tabled before the summer to relocate 40 000 persons from Italy and Greece. I expect that a vast majority of the Members of this House will vote in favour of this proposal later today and will also support in the future the new temporary relocation scheme. At the same time we have to learn the lesson that the current crisis is teaching us. Europe is not well-equipped to manage sudden and extraordinary surges of refugee inflows. We need structural solutions to face such events in the future so that we can systematically support Member States and guarantee protection for those who are really in need. That is why we propose establishing a permanent crisis relocation mechanism by amending the Dublin Regulation. In parallel with increasing our support to guarantee shelter for those in need of protection, we have to make sure that those who do not have the right to stay in the European Union are promptly returned.  As a first step, Member States shall be in a position to steadily process unfounded or unlawful requests so they can devote their human and financial resources to legitimate requests, filed by those who urgently require international protection. That is why we are putting forward today the introduction of an EU list of safe countries, including the Balkan countries and Turkey. In 2014, nationals from these countries submitted over 17% of the total of 562 000 applications filed in the European Union. These requests put a heavy burden on the European Union’s national asylum systems, while the vast majority of them were clearly unfounded. By including these countries in the list of safe countries of origin, the examination of the applications for international protection will be fast-tracked. This will increase the efficiency of asylum systems, and will allow Member States to devote greater resources to protect those in need and to return the applicants of unfounded requests faster. Currently Europe has a very low rate of return: around 40% of third-country nationals. This undermines the credibility of our migration policy. We therefore also present here today a European return programme aiming at fostering a clean-cut return policy. This communication is the occasion for the Commission to set out a list of actions to support greater operational cooperation among Member States and to stress the need to find leverage in our relations with third countries so that they readmit their nationals. I really count a lot on your support to implement this package as you have done, and I have to commend once again this House for being very supportive from the very beginning of our efforts to adopt a common European migration policy. I count on you and I thank you very much for the support you have provided thus far.

I note full convergence between the positions that the parliamentary group that I chair has expressed and the proposals that Commissioner Avramopoulos mentioned just now: the four points of the package. I have to say, sometimes I think that the immigration dispute is a little surreal: let us put in place, let us build walls on the sea; we do, we put barbed wire and we stop thousands of men, women, fleeing war, but what are we talking about? These things are only for propaganda, does anyone really think that this will solve the issue of refugees or immigration? But let's not kid ourselves, this is just a tactic, propaganda to take votes. If we're serious, we have to get serious. The proposal presented by the European Commission is a serious proposal, which addresses the issue of the emergency, which establishes a permanent system, which is therefore ready to take action when there are other crises. Unfortunately, there will be other crises.  Then there is also the issue of economic migrants, which we must address seriously and rigorously, understanding the needs of society and the labour market in the various European countries. There is the problem of controls, which must be done in a serious way, with common rules, with common times – not that one country takes 90 days another country takes 3-6 months to ascertain the appropriateness of the asylum application. And then there is all the talk to be made, about the initiatives to be taken on Africa, which I mentioned earlier, to which Vice-President Mogherini and Vice-President Timmermans returned.  And foreign policy: the stabilisation of North Africa, the action that is being taken in Libya is fundamental, all the talk about Syria. They are non-nations, they are non-states, from where we necessarily flee, any of us would flee if we were in those conditions. We have a duty to have an all-out strategy, without demagoguery, with great realism, but with great seriousness. Now it is only a question of approving it.

It is us, the EU, which introduced a directive on carrier liability that makes it completely illegal for any airline or shipping company to take on board anybody that does not have a visa. This is a vicious circle, a Catch-22 situation, and we are responsible for changing it.  We must review the existing asylum legislation in Europe and adapt it to this century to provide for legal and safe routes to get here.

We will put forth all the effort necessary to implement the decisions already taken and make sure that Member States apply the common rules, and of course we will count on support from Parliament in these endeavours. This migration will last; that is a fact. The package adopted by the Commission today is only a step to better manage migration. We also have to work on integration of the refugees we welcome. This is essential for European cohesion. A successful integration policy is the most efficient tool against secondary movements. Cooperation with third countries and opening legal avenues to Europe is also essential. This goes hand-in-hand with the war we have declared on unscrupulous migrant smugglers. Member States have agreed on an EU resettlement scheme. We have never before reached 22 504 places in the European Union. We therefore have to build on this success and take even more initiatives in the future to open legal ways to come to Europe. Finally, protecting and defending our borders is crucial. We will launch a wider reflection to reinforce management of our borders and ambitious solutions.  Let me thank this House for the overall support.

A change in name could destabilize an already extremely difficult and complicated situation, and destabilize Israel in mediation attempts. Also, the same could unintentionally give legitimacy to the terrorist organisation Hamas, which holds the Gaza Strip.

Justified steps to maintain them will result in a continuous and significant reduction in the amount of marine fish fish fished. Therefore, the common fisheries policy should pay much more attention to sustainable fish farming, i.e. aquaculture, and in particular freshwater fish farming. A significant number of fish ponds in Hungary are located in Natura 2000 sites. These farms do not pose any threat to the natural assets of these areas. Moreover, in many cases it is precisely because of our closed-system fish ponds that they have created or preserved individual wetland associations.

Justified steps to maintain them will result in a continuous and significant reduction in the amount of marine fish fish fished. Therefore, the common fisheries policy should pay much more attention to sustainable fish farming, i.e. aquaculture, and in particular freshwater fish farming. A significant number of fish ponds in Hungary are located in Natura 2000 sites. These farms do not pose any threat to the natural assets of these areas. Moreover, in many cases it is precisely because of our closed-system fish ponds that they have created or preserved individual wetland associations.

Therefore, the common fisheries policy should pay much more attention to sustainable fish farming, i.e. aquaculture, and in particular freshwater fish farming.

Moreover, in many cases it is precisely because of our closed-system fish ponds that they have created or preserved individual wetland associations.

Justified steps to maintain them will result in a continuous and significant reduction in the amount of marine fish fish fished. Therefore, the common fisheries policy should pay much more attention to sustainable fish farming, i.e. aquaculture, and in particular freshwater fish farming. A significant number of fish ponds in Hungary are located in Natura 2000 sites. These farms do not pose any threat to the natural assets of these areas. Moreover, in many cases it is precisely because of our closed-system fish ponds that they have created or preserved individual wetland associations.

It is also clear from the report on the new Protocol that, in order to maintain marine fish stocks, the European Union is being forced to impose appropriate restrictions on sea fishing. 30% of the earth's seas are overfished and marine fish stocks are at risk. Justified steps to maintain them will result in a continuous and significant reduction in the amount of marine fish fish fished. Therefore, the common fisheries policy should pay much more attention to sustainable fish farming, i.e. aquaculture, and in particular freshwater fish farming. A significant number of fish ponds in Hungary are located in Natura 2000 sites. These farms do not pose any threat to the natural assets of these areas.

Considering that this protocol is of particular importance to developing countries as it is a vehicle for global economic growth and also considering that it should enable small businesses to access new export opportunities, while offering consumers a wide range of products, I have spoken in favour of this text.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 931, "date": "2015-09-09.json", "name": "Mireille D'ORNANO", "mepid": "124750", "text": "  In writing.

We all know it in theory, but it is not applied in practice, and until it is clarified, until it is clearly and simply said what the capacity is, there is no point in these quotas, because they should be considered not against 150 000 or 160 000, as currently offered, but should be estimated against about 100 million, as is the population of Africa and the Middle East.

This report on the Council's proposed decision to introduce interim measures in the area of international protection for the benefit of Italy and Greece aims to encourage Member States to come together to respond to the challenges of migration. It supports the Commission's proposal on the binding relocation measure, which includes a key to the distribution of refugees among Member States, on the basis of the principle of solidarity and the sharing of responsibilities. It also goes further by proposing to increase the number of refugees to be relocated (50,000 at least, compared to 40,000 for the Commission).

It is important to share the burden that this crisis has provoked with Greece and Italy, both of which have to confront new emergencies on a daily basis, and to support a just relocation of refugees within the EU. Furthermore – and this is my ceterum censeo – I believe that the euro must be abolished.

The central means of discharge will be a European-organised distribution of quotas among the EU Member States. The report is problematic for a number of reasons. Firstly, the concept of the quota is currently unenforceable due to a lack of technical requirements. Enforcement of existing rules of the admission procedure is hardly successful. The Schengen system does not allow for long-term control of internal borders. Secondly, the report calls for refugees not to be assigned to a country against their will. As a result of this rule, only a few countries with attractive social benefits are targeted. Thirdly, the very generous German policy is creating false incentives and, moreover, is in breach of European law. States that have not been involved or consulted at all should now support this policy by quota. Many are unwilling to do so.

The Schengen system does not allow for long-term control of internal borders. Secondly, the report calls for refugees not to be assigned to a country against their will.

The rapporteur welcomes the proposal, pointing out that the Member States of the European Union must form a united front to address the challenges posed by migration, and that the solution must be based on solidarity and a fair sharing of responsibilities, especially with those Member States that receive the largest number of refugees. As the 40,000 numbers were based on last year's refugee population, and this year the number of refugees has soared, he proposes to increase the number to 50,000. It takes a position in favour of a mandatory quota for the distribution of asylum seekers between Member States and an improvement in the quality of resettlement. As a lesson from the Maltese pilot resettlement project, it underlines that, in order to ensure successful resettlement, it is worth taking into account, to the extent possible, the preferences of refugees for the country of destination and attaching critical importance to information and consent. It draws attention to the fact that the Commission announced in its Agenda on Migration that it would present a legislative proposal for a permanent resettlement scheme under the codecision procedure by the end of 2015, and recommends that Parliament take the initiative in this regard and present an own-initiative report if the Commission does not come forward with such a proposal.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hu", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1241, "date": "2015-09-09.json", "name": "Cláudia MONTEIRO DE AGUIAR", "mepid": "124734", "text": "  in writing.

The central means of discharge will be a European-organised distribution of quotas among the EU Member States. The report is problematic for a number of reasons. Firstly, the concept of the quota is currently unenforceable due to a lack of technical requirements. Enforcement of existing rules of the admission procedure is hardly successful. The Schengen system does not allow for long-term control of internal borders. Secondly, the report calls for refugees not to be assigned to a country against their will. As a result of this rule, only a few countries with attractive social benefits are targeted. Thirdly, the very generous German policy is creating false incentives and, moreover, is in breach of European law. States that have not been involved or consulted at all should now support this policy by quota. Many are unwilling to do so.

The Keller report, referring to the Commission proposal of 27.5.2015, aims to improve the situation of refugees from Syria and Eritrea, who have an average recognition rate of more than 75% in the EU, and to relieve the first host countries of Greece and Italy. The central means of discharge will be a European-organised distribution of quotas among the EU Member States. The report is problematic for a number of reasons. Firstly, the concept of the quota is currently unenforceable due to a lack of technical requirements. Enforcement of existing rules of the admission procedure is hardly successful. The Schengen system does not allow for long-term control of internal borders. Secondly, the report calls for refugees not to be assigned to a country against their will. As a result of this rule, only a few countries with attractive social benefits are targeted. Thirdly, the very generous German policy is creating false incentives and, moreover, is in breach of European law.

In this text, it is planned to guide this policy according to the objectives set out in Horizon 2020, to facilitate european financing of local projects and above all to improve coordination between the EU and local authorities. That is why Member States are being asked to speed up decentralisation.  As the rapporteur points out, urban policy is in no way within the EU's competence. However, this project lays the foundations for a European urban policy, including the implementation of a timetable. The European authorities therefore want to grant themselves new powers as usual, which would further limit the scope of action of the States.

Cities are true engines of economic development, ensuring growth and employment, acting as catalytic centres for creativity and innovation. At the same time, urban areas face many economic, social and environmental challenges, to which the European urban agenda can provide concrete solutions. The objectives of the agenda should focus on specific priorities that have the capacity to deliver measurable results in the development of smart cities and the low-carbon and socially inclusive economy.

However, I voted in favour of promoting through the many financial instruments (such as Integrated Territorial Investments, Community-Led Local Development, etc.) and necessary participatory investments, to promote a more rational model of sustainable development in the urban areas of the European Union that create synergies not only with each other but also with their rural environments.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "GUE/NGL", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1434, "date": "2015-09-09.json", "name": "Jill SEYMOUR", "mepid": "124950", "text": "  in writing. ‒ I voted against this as I do not agree with giving more power to the EU Commission, which I believe this report calls for.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "EFDD", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1435, "date": "2015-09-09.json", "name": "Siôn SIMON", "mepid": "124948", "text": "  in writing. ‒ I voted in favour of this report as it acknowledges that although there is no explicit EU competence on urban development, there is a broad range of EU initiatives which impact towns and cities directly.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1436, "date": "2015-09-09.json", "name": "Branislav ŠKRIPEK", "mepid": "124927", "text": "  in writing ‒ I voted against the resolution in line with the group's position.

I want to focus on the following issues: What space does the EU have to act in urban policy? How does EU policy currently affect cities that should have an impact in the future?  How can EU urban policy coordination and coherence be improved? It is important to point out that in the European Union almost half of Europeans live in cities under 100 000 inhabitants, and the Commission's predictions show that today's cities will grow into \"megacations\" by 2050. The expected increase in the population in cities poses challenges for the direction of economic development, administrative structure and decision-making in growing cities.

Since I come from košice in the east of Slovakia and I know the surrounding towns very well, I can declare very responsibly that these towns are also experiencing problems that are associated with relatively high unemployment, serious problems in transport, their growth, lack of amenities and public services, and the reduction of citizens' quality of life.

In European urban centres, which are the driving force behind the exchange of information, as they contribute as much as two thirds of GDP, barriers to growth and employment must be removed and linked more closely to the formulation of European policy. Cities only participate in policy-making to a small extent, but this can be improved by their early involvement in political processes, for example through consultations and exchanges of best practice and experience, and the introduction of a assessment of the territorial impact of policies on cities, which will improve the practical feasibility of the measures.

It therefore seems obvious to support the idea of creating an 'urban agenda', which will be the backbone of the EU's urban policy. Cities are the flywheel of the economy, they make up the majority of European GDP, they are educational and scientific centres. This leading role of cities is also associated with many problems, such as high population density, communication difficulties, the large number of pollutants emitted into the atmosphere and large disparities in the living standards of the population. The urban dimension of EU policy should take these aspects into account and take into account local and regional specificities, which can best be understood by casting a decisive vote in formulating the objectives of local authorities. We should use all available financial tools, both existing ones such as Horizon 2020 and those that are just emerging, such as the European Fund for Strategic Investments, to make cities as friendly as possible, including for people with special needs – the elderly or people with disabilities.

Syria, Yemen, Libya: the list is long. Still, whatever the competing pressures might be, I strongly believe that we cannot put aside the Middle East peace process. It is crucial for the Israelis and for the Palestinians, and it is also crucial for regional peace and security. It is crucial for the international community. Further deterioration on the ground is happening at the moment, whether in Gaza, Jerusalem or the West Bank, and this has a deeply negative impact on an already-troubled region. The fact that this is the oldest conflict does not make it any less relevant. On the contrary, in a regional situation which is becoming increasingly worrying, this is the piece of the puzzle that we have to look at if we want to start somewhere. We all know that the conditions for relaunching final-status negotiations are not in place at this moment. There is a deep lack of trust on both sides and wide gaps on what a final deal should look like. But, as we have seen on Iran, with bold thinking, with a creative approach, patient diplomacy and an openness to compromise, and with a lot of teamwork from the international community, even the most difficult issues can be settled. Putting in place the conditions for a resumption of serious talks based on mutual steps is our first priority. Negative developments on the ground in this very same month only underline the importance of this work. We must not, and we cannot, lose what we have all worked so hard to build since Oslo: the development of institutions of a future Palestinian State through the Palestinian Authority. This includes essential services for ordinary Palestinians and vital cooperation, first of all in the security sector, between Israel and Palestine. But today we have a complete lack of process and prospects and, I would say not least, the presence of Daesh in the region. We will not live forever in the post-Oslo mode: we cannot take that for granted. If Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Abbas fail to work together now, the future will be dangerous for both Israel and the Palestinians. And for the region it will be even more dangerous than it is now. A fundamental change in the political, security and economic situation in Gaza, including the end of the closure, is an essential starting point. The parties must urgently make progress towards a lasting ceasefire, based on their agreements in Cairo last year, and reach an agreement which both ends the Gaza closure and addresses Israel’s legitimate security concerns. Moving towards real reconciliation – national reconciliation – was on the agenda one year ago. It seems not to be on the agenda anymore. I believe, however, that we cannot afford to put aside a national reconciliation process in the Palestinian camp, including Palestinian Authority control in Gaza, starting with the control of border crossings. What we are doing is pushing both the Israelis and the Palestinians to show leadership and to refrain from any action which would lead further away from the two-state solution. We have revitalised the Quartet in recent months, in line with our commitment to building a new regional and international framework for peace. We have appointed an EU Special Representative to work full-time again on EU efforts to re-open a political perspective for Israel and Palestine. You know him, you have met him, and he is constantly working on this in Jerusalem with all our international partners and with the parties. We work closely, and he personally works closely, with the Quartet colleagues to press both sides, on the one hand, to take courage in setting out improvements on the ground – concrete legal steps that can change people’s lives – and, on the other hand, to try to rebuild trust, of which there may be less today than at any time in the past. We can aim for measures which empower the Palestinians, strengthen security cooperation and address Israel’s concerns. These are practical, concrete steps which, if implemented on the ground, would move the situation towards, instead of away from, the two-state solution. Of course, such steps cannot be a substitute for resolving the final-status issues. We know that very well, but I believe this is the best way to get there in what is a very tough political climate both on the Israeli side and on the Palestinian side. It can be a way forward and a way out of the stalemate. However, we are also rethinking the way in which the Quartet has been working, or not working, so far. You know that two out of four of the Quartet envoys – the EU and the UN envoys – are new ones. We have started to work very well together, and also with the other two colleagues. The Arab countries can play a leading role in strengthening and giving incentives to the process. The Arab peace initiative demonstrates the potential, which is even stronger now than when it was launched, for a wider regional settlement to end the conflicts: the Israeli-Palestinian one and the Arab-Israeli one. This is why the Quartet envoys went together to Cairo and Oman and will visit Riyadh in the coming days. The key Arab countries, and the Foreign Ministers that I met just yesterday, have made very clear to me that they are ready to play their role in this regional and international framework to try to restart the engine of the process. That is why UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has already sent invitations to the Foreign Ministers of the Quartet to meet on the fringe of the General Assembly in New York at the end of the month, and, in the context of the initiative that we have taken as the European Union, has also extended an invitation to the Foreign Ministers of Egypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia, and to the Secretary-General of the Arab League. We are working to prepare the ground for a genuine regional framework that can help the parties to take some steps. Again, I know I am not defining the final-status solution, but I believe that, from the situation we face today of complete despair to the dream of hope and a final solution to the conflict, we have to build the bridges that will enable us to get there. We have to create the conditions on the ground, and the political conditions. We are moving forward to build this credible international and regional framework to support the parties and to regain and rebuild confidence between themselves and in the international community, for we know that this is needed as well. The two parties need to find the courage and the space to start trusting one another but, most of all, they need a regional and international framework in which they can find trust. This too has to be rebuilt. But ultimately it is not going to be the regional or the international framework that resolves the crisis. Only the parties themselves can take the fundamental decisions. They can either advance together in the future, or they can allow the two-state solution to move beyond reach, with all the negative consequences that would bring for both sides and for all of us, including us Europeans. Leadership is needed, and the European Union is ready. All the major stakeholders agree that we face the same challenges in the region. We face regional threats, including the rise of extremism, terrorism and the failing states. Peace in the holy places would send such a powerful message to the world; you would really have to be blind not to see it. In the current regional environment we cannot afford to stand still. If we do not move forward, we will see violence coming back again – we are already seeing it from time to time – and we will see the two-state solution become less and less viable, if not impossible. I believe the international community, the Palestinians and the Israelis cannot afford that, because we do not know what is going to come next if we close the window for peace that Oslo opened. The time has come to provide real long-term security and hope for the Israelis and the Palestinians – knowing full well that these words sound empty to both at this moment. The time has come for both sides to make the necessary compromises and, most of all, to show leadership. This is what is needed. The time has come for us to put all our efforts into supporting this process and helping it to start again. These days call for the whole European Union to play its part, and I am glad that, as I understand it, I will be able to count on the full and united backing of this Parliament for the European Union effort to ensure that this conflict –the oldest one in the region – does not become a forgotten one at a time when we all need, more than ever in the decades ahead, to solve it strategically.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1470, "date": "2015-09-09.json", "name": "Elmar BROK", "mepid": "1263", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Mr President, I would like to thank the Madam Vice-President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her Colleagues! Since Mrs Mogherini and the European Union have gained new authority through the successful negotiations on Iran, this can also be a formidable foundation for the other two crises in the region, the war in Iraq and Syria and the Middle East conflict. And that is interwoven! I believe that the settlement of the conflicts in Syria, in Iraq, can only be achieved if we now get together with the Russians, the Americans, the United Nations, partly also under the leadership of the European Union, the Saudis and the Turks and the Iranians, in order to put an end to this proxy war. This, too, has to do with the fact that this will only succeed if the Quartet – with a strong role for the European Union in it – goes ahead with the Arab League or the Member States of the Arab Peace Initiative and makes another attempt to achieve the two-state solution. The goal must be: a viable state of Palestine and a secure Jewish state of Israel. And I believe that it is part of the fact that both sides have something to achieve bilaterally here. This includes an end to the settlement policy and an end to Hamas' violence.  Violence and settlement and all this do not fit in, and certain things must be developed on both sides in order to build trust, but at the same time the Arab states, like the members of the Quartet, must also ensure the necessary level of mediation and subsequent security for the country to move forward. We also need the appropriate support that we must provide to a viable state of Israel, for a functioning administration, for the fight against corruption, in order to have an economically viable state that can play its role.

Mr President, I would like to thank the If I may answer the last question. If I have understood the French and the British correctly, they want to bomb ISIS, not Assad. There is, I believe, a slight difference in assessment. There is a division of labour here. Germany has supplied weapons to the Peshmerga to fight ISIS – effective weapons – and is also training the Peshmerga to fight ISIS, for example. I believe that we need to have a common approach to fight ISIS. As I said in my speech, the most important thing will be that we win over the Turks, the Saudis and the Iranians to end the proxy war there and involve them in a common strategy here, because ISIS has now become a threat to everyone. This is perhaps a good task for the European Union to bring about. This will not succeed without getting those involved in the proxy war away from it. And we will have a struggle for influence under the alibi of a religious dispute. We must also deal with this together with these countries. When it is clear that a Gaza solution was to be resolved, we need to talk about whether what Israel has done was proportionate. But Israel has been shelled from Gaza. That has been noted, and we must also see that. We have to see that some of the building objects – cement – in Gaza have not been used for the construction of houses, but for the construction of tunnels. This, too, must be included in a balanced assessment. To draw up a list now that Israel should then pay compensation to the European Union in order to rebuild it does not seem to me to be a solution with which we can make progress here, but would only be a revival of Hamas, which has so far also prevented its political authority from Ramallah from having the regime there and being able to control the country. The Palestinian Authority must be responsible for all of Palestine, including Gaza.

It is today at a more serious impasse than ever before and poses a direct threat to the security of our European Union. Hence the need to reaffirm our commitment to a peace process in the area and, in particular, to the peace process between Israel and Palestine, based on the recognised border principles of 1967 and the fact that the two states, Israel and Palestine, must coexist in security and peace.  Madam High Representative, you have demonstrated, in the past year, your entire commitment, I would even say the enthusiasm, to help relaunch the peace process and to enhance the role of our Union in this direction. We support you, and the resolution we are adopting tomorrow comes to confirm, once more, if necessary, this. Any lasting solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict can only be achieved in a regional context, with the involvement of important regional actors that you mentioned - Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia - and through close cooperation between us and the United States of America and also institutionally, through cooperation with the Arab League and relaunching its project, the Arab League Peanut Plan. In this context, my group and I are giving you our full support and I would like to remind you in this Chamber that we Europeans have recently received an extremely positive message from Israel. The Vice-President of the Knesset, opposition MP Hilik Bar, presented his document on a peace project, which is impressive in its courage, vision and strength to tell even truths that are inconvenient to the Israeli audience. He reminds us all of the words of the peace hero, Yitzhak Rabin, \"You can only make peace with your enemy\". This fundamental truth is still true today, including for Prime Minister Netanyahu.  Because the European Parliament has managed this year to help support the Commission's efforts, tomorrow we will adopt a resolution which, which, which will be recorded by all the groups in this Chamber. It is impressive, but it is also the strongest mandate we can give you, Madam President, to help bring our Union peace to the Near East. Thank you and wish you success.

As Egypt battles terrorist attacks in the Sinai, Saudi Arabia worries about growing Iranian influence after the nuclear deal and Jordan faces every day increasing pressure from the scale of its refugee crisis, as well as those from Palestine – also now from Syria – we can be more optimistic that there is a real common interest now to pursue a deal.  Therefore I welcome the High Representative’s call to the UN Quartet to relaunch the peace process and I do believe that the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative should be used as a blueprint to start from, with the commitment to the two-peoples two-nations approach.  With power shifting in the Palestinian Authority and Hamas reportedly facing pressure now in Gaza from ISIS, there is also reason to believe that those players at the centre of the debate are keen to see progress, for various different reasons as I have outlined. All too often the negotiations are undermined by focusing on the details too early, which is why contentious topics such as the status of Jerusalem, East Jerusalem, which settlements can stay or go, and the right of return for the Palestinians must now be left to the end, following simpler confidence-building initiatives now at the beginning.

The EU should also ensure that no EU funds are allocated to Israeli organisations involved in occupation activities, as a lever to apply pressure on the Israeli Government to re-engage in a meaningful peace process and to work for a two-state solution.

I will try to refrain from grandstanding and pretending that we, or anyone in this House, could know the exact solution to the conflict. What we know, however, is that the conflict needs to be resolved because a one-state solution – towards which there are some indications that Israel is moving – is a non-solution. My Israeli friends also know that. The reason why we base our position on the two-state solution is not ideological: it is a practical response to thinking about how the alternative would look. I would like to remind everybody of a brilliant piece by none other than Tony Judd, way back in 2003 in the New York Review of Books, which made waves in Israel as well. Back then he argued that, if the two-state solution was dead, the one-state solution might be coming and the bad news was that it was going to be much more costly for both the Palestinians and the Israelis. It is not a solution that anyone should aspire to, and we are not supporting anything which allows the last hope for a two-state solution simply to evaporate because of inaction. That is why we have been working very closely with the S&amp;D Group and the rapporteur, and, luckily, after four hours of negotiations we were able to put together a text, which is not ideal from our point of view but which, at least, may provide strong support from this Chamber and offer a strong mandate for what to do next. The negotiations should resume and should involve both sides and all the parties. At the same time, we should not forget that international law needs to be observed, even by Israel, and if that is not a principled stance on the part of the EU we will not be able to influence the situation.

Across many of the different EU institutions, it remains fairly uncritical of Palestine and always puts the onus on Israel. It seems to me that it is carrots for Palestinians and a stick for Israel. Chairing the negotiation of a deal with a state that calls for the destruction of its neighbour, with massive grants of financial aid to Gaza, whilst rockets are still being fired into Israel, is hardly the best approach towards lasting peace. Central to your involvement, Commissioner, is support for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), with the EU as its largest multilateral donor. But, interestingly, my country, the UK, is not far off matching the total EU contribution. There remains a valid question about UNRWA’s efficiency and what exactly the EU is funding, as well as concerns over UNRWA’s governance. There always appears to be some budget crisis. Commissioner, I would like to ask what assessments and audit checks the Commission carries out on UNRWA. In the past, UNRWA has regrettably been a byword for corruption and waste. Finally, there is a question as to what the role of the EU is in the continuing discussions with the Quartet, UN Security Council and various bilateral negotiations. Is there not a danger of confusion with so many actors? Is it the case that the EU wishes to be involved so that it can appear as a player, rather than bringing something constructive to the table? There needs to be fresh thinking outside the constraints of a two-state solution. In any case, there needs to be a more even-handed approach to Israel.

They oblige us and they also allow us to act by uniting all those who are likely to participate in the restoration of dialogue and the restoration of trust. Now more than ever, I believe that the rise of terrorism and the destabilization of the region require rapid progress. There are fewer and fewer window of fire for reconciliation and peace action or for stabilization of the region. The basis of the solutions is known, and they are recalled in the resolution we will see tomorrow. The problem is the will to act and trust.

To our Palestinian friends, we were proud to pass the resolution in favour of a move towards recognition of your state, but we always said that this was not a substitute for direct talks. We hope the successful vote today to name our own delegation, specifically one with Palestine, will be a further such encouragement. We note the efforts last week in Qatar of your chief negotiator to seek Hamas’ participation in a meeting of the Palestinian National Council. We encourage reconciliation, and should consider any further action the EU take can take to help achieve it.

We also call on you to intervene to end the arms trade between Member States and Israel, with which weapons are bombed in Gaza and entire families are being torn out. We want you to insist on guaranteeing the right of refugees to return and denounce the continuing violations of human rights.

We insist only that international rules must be respected when it comes to others, but not when it comes to Israel. It is important to say that these are not two equal parties, no, one party is occupying the other! If you can't tell the difference between occupiers and occupiers, then there's something wrong in your head. Of course, I do not only miss the fact that we are told quite clearly that the occupation must be abolished, but also that we are given clarity as to what means we actually have to make things work. We have for many years folded our hands and wished it would go well, we want to build trust, we want people to believe in each other and so on and so on and nothing happens! Yes, more and more settlements are coming! In fact, something we can do is already there, and we should be aware of that. We originally have in our green proposal a number of things that can be done, which are remedies, not punishment, not BDS, not boycotts. In other words, to a very different extent than today, we must take our own laws seriously and comply with them and have a proper policy of separation between Israel and the occupied territories, so that attention is paid not only to products from there, but also to all companies involved in the occupation, including to universities, to banks, to everything possible. If we say that they will have nothing to do with the European Union because they are illegal under its own laws, I am pretty sure that something will happen.

This is true in Israel, where the new Netanyahu government appears crushed by its own electoral rhetoric, which is increasingly isolated and partly hostage to the nationalist and ultra-Orthodox parties that support it. And so every effort seems more catalyzed towards maintaining the status quo. To obstruct reconciliation between the Palestinian factions, between Hamas and Fatah, so as not to have an interlocutor; I would also like to say a few things about the difficult agreement on nuclear power in Iran to prevent its potential effects from actually materialising, that substantial change in circumstances which would perhaps actually help us to have a serious relaunch of the negotiations, with the cooperation of the Gulf countries and Turkey as well.  The Palestinians also have their serious responsibilities, first and then, a ruling class that is now light years away from the people it represents; Abbas' resignation may be an act of desperation or a tactical move, time will tell, but they certainly sow uncertainty in the short term. We are therefore at the mercy of this eternal postponement, while Gaza remains an immense and desolate open-air prison and illegal colonisations are proceeding.

Some time ago, Shimon Peres said that it is not true that there is no light at the end of the tunnel in the Middle East, far from it! He said the light is there, the problem is there's no tunnel.  His was a bitter consideration that comes to mind every repetition of the difficulties between Israel and Palestine and the fact that the conflict, with less or greater intensity, has never stopped. And it is this perception of the intangibility of conflict, of fatality independent of the efforts of the world, that leads someone to look for alternative solutions, to think that, before we even go through it, we have to find the good tunnel.  But the truth is that there is no alternative solution, because of viable paths to peace, there is only one. The tunnel is there, but we must convince the Israelis and Palestinians to take it. In fact, what the conditions for peace between Israelis and Palestinians will be, it has been known for years, perhaps decades, that all the different peace negotiations have been structured on these formulae, from Madrid to Oslo, from Camp David to Taba, from the Roadmap in Geneva.

The water, the agriculture, the houses, the hospitals, the schools, it was all destroyed. The same study showed that socio-economic conditions in the territory are at their lowest level since 1967. The same study shows that the situation is unsustainable after 8 years of economic blockade. The same study notes that in the first four months of 2015, Israel again withawe withed customs revenues, which would represent 75% of the incoming money in the Gaza Strip.  In no conflict history is made in black and white. But it is true that this is not just any conflict and that there is an oppressive state that has been treated preferentially. Also this week there was another report showing that arms sales from European countries to the State of Israel continue to increase. In one of the countries this increase represented 1/3 of the invoicing, 1/3 of profit and represents, moreover, expenses of EUR 660 million.

The destruction of the Near and Middle East is due first of all to the destruction of Iraq and this unnecessary war in Iraq, the sectarian management that was then made of Iraq, the subsequent destruction of Libya, the interventionism - also French, it must be said - and the destruction of Syria. All these acts were committed because of the right of interference that the West and the Union give themselves to manifest imperialism, supposedly in the name of human rights and democracy but, unfortunately, in reality, in the service of foreign interests contrary to our European interests. It must also be seen as the will of the United States to create profitable chaos to prevent the creation of a Eurasian and Eurocontinental Union.  In the face of this, I would like to stress, in relation to the criticisms that are being made against Israel, that this country is a pole of stability and democracy and that if we do want to make it a pole of war as well, let us move forward with this idea of the two states. We will then see what the result will also be for Israel, which at present, as I stress, is the only pole of stability and democracy. In these circumstances, it is scandalous, irresponsible and dignified, for my part, of the crime of high treason to prevent States from controlling the flow of migrants in which the Islamic State, which boasts of it, has itself claimed the infiltration of its fighters, who will tomorrow be a factor of instability in the Near and Middle East that will reach our continent. It is irresponsible that regimes such as Egypt or Syria are being destabilizationd and, ultimately, methods, it must be said, of sorcerer's apprentices also coming , let us be said - from the Commission. To top it all off, we support you, Parliament and the Commission, support Turkey at a time when Turkey has just attacked the Iraqi Kurds who are fighting the Islamic State. On the other hand, you are and we have largely remained deaf to the cries of agony of the Christian minorities of the East. Where were our tears in the face of the thousands of women and men sold as slaves, raped and beheaded? Our morality boils down to demanding that the abandoned, forgotten and defenceless European peoples welcome all the misery of the imperial wars we have supported. Of course, what then is the point of crying in an orchestrated way in a photo to make the people of Europe believe that we have heart?

This means that the leadership of the Palestinian Movement is having difficulty making the necessary compromises with Israel because it does not want to be accused of treason. For its part, Israel, which is the only truly democratic country in the region and must therefore always be the privileged partner of the European Union, feels threatened by the development of Islamist forces, by instability in Egypt, by the substantial disintegration of Syria and Iraq for the benefit of the so-called Islamic State and by Iran's policy.

However, I am afraid the actions we continue to witness from the Israeli Government are not conducive to peace. The settlement building continues, despite being a blatant breach of international law. The European Union response – your own response – is right and correct in the form of words, but failing in terms of any action. By our inaction, I think we give tacit support to an illegal occupation. The EU-Israel Association Agreement has, under Article 2, provisions for a formal human rights dialogue. We need to begin that dialogue immediately. If Israel refuses to halt the settlement building, we should move to suspend the Association Agreement. Trade preferences are carrots and sticks. If we are afraid to use the stick when facing such disregard for international law, then our claims to have values in our foreign policy become empty words.  What is interesting, though, is that while the institutions drag their heels our citizens are demanding the opportunity to take action. They are demanding to have mandatory labelling on products so that they can choose to boycott products coming from the occupied territories. So I welcome the news that the Commission will soon publish its proposal for labelling guidelines, but these must be mandatory guidelines showing that these are goods from illegally occupied territories. Mandatory labelling is essential, both for giving consumers accurate information on what they buy and to take seriously our obligations for a fair – as well as free – trade policy.

However, in the wake of the Arab Spring, a new conflict has appeared, this time intra—Arab, between the Shias and the Sunnis. The recent advances of ISIS in Syria, where the civil war goes on unabated, and Iraq – as well as in Libya, where things were further complicated by the political division of the country – suggest an ample de—structuring process with dangerous and unpredictable consequences: the accompanying instability in a much larger area of the Middle East. Its reverberations within the Muslim communities in Europe and the current migrant tsunami are consequences we already have to face.  Under the circumstances, it will only be a question of time before this new conflict becomes dominant, pushing the old Arab-Israeli conflict into a secondary position, thus forcing us to revisit our traditional policies and alliances in an attempt to adapt ourselves to the new landscape in the area.

We were discussing the Syrian and migration issues this morning. Let me – even if it is not my role – maybe apologise to members of the public who are probably following this debate more closely than some of the Members of this Hemicycle. (Applause) Let me thank you all for the support that you are expressing for the European Union’s stand and action when it comes to the Middle East Peace Process. Let me thank you sincerely for that. I think that a united position of this Parliament is going to contribute in a way that, as some of you know very well, is important; some others might not imagine, but it is going to count a lot. Let me also say, as sincerely as I always try to be, that some of your expectations might need to be carefully looked at. I do not want to downsize any of the expectations, but the work is going to be long and very difficult. It is true that we have an opportunity, as the European Union, because on this issue we are more united than we believe. Even though we are facing multiple crises all around us, I have been discussing and working on this very same issue with the Foreign Ministers of all the 28 Member States for the last four meetings of the Foreign Affairs Council, and we have unanimous conclusions and different stands, different political views, different histories of the countries that are members of the European Union, but we have a united policy on the European Union’s role when it comes to the Middle East Peace Process. So I will put all my energy and determination, as I have been doing since the beginning of my mandate, into trying to, as I said, restart the engine of this process and avoid the vacuum that we have been facing now for more than one year.  However – and I would count on your support in doing this, and on our unity – results will be difficult and will take time, that is if we manage to get results. Maybe the first steps will be very limited results, or sometimes we will have negative results and then sometimes positive results. Difficult deals and agreements take time and patience. This is just because I have heard a lot of good luck messages. I take this with enthusiasm, as you know, but we have to be realistic about the fact that the starting point today is a very difficult one for us to be realistic on regarding the situation in front of us. I think Antonio Panzeri described it, taking the words of a former President in the best possible way. I see our role as trying to help the parties to find the tunnel at the end of which there is light, and at the same time keeping the light at the end of the tunnel alive, because this is not to be taken for granted. We have these two challenges, these two works, in my view, to do: helping the parties to come together and find the right way, because there is no alternative, no substitute for direct talks – we have to be very clear about that – and keeping the perspective of peace and of the two states, the perspective towards which we are working. Because yes, there are doubts in the international communities, in the parties themselves, that this perspective of the two-state solution and of the peace process is still there. Our work has to be focused on this. And new initiatives: given this framework, the picture is not rosy; it is not encouraging at all. I think our role is to build conditions to get to initiatives. We can always have big international conferences. What is difficult is to prepare the big initiatives and to make sure that these initiatives then have results. Conferences after conferences after conferences do not solve the problem. The real point is now trying to rebuild a modicum of trust and trying to put an agenda on the table that can allow the parties to take some steps forward instead of some steps back, which is exactly what is happening today: reverse the process. I am sorry, I did not want to give you a cold shower, but we are talking about something extremely ambitious and extremely difficult, even if we take these minimum goals in front of us, and obviously something that I referred to in my opening remarks: building this regional and international framework. I am really convinced that if we have one way of playing our role to the full, as Europeans in the Middle East Peace Process, it is in partnership with our partners in the region, starting from our Arab friends. Because here we have two different conflicts and crises: one is between the Palestinians and the Israelis, but the other one is between the Israelis and the Arab world at large, and you cannot imagine – or some of you imagine and know very well – that from the Far East to Latin America this is an issue that, if it is not solved, contributes to creating radicalisation and also hate. So we have a global responsibility that we can play with our global partners. Indeed, we do have an opportunity: the Iranian deal that we will discuss, hopefully, in a couple of hours gives us a little bit of credibility in the sense that it is something that shows that multilateralism and diplomacy can work and lead to results, and our unity also gives us a chance. It is also our consistency that gives us a chance to play a role. One of you mentioned something that it is very important to me, and I thank those who raised it, because I did not mention it at the beginning and I take the chance to do so now: our work with international organisations, and in particular with UNRWA. We faced a major crisis over the summer. UNRWA was clearly desperately saying that the danger of not re—opening the schools for Palestinian kids was very real, and it is thanks to the European Union’s additional financial support that we managed to avoid the situation whereby Palestinian children in the camps were not able to go to school at the beginning of the school year. We avoided this, and in this way made a very important contribution. This is also an important role that the European Union plays. I well remember saying to the Hemicycle the very first time we had a debate on the Middle East Peace Process that we have to be not only a payer but also a player. Continuing to be a payer is also relevant in the conditions we are facing. So this is something that we have to maintain. Some of you asked about the labelling. I can share with you what I shared with the ministers at the weekend. I recently asked the services of the Commission, in particular DG TRADE, to complete and finalise the work on the European guidelines. It is not a matter of taking new decisions – decisions were taken long ago – but a matter of implementing them in a European way. So there is no decision needed: it is an implementation thing that for me has to do primarily with transparency for our consumers. It is not a boycott. I know very well that there are different positions in this room about that. My institutional and political starting point is that this is a decision that we owe to our citizens and our consumers, because they have the right – and the legal right, according to our European rules – to know the origin of the products they buy or that they decide not to buy. It is a matter of transparency for me. Also because I believe – and we discussed this the last time we were here in this room discussing the peace process – that our role is to try to facilitate and to build bridges. This means, as one of you mentioned, not taking one side, even if we see the limits of both sides. Some of us see more the limits of one or the other or both. I think there is no one in this room who does not see any limit of any of the two parts. Still, our role – if you want to play a role – in re-starting the process and bringing it to some positive result is to build bridges, to build confidence, to engage and not to punish. This is my stand. This is something that we do in full respect and, as always, that is the basis for the European Union’s action in international and foreign policy, in full respect of, and compliance with, international law. That is why my reaction to every step forward that is taken on the settlement is always immediate, because this is something that we do not and could not recognise in international law. This is illegal – but boycotting is another story. I hope I was clear: it is a matter of transparency that we owe to our consumers. Let me finish by saying that in trying to have a role in bringing the parties together, the sense of unity that can come from this Parliament is essential, because again, if we are not able among us Europeans to find a unified vision of the Middle East Peace Process, how can we ask the parties in the conflict itself to find a common vision and how can we aspire to facilitate the mediation? Showing that we can find common ground – and I know that each of you has a particular point of view – gives us strength like nothing else. I would like to thank you for your support and for your expectations, even if I would ask you to keep them under control, especially regarding the timing. I would also encourage you to go forward in finding common ground, because this is also the basis for us to ask the parties to find common ground themselves.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1543, "date": "2015-09-09.json", "name": "Ildikó GÁLL-PELCZ", "mepid": "102886", "text": "   Six motions for resolutions were sent to me to conclude the debate.

It is vital for the EU to work with the Israeli, Palestinian, Egyptian and Jordanian authorities to prevent the re-arming of terrorists in the Gaza Strip.

I very much appreciate your long-standing interest and our cooperation on this important neighbouring country. Let me start immediately with the latest and most relevant development, which we also discussed with the Foreign Ministers in our informal meeting a few days ago. The release of all political prisoners just two weeks ago represented a long-sought step that was also welcomed by this Parliament. Since the December 2010 post-election crackdown, we had consistently called for their release. Restrictive measures were imposed and our cooperation with the national authorities was put on the back burner by comparison with the other Eastern Partnership countries. It is important to ensure that all former political prisoners can exercise their full civil and political rights and, of course, that no new politically-motivated imprisonments take place. In response to the release of political prisoners and in the context of the October presidential elections – the conduct of which will be extremely important – we need to send a clear signal to Belarus. We wish to move towards a further improvement in our relations, based on mutually-encouraging steps. I started discussions on the prospects in this regard with the Foreign Ministers in our informal meeting in Luxembourg last Friday. Of course we realise that the situation has not changed in a systemic way. Belarus remains the only country in Europe to still apply the death penalty. Civil and political rights, such as freedom of association and assembly and freedom of expression and media, remain restricted. In addition, the country’s economic and financial situation is extremely difficult. Still, in this context and taking a step back, one can see that the European Union’s consistent policy of critical engagement over recent years has yielded some positive results and contributed to an improvement in EU-Belarus relations. After the very difficult period of 2011-2013, EU-Belarus relations have been improving since the start of 2014 and have intensified in 2015 in the form of a number of positive developments: pro-active participation by Belarus in the Eastern Partnership, the recent resumption of the human rights dialogue and the country’s constructive stance in the context of the crisis in Ukraine. As a result, several high-level visits to Belarus took place in the first six months of this year to build on these openings. It is also encouraging that Belarus has agreed to the deployment of a fully-fledged OSCE electoral observation mission and that this mission has so far been able to set up and operate without restrictions. Four hundred short-term observers are expected to be deployed. In January, in recognition of the opportunity to announce the European Union policy of critical engagement vis-a-vis Belarus, the Member States agreed a list of measures that could be implemented if the conditions were right. A number of these measures have already been activated, including the signing of an early-warning mechanism in the area of energy supply, the launch of negotiations on a mobility partnership, and promoting approximation by Belarus to the Bologna education principles. I am convinced that, in addition to reacting proportionately to new events in the country and, obviously, remaining true to our values of democracy and human rights, we should implement a longer-term strategy focused on building links between the European Union and Belarus and on supporting the reforms the people of Belarus need and want so much. In this respect I looked with great interest at the European Parliament delegation visit to Minsk last June – the first such visit since 2002, as far as I know – and noted that the Members of this Parliament came back with a mixed and yet rather positive message tending in the same direction: the call for keeping communication channels open, resuming dialogue and working closely together. For the first time since the end of 2010 it is possible to imagine more constructive relations between the European Union and Belarus, and I am convinced that it is worth seizing on this moment and embarking on a more positive agenda with one of the European Union’s immediate neighbours and a key country in the partnership.

Anyone who ignores this fact disregards the emotions of their families. I warn against this. But anyone who overestimates this fact too, committing another mistake – above all, a lack of context analysis. We should not be under any illusions or excessive expectations, because we will make a mistake of political naivety. On the other hand, it is a fact that, in the current situation of stability challenges in the region, it is our common interest to seek a way of normalising relations between the European Union and Belarus. Realism, combined with the lack of compromises on the fundamental, fundamental elements of European values, is also the most important thing for possible openings and new proposals for economic cooperation. The most important time will undoubtedly come immediately after the elections in Belarus. They, observed by an increased number of observers, as well as the period after them, will be the basis for possible next steps from the list of twenty-nine actions prepared, inter alia, by the High Representative. It is important that europe's possible financial involvement is linked to privatization processes – including business developments, macroeconomic reforms. The entry of education into the Bologna system or the improvement of phytosanitary control in the field of food research should be appreciated. But this is just the beginning of the proposed action.

The last official visit occurred more than 12 years ago. One can hope that it has indeed been viewed as a signal on the part of the European Parliament and the European Union as a whole that we are finally ready to pursue closer and stronger ties with the Republic of Belarus. Likewise, the recent pardons of opposition figures in Belarus a few weeks ago can also be viewed as a signal, this time on the part of our neighbours, that they, too, are ready and willing to overcome existing difficulties and advance further on the path of better mutual understanding and cooperation. We acknowledge the fact that these pardons were granted, not only two months following the delegation’s visit, but also two months before the upcoming general election in the Republic of Belarus. In this context, such a step could provide grounds for a more common position with regard to the level of democratic development in the Republic of Belarus, thereby lessening the degree of any misunderstanding in the wake of the elections. As Vice-Chair of the Delegation for Relations with Belarus I am very happy about this step, because it clearly shows the willingness of the Belarusian leadership to both reconcile its differences with the European Union and to gradually move towards closer cooperation. Finally, this step is also very important to me as an inhabitant of a neighbouring country and EU Member State, Latvia. While the economic and inter-societal aspects of the Latvian-Belarusian relationships are already strongly developed and are gradually advanced further and further, this release could provide a powerful stimulus for a closer political dialogue as well. During the last year, especially following the close engagement of the Republic of Belarus and the conclusion and implementation of the Minsk protocols, EU-Belarus relations have finally started to warm up. In recent decades, most, if not all, of these warm-ups, regretfully, have never been long term. Just as a long winter is always followed by a spring, one can hope that soon afterwards it might progress to summer. Unlike with nature, however, we as humans have all the necessary instruments to achieve a lasting long-term partnership with our Belarusian neighbours. Of course, while part of the responsibility for the shape our relations took almost 20 years ago lies with the Belarusian leadership, it was never a good idea to isolate Minsk, thus only alienating them further.

And as far as elections are concerned, this upcoming presidential election, I appeal – let us observe not only the course of the electoral act itself, but the whole election, that is, the election campaign. The Belarusian authorities should also know that freedom of expression of opposition party candidates will be essential for our assessment. But, of course, in perspective, we need to see this next election that will follow the presidential election, which is a more distant general election.

However, nothing new appears to be happening in Belarus. We have witnessed time and again the imprisonment of political activists and civil society representatives in Belarus. Then, when the political climate is bad enough, Belarus steps up and frees some prisoners in order to get a reward from the European Union. So on the one hand they release a few political prisoners, and on the other they arrest new ones. We need to see other measures taken that improve the state of democracy and civil liberties in Belarus. With the presidential elections approaching, there remain many areas that need to be improved. Belarusian opposition activists and civil society must be guaranteed freedom of speech and freedom of political rights. In order for the elections to be considered free and fair, the OSCE recommendation should be adopted and implemented. There must also be freedom of the media. The EU must find ways to enhance contact between the civil societies of the EU and Belarus, and we need to support civil society organisations. The facilitation of visa-free travel is very important. The launch of the visa facilitation talks in 2014 was a good start, but we need to take it further now. And last but not least, the abolition of the death penalty. We will continue to address this issue until its final abolition in Belarus. It is the only country in Europe that still has the death penalty as a punishment.

It is probably the case that the so-called critical, constructive approach of the Commission and the External Action Service has been good, but now we have to say that we must make steady progress on certain concrete cooperation initiatives in order to see whether Belarus is really ready for democracy. Above all, the forthcoming elections will be a test because, as we all remember, after the 2010 elections, the regime very brutally crushed the opposition. It's happening at the moment, too. We must not turn a blind eye to the fact that the opposition is still being disturbed.

The independence of the judiciary is a key issue which I believe should be promoted through concrete cooperation.

One is towards the large neighbour to the east, which is one of the largest economic partners and, as we know, is not always easy to assess. On the other hand, great uncertainty also with the neighbour in the West, which, controlled by others, has partly put itself in a situation that is worrying and is already doing more harm to itself than anyone else with the sanctions. The situation on the ground is therefore not easy for the political leaders in Minsk. I can tell you one thing: during my visit, it turned out that the doors in Belarus were wide open.

If the OSCE observers give a positive assessment of the Presidential elections, the EU should review its sanctions.

He went on to explain that the main force of the regime he leads is stability. That is precisely the problem: the stability that Lukashenko is talking about has an enormous price: freedom of expression, freedom of the press, freedom of association. Anyone who dares to oppose it is treated with violence and repression. I recall that of the nine challengers in the 2010 presidential election, seven ended up in prison. They were accused of organizing a mass disturbance - that is the precise expression used. They were, in fact, protesting, along with tens of thousands of other people, against the results of the presidential vote, as the OSCE had already stated that the vote in question was far from meeting minimum international standards.

Nikolai Statkiewicz, the opposition presidential candidate, has spent five of the six years he was sentenced to. To this group should be added Alesia Michalewicza, who two days ago, returning after a dozen years in exile, was arrested and fortunately released on the same day.

They are under constant police monitoring, have limited civil rights.   Some in this Chamber remember what happened after the previous elections in Belarus, when many opposition activists were arrested or re-arrested shortly after what would seem to be a normalisation of relations with the European Union. No one wants a replay of this story and the next game of appearances. Although we have clear signs of warming (because both the release of political prisoners and, until recently, the first official visit by the European Parliament delegation to Belarus in many years with the official agenda of meetings with both the Senate government and representatives of civil society and the opposition are evidence of warming), this will not automatically trigger a re-normalisation of relations between the Union and Belarus. Further steps are needed – achievable. This needs to be built on the bridges referred to by the High Representative.

The news that is coming to us so far informs a worrying development in the run-up to the next election. Opposition parties can participate in controlling the counting of votes in less than half a percent of districts. Media coverage of the election also seems to us to be worrying. For example, the list of all presidential candidates in the media was published only twelve times, and on one hundred and eighteen websites there was no information on groups collecting signatures for presidential candidates other than Alexander Lukashenko. And the broadcast, which was the content of President Lukashenko's activities, takes up an average of seventy-five percent of the airtime.  Given this information, it is to be feared that the elections will be held as they have been in the past.

In October this year there will be presidential elections again in Belarus.

Belarus's president would thus have spent almost a quarter of a century in office. I don't think he's going to make up for Fidel Castro. It would be a smile if there was nothing behind all this but repression and restrictions on political opponents, journalists and civil society. The very preparation for the presidential election raises concerns about undemocratic practices and shows that the elections will be manipulated again. There is growing pressure on candidates in elections and people collecting signatures for their candidacy. As my previous spokesman has already said, a few days ago, former presidential candidate Aleś Mihaljevich, who was granted asylum in my country, the Czech Republic, was arrested in 2011. Yet there are also positive signs that give us hope. Belarus is a country that is slowly opening up to Europe under the influence of the Ukrainian crisis and other factors. We have also seen some positive progress in the field of education, for example. Belarus recently signed up to the Bologna process. This will help universities and especially students and as a result of the development of the whole society.

I think that we have all prepared a quality resolution on the situation in Belarus today, where we are all aware that a few weeks before the new presidential elections, the result is practically known in advance, because we see that the process of democratization and transition is more than slow in this European country, which from a series of presentations of our colleagues represents a kind of anachronism. Nevertheless, after the visit of the delegation in charge of Belarus led by our colleague Zdrojewski, after more than thirteen years we can record some progress by the European Parliament, a shift in the dialogue on the issue of human rights protection, and of course we positively view the release of political prisoners as a signal for the better. However, this should not be a one-off move, but we expect it to continue and that this process of gradual evolution of the situation and regime in Belarus has its better and European standard. I also believe that the Commission needs to think about the possibility of sectoral cooperation, in particular one that is not strict sensu related to meeting political criteria, that we influence young people, that we influence the media scene and of course help the Belarusian opposition in this regard. I would recall a meeting of the Euronest Assembly a few months ago in Yereen, in which representatives of the Belarusian opposition participated and I saw this as one positive step. As head of the Delegation to Ukraine, I believe that this kind of role of Belarus as a certain international mediator is important, but it would also be good if the situation in Ukraine was presented objectively, not that it is influenced by Russian propaganda and that in some way the situation in Ukraine helps democratization in Belarus.

This must not, however, lead us to try to make the same mistakes again as we did in the past with Ukraine; we should develop a strong approach, yes, of cooperation and conditionality towards Ukraine in order to ensure that the situation improves over time, we actually get concrete and factual progress, but without putting the Belarusians back on the wall against the wall in the face of an hamlet choice between us and Russia, we have seen what this has led to in the Ukrainian crisis and I sincerely think that we should learn from our past mistakes.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "EFDD", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1581, "date": "2015-09-09.json", "name": "Federica Mogherini", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission/ High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs. – Mr President, I will be very brief, because for me this session was mainly a good chance to listen, to take note and to make sure that Parliament’s thoughts about the way forward for our relationship with Belarus are fully incorporated and included at this stage of reflection. So I would like to thank the honourable Members very much for their contributions, especially those encouraging more cooperation between the European Union and Belarus at all levels. I think this is the first time since the end of 2010 that we have had the opportunity to engage on a more positive agenda in this regard. I agree with the president of the delegation who said that the approach to Belarus should be holistic and not limited to our policy on sanctions. Indeed, several of the 29 steps could be activated, including in the economic field. Finally, as indicated, we are considering, together with the 28 Member States, the way ahead in response to the release of the prisoners. Our response will need to be proportionate and adequate, taking account of timing and sequencing. You all pointed out the pros and cons, the question of timing, and the difficult challenges still ahead of us. At the same time, we agree that there is a window of opportunity now that should not be missed. So the question is how to do it in the smartest, most positive and most productive way. Obviously I believe any EU response has to be, and will be, accompanied by steps to increase cooperation.

Mr President, let me first of all say that I am very glad we are finally taking one of the most important points. I was surprised, I was looking back at my presence in the Parliament – you know I am coming often – but this is the first time we discuss Iran. I am glad to do so after we reached the agreement and also after a visit of a delegation from our Parliament to Tehran.  Let me start by saying that it was an honour for me to represent the European Union in the negotiations and in the signing of the deal we reached on 14 July in Vienna with Iran. As many have said the moment was really an historic one. We should all be proud of what we have achieved, also because we have achieved that together, showing unity, unity of purpose, unity of method and we did this while we were negotiating at the signing and also in the follow up, this first months of the follow-up, of the agreement. The deal has put an end to years of negotiations aimed at securing a comprehensive long lasting solution to the Iranian nuclear issue and it has also put an end to decades of tensions and distrust.  What we achieved in Vienna is a victory of diplomacy, of multilateralism and, I think in this respect, is also a victory of the European Union. And it is a good deal the one that we reached. First of all we would have not accepted a deal that was not good. It is a strong, durable and verifiable deal because we know very well trust is important but agreements of this nature are not and cannot be built on trust, they are built on things that are verifiable, and written in all details in the agreement. It took so much time, it took so much energy also because we wanted the agreement itself, the text and the annexes themselves to be as detailed as possible in order not to leave space for interpretation or disputes in the implementation phase and in the follow-up.  I said it is not based on trust but it is an agreement that while it starts to be implemented can open the way to build trust and this is the bet we are doing, that implementing the deal will also help building trust, trust within the region and within the international community, I would come to that at the end, but also trust as I said and confidence in something very rare and something very precious, which is again the fact that diplomacy, multilateralism, negotiations can lead to results. In fact we prevented probably, most probably, we prevented a crisis or a major conflict through our action.  So that is why I was so proud that the European Union was able to facilitate and to lead to a positive result in this negotiation. Indeed it was also important, it is also important because it is hard, very hard, to think not only in the recent years, but especially now with the security situation we have all around the European Union and in the globe. Difficult to imagine any other moment in history when all the world powers be them Europeans, US, Russia, China, acted in such close cooperation in addressing a common challenge, recognizing a common interest of the international community and being able to act together. The European Union, as you know, played a crucial role. First of all as a facilitator of the talks but also, and let me praise our staff, our excellent people for that, as a pen holder of the agreement and of all the technical annexes to that. Sometimes we refer to the European bureaucrats, well it is thanks to our people, experienced, very knowledgeable about even tiny technical details of nuclear programmes, if we were able, as Europeans, as European Union, to indeed write concretely all the details of the annexes. I was proud of my team, I was proud of our European team. (Applause) Yes you can clap because they deserve that, they deserve that and indeed thank you because I am very happy and it is nice when my personal role is recognised but I always say this was a team work, not only with our partners in the international community, this was also a team work of our staff, and really our people did an excellent job, staying in the same sometimes closed rooms for months, months literally, working on papers, days and nights. So thank you for thanking them with me, they really deserve it. Now we come to the critical phase. We will keep, I will keep personally, a crucial role for the phase of the implementation as I would stay as a coordinator of the Joint Commission overseeing the implementation of the GCBOA. Implementing the agreement effectively is critical. The UN Security Council endorsed the agreement as you know on 20 July through resolution 2231 and this very same day, in the Foreign Affairs Council, we had a unanimous endorsement by the Foreign Affairs Ministers. We started as the European Union preparations for our own legal measures necessary for lifting the sanctions and we look forward to a positive conclusion of the parliamentary reviews. As Iran will start implementing its nuclear commitments after the reviews will be finished, EU, UN and US economic and financial sanctions will be lifted upon verification of the IAA, and let me also say that our cooperation with the IAA was excellent and also was a way of strengthening, which is something, sometimes we say, but it is difficult then to do, to empower an important agency to do their work, and cooperation in that respect was really excellent. Very importantly going back to sanctions, sanctions lifting will be subject to snap back in case of violation of the agreements. So far I have to say we have very encouraging signs. Iran has complied with the road map agreed with the IAA and has submitted the requested information regarding the outstanding issues we had. Now we need to keep in mind that the current process remains very sensitive. We will keep focusing on the implementation of the agreement and this is something not only that I underline, but this is the main reason for my visit in Tehran, just 14 days after the deal was signed. I stressed in the Tehran meeting with the President Rouhani, with Foreign Minister Zarif, we were missing each other after having spent so much time together in Vienna all of us, but also with the president of the parliament that I know has kept a very positive and constructive memory of her visit there. I stress that the successful and speedy implementation of the deal is key. The deal is signed but it enters into the real elements, into the real force, once we start and especially once Iran starts implementing it. Implementation phase will be key because it is the key to open the doors towards a renewed engagement between the European Union, its institutions, and its Member States and Iran. That is very clear to me that the majority of the work of re-engaging, restarting bilateral relations will be with the European Union. Out of all the partners sitting around the table we are clearly the ones that for history, for geography, for economy, for interest in the common region we share which is the Middle East, have a clear agenda of interest of exploring ways of working with Iran, as difficult as it can be also on the way ahead. During my visit, we also identified with the Iranian authorities areas of common interest, on which a possible cooperation can start in the months to come in parallel with implementation. Trade, energy, environment, technology, aviation safety but also terrorism and regional issues, and obviously human rights, we agreed the following steps. First we will start an informal political dialogue, starting from senior official level to further explore areas of potential cooperation and elaborate possible details. Second, we will look into the possibility of a European Union presence in Tehran once the agreement has come into effect. This process requires all European Union institutions to work in a coherent way. For these reasons I have created a common joint Iran task force bringing together services from the Commission and DS (???) that will serve, that has started already to work, to serve as the interface one to ensure the necessary level of coordination in the European Union site. But as we discussed also this morning and also with the President of the Commission, the agreement opens some new opportunities for a different, more cooperative regional framework, and I believe this is really what is going to be more relevant for us. It can open the way to a new way of addressing the crisis in Syria, first of all in Syria. And let me also say that I will discuss also this possible developments tomorrow with Zafandemistura (???) in Brussels, but also in Yemen and in Iraq and in Lebanon, and so on. Maybe this could be a way of allowing us to bring different parties together with a different perspective. The perspective that managed to bring a result to the negotiations on the nuclear programme of Iran, which is the win-win approach. Different parties around the table brought together by either a common interest or a common threat they have to face together and many of you referred to the need to face together joining forces the threat of Daesh in a more coherent way. Well, I believe that if we managed to start implementation of the deal, to start developing new relations based not from today to tomorrow, it will take time, but based on some degree of mutual interests and mutual trust, we could also find more effective ways of facing the challenges we have in the region. This will not happen overnight. That is clear, but let me say that's the issue of building a more cooperative framework in the region, in the Middle East, is the interest of all. A more cooperative Middle East would mean first of all an increased dialogue between Sunni and Shia forces and this would be the real nightmare for Daesh - uniting forces on the ground, uniting forces of differences, and obviously facing their messages of sectarianism and hate that can only grow, flourish on divisions. At the same time let me stress and finish with that because I believe it is important in itself for us Europeans, the deal with Iran it is important for all these different political reasons I am stressing but it is first of all important because it is a milestone for regional and global non-proliferation. It is first of all a non-proliferation agreement. It is first of all a security agreement. We have been focusing very much on the political meaning of it but the concrete outcome, first outcome of the agreement, is a security and a non-proliferation one. It can strengthen and it strengthens the non-proliferation treaty and could create momentum towards a full ratification of the nuclear test ban treaty. The deal reached in Vienna can also promote disarmament globally and it can foster progress towards the Middle East weapons of mass destruction free zone that as you know, has always been very much supported by all of us in the European Union institutions and Member States from the very beginning. It is obviously a very ambitious goal, but the non-proliferation and disarmament agenda when it comes to the nuclear weapons is an agenda on which I know I find in this Parliament a partner on which I can count and as much as you can count on my personal commitment to that. So to sum up, because we are late, as usual, let me say that I was proud of representing the European Union there because I believe that that was really the way of serving our face our best face of international engagement, which is that of serving peace and stability and let me say that thanks to the efforts of many, of many, we served the EU interests and the interests of the global community at the same time and we showed, I believe, the European Union at its best.

Mr President, High Representative, I would like to start by welcoming the agreement of 14 July on the Iranian nuclear issue and personally congratulate you on your commitment to facilitating this agreement.  After more than a decade of negotiations, the agreement reached by the partners and Iran finally offers hope of providing a lasting solution to this issue and replacing confrontation and mistrust with cooperation for good. But to do that, we cannot rest on our laurels. The agreement aims to cut off Iran's access routes to the fissile material needed for nuclear weapons and provides for a system of inspection and transparency needed to verify the implementation of the agreement. The key, as you pointed out, is implementation.  The lifting of economic and financial sanctions against Iran will only be possible if the International Atomic Energy Agency sees the implementation of the commitments made in the Joint Comprehensive Action Plan. I would add that implementation is also a challenge for our European diplomacy, for the diplomacy you lead, given the recognised role of the European Union in this agreement and I am glad that you have pointed this out and highlighted this during our meeting today. At the same time, I think we need to start looking beyond this agreement and see how we can move forward on other contentious issues that still mark our relationship with Iran. First of all, within the country itself, I recall that President Rohani has also made a number of promises on the human rights situation in that country and perhaps it would be worth recalling. Finally, we must look at this agreement from the broader perspective of our goal of seeking peace and stability in the Middle East.

In the last week, some would think that the only importance was the reaction inside the US Congress, but today’s debate demonstrates European support for a European deal. We should not be deflected in developing our own European strategy to follow up its implementation. Europe expects Iran to keep its promises, but we have to show we will be a reliable partner in keeping our own promises in return.  We have heard from the High Representative about the setting-up of the interinstitutional task force and I would like to ask her about the Parliament’s role in that task force in helping bring forward a new era of cooperation ranging from energy to education to the environment, as she outlines. We endorsed the proposal for the opening of an EU delegation in Tehran. But Europe is not, and will not, be uncritical. Europe’s response can and must strengthen reformists within Iran. We will criticise the death penalty, but when 80% of the executions are drug-related – and the Iranians told us themselves that their policies in combating drugs are failing – surely EU cooperation in the fight against drugs can have some real influence.  Similarly, we have a difficult but essential job to engage Iran in the fight against ISIS and in resolving the conflicts within the region, thus dealing with the causes of today’s migrant crisis, not just its symptoms. But today America is talking to the Russians and the Russians are talking to the Iranians. We need to talk about how we can engage Iran in the cause of peace. Finally, recognising the important statement of the Saudi foreign minister expressing satisfaction with the assurances about the deal, the wariness the Israelis have expressed to me is this: that this is a deal for 15 years, but, they ask, what about 15 years and one day? We can find an answer. In Europe’s cooperation with Iran we can seek development, which means there will be no going back. We did a nuclear deal. We now have to make sure it is a deal for development, a deal for modernity, a deal for peace.

The alternatives – military, in particular – were unrealistic and had the potential to cause further fall-out in an already destabilised region. We should not allow a new-found cooperation with Iran, however, to blind us from past experience. The regime in Iran is no stranger to being economical with the truth, and it will be the enforcement and verification measures of the deal that will judge it to have been a success or failure. Ensuring that Iran complies with the terms agreed and being prepared to swiftly reimpose EU economic sanctions are absolutely crucial. The deal should also not deter the EU and its Member States from criticising Iran where necessary. Its continued human rights abuses and sponsorship of terrorism have not been tamed by the so-called moderate President Rouhani. Under his leadership, the number of executions, including of political dissenters and minorities, has soared, with the average now standing at around two per day. We in my Group rightly and readily condemn the barbarity of ISIS, but the Iranian regime – ISIS’ mortal enemy – is only marginally better. Furthermore, we cannot ignore Iran’s funding of groups such as Hamas and Hezbollah and its continued stoking of sectarian power plays in Lebanon, Syria and Bahrain.

My compliments go to you, High Representative, your predecessors Javier Solana and Catherine Ashton, and your teams. I enjoyed seeing pictures of the almost all-female crew, but mostly the results that were reached behind closed doors. They must have inspired many women in Iran, too, who need room for participation in society and politics. Certainly the ambitious, smart, Iranian young generation inspires me. Now we must see to it that all sides stick to their commitments and implement their part of the deal. This is only the beginning. I think we have no time to lose in developing a broader EU agenda in relation to Iran, and human rights should be top of that agenda. For too long, quite frankly, they have been overshadowed by these – albeit important – negotiations. Executions; torture (which is systematic); censorship of the media, the internet, academia and art; repression of minorities; no fair trial, and lawyers like the brave Sakharov Prize winner Nasrin Sotoudeh, who are banned from practising law and have faced imprisonment. The Iranian people deserve better. Also, economically the risk is that the deal and the lifting of sanctions will only strengthen the already very strong position of a few: the Revolutionary Guards and those close to the people in power. But Iran needs a truly private sector, and I think we have work to do to make sure that EU companies do not blindly take the opportunities in the economic openings they see but are actually aware of the full picture. We must engage Iran in the explosive regional situation and talk to them in a diplomatic effort to end their support for the murderous regime of Bashar al-Assad, which continues to bomb its people, and to stop supporting terrorist organisations like Hezbollah.

On their behalf, I very strongly welcome this deal as an important step forward globally –as our High Representative rightly says – of an example towards nuclear non—proliferation. So we very much endorse the praise and recognition that Ms Mogherini, her team and indeed her predecessors do rightly deserve. Yes, the stars had to align in a wider context, but this was the EU acting as the EU for perhaps the first time, where we played a significant central role that nobody else could have done in bringing this deal home. I think that does deserve the recognition that we have heard tonight. We had a pressing need to bring Iran in from the cold. The cold war between Saudi Arabia and Iran is right now having grave consequences in the region. In Yemen, Iraq, Syria and elsewhere, we are seeing interference by both countries in the internal affairs of their neighbours. The global community had to find a way to reboot our relationship with Iran, a country that could, and should, be a strong ally. I do not think it is fanciful to think of Iran in those terms in a number of areas. So what does the future look like, now that we can think about a new relationship? I would strongly endorse Ms Schaake’s comments, and again the EU can play a role in this. We have a lot of experience in bringing mistrusting parties together. High Representative, what thought has been put into confidence-building measures across the Arabian, or indeed the Persian Gulf between the Gulf States and Iran, where a deep mistrust has been allowed to develop? Also, on human rights, Iran’s record – as we rightly say tonight – is poor. That is not unique within the region, of course, but this House in March 2014 called for an EU—Iran human rights dialogue. Can you assure us that that remains a central plank of our engagement? On trade, where we really do have muscle and leverage, after years of sanctions the EU trade diplomacy surely gives us real leverage over Iran and that dialogue.

I would like to sincerely thank the High Representative Federica Mogherini and all the staff of the European External Action Service for their great role in the negotiations. Unfortunately, as we have to say, the ultimate objective of full implementation is still a long way off, but we will assess it over time.  The reintegration of Tehran into the international community can put in crisis the sometimes too strong positions of Riad eTel Aviv and their security in considering themselves supported, regardless, by the West, even regardless of concrete actions. Let us hope that both, but above all Iran itself, can moderate their role in the conflicts over time by proxy in the region and that Israel will therefore be pushed by the agreement itself to seriously return to the negotiating table for a two-state, fair and lasting solution.

In Washington's view, the agreement should completely change the geopolitical framework of the area, creating a balance between the four regional powers, Iran, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Israel.

The Agreement will ensure the civilian nature of Iran's nuclear program through a number of important limitations and restrictions that the Government of Iran has accepted and whose compliance will be closely monitored by the International Atomic Energy Agency. It seems to me that the unanimous support of the Security Council, as you said, to Resolution 2231 is a sign of the positive welcome that virtually the entire international community has given to the Vienna Agreement.  Now a long and difficult stage is opened: the verification of compliance with the conditions. This dimension of verification is, of course, the essential guarantee of the Agreement.  But I believe that the scope of the Agreement goes beyond its very important security dimension. On the one hand, by lifting sanctions and restrictive measures, it will allow the progressive normalization of relations with Iran – also economically and commercially, with the effect that this is positive for all, including the Iranian population – and, on the other hand, will also lead to a normalization of political relations. This will create a new climate of Iran's cooperation with the international community that I would like to see a positive impact on the region.  We all know the activities and role Iran has been playing in the Middle East. Now, the new climate opened by the Agreement will hopefully allow Iran's attitude to be more constructive and contribute to the stability of a much-needed region. There we have, together with the deadly middle east peace process, the war in Syria, in Iraq, the terrible rise of Daesh and all the death and suffering and displacement of millions of people.  May Iran, along with other key players in the region, help bring much-needed stability and security, ending the war in Syria and also eradicating Daesh's terror. And I'm going to finish.

I think not – because this deal is important not only for the United States but for the whole world. And this is the level at which Europe can and should always play.

Our Union has already received the Nobel Prize for Peace, and this should be a reason for Europe to come a real global power for peace and cooperation. Allow me now to say just a few words in Romanian. This agreement is a document that is particularly aimed at nuclear non-proliferation, but it is not just about it. It opens the possibility of cooperation between the European Union, Iran and other regional actors to stabilise the situation in the Middle East, including an exit strategy for a transition to Syria. It is a document that allows cooperation to stabilise a wider area, from Iran to the Mediterranean. It's a place where Europe - and I look at Philip Hammond, I look at Deputy Chancellor Steinmeier, who go to Tehran to discuss the nuclear deal, but to talk about business as well. I look at Daniel Barenboim, who accompanies the vice-chancellor in Tehran, believing in the power of the symbol of music and multiculturalism as a message of peace. For these things, it is time for Iran and Saudi Arabia to stop the war of the proxies and Iran to change their language towards Israel in equal measure, vis-ing with the United States.

First of all, thank you to Mrs Mogherini for a really interesting introduction. I have great sympathy for the joy of the nuclear agreement with Iran, but I must also say that there have been some worrying comments on the part of the European Union. When it is said that the European Union and Iran are close friends and that there is mutual respect, I am therefore a little concerned. After all, Iran has major, great human rights problems. In the last few years alone, more than 2 000 executions have been carried out – not to mention the harsh punishments handed out by the regime to people who allow themselves to criticise it. In addition, there is discrimination against women in general in society. It's not something we can just ignore. On the contrary, it is an area on which we must focus much more on it, and where it is also essential that the Representatives of the European Union always bring it up and criticise it. When there are large press conferences where the many violations of human rights are not mentioned at all, it sends a bad signal. Even here, in the midst of joy, we must remember all the people who are suffering today from the Iranian regime.

While President Rouhani may be a moderate, we must remember that, without changes to Iran’s political and governance systems, there is no assurance that a traditionalist or a fundamentalist will not take control in the future, removing the current supreme leader’s fatwa forbidding nuclear weapons. We should respectfully bear in mind that Ayatollah Khamenei is now 76 years old. The Middle East has enough security challenges as it is, without adding a toxic mix of re—energised nuclear proliferation. Where there are now better positions to develop nuclear weapons, will we see further Middle East nations seek to become nuclear powers? Already, the Saudis have a nuclear agreement with Pakistan that potentially allows them to look towards nuclear weapons. Commissioner, I cannot see how this secures either the Middle East or the rest of the world.

The result has been buying time. The question is, who is going to use this time more efficiently? It is up to us now to answer. The essence of the Iranian regime has not changed; the same undemocratic leaders have a notorious track record of broken commitments. As there is no confidence, as Ms Mogherini admitted, the question is: will these leaders benefit from the new situation more than their partners? Asking for more concessions is impossible, because unfrozen assets will provide money for supporting Iranian proxies in the Middle East; the missile programme has been left out of the deal; part of the advanced centrifuges will be retained. But I think the central issue is our clear commitment to human and minority rights situations there. It is a basis of trust and any real progress. What alarms me most is that the human rights situation in the meantime has worsened, not improved. Under President Rouhani, there have been 2 000 executions, many of them for political motives.

I hope our colleagues in Congress will not unfairly leave him in the rain. Finally, I would also like to thank the Russian Foreign Minister – you would be surprised if I did not do so – to Minister Lavrov, because it makes it clear that if we act together, if we tackle problems together and if there is a serious will to solve them together, there is a chance of doing so.

One procedural issue that I have raised once already in this Chamber is that I think I am in my 11th hour in this hemicycle today. I am very happy that this is the case, but maybe you have to reflect a little bit on the procedures of your work, for its efficiency. This is just a suggestion.  Let me say, first of all, what many of you underlined. This is first of all a security deal, a security agreement. I can never stress this enough. First of all because the scope of the agreement itself, by its nature, was, and is still, limited – even if the word ‘limited’ is maybe not appropriate because it is historical in itself – but limited to the nuclear programme. So you would not have expected this agreement to cover other aspects of Iranian political institutional life or its relations with the rest of the world or its internal roots. It is very important to stress that this is a security agreement, also and first of all for the environment, the region of Iran, which is a region that does not enjoy very high levels of security nowadays.  We normally look to Syria, Yemen, Iraq and Daesh, and we are right to do so, but I would like to mention one other security dimension where the deal could open possibilities for investing in more security. This is Afghanistan. We tend to remove issues from the agenda once they disappear from the newspaper headlines, but the fact that we could engage with Iran also on the stabilisation of Afghanistan, which is another country neighbouring Iran, is going to be no less relevant than the rest of the work we will need to do in the Middle East.  There is another important element when it comes to stressing the fact that this is a security agreement, a non-proliferation agreement. This is first and foremost an agreement for the security of the region: starting with the security of Israel, starting with the security of the Gulf, but also for our own European security because, as Europeans, we were the ones closest to Iran of all those sitting at the negotiating table. Some of you asserted that it is only ‘10 plus years’ without a nuclear weapon. Well, ‘10 plus years’ is a relatively long time and the point will be how we use these 10 years politically. I will come back to that in a moment, but I believe that we have somehow invested in the future of the region and in the future of the country too. I am surprised that nobody in this room mentioned something that has shocked me, at least, very much: the pictures of the young Iranians celebrating in the streets. My reading of the political dynamic inside Iran is that the current Iranian leadership did something that the previous Iranian leadership did not do – decided not to do – which is investing in the possibility for their country to open up to international relations of a different kind, not starting with trust, but working to build trust in the process, and also probably investing in their own younger generations.  That image of the younger generations of Iran celebrating in the streets a diplomatic victory by the current Iranian leadership which took a different political decision from the previous one is, I think, something we have to read because it is also in our political interest in Europe to invest in that kind of Iran.  So that is why I say a lot will depend on how we use these 10 plus years that we have gained. Our role does not stop here. I said at the beginning that we will keep a role – I personally will keep a role – in the implementation of the agreement. But this is not the only role that we as the European Union will have to keep. Our work has not finished with the signing of the agreement. First, because we have the implementation phase, but also because we have to work on future political developments inside Iran and outside Iran – in the region – in which we will need to invest.  Some people asked the most difficult question: will Iran be more cooperative or more assertive and what will be the reaction of the other players in the region? I do not believe we can afford to take a passive approach to this question, to sit and watch what the different players will do. We can, as the European Union, play a role in trying to shape the future of relations in the Middle East, starting from the role we have played in facilitating the agreement. It will be difficult, it will involve a lot of energy and unity and careful management, but I see this as our role. A strong role on the implementation face and a strong, active role in trying to shape a different kind of regional framework, and also in trying to make it clear for the Iranian people who were celebrating in the streets – not, I guess, strictly on the Iranian details of the agreement, but because of the symbolic and political meaning of that agreement, namely that Iran is opening up.  We have to make a political investment of that kind, and we have a narrow path on which to do so. We have to be wise enough, courageous enough, consistent enough to walk down that path together with our partners.  This also implies our work on human rights. I mentioned that in my opening remarks, maybe some of you were not here but I mentioned that very clearly. The main reason for my visit to Tehran at the end of July was obviously to work on implementation of the agreement. That was the issue on the agenda, that was a follow-up on the deal, but nonetheless I discussed the issue of human rights with all my interlocutors, from the President to the Foreign Minister to the Speaker of the Chamber of the Parliament. And we agreed in the meetings, especially in the meeting with Mr Zarif, to have a human rights dimension to our dialogues.  If you look carefully at the video of our joint press conference, you will see that he is the one making reference to the fact that we agreed to include human rights in our common dialogue, in our common work. To me, this is highly valuable. It is something new. Obviously we have to engage in this direction and you can count on the fact that I will personally do that. I think this is something that may answer the comments many of you made. Obviously this is just the beginning, this is the start of a story. It is a beginning and we need to invest in that direction. Let me say three final words: firstly on the role of the rest of the partners we had around the table. It was indeed a victory for European diplomacy, but it was also an extraordinary example of teamwork between the European Union and the others: the US, where the administration, the White House, and John Kerry personally all invested a lot of political capital; Russia, which played a key role in achieving this result; and the Foreign Minister of China. That also helped a lot.  Let me say – and this I hope this also answers your question, Mr President, – that having an international common approach of that kind, having different interests around the table, having different points of view around the table, but managing together to find a way forward and reach an agreement, did indeed also offer hope for the fact that different global dynamics could be possible if we identify common ground and common interests. A natural reflection of that was the consensus in the Security Council, which is not something that has happened very often in these past few years.  So, yes, I do not know if it is a model, but it could also be a way to work on other issues and it could be a way too of rebuilding some degree of trust within the international community.  This does not wipe out all the things that keep us far apart from one another, but if we manage to find some common ground on some regional crisis or some global issues, such as non-proliferation where we managed to act together with a view to achieving results that are very much in line with our European agenda, then I think this is positive and we should encourage it. Someone said: trust John Kerry, trust the European ministers – I do not know. What I do know is that the real point is that we can trust the international community. We did not have just Europe or just the US or just whatever around that table. Around that table we had, somehow, the international community represented on a clear mandate originating from a Security Council resolution. That is why I say that this is an agreement that also restores trust in the international and multilateral approach and we desperately need it. This is really the European approach to diplomacy.  Finally, one word on what Marietje Schaake mentioned: the fact that the majority of our team, at least, were women. That is true. Other women too were playing key roles in some of the delegations, especially Wendy Sherman, but our delegation, our team, was indeed mainly women and I want to share with you that I was really moved in those hours by the reaction of so many women and girls, and even very young girls, not only in Iran, but also in Europe.  I think that we managed to pass on a good message, one for ourselves too because sometimes – and this is obviously natural, more than natural, and obvious – sometimes we focus on the condition of women outside the European Union, but you cannot imagine – or maybe you can imagine very well – how much too we need to understand inside our own countries that women can be a powerful force, especially for our diplomacy but also for our work ahead. That also made me proud. It was a different level of being proud, but it was a very important one. I thank you very much for all the support you have shown today, but this is just the beginning. We will need to work together closely on the follow—up, both on the implementation and on all the political challenges we will keep having ahead of us, trying to find the right direction for the region as a whole.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1631, "date": "2015-09-09.json", "name": "Rainer WIELAND", "mepid": "2323", "text": "   The next item on the agenda is the joint debate on the joint debate on the joint debate on the work of The Commission on Employment and Social Affairs , on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on social entrepreneurship and social innovation in the fight against unemployment (2014/2236(INI)) (A8-0247/2015) and - the report by Martina Dlabajové on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on the creation of a competitive EU labour market for the 21.

Today, there are more than two million companies in the social economy in the European Union that offer jobs to more than fourteen million Europeans, figures that have even improved during the crisis. Nevertheless, they are recognised only at national level in some Member States and in different legal forms.  Today's report stresses the importance of companies in the social economy through the European Union as a whole. These companies are characterized by having as their main objective the realization of their social object instead of maximizing their profits.  The social object is very diverse, such as creating employment for vulnerable groups or providing services to members of a specific community, but generically seeks to make a positive social and environmental impact. In fact, to this end, companies in the social economy reinvest the surplus that the company itself obtains with a long-term vision to ensure its sustainability, thus driving greater social innovation.  That is why we say that those companies are innovative by nature, and training must be a key pillar to support them. Greater promotion of the innovative spirit and entrepreneurship from school, as well as the values of the social economy, coupled with greater participation. These undertakings, in the education and training programmes of the Member States, will ultimately promote innovation and social entrepreneurship, which will also help the introduction of a European trusted mark for social entrepreneurship.  The realization of their social object and their strong local roots help these companies to help improve the economic, social, territorial and environmental cohesion of the European Union, as they know first-hand what specific needs they have to meet and help the integration of the groups further away from the labour market. In addition, the organizational model that characterizes them allows efficient, responsible and transparent management of their resources.  However, companies in the social economy need specific support in order to grow and be sustainable, and the first step must be to eliminate the false myth that they are not productive or un competitive, as many of them are leaders in their respective fields. This false conception of society at large makes them even more difficult than traditional companies in accessing finance.  To solve this problem, we must not only facilitate access to credit through European funds or other forms such as microcredits or collective microfinance, but we must also promote them at national and European level, promoting greater recognition and visibility through society as a whole. At the same time, we need to improve the environment in which they operate, promoting the creation of networks of companies in the social economy and facilitating the exchange of information or good practices. Finally, we also call for a rapid and effective transposition and implementation of public procurement and concessions directives that allow greater participation of companies in the social economy in public procurement procedures, at the same time as the primacy of tenders that bring greater economic and social value above the lowest price criterion.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1633, "date": "2015-09-09.json", "name": "Martina DLABAJOVÁ", "mepid": "124709", "text": "   Rapporteur. – Mr President, I must say at the outset that interest in my report exceeded expectations. Whether it was a beneficial cooperation with colleagues, for which I thank them very much, or an exchange of views or a fierce struggle for every word with other colleagues. I'm so glad my message doesn't fit. We can see that we are not indifferent to the issue of employment and the future of employment in Europe.  At present, Europe faces many serious challenges. We all know where our future efforts will have to go. The creation of new jobs, reducing unemployment and building a competitive labour market reflecting the real needs of the present is also a key issue that we need to pay due attention to. Young Europeans, in particular, are currently affected by unemployment, which is the result of some stagnation or unwillingness of some countries to proceed with long-term labour market reforms or the modernisation of labour law, many of which date back to our grandparents' time. Together, we must try to respond much more flexibly to the needs of the 21st century. The alarming youth unemployment figures in southern Europe are a signal that the youngest generation is losing the possibility of a traditional transition from school to work, losing their professional dreams and, with them, confidence in the whole system. We're running out of time. Let's stop it, we can change it together. But progress without change is not possible. What we need is a competitive labour market. A labour market that will be modernised and that will continue to change and evolve according to the times in which we live and will not stagnate in history. A labour market that will seek to balance the skills of job seekers with job vacancies, a market that monitors and evaluates employers' real needs and adjusts the offer of vocational training accordingly. Therefore, lifelong learning is extremely important to enable people of all ages to keep up with professional challenges. Let us not be allowed to look for examples of good practice and be inspired by them. With regard to the vote on my report, we can argue on every point. Some people do not like the fact that young people should be held accountable for their lives and should actively and responsibly prepare for inclusion in the workforce. Some have reservations about the economic mobility of workers within EU countries. Others, for example, disagree with the proposed changes and procedures to stabilise and develop the situation on Europe's labour markets. But now is not the time to argue about words and numbers. Now we have to decide: Are we able to accept reality? Look at a situation without political prejudice? Do we really want to build a competitive labour market together? If we continue down the same path and do the same things in the same way, change will never come. This isn't about whether we want to go more left or more right. We all have to go forward.  Whatever happens in tomorrow's vote, I will not let up on my initiative. I will continue to look for ways to connect the education system with the needs of the labour market and to motivate young Europeans to live an active life. After all, we spend a third of our lives in the workplace – and this experience is irreplaceable to every person. We cannot think that all we need is the protection of our citizens and their labour law. We would act like an overly caring mother who lovingly cares for her children but doesn't teach them the right skills in life. We must have an ambition to educate confident citizens, modern Europeans who will be well prepared for life and who will not be afraid to take responsibility for themselves and others. We must want to educate Europeans who will have a clear idea of their future and will be able to fight for it.

Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner! Minister! Ladies and gentlemen! Before I come to the oral questions, I would like to explain a few facts which underlie our oral question. We currently have 23.5 million registered unemployed in the EU and are happy that this percentage has fallen slightly. We are cheering this morning on 1.65 million new jobs created last year, but we are misbehaving that these are essentially precarious jobs, jobs that no one can live on.  Precarious employment has been the largest growth market in the employment sector for years. In Germany alone, precarious employment has increased by 70% in twenty years, while normal working conditions have fallen by 7.2%. No one can live on that! This development continues even among the young educated. Even in prosperous regions and sectors, 50% of young people are without permanent employment. We live in Europe with a quarter of the population that is poor, poor despite work. This is slowly becoming a mass experience. Ladies and gentlemen, the EU has always been a promise of social security, growing prosperity and a slow convergence of living conditions. More and more people are living the opposite. I am convinced that if people lose faith in the security of the future, Europe as a whole will lose. Employment and social affairs are not the waste of international competitiveness, but the main objective of European policy. That is why, in my opinion, and in the opinion of my committee, the Commission and the Council are called upon to step up efforts against precarious work. A detailed overview of the development of precarious employment relationships is required.  We have directives on part-time, temporary work and temporary work. What is the state of implementation in the Member States of the European Union? What can the Council report on progress in the fight against precarious work? For example, what measures is the Commission taking in the case of new zero-hours jobs, bogus self-employment, subcontracting, outsourcing and so on and so on – not to mention new forms of precarious work, such as employment sharing, casual work, crowdworking and voucher work.  I believe that we have to deal with this more intensively, with the questions: which sectoral and employment groups are particularly affected? How do the Member States ensure that, for example, the fight against youth unemployment does not lead to an increase in precarious work for young people? How does the Council intend to coordinate these efforts? For example, what support does the ILO agenda on decent work provide? I believe that we have a great deal to do in this. Can the Council tell us when this will be more on the Council's agenda? We don't know!  I would like to add a thought from this morning's discussion. The issue of migration is also an employment issue, as a result of this problem. Those who do not try to legalise illegal immigration today create illegal employment, create recipients of poverty wages and create human tools for wage dumping. That is why we should also ensure more legal immigration routes from an employment and social policy point of view.  Jean-Claude Juncker stressed this morning that the people of Europe are entitled to full employment, and he has emphasised the principle of equal pay for equal work in the same place. Both are extremely welcome from the POINT of view of the EMPL. We will support these efforts. However, I would also like to add that a triple-A in Europe in the field of social issues also means: wages on which one can live, at decent working conditions and working hours, a European minimum wage level and minimum social standards. Only then will it be round. If you want a European labour market with more mobility in the future, you can no longer afford six different groups of workers in Europe with different rights. I would remind you that, in recent months, we have treated the fiscal rules in Europe as the Ten Commandments, but on the issue of working conditions, labour rights, working time rules, fundamental rights of posted workers – we sometimes treat disrespect no differently than cavalier offences.  That cannot be the case, so I would like to remind you that we need more labour inspections at European level and common regulations for them. Work and social justice cannot be waste products of economics or increased international competitiveness!

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the economic and financial crisis which, in many Member States, has also become a social crisis, has led to an increase in the number of unemployed - although we are now pleased that the unemployment rate has fallen slightly, albeit very slightly - and has, at the same time, led to the reduction, in many cases , social benefits and rights to these benefits.  The crisis has also contributed to the increase in precarious work. This has serious implications for our economies as well as for stability and social cohesion, but also, in the long run, for the sustainability of our social protection systems. The ability of those who wish to enter paid employment is one of the core values of our society, as you pointed out. I believe that in the treaties, the idea of a social market economy refers to a high-level economy of jobs, but of quality jobs. It is therefore a key element for social recognition and participation in society. In the past, this amounted to stable employment and, to the extent desired, full-time employment.  In recent decades, the form of industrial relations has become considerably more diverse and, let's face it, has very often worsened. This trend continued during the crisis. More and more workers do not have indeterminate employment contracts and are struggling to obtain them. Sometimes they don't even succeed and therefore really plunge into a lasting precariousness. People in precarious jobs are, for the most part, faced with poor quality work, poor pay, poverty at work, insecurity and vulnerability. You have mentioned it, indeed. We are now seeing the development of a category of working poor, people who are employed but who, in fact, are no longer able to live off the wages of their work.  A 2012 report by the European Parliament's research department showed that almost 10% of Europe's working-age population was poor. I wonder, because we had a strategy that was the 2020 strategy, one of the major social objectives of which was a significant reduction of 20 million. It was therefore a quantified and not insignificant target to reduce the number of poor people in Europe by 20 million. We have not achieved that goal. I believe that when we are going to renew the 2020 strategy, we really need to focus on finding new avenues and new ways to achieve this poverty reduction target in Europe.  A comprehensive approach is therefore required. We need to focus on the different aspects of the quality of work. It is clear that we want to create jobs, return to a high level of employment, and even move towards full employment. But full employment is not enough. It is a question of getting closer, again, not only to full employment but also to creating quality jobs. When we talk about quality jobs, we are looking at the right pay, benefits and working conditions, and safety and health in the workplace.  Tomorrow, in Luxembourg, there will be a conference on workplace safety and health and working conditions. This debate on working conditions, particularly in the framework of the European Health and Safety Strategy, seems to us to be extremely important and europe will of course have to renew this strategy on safety and health.  As for access to education and vocational training, I must welcome the report on the competitiveness of labour markets, as it highlights the importance of vocational training and shows very well that if we want to have inclusive and even competitive labour markets, one of the keys is access to training. I believe that in the long run in Europe, in order to cope also with changes in the labour market and the technological revolution, it will be necessary to ensure that every employee and every worker has a real right to training because training is his guarantee of securing his professional careers. We know that the economy is changing and changing a great way and that you cannot guarantee that someone will be able to keep the same job for the rest of their lives, as they did thirty, forty or fifty years ago. But we must give every employee the guarantee that he will be able to follow this evolution of the labour market and find a job if his or hers disappears. Combating and preventing unreported work will also help to improve the quality of employment for those working in Precarious. In this regard, I hope that the negotiations between our two institutions on the decision to establish a platform to combat undclared work can be concluded as soon as possible. A trilogue was held this week; We have to move on. For the Presidency, the aim is to achieve this by the end of the year. Young people, as you mentioned, are a particularly vulnerable group, as are others, for example, people with disabilities, who have a lot of difficulties in the labour market. Good quality work is one of the key elements of the Council's 2013 recommendation on the creation of the Youth Guarantee. The main recommendation is to ensure that all young people under the age of 25 receive a good quality job offer, an offer of continuing education, apprenticeship or internship within four months of redundancy or after leaving formal education. I am also referring to a recommendation from the Commission on internships because, in my opinion, as important as internships are for young people and for their integration into the labour market, we must also recognise that there is an abuse in terms of internships. In Germany, we are talking about the Generation Praktikum, that is, young people who go from one internship to another without real remuneration, without social guarantees and without the prospect of finding an indeterminate contract. As a result, these young people live for many years in a real precarious situation. I would also add that Parliament, in fact, dealt a lot with this aspect of internships a few years ago, and I believe of course that there are states that have dealt with or regulated this issue of internships. It is indeed necessary, especially for young people, to find coherent solutions in this area.  I would also add that women are disproportionately represented in precarious jobs. They may have very short hours, low pay and limited access to allowances. And let's not talk about their pension rights! In reality, we are creating new sources of poverty.  Yes, there is the issue of the minimum social wage and I welcome the introduction, finally, of a minimum social wage in the country where you come from. But in Europe, I think there are 21 or 22 countries that have a minimum social wage. The minimum social wage is therefore not, on its own, a guarantee against poverty. It all depends, of course, on the level of this minimum wage.  Indeed, I believe that we must once again make the organisation of work and the labour market, as was also presented in this very interesting report on competitiveness and labour markets, a great subject in Europe to, precisely, to ensure that economic recovery also goes hand in hand with new social guarantees and with social progress.  I also see an important role for the social partners. The Latvian Presidency has made social dialogue a major issue. In my view, social partners have an important role to play. I would also like to point out that there is still a framework agreement that was concluded in Europe in 2010 on inclusive labour markets and that this framework agreement between social partners provided for a number of interesting elements to prevent precariousness, to make labour markets work better and guarantee social rights. Social dialogue must be encouraged and promoted at European and national level. It also means preserving the right to collective agreements because there is no social dialogue without a strong right to collective bargaining.  I will add a word about wage policy. Wage policy has two aspects: the social aspect, namely being able to make a living from one's work. But it also has an economic dimension. We see this today, in fact, in the sharing of value-added in Europe as in the United States — it is not for nothing that President Obama is strongly committed to raising wages in the United States. This recovery and sharing also have an important economic dimension.  Finally, the Luxembourg Presidency has made the social dimension one of its priorities. I would also like to mention in this context the social and solidarity economy, which was presented in the other excellent report, which I welcome. The Presidency has also made the promotion of the social and solidarity economy one of its main priorities, since we will be organising a major conference in Luxembourg in December on the promotion of social entrepreneurship and we will propose to the Council to adopt conclusions on the development, strengthening and promotion of the social economy in general, and social entrepreneurship in particular. Precarious employment, we must knowledge, is damaging to cohesion and to our economies. It blocks the prospects of an entire generation of young people. This risks leading to a vicious cycle by increasing inequality and generating both insecurity and instability.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 2, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1636, "date": "2015-09-09.json", "name": "Valdis DOMBROVSKIS", "mepid": "28618", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission. – Mr President, Minister, honourable Members of the European Parliament, I am pleased to contribute at this point to the joint debate on a series of essential topics related to the EU labour market. They touch upon the challenges we need to address in order to firmly anchor the EU into recovery, economic growth, job creation and social progress.  The European Commission wants a AAA social rating for the EU and the recent Five Presidents’ report makes it clear that the notion of convergence is at the heart of the economic Union.  The two own-initiative reports, the Dlabajová report and the Lope Fontagné report, focus on important topics for our labour markets and we see that their conclusions are generally supportive of the Commission’s policies. We want quality jobs and the skilled workers that we need to support recovery. We support social innovation that helps protect our societies. First, on the oral question on precarious employment: it is undeniable that the crisis has had a significant social impact on the labour market, particularly the increase in unemployment, under-employment and precarious employment. Precariousness is difficult to define and monitor statistically, but we can approach it via the evolution of temporary contracts and part-time work. Let me be clear that temporary work and part-time work do not necessarily equate to precarious work as they also introduce necessary flexibility to the labour market.  The figures confirm that temporary work follows an economic cycle. They first declined in 2008, but they also first recovered in 2013. Actually, they increased by 8.7 % during this period. That is to say part-time employment increased by 8.7 % during that period but, on the contrary, full-time employment decreased dramatically. Even though the creation of full-time jobs outnumbers the creation of part-time jobs since 2014, those figures still remain 4.6 % below the 2008 level. Hence, there are signals of recovery but serious challenges remain. Initiatives have already been introduced at EU level to determine a minimum set of rights for workers who are subject to the more precarious forms of contracts, namely the three directives on fixed-term, part-time and temporary agency work. It is worth recalling that two of those directives – i.e. on fixed-term and part-time work – are the fruit of social dialogue since they are based on a framework agreement between Europe’s trade unions and employers. They all aim to guarantee decent working conditions for the workers concerned, notably ensuring the principle of equal treatment while providing businesses with the flexibility they need to overcome traditional difficulties and ensure their development. While the fixed-term and part-time directives are being currently evaluated, the European Commission has already released a report on the Temporary Agency Work Directive. This report was published last year and it concludes that the directive has been correctly implemented and applied and that there is no need for revising it at this stage. The Commission would rather focus on ensuring its proper implementation. New forms of employment have been developed, some with a clear risk of precariousness. Undeclared work and bogus self-employment are among the most harmful forms of precarious employment. We monitor these developments and we consider action at EU level where appropriate. Furthermore, in the framework of the European semester on economic policy coordination, the European Commission recommends that Member States tackle the segmentation of labour markets and fight undeclared work. In 2014, we also proposed to create a platform to prevent and deter undeclared work. The proposal is under discussion by the co-legislators and the Commission expects an agreement to be reached in the near future so that the platform can be set up without delay. The Commission is also examining whether a strengthened set of EU social rights for the protection of those in and out of work would be needed, notably in the light of new forms of employment. The role of social partners is permanent. While consultation with social partners in the European semester is being strengthened and streamlined at EU level, the involvement in the design and implementation of national reforms also needs to be strengthened. Low-skilled workers who may be caught in a vicious circle unless we take the issues of skills seriously are more affected by precariousness. In order to fight unemployment, guarantee quality in employment and allow Europe to grow in a sustainable way, we need to ensure the right skills for our workers. We therefore welcome Mrs Dlabajová’s report, which sets out a number of ways to achieve those goals and enrich the European skills agenda which we are currently developing. We converge on three key policy needs. First, together with all labour market stakeholders, anticipating skills needs and access skills gaps across the EU. Second, developing skills with more and better vocational education and training and apprenticeships and thereby bringing skills closer to the labour market’s needs. Finally, improving recognition of skills formally or informally acquired at any point in time across Member States and sectors, which is essential to support mobility as a factor of employability and competitiveness. On the Lope Fontagné report on social entrepreneurship and social innovation, this is another sector which helps to fight unemployment and encourage work is social entrepreneurship. Its role is rightly underscored in the Lope Fontagné report. Many good actions have been taken both at EU and Member State level, but we agree that there is room and need for further concrete initiatives. We need a comprehensive approach as it is especially important for social enterprises to combine better access to finance with better visibility and to develop a vision and enabling regulatory framework. Finance is not enough if visibility and proper recognition by policy makers at all levels are not ensured. The Commission provides several channels of financial support but it is also taking initiatives, for instance with the OECD, to better understand the sector and support Member States in their efforts to build up an environment conducive to social enterprises. Moreover, I agree with the rapporteurs that we need to promote social innovation since it plays a critical role in modernising our social protection systems. Social innovation is also financially supported both in the European Social Fund and in the employment and social innovation programme.

I am delighted that, on the day the President of the European Commission delivered his speech on the state of the European Union, we have the opportunity to have a comprehensive discussion on the labour market and employment in Europe. I will fully believe, after Jean-Claude Juncker, that the economic crisis will end if we succeed in full employment. Today, decisive steps and bold, well-thought-out structural reforms in the labour market are needed to unambiguously improve efficiency and safety.  Recently, together with Martina Dlabayova and colleagues from the political groups, I had the pleasure of working on a very good report by the Committee on Employment on the need to adapt the skills and qualifications of workers to job vacancies. If we want to have a competitive labour market in Europe in the 21st century, we must first of all teach young people starting their careers responsibility for their own decisions and prepare them for the need for continuous education and requalification. Despite high unemployment, entrepreneurs are too often unable to find a candidate with the right experience and skills. This continues to show that curricula have not been adapted to employers' requirements. In this area, immediate concrete action is needed. It must be standard practice to cooperate efficiently between universities, businesses and public and private employment services, as well as the employees themselves. In addition, there is a need to constantly monitor future trends in labour markets and anticipate the need for skills and qualifications. Incentives are needed for small and medium-sized enterprises to be willing to invest profits in training for workers. These and other valuable recommendations are contained in the report on which we will vote tomorrow. The Group of the European People's Party is determined to combat inequalities in the labour market, unfair abuse and circumvention of European legislation in order to lower social standards. We are responsible for the use of fixed-term contracts, self-employment institutions. These are instruments that should not be abused in order to reduce labour costs.

This has nothing to do with the crisis alone, this development began long before. This applies not only to the low-skilled, but also to engineers and highly qualified people. More than 2.3 million part-time jobs have been created since 2011. Many people in Europe work part-time on forced part-time because they do not get a full-time job. The proportion of fixed-term contracts also remains consistently high, and the sole dictates of competitiveness mean that for more and more people, if they work full-time, they will no longer be able to make a living, that the general public will pay to be able to afford housing, heating and food. The European reality is: posted construction workers or drivers, working for a starvation wage or without social protection, companies, for example in the logistics sector, whose regular workforce consists of temporary workers or employed subcontractors, contracts without working time guarantees, so-called zero-hour contracts, workers on call, for example in the fast food sector, or pilots who, like many other professions, are forced into bogus self-employment, newcomers to the profession, university graduates who go from one unpaid traineeship to the next – that is the reality of Europe! And these are very few examples. This is really pure exploitation under the guise of the flexibility of the labour market. Precarious and illegal employment must not be the rule. For a social triple-A in Europe, we need new legislation, and we need clear definitions of workers. We do not need to observe the long-known loopholes, we need to plug them.

It is a good example of why, just because something is difficult, we should not give up. It is worth fighting for, and it has produced very worthwhile ideas which are concise and targeted and can add real value to the employability and prosperity of people. I will focus on just a couple of areas in particular: entrepreneurship and work—based learning. The report highlights the need to remove bureaucratic obstacles with which SMEs are confronted and enable them to achieve their full job—creation potential. It highlights the need to promote an entrepreneurial mindset in Europe: the need for institutions to be more business—friendly and to support young people in transforming their ideas into successful business plans. It also recognises the importance of fostering work—based learning – apprenticeships – as the alternative route to employment. I was very privileged to visit the Goodwin Group in Stoke-on-Trent last Friday. It is an engineering company established in 1883, and they believe that a radical new approach is needed to raise the level of the individual worker to the standard required for the future. So they have built their own state—of—the—art training school with a centre of excellence for 125 engineering apprentices.

First of all, I want to thank Ms Lope Fontagné for her excellent cooperation and congratulate her on her very comprehensive report on social entrepreneurship and social innovation in combating unemployment. We have heard that these enterprises employ 14 million people and contribute to social inclusion, rural and regional development and environmental protection. Crucially, these jobs cannot be outsourced. Yet in my opinion, these enterprises deserve greater support than at present. I fully support the recommendations in this report, in particular the need for a legal framework.  Secondly, precarious employment: Commissioner Dombrovskis has told us that it is difficult to define and monitor precarious work. I say to him that this may be true, but equally what most people want is a decent job that will enable them to support themselves and their families. You quoted figures from the Commission’s own social and economic report for the last quarter. But there is another statistic from that report which tells us that in the final quarter of 2015 two thirds of the jobs created were permanent, one third were temporary. The question is: will that one third support families? Probably not. We can and must do better.  Finally, a comment on the excellent report from my colleague Martina Dlabajová on matching skills and qualifications with demand and job opportunities.

Mr President, as a Left, we have in the past supported social enterprises with all our might, for example in the context of cooperation. We therefore know and appreciate the potential of these businesses, which focus on people and social development rather than maximising their profits. The report on social enterprises that we are called upon to vote on contains positive elements, such as the definition of those enterprises characterised by the primacy of individual and social objectives over the interests of capital and such as democratic control by their members and the defence and application of the principles of solidarity and responsibility. There is a clear reference to the inability of any undertakings to replace the social state, which was, after all, our amendment. As a Left, however, we cannot tolerate the abolition of the principles of social entrepreneurship and we cannot allow these companies to enter the stock markets and be used by the financial funds either for tax avoidance purposes or to multiply profitability. We believe that social enterprises should remain committed to their social work and should not be used as a gambling vehicle by stock market groups. The European Union must change course and move away from the beaten-up of neoliberalism and unbridled capitalism.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is time for Europe to turn a blind eye to an indisputable fact. The social and solidarity economy has done much better than resist the crisis, it is one of the best antidotes to the crisis. In ten years, the social and solidarity economy has created 23% of jobs, while the traditional economy has created only 7%. There are already 14 million employees in Europe today. It is this producer of milk and yoghurt that produces for the canteens of its territory, for retirement homes and for families. It is this entrepreneur who organizes meetings between young parents and nannies via an internet platform. It is this marketing company that employs 100% of disabled workers and gives them the place they deserve in society.  We are talking about an economic model that makes sense to those who work and benefit from it. What for? Because human beings take precedence over profit, because they allow their members to become employers, employees and, tomorrow, responsible consumers. We are talking about an economic model that provides jobs that cannot be relocated, open to all, and that is not a detail especially for the younger generation. It is up to us only to really extend this model to our entire territory, including by facilitating their access to financing. Let us introduce social and environmental criteria into public procurement to give priority to works that bring them the highest added value, not only economic, but social and environmental, rather than those who simply play the low-cost card. So, ladies and gentlemen, dear Commission, I am sending you a solemn appeal. We are three months away from COP 21. You are able to send that message today. Reconciling the climate with the environment, reconciling the climate with the economy, reconciling the climate with the social, reconciling the climate with well-being but above all reconciling the climate with solidarity.

The measures taken usually exacerbate the problems rather than solve them.

This has been helped by the labour reforms imposed, undermining workers' rights for the benefit of enterprises. Today we are debating a competitive labour market that is incompatible with a democratic conception of labour, as workers are treated as goods, numbers in the game of supply and demand. Speaking of individuals, we forget to talk about structures, institutions that condition the volume and quality of employment. It is not a problem of will, capacity or individual initiative. It is even indecent to suggest this when so many are forced to migrate or work in precarious conditions, while the numbers of poverty and inequality continue to grow. Individualization of industrial relations has been encouraged rather than collective bargaining strengthened. Any model changes in the productive structure have been abandoned and, as a measure of employment promotion, business contributions are reduced or rewarded, which also impair a fundamental mechanism to combat poverty, such as pensions.

My colleague's report places great emphasis on the fact that the mobility of workers in Europe is low and I agree that a united Europe cannot afford 0-point mobility. Our task as representatives of european citizens is certainly to encourage it, and we in the 5-Star Movement believe in the importance of labour mobility in Europe, but only if this represents a voluntary opportunity for personal growth and not the obligatory consequence of the lack of work in some countries and relocation, because this would make some countries even poorer and others even richer. , contributing to European disintegration rather than integration.  The creation of a strong and stable labour market certainly depends on investment in education, the fight against early school leaving and the creation of a new entrepreneurial culture. That is why I also very much appreciated the strong reference to small and medium-sized enterprises, which is at the heart of economic productivity and job creation. The creation of a labour market suitable for the 21st century also involves incentives for start-ups, micro-enterprises and, above all, greater dissemination of the entrepreneurial culture among young people.

The commonly accepted definition is related to the worker's perception of safety at work, a focus that is wrong. If, on the one hand, forms of undeclared, informal or irregular work, or even false green receipts are undoubtedly forms of precarious work and are, first of all, illegal, the Commission has a duty to untangle other forms of work which are currently defined and which are of the free choice and interest of the worker.  For example, it should be considered that part-time work may correspond to a parental right to accompany a child or even to a form of employment of a student worker. This confusion of criteria leads to a difficulty for the European Union in tackling precariousness at work, which is therefore exploited by various employers who abuse the most vulnerable for their own benefit. I would therefore like to know whether the Commission has taken this diversity into account and that there is a need for some mechanism to be objective, a necessary condition for us to be effective in this fight. On the other hand, the Commission needs to be in line with the effects on the labour market of its policies in other sectors, such as the end of the reader quota system. In this row, we are witnessing the decline in employment, as a result of the continued and abrupt fall in milk prices, with a particular impact on the most vulnerable regions, such as the outermost regions, including the Azores, which is my region.

It is very easy to pass the buck and say it is an issue for national governments; something to be resolved at national level. But the truth is that it is just not happening.  Nothing is being done and the situation is getting worse. For example, recent statistics have shown there are now an estimated 1.8 million zero-hours contracts in the UK, an increase of nearly 20% in the past year alone.  Given that the majority of people on these contracts have been with their current employer for over a year working on average 23 hours a week, does the Commission not understand that these contracts threaten the standards created to protect workers? Why are we allowing a system where people – often young, often women and often close to the poverty line – are expected to work full-time hours when it suits the employer but given no protection or guarantee of employment in return?  It is not sustainable, and it certainly is not fair. They still have to feed their kids and pay their rent.

The so-called employed are workers who, instead of enjoying an employment contract that corresponds to the permanent job they often occupy - often even in public institutions - are workers who have the so-called employment and insertion contract, attend an internship or a vocational training course and are not unemployed.  Last June, in Portugal, there were already more than 150,000 workers who had this kind of precarious bond, about 50,000 of them with such a contract called employment and insertion, in which workers work like any other worker but earn below the minimum wage.

This makes it all the more important that they are more widely recognised in politics, society and the media at local, regional, national and European level. The European Commission, Commissioner, should consistently implement all the measures taken under the 2012 Social Entrepreneurship Initiative and, in my view, also promote them in the future through national programmes of the European Social Fund. And banks should do more, as social enterprises often have far too little access to finance. The reason is that this type of company is not sufficiently well known by many banks. That is why the creation of a special European fund for the banking sector has a particular signalling effect. In addition, we are encouraged by the Employment and Social Innovation Programme, in which we have a sub-programme for social entrepreneurship.

We must fight for EU funds to be disbursed more effectively and to really reach those who need them on the ground. We must ensure that even the groups most excluded from the labour market, in particular people with disabilities, are reached and guaranteed in their inclusion. In the report we have made clear the need for full and fair access to contracts by social enterprises.  In some countries such as Italy, but not only, it is precisely the cooperative movement that is making a mass mobilization, with petitions and legislative proposals to combat abuses, exploitation and even criminal events in the world of the social economy, precisely because in the history and values of the international cooperative movement, the fight against those who exploit workers damages society. I believe that this should be given credit for, it should be remembered, valued and not denigrated.  In conclusion, I want to say that the labour market in Europe is changing rapidly, reacting and adapting to the demographic challenges of technological innovations.

Countries like Greece and Spain needed their own currencies so they could depreciate to protect activity levels in the worst of the crisis. The euro meant they could not do that, so activity levels collapsed, taking jobs with them.  Thanks in part to the recent application of quantitative easing (QE), there has been some softening of the euro, but there is, of course, no chance of Greece or Spain depreciating against Germany. When the German economy is going full pelt again, no doubt there will be pressure for QE to end, interest rates to rise and the euro to rise again in value.

The economic and financial crisis is a painful lesson for us. It clearly demonstrates the crucial importance of building a cohesive, inclusive society in which everyone has a role to play and in which the potential of every citizen is developed, valued and supported regardless of their gender, age, disability or education. By rebuilding the European economy, we must strive to restore citizens' trust in public institutions and to build social capital. Strategic partnerships between the public sector, educational institutions, business and NGOs are needed to achieve this ambitious goal. Better preparing young people for labour market requirements requires changes in the education system, in particular the introduction of a dual model and entrepreneurship education. As my colleague Šojdrová pointed out yesterday, when presenting her report, entrepreneurship is the ability to put ideas into practice, and entrepreneurship education triggers creativity, initiative, innovation, independence of thought and many other important characteristics, both professionally, socially and civicly.

Lack of economic predictability and flexible work are an important component. This precariousness takes various forms, such as the development of part-time work, fixed-term contracts and the use of temporary jobs. It also takes an illegal form, illegal through unreported work or the proliferation of false independents. These fraudulent practices must be firmly combated, including through the effective establishment of the platform to combat undclared work, by strengthening social inspections and their coordination, and by setting up and setting up a social Europol, a European social inspection.

Overtime is being paid less and less. It is clear that collective bargaining in many countries has been deteriorating. The temporality has gone up a lot. Bias in contracts, not beloved on many occasions, has been increasing. And above all, within this logic of internal devaluation that has occurred in recent years within the euro.

The European labour market is currently facing a number of problems, including skills mismatch with the needs of the labour market and low labour mobility of the European Union, which, despite the twenty-five million unemployed, we still have two million vacancies in the Union. Statistics illustrating the details of this phenomenon are atomised, collected and analysed at regional level, while meta-analyses are needed to create a coherent European Union policy in this area, giving a picture of the whole of Europe. Adequate market monitoring at European Union level is therefore another urgent task that would build a healthy and competitive labour market. The main barriers to european mobility identified in the research are, paradoxically, ignorance or poor knowledge of foreign languages, cultural differences, lack of guaranteed housing and complex administrative procedures. The rationale needed to modify existing anti-unemployment programmes, such as Eures, can be inferred from them. In order to increase mobility, clear procedures for recognising the qualifications of citizens from different European Union countries, emphasis on foreign language education and training and training to improve intercultural communication are also needed. Matching skills with market needs, in turn, requires changes in the education system, in particular the rehabilitation of vocational training, close cooperation between schools and the labour market, the popularisation of dual education at all levels of education, taking into account social and humanities fields, and a meaningful apprenticeship programme and the presence of professionals in higher education. Many European Union countries have positive experiences in the above-mentioned areas, such as Germany in dual education and in school-market cooperation. So it's worth taking advantage of and taking inspiration from those systems that produce good results. They are based on cooperation between schools not only with large workplaces, but also with the communities of craftsmen and small family businesses, which are a pillar of the European economy.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1678, "date": "2015-09-09.json", "name": "Georgi PIRINSKI", "mepid": "124855", "text": "   – Mr President, I would like to refer you to two points that President Juncker particularly stressed this morning regarding employment that are of direct relevance to this debate. Firstly, that refugees must be given the chance to work, which – besides letting them earn money – is a matter of basic human dignity. Secondly, it is actually full employment that we should be striving to achieve.  The report on a competitive labour market has the severe impediment of proceeding from the assumption that people are inclined to remain idle or passive behind rigid protective social and labour barriers, since they supposedly lack the necessary entrepreneurial spirit and impulse to be mobile: a deeply flawed defining proposition, since it is at odds with the basic human preference for a life in dignity and the accompanying desire to engage in productive work given the chance to find meaningful and rewarding jobs.  Conversely, and quite correctly, the other report highlights the need to enable social- and solidarity-based enterprises to grow, and urges Member States to promote the cooperative enterprise model, precisely as contributing factors so that the social- and solidarity-based economy may fulfil its defining mission to provide full, high-quality employment. In this regard, I would like to urge Commission Vice-President Dombrovskis to personally commit himself to ensuring that the Commission responds positively to the call, contained in the report, for the Commission to come forward with a legal framework codifying a dependable specific status for such enterprises, defined as having other objectives than simply profit for shareholders As to the platform on undeclared work, just a word to assure you – since I am the rapporteur on behalf of Parliament – that we shall do everything in our power to enable the inauguration of this platform before the end of the year.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1679, "date": "2015-09-09.json", "name": "Siegfried MUREŞAN", "mepid": "124802", "text": "   – Mr President, the 23 million unemployed people in Europe are the result not only of the economic crisis of the past years, but also the result of structural shortcomings within EU labour markets. We have to tackle these if we are to create more employment in Europe in the years to come.  Therefore I advocate three solutions: firstly, facilities for labour mobility, secondly, an improved entrepreneurial environment and, thirdly, a better way of matching the education system and employers’ needs, mainly through vocational education. On the first point, labour mobility: nowadays citizens have to move to where the jobs are. Therefore, cities need to provide enough affordable housing for people from rural areas who need a second house in the city for working days during the week. A further point on labour mobility: we talk a lot about people moving between EU Member States, but we also need to talk more about people moving within an EU Member State. There are still significant discrepancies between regions in terms of employment opportunities within a country. I therefore call on the Commission to establish a catalogue of best practices to stimulate mobility within a Member State and to share these experiences with Member States which still have work to do on labour mobility. Secondly, on improving the entrepreneurial environment, we all know the Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs programme established by the Commission. It is a good programme, which I fully support, but it needs to be complemented by a similar programme at national level. The Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs programme obliges you to move from your home country to another country to undertake a traineeship paid by the Commission with an already established entrepreneur. It is a good programme and I give it my full support, but Member States should also launch and publicly finance such programmes at national level in order to stimulate mobility within the Member States. The Commission could assist, based on its experience with Erasmus for Young Entrepreneurs at European level.

It sounds to me as if social dumping, precarious working conditions, the whole range that we know so much – zero-hours contracts and so on and so forth – are the panacea for making the labour market competitive. I know countries – and these are certainly the richer ones in the European Union – where it has already become a system for wages to not be enough, namely that taxpayers will eventually have to shell out so that people can get by on their incomes. An absurd situation! This has nothing to do with competition, it is unfair competition and it has nothing to do with it in the European Union. The free movement of workers and mobility are, of course, important principles that we should defend. However, the mobility of workers is an instrument in our internal market that can be used by workers, which is intended to give them an advantage, but which does not need to be used.

This formula of success is as simple as it is complex, because the foundation of a prosperous Europe is in quality human capital.  It is really time to invest in our people, in our young generation and especially in our talents. The number of young people out of training or employment is indeed too high. There is also an increase in the number of dropouts from school. Even young people with a high level of education fail to find a professional realization. However, this does not mean that our young generation is incapable, it simply means that the knowledge and skills being promoted do not meet the needs of the labour market. Unemployment has been a key word in Europe for too long and this negative trend needs to change. Therefore, we need to direct young people to the professions of the future, those that do not even exist, to create quick-thinking, creative staff with excellent digital skills and analytical abilities.

Its availability is more important than any other human need. The life and health of a person and the development of his family depend on work. Member States and the European Union should work towards the best and most effective solutions to create new jobs. This is combined with multiple directions of activity. On the one hand, entrepreneurs, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, which are the largest source of jobs and at the same time the companies that are able to adapt most flexibly to the situation, should be supported. Without the promotion of entrepreneurship, without reducing financial costs and bureaucracy, it is impossible to effectively increase the number of new jobs. On the other hand, we should increase the mobility of society in Europe, especially for young people, because mobility is one of the conditions for responding to the needs of the labour market, also from an international point of view, and not just from a local, regional or national level. Most importantly, education, including vocational education, must be supported and modernised. It needs to be improved and adapted to the requirements of the modern knowledge economy. Practical vocational training and planning strategies for the development of education must be subordinated to the future needs of the labour market and not only to the present.

It is also important to ensure that such companies receive administrative support and access to finance. In cohesion policy, we already have instruments that these companies can use. It is important that they are aware of these opportunities and receive appropriate support during application and implementation.

Second, we need to adapt The 2020 strategy with innovative approaches to promote quality employment, to combat poverty and exclusion, and to focus on training in all its forms. In this context, I believe that social entrepreneurship also has an important place. In fact, Madam, I was in Madrid, Spain, a few months ago, to see the dynamism of the social economy in this country.  Third, there are major technological changes, and I think we need to take very seriously what has been said about digitization and its impact on the labour market. In fact, during the last Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumers Council, the Presidency will address the issue of labour market, skills and skills implications.

Making the European labour market competitive is a major challenge when you consider the EU unemployment figures. One word often comes up: flexibility. Labour market reforms must promote flexible pathways and training, flexible labour markets and greater mobility of workers. The main idea is therefore to make the workforce malleable to comply with the requirements of the market: in other words, it is the market that decides and men only have to obey. The widespread use of the EURES network and immigration must complete this process. Thus, in order to adapt European labour markets to the context of globalisation, the EU opts for the displacement of populations: too bad for the social dumping that is organised!

Social and solidarity-based economy enterprises have demonstrated their adaptability to economic and social circumstances and offer more flexible and innovative working conditions. This is influenced by the fact that social economy enterprises are well established at local and regional level, and this gives them an advantage because they know the specific needs and can offer the right solutions.

Furthermore, the Commission is addressing sustainability challenges in healthcare systems in the EU by including relevant criteria in various actions – as has been the case, for example, in previous exercises of the European Semester – and by using a variety of policy tools. The Commission shares the general concern about the affordability of new medical products and the related risks of inequalities arising in access to care, and it is committed to helping Member States respond to this challenge. This commitment was highlighted in the Commission’s communication of April 2014 on effective and resilient health systems, which, among other things, focuses on increasing the accessibility of health systems. The communication stressed the need for improved cooperation, increased transparency and better coordination to minimise any unintended effects that current national pricing systems may have in terms of accessibility throughout the EU. The Commission has no competence to regulate the level of prices of medical treatments: these are determined by Member States individually. The Commission could, however, explore other avenues, for example by pursuing improved exchanges of information among Member States on their pricing policies, with a view to minimising negative effects on the accessibility of medicines in the EU. Another way in which the Commission could assist would be through further exploring the use of the Joint Procurement Mechanism to encourage more advantageous price offers from the pharmaceutical industry. The transposition deadline for the directive on patients’ rights to cross- border healthcare was 25 October 2013. A number of Member States were either late transposing the directive or transposed it incompletely. Where necessary, the Commission launched infringement proceedings against these Member States. As a result, nearly all Member States have now transposed the directive in its entirety. There is a small number of cases outstanding, which will be resolved in a near future. The next stage for the Commission is to assess whether Member States have transposed the directive correctly. The Commission and the Member States are exploring the possibility of producing a joint EU health technology assessment (HTA) report to inform decision makers about clinical outcomes of new health technologies. Member States will continue to work under the remit of the upcoming European Network for Health Technology Assessment (EUnetHTA) joint action to implement the HTA strategy adopted in October 2014, cooperating together on joint assessments of technologies and addressing methodological challenges. Joint forces and expertise will help decision-makers to make more informed and faster choices on access to innovative treatments. There is, however, no willingness to harmonise decisions on either the uptake of technologies or pricing and reimbursement.

Despite this, there are some cross-cutting problems that unite all systems, even those of the richest countries: the data tell us that, for example, as many as 86% of European hospitals suffer from a shortage of medicines, often these are very serious deficiencies, which even concern essential drugs such as those for basic chemotherapy therapies. This is a real paradox! Medicines are approved at European level, but the Eu ropean Union does not have a coordinated action plan to tackle the shortage of medicines. Parallel imports, as the Commissioner mentioned a few days ago, are also often the cause of inequalities in access to essential medicines. In this context, I believe it is necessary to create a complete European framework in order to have a picture of the shortcomings. EMA's efforts to put together a European catalogue of shortcomings are laudable, but unfortunately they have not so far borne fruit.  There is also no framework for the cost of medicines at European level, today each Member State has its own procedures, which means that the same drug is evaluated 28 times, resulting in waste of resources, time, and lack of access to life-saving medicines. Let me give you an example, Trastuzumab, a powerful breast cancer drug that is included in the World Health Organisation's list of essential medicines, has not been distributed fairly in Europe and in some European countries it has taken more than 7-8 years for the drug to be made available to patients. So how many European citizens have died?  In order to move towards harmonisation in the definition of prices between countries at European level, it is necessary to define a Health Technology Assessment at European level, which applies as a reference for all countries.

However, I think that we should go to the core of the issue. The core is that our healthcare systems were developed in a previous century when people mainly died from malnutrition and infections. But now we see people suffering from chronic diseases, requiring years of innovative treatment. Healthcare spending in the EU has grown by nearly 50% since 2000, to almost 12% of European GDP, and it will continue to rise. Nor is it only drug pricing which is to blame. This means that we have to look fundamentally at how we run our healthcare systems if we want to keep them open, qualitative and affordable for everybody. I have heard many good proposals coming from the Commissioner’s side. The Commission is trying to coordinate, invest and exchange information, setting up networks and sharing best practices, but this will not result in the changes that we really need.  Therefore, I would like to make three concrete proposals. First of all, there are major differences in healthcare spending between Member States. The European Semester could serve as a tool to monitor healthcare quality, organisation and spending. Recommendations per Member State and follow-up of implementation of best practice by the Commission would then be key.  Secondly, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has estimated that 20% to 40% of healthcare budgets are wasted due to inefficiencies. So we have to keep a competitive edge when it comes to innovation. This means creating a simplified, stable and favourable environment for investing in healthcare, ranging from drug development to e-health applications to prevention strategies, bringing down the cost for the whole system. Thirdly, I want to make a very concrete suggestion as to where the EU can really provide added value. It is in the field of rare diseases and orphan drugs. I call for the establishment of a European rare disease fund which would harmonise the health technology assessment procedure, making it easier for companies to enter all European markets and obtain reimbursement. The combined Member States would have a stronger negotiating position over the price and the fund would guarantee access for all patients suffering from a rare disease to the most novel and innovative treatments. The Rare Disease Regulation is a decade old so let us finish this work. We have to change our thinking about healthcare and the way that we look at European healthcare systems, so I count on the Commission to lead the way. I think that we will support you in many aspects.

If access to care for all is threatened throughout Europe it is above all - compared to my colleague who intervened - because innovative medicines are very expensive. The case of sovaldi, which we discussed, this hepatitis C drug sold in France costs about 41,000 euros, but as another drug must be added, it amounts to 100,000 euros per patient per year, and it will cost the social security 700 million euros per year. When you add all the new drugs that are very expensive, it certainly blows up the social security accounts. One wonders why they are so expensive, especially since, when we make a precise analysis - already made in the case of sovaldi by associations - we realize that there are large doses of public money that have precisely allowed their invention directly or indirectly. This is mainly because our pharmaceutical research and development model is severely affected by chronic perversion.  Net margins and profits for some companies range from 10 to 40%, you see it's incredible. The pharmaceutical industry is the most lucrative right now, so conditionality has to be introduced. I am in for help to pharmaceutical companies, but only if there is public money.

This clearly looks like EU harmonisation of healthcare systems by the back door, but using pricing of drugs as the mechanism. I would like to point out that there is a huge difference between the insurance- and privatised—based model of healthcare prevalent in most of Europe and the contributory taxation—based National Health Service model that we have in the United Kingdom. I am not at all sure that this step, which seems to be being launched, will not represent a disastrous threat to the quality, cost and provision of UK healthcare services. My voters and my citizens do not want that. We have got stop blaming the elderly. Many of the chronic healthcare conditions that create the demand are coming about because of lifestyle choices by patients and by individuals of all age groups. We need to do more – if we are going do anything at all – to tackle the source of those problems and start talking about the business interests and the lobbying companies that push the products and create the environmental factors that create the illnesses and the problems for the EU.

The creation of an expert group is a step in the right direction. Only the European Union can have an overview of the differences in the functioning of member states' health systems. The action can only be led by one who has an overview of the whole.

This could establish an annual cycle of health policy coordination and develop a framework for reforming and convergence of health systems.

In recent years the situation of economic crisis has strained this system of well-being and the transit to the welfare society is done to us somewhat higher.

Despite the European Union's limited powers in the field of health, it must become our priority not only in words but also in deeds.  It is difficult to explain to European citizens why we deal more with farm animal health than human health. The challenges in the future will become greater due to demographic changes, an ageing population, the increase in chronic diseases. This reality must be reflected in the preparation of recommendations to Member States in the framework of the European Semester.  Concrete commitments are needed to implement structural reforms to ensure not only financial sustainability, but also equal access for European citizens to quality healthcare adequate for the 21st century. There are still major health inequalities in Europe between different Member States that hamper economic and social cohesion.  I believe that overcoming these problems requires the European institutions to engage even more deeply in assessing the functioning of our health systems, monitoring their outcomes and– very importantly for me – measuring access to quality healthcare within the European Semester by introducing new health indicators. This will help Member States learn from each other, exchange good practices and identify effective solutions. It will also allow an assessment of compliance with patients' rights in cross-border healthcare.
