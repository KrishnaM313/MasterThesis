The European Union has already taken a series of steps to tackle it, both online and offline. The Child Sexual Abuse Directive includes a substantial number of tools to improve the effectiveness of Member States’ responses to these crimes and to facilitate international cooperation. So the Commission does not intend to propose any amendment in the near future but to focus on its implementation.  A study is ongoing to look into Member States’ transposition of the Directive. The results will be available by April, after which decisions on pursuing or opening new infringement  proceedings – 11 are already open – can be taken. In the meantime, the Commission is in bilateral contact with various Member States to facilitate transposition and notification. There are specific issues regarding the need for law enforcement and judicial authorities to access evidence of child sexual abuse online held by private companies located under different jurisdictions. This is a major obstacle to the effective investigation and prosecution of these crimes, which Member States must ensure in order to respect their obligations to protect the fundamental rights of victims. These issues are common to other forms of cybercrime and other crimes facilitated by the internet. Given the global reach of the internet, a European Union response to them must take account of the need for cooperation with the EU’s strategic partners worldwide. A comprehensive approach is essential to ensure consistency, including in the fight against crime, in cybersecurity, consumer protection, fundamental rights and data protection, and e-commerce. These challenges will be considered as part of the reflections for the upcoming digital single market package.  I will now turn to the Global Alliance against child sexual abuse online. The Global Alliance is a set of political commitments by Ministers from 54 countries to take action to improve victim identification and assistance, improve investigation and prosecution, raise awareness, and reduce the amount of child sexual abuse material available online. The Global Alliance has succeeded in a number of points. Commitments have become part of national policy.  But the Global Alliance still needs to address a number of issues. First, ensure that all countries continue to pursue the policy targets, by mutual inspiration and pooling resources. Second, it should reach out to more countries. Third, the Alliance should react to the trends and threats that we see in the real world, and adapt the response to them. We must also work more closely with the internet industry that is ready to play a role within the Global Alliance.  Under the Internal Security Fund, the Commission will support the establishment of public-private partnerships between key players from the private sector and law enforcement agencies. Under the Connecting Europe Facility the Commission will continue to co-fund the long-standing European network of Safer Internet Centres which have a key role in raising awareness about internet safety matters for children throughout the European Union.  Safer Internet Centres currently operate in 27 Member States and cover three functions. Firstly, an awareness centre for empowering children, parents and teachers to make the best use of the internet, building on enhanced digital resource centres, from which specific awareness toolkits and services will be adapted and deployed, in cooperation with schools and industry.  Secondly, an online helpline service for children allowing them to seek advice and to report harmful contact, conduct and content. Thirdly, a hotline to receive information from the public relating to child pornography.  The hotlines make a preliminary assessment of the legality of the content reported, trace its origin, and forward the report to law enforcement. They notify the hosting ISP and monitor systematically the take-down of child sexual abuse content by the ISP. Hotlines are networked through the Inhope association, co-funded by the Commission, on a global level. Finally, the Commission will continue to support law enforcement in more efficient identification of victims and perpetrators by co-funding the development of shared databases, currently hosted in Interpol, giving law enforcement better access to data and evidence available worldwide.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2, "date": "2015-02-12.json", "name": "Monika HOHLMEIER", "mepid": "96780", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has First of all, a heartfelt thank you for this debate, which I consider to be very important. We have recently been dealing with an explosion of deeds and an explosion in the number of children abused. The Internet is a boon for many areas where we can promote the economy and jobs, but the Internet is a curse for those who are victims of crime. I have the following questions for the Commission. We have set up EC3 and, knowing that the Internet is the main platform, it is essential that there are enough staff at all to deal with this specific form of crime, even with enough staff. Unfortunately, I have to say that we have exactly three people for the whole of Europe. Of course, Europol also has more staff, but they have to do with trafficking in human beings, with organised crime, with a wide range of forms of crime. That is why I first ask that we need adequate staffing to counter these crimes. Secondly, the implementation of the directive must be speeded up as a matter of urgency in the Member States, and all Member States must actually implement the directive, which has been in force since 2011 and is really good. Thirdly, I consider public-private partnerships to be excellent and I also consider it good how far we have come in this sector. The cooperation is good. My final point is that, on the subject of encryption, we must ensure that it is important on the one hand to prevent espionage in order to guarantee security, privacy. On the other hand, we must find ways of not protecting the most serious criminals who rape and kill thousands of children in this world.

Mr President, I would like to thank the Sexual abuse of children – we all agree on this – are crimes, serious crimes, which often lead to long-lasting physical, psychological and also social damage for the victims. The Internet creates the possibility to spread images and films of abuse quickly and very widely. Internet offenders use it to establish contacts with children. As a Parliament, we, together with the Council, adopted a directive in 2011 so that states can effectively tackle this type of crime with uniform standards, with common rules for the definition of offences and the associated penalties, and with uniform provisions on the prosecution of offenders, including for offences abroad. The prevention and protection of victims play an important role, as does improving media literacy. Unchanged: The blocking of such content can only be a transitional solution at a time. The aim must be to make the content mandatory, especially in the interests of the victims. Private providers are not allowed to decide on this alone. Will this important directive now be implemented consistently and comprehensively? The Member States clearly lack the political will to do so. In January 2014, the Commission issued an 11-11 thin - Member States a letter of formal notice as the first stage of the infringement procedure. And it is only in the case of Cyprus that the procedure has been closed. By the way: my own Member State only passed a corresponding law in November last year, without any written warning, by the way. The Member States must finally do their homework, and the Commission must fulfil its role as guardian of the Treaties, without any false reticence towards the Member States. The Commission has until December to submit a report on the directive. I am curious to see how far we have come. We should not forget one thing in the whole debate: abuse is not virtual, it takes place in real life every day. It is appalling how differently the problem is handled or even ignored in different states and regions, including in Europe.

We need to work with internet companies and providers, social media, schools, parents, communities and police authorities. We need to block search results that lead to child abuse. We need to identify illegal images and take them down. We need to capture and prosecute perpetrators and provide justice for victims, and to give ourselves the tools to do so.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a few weeks ago, in the Committee on Freedoms, in an important debate on the fight against cybercrime and cyber-predators, we have seen horrific data and statistics, inspiring disgust and abjectness towards children: 4 million child pornography materials are currently circulating on the internet. The victims are younger and younger - 10% of children are under two years of age - the images are becoming more violent, the network has an increasingly sophisticated encryption system, etc. A few weeks ago, I began to try to understand how things worked on the dark web and became more aware - if needed - of its sordid and dangerous facets. Some networks, including Tor and Freenet, are totally hijacked by cyber-paedophiles and, ladies and gentlemen, we cannot stand idly by in the face of this indignity. On reading the AFA report, we see that, in 2014, there was a 100% increase in reports of child pornography. That is to say, we have found, once again, that this child pornography on the Internet is increasing more than ever. In the face of this horror, this abjection in our democracies, what answers? Firstly, can we get a real report to assess the implementation of the European directive, the deadline for transposition - I remind the Commission - was 13 December 2013? Can we get information on that? Can the Commission exercise its role as guardian of the treaties in this regard? Second, what about the role and potential increase in the skills and powers of Europol's Joint Cybercrime Action Taskforce and the Cybercrime Centre? Thirdly - you have not really mentioned this, Commissioner, and I regret this - we must act to remove the sites and block them in order to remove these horrors and child pornography.

Children are carrying around smartphones in their pockets, and very few are aware of the risks associated with them. We need to explore the use and danger of new media so that children take precautions, and we need to ensure that parents and educators have the skills to inform. We should look at solutions which, while protecting children, also protect a free internet, and we should open up the discussion and raise awareness.

It is very disturbing for us to hear just how many Member States have still, apparently, not fully transposed its provisions. Obviously, as people have said, the removal of existing content on websites is an important issue, and the directive makes it very clear that action to take down sites is compulsory and that, even if Member States choose to block, we need to be clear in the law about where responsibility lies. I think this partly answers the question that was raised earlier about service providers or whoever else it is: the law needs to be clear about what their action should be, and I think the directive is clear on people’s responsibility. I would also welcome it if the Commission could say a little more about the difficulties it is having in getting agreement with third countries where sites are hosted and how that can be followed up, because we are all aware that child abuse images should not be acceptable in any country in the world. Indeed, child abuse itself should not be acceptable. I think we also we need to link together some of the actions that we are taking on vulnerable children, for example the measures in place to report missing children rapidly. We need to close the gap in our asylum system, where at present there is no duty for anyone to follow up on children who go missing. Others have spoken –  and my colleague just now – about the issues of the prevention and empowerment of children and young people so that they do recognise the risks.

I would remind you that the European Parliament resolution on Burundi in September significantly helped in securing the release on bail of human rights activist Pierre Claver Mbonimpa. It also encouraged a more intensive and focused political dialogue with Bujumbura. Despite this, significant issues remain to be addressed with a greater sense of urgency as parliamentary, presidential and local elections come into view. Let me stress my concern, and that of High Representative Mogherini, at the arrest of Bob Rugurika. This took place after his radio station broadcast reports on the murder of three Italian nuns, reports which incidentally deserve to be followed up by appropriate independent inquiries. His arrest raises great concern, in particular given the current pre-electoral climate. The charges against him seem disproportionate, and we see no legal basis for his detention. The issue could have been addressed within the framework of the country’s media law or though the National Communication Council. Colleagues, including our Head of Delegation in Bujumbura, regularly visit Mr Rugurika in detention to check that his conditions are satisfactory. We will do all we can to follow his case and to argue for full respect for the principle of freedom of the media. Shortly after Mr Rugurika’s arrest his case was raised under the intensified political dialogue that EU Heads of Mission are currently having with Burundi. The Heads of Mission insisted on strict respect for legality, the law on the press and the principles of freedom of expression and freedom of opinion, and they called for Mr Rugurika’s immediate release. These messages were made public in a communiqué issued following the dialogue. The Heads of Mission also expressed concern at the possible political impact of this affair, given its timing – and this includes the risk of a negative effect on the political climate, the credibility of the authorities and the ongoing electoral process. With this in mind, I reaffirm how important it is that the upcoming elections are inclusive transparent, peaceful and credible. Keeping Bob Rugurika in detention sends a worrying message to journalists in Burundi. We will continue to call for his immediate release. I welcome the fact that we communicate regularly with Burundian counterparts in our now intensive political dialogue, leading to mutual contractual engagements. We must sustain the intensity of the dialogue and use it to underline that our support for the elections is linked to the fulfilment by Burundi of all the relevant commitments it has made, including those in the electoral law and the roadmap.

Saudi Arabia is an important partner for the European Union and an influential political, economic, cultural and religious actor in the Middle East and in the Islamic world. Like many in Europe, we have been concerned by the punishment imposed on Mr Badawi by a Saudi court of appeal in September last year, and by the public flogging to which he was subjected on 9 January this year. We have been closely following developments related to his case as well as the overall human rights situation in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. There is no doubt that the basis and conditions of Mr Badawi’s sentence, as well as the nature of the punishment handed down to him, are matters of strong concern for the European Union. In addition, the sentence appears overtly disproportionate. The statement issued by the spokesperson for the Vice-President of the Commission and  January, recalling our principled position on this case, is one of many initiatives that we are taking at EU level. The European External Action Service has been constantly monitoring this case, including via the EU delegation in Riyadh. In close coordination with EU Member States, several formal and informal outreach initiatives towards the Saudi authorities have been undertaken, both in capitals and locally. Since the first set of 50 lashes on 9 January, further lashing has been suspended on health grounds. This is certainly a positive development and it is to be hoped that further execution of the sentence will be definitely suspended. Obviously we will continue to call on our Saudi partners to suspend this sentence and to review the court ruling, as we understand the case may soon be referred again to an appeal court. More broadly, we look forward to strengthening an open and frank dialogue on human rights with our Saudi partners, seizing, in particular, the opportunity offered by the ongoing judicial reform process. The abolition of corporal and degrading punishment and the broader issue of freedom of expression will continue to constitute essential elements in our dialogue.

Meanwhile, fundamentalists of any faith – whether Christians, Muslims, Jews, or Hindus – are an intolerant component in a society that has always and everywhere had major problems with democratic rules. Saudi-born fundamentalism, known as Wahhabism or, correctly, Salafiya, is a Sunni sect that fights against all nonbelievers – including other branches of Islam, not just Shiites. I remind you that there are a number of links to Al Qaeda from the Wahhabi, and abu bakr al-Baghdadi, the head of the self-called Islamic State, also subscribes to this seed. In this way, Wahhabism becomes one of the biggest problems of our time. Both in the Muslim world and in liberal democracies. Discussing respect for human rights in a country where fundamentalist sectarianism is the official religion is almost a waste of time.

The Commission is conscious of the human dimension of the consequences of the tragic events of 1963-1964 and 1974 for the population throughout the island of Cyprus. Unanswered questions, especially those about missing persons, prevent many Cypriots from both communities from leaving their painful past behind. For the families concerned it is thus crucial to determine the fate of their loved ones. For this reason, the Commission is fully committed to supporting the work of the UN-facilitated bi-communal Committee on Missing Persons (CMP). The Committee on Missing Persons’ humanitarian mandate contributes to providing relief to the families of missing persons. It has proved to be a successful confidence-building measure between both Cypriot communities, and thus also strongly contributes to reconciliation in Cyprus. The European Union is currently its main source of funding, with an overall contribution since 2006 of EUR 14.7 million, managed under the authority of my colleague, Corina Crețu. The European Union is committed to continuing to support the work of the CMP and will provide an additional EUR 2.5 million in 2015. We also wanted to thank this Parliament, which in the past years provided extra funding for the CMP. In this respect I would like to pay my personal homage to former Members Panayiotis Demetriou, Ioannis Kasoulides, Klamt and Busuttil, as well as to current Members Böge, Theocharous and Hadjigeorgiou. The Commission agrees that more can and should be done by all relevant stakeholders to clarify the fate of all missing persons. At the same time, the fieldwork becomes more difficult, as new information sources are now scarce, and remaining potential graves are less accessible. This is why it is important that the CMP is granted full access to all relevant archives and, of course, military areas. The EU regularly calls on Turkey to comply with this. Missing persons is a humanitarian issue. This, like many other issues, shows the need for a fair, comprehensive and viable settlement between the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot communities. The EU has given its strong support to the resumption of Cyprus talks under the auspices of the United Nations. We have made clear our readiness to help. We support the efforts of the UN envoy Espen Barth Eide.
