[{"id": 0, "date": "2015-01-13.json", "name": "Martin SCHULZ", "mepid": "1911", "text": "   Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. Seventy years ago, on January 27, 1945, the Auschwitz concentration camp was liberated by Soviet soldiers. The images that the liberators saw and captured still shake the world to this day: the mountains of corpses, the crematoria, the mountains of shoes, glasses and human hair as testimonies of plundered life, the images of the exhausted survivors, closer to death than to life, these images have burrowed into the collective memory of humanity. For the vast majority of prisoners at Auschwitz, the rescue came too late. More than a million people have been murdered in this extermination camp – through hunger, disease, criminal medical trials, torture, execution and, above all, systematized death in the gas chambers. Especially Jews from Hungary, Poland, France, Holland, Greece, people of Jewish faith from all over Europe, Sinti and Roma, the disabled and the sick, homosexuals, prisoners of war, political prisoners and – especially abhorrent to anyone who has ever visited Auschwitz – countless children. These people, declared by fanatical Nazi ideologues to \"subhumans\", to pests whose lives were considered to be lifeless, these people should, yes, the butchers want this life to be destroyed and eradicated. Auschwitz was not the only place, but the central place of organized mass murder, the worst breach of civilization in human history. \"This place is always an outcry of despair and a reminder to humanity,\" it says on the commemorative plaque in the concentration camp. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, this should be Auschwitz forever, an outcry of despair and warning. The perpetrators may have taken personal guilt into the grave, but the responsibility arising from their atrocities is a joint responsibility of the international community, and it is certainly a special responsibility of the people to which I belong, the Germans. As future generations, we bear the responsibility to honour the oath of \"Never again\" for all time. History does not repeat itself, but the present emerges from the past, and how we deal with history determines our future. That is why, knowing that the incomprehensible happened at Auschwitz, we want to vigorously defend freedom every day. That is why we want to stand up for the unconditional dignity of human beings every day, knowing that this freedom is being jeopardised. That is why, every day, we want to take action against the return of ways of thinking that we in Europe thought had been overcome and in which we must nevertheless see that they always exist: hatred, xenophobia, anti-Semitism, ultranationalism and intolerance. If today, 70 years after the liberation of Auschwitz, Jews in Europe fear for their safety and fear for their lives, then that must upset us and it must awaken us. Now we must stand together against fear, not let ourselves be infected by the hatred that the paris attackers, for example, carried. We must not respond to hatred with more hatred, we must not respond to violence with even more violence, but must combat a growing distrust, defend the freedom of all and protect the dignity of every individual. That is the task that, 70 years after the end of the Second World War and the liberation of Auschwitz, we have to carry out in a special way here in this Parliament, as the multinational assembly of nations.

I believe that your greeting, your speech, Mr President, allows us to go into the substance of the budget for the six months of the Italian Presidency, remembering where we started. Taking as our starting point the role of Telemachus, also in continuity with the Greek Presidency, we had asked ourselves whether today these institutions, these politicians, these representatives of the territories that make up the great dream of the European Union, were able to assume the right to be heirs.  What does it mean to be heirs? It means being able to think that Europe is not just a memory for us: Europe is first and foremost a hope; it declines to the future, not just to the past. It has the warmth and color of opportunity before even concern. Have we been able to rise to this challenge in these six months? Of course I am aware that the press, that the operators, that the insiders, before addressing this great theme underline and highlight: \"But, first tell us about the results, tell us if you are satisfied with what you have done in Europe for Italy!\" That is a question that has not been asked, Mr President! Because those who make politics are never satisfied, if they are satisfied it is good that they change their profession! Also because you do not lead a semester thinking about the interest of your country, you lead a semester thinking about how Europe can have a chance for the future! We Italians, of whatever political colour, know perfectly well that our challenge is not here, it is at home. It is not simply a question of evoking the cliché of structural reforms. It means saying that Italy, if it wants to be in the global competition, must change and in these six months we have done a lot in our country, what Italy needs to do is the Italian citizens, not the European institutions, and the Italian citizens must be much more aware that in recent years we have provided Europe with much more resources than we have taken. Every year, Italy gives the European institutions around EUR 20 billion and receive no more than half of it.  In recent years, Italy has helped to save not only neighbouring states, but also banks, credit institutions in other countries, and it has done so not because of an act of generosity but because it believes in the European institutions. It did so without putting a penny of the money from the European institutions for the benefit of its credit institutions, which, in fact, after the stress tests, were forced to increase capital. It did so because it believes in Europe, Italy is a country that does not come to the European institutions to ask for help, it comes to offer a great history that began in Rome with the signing of the Treaty, but perhaps we can say that it began much earlier, started in the values that made our country great, that made our continent great.  We have this idea of Europe: the idea of a great place of hope for future generations and we know that our problems we have to face at home, as we are doing with the reform of the Constitution, electoral law, justice and public administration, all realities that the Italian Parliament has put forward in these six months.  We have done so with a European and Pro-European vision, which has so many authoritative representatives in the history of our country – and I will allow you, Mr President, the Members of the European Parliament to recall one for all, which has been and has also been the guide for our country in these six months – I would like the European Parliament to welcome the President of the Italian Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, from here today. , a convinced Pro-European who will be leaving office at this very moment, having made a long journey of change and having dealt with the difficulties in Italy with the intelligence, wisdom that many of you have acknowledged to him by working alongside him in this House in past years.  Well, in these six months Italy has used two major objectives: the first, that of giving political value to your work, ladies and gentlemen: on 2 July when we came here to begin the six-month period there was still no new Commission. We have been co-operating with all the other governments, a choice which I consider historic: the result of the elections of 25 May has been chosen to be of political value. The The appointment of Jean-Claude Juncker as President of the Commission does not simply arise from the recognition of a result which in itself would not have been enough, because the party that presented Jean-Claude had not obtained the majority of the members necessary to have a vote of confidence, but of a political agreement with a capital P in which, valuing the popular choice against President Juncker, it was decided to give profound meaning to the citizens' vote. , linking the Juncker Commission to a reform package, a political project for the coming years. This is the first time that this has happened in the history of the European institutions, and I believe that it should not be the last and that it should be codified to some extent by political custom, but it is a very significant step forward.  Alongside this, Italy has proposed a change in the economic paradigm that has characterized these years in our continental debate. I believe that either Europe is changing gears on the economy or we are becoming the taillight of a rapidly changing world. Mr Juncker has taken up this reasoning, he has broadened it with the members of his College, and I find it symbolic that today, at the Meeting of the College, Mr Juncker will present the communication on flexibility and the strategic investment lintel fund of the investment plan. These are two operations on which we are in favour, we recognise that we are moving in the right direction, in our opinion we need to do even more and we are ready to play our part. We are ready to be generous with the Fund, we are ready to believe deeply in investing in flexibility, not least because if there had not been flexibility, so many of the countries from which we come and come would not have the economic conditions they have today. If there had not been flexibility, reconstruction in Germany would not have been so easy, if there had not been flexibility, the policy would have been erased from this House today.  But what I want to say is that in these six months we feel like we have seen a profound change in direction, not yet in fact. I remember the Ypres Summit, it was June of this year, I remember the very tough discussion with my friends and fellow Heads of Government, when we stressed the importance of investing in growth, when we stressed the importance of investing differently in the relationship between economic and flexibility. How much time seems to have passed, yet only six months have passed! These are the two results that I think are together: investment in politics with politics, of the Commission choosing a direction.  I could, of course, discuss at length the results, the climate and energy agreement, the policy of transition from Mare Nostrum to Triton, the institutional transition carried out in spite of the negative wishes in a climate of positive cooperation, the automatic mechanisms to combat evasion, the investment in a different policy of international cooperation, the declassification, which was so much in the concern of this Parliament. , of the negotiating agreements for TTIP, GMOs, even with some defeats, I consider President Schultz to be a defeat and on made in the commitments that this Parliament, understood as an institution – because it was in April last year – but nevertheless this Parliament, understood as an institution, by asking the Council and the Commission to promote themselves, have not been successful. On made in it is incomprehensible the resistance that some countries are making.  For convenience, we have presented this document, it is a document that presents all the results of this six-month period and you will allow me, then, to move immediately to the second and final part of my reasoning. In other words, to return to the basic question: have we managed in recent months to restore a soul to Europe? It is difficult to approach this debate at a time when the debate on the profound meaning of Europe today sees an embarrassing demagogy pitted against that idea of places of hope and politics of Europe which, for example, His Holiness Pope Francis – who wanted to bring his speech to this Assizes during this very semester – explained with this clarity and with this beauty : the idea of Europe as something that the world needs and, on the other hand, the attempt to invest in demagoguery, fear, the attempt to block and curl up our values within a small frame and inside a fortress. The place of Europe is not the fortress is the square! The place of Europe is not the trench is the museum, it is the school! Europe's key word is not conflict and confrontation, but dialogue and encounter!  So from this point of view, Mr President, let me be very clear: we in this very House have opened up the I am proud and shivering to say that Europe is that in these six months we have allowed that woman to return to freedom and to take her born child to a prison to live free. Because for us, Europe is first and foremost freedom. Let me say, Mr President, that I am excited when, on 20 August, I had – on behalf of you too – the dramatic beauty and difficult situation of entering a refugee camp in Erbil; I remember the reaction of a young man in his twenties, of so many young people in his twenties, when in Srebrenica Europe did not have the courage to open its mouth and even the blue helmets witnessed astonished and squalid in the face of violence and genocide.  Today we have before us so many places where situations of pain, terror and horror are taking place. I believe that Europe must be there, and friends of the European Parliament know this well, those citizens who took to the streets in Paris. They know this well because some commentators have said: the historical photo is the photo of the leaders, no it is not the photo of the leaders walking together, the historical photo is the photo of a people, first and foremost the French people, whose history of lights and cathedrals, of reason and beauty, I place entering Strasbourg, a European headquarters but also a city French , a tribute, the tribute of all Italians and all Italians after what happened; but it is also, let me tell you, Mr President, that profound idea, that extraordinary experience that we had hearing the songs of the Marsigliese as we walked. Seeing the images of women and men who did not resign themselves to the idea of terror and fear and who said with their presence in those squares, that Europe is greater than threats, that our values are stronger than their attacks and that each of us, if we really want to be faithful to the idea of European Union and European unity , today it has the task of identifying an enemy.  Because the enemy is there! Woe betide those who pretend not to know that the enemy is there! Of course there is the enemy, but to those who say that religion is the enemy, I invite them to go and reread a great speech made by the Egyptian President – among the many appointments of this semester I would like to emphasize how the bilateral we did both in Cairo and in Rome, with the Egyptians, is one of the fundamental turning points for the Mediterranean – but that speech that Al Sisi gave on the first day of the year at a university in Cairo , at a university where he explained that the enemy is not religion, but it is that ideology that aims to kill even the very idea of religion that people and al Sisi leaders try to carry on on a daily basis.  The enemy is there, it is ideology, it is fanaticism, but the great risk that we run is not to not see the enemy, it is to think that fear can stop us, it can immobilize us, it can block us; So I believe that closing in, isolating one's isolation, raising limits, raising walls means not being European. Mr President, someone is currently going further, in the political debate, but also in the cultural debate, and goes so far as to say that we must, in the name of our security, live in fear and snuggled up. We have come to say that the word identity is contrary to the word integration, as a man of government, as an Italian man, let me say it as a left-winger, I want to say forcefully that we will never leave the word identity to those who shout loudest, because the word identity is a beautiful word that belongs to us, that concerns us, the word identity is a word that expresses the profound meaning of being European.  I am proud of my roots, I am proud of the streets where I played football, I am proud of the schools where I grew up, I belong to my land, I am proud to be European, Italian, Florentine, I am proud of what my small personal history represents, because my identity is a fundamental trait. The opposite of identity is not integration, the opposite of identity is anonymity, the opposite of integration is disintegration, it is rupture, it is destruction.  So today we must have the strength to say very clearly, with great determination, that when we think within the European institutions and outside that we are defending our identity by locking ourselves in fortresses in the name of security, we must always tell ourselves that freedom and responsibility are the conditions of security, that there is no possible security without freedom in Europe and that in this world our enemies cannot kill us aim to change our way of life. We cannot allow anyone to change the way we live if you want to call it the words you think is most appropriate; do you want to call it war? do you want to call it conflict? you can call it what you want!  There is a real reality, the bogeyman of demagoguery can bring an extra decimal vote, but if we are a ruling class here, if we are leaders and men here who are capable of leading the institutions, today's challenge is to get Europe back to doing its job, and this step leads me to say something very simple to close: if we are seeing politics return to Europe today it is because in these months and years we have since the world demands more Europe, not less Europe; But we have to tell the truth: this kind of Europe that we have built in recent years has given the impression that it is all too often a model based solely on the economy, on parameters, on constraints, on austerity.  I believe, Mr President, that at the end of these six months we can tell ourselves that this attitude was a mistake and that the change that the Juncker Commission is bringing about in these six months is a change that probably had to be imagined over the last six years, not in the last six months. Today the world is changing, the world is trying to invest in the future, Europe is not! We've been to Brisbane, along with the G20, and the words of growth, investment and innovation are words that have resonated everywhere. We must be at the helm of this phenomenon of change, not at the end of the day.  We will only be if Europe comes back to look itself in the eye with the awareness of those who represent a non-economic superpower, a value superpower, the same superpower of values that certain part of demagoguery would like to erase. In handing over the baton to the Presidency of Latvia, I would remind myself that when this Parliament was called to direct elections it was under the Italian Presidency, it was 1975. Under the Italian Presidency, agreement was reached to move on to direct voting and the direct election of MEMBERS of the European Parliament, it was a very important, very beautiful and very significant moment. Forty years ago Latvia was not only not part of the European Union, but was in a totally different history.  Today we are showing that Europe is capable of change, but we must also think that this change must first of all make us look at the neighbourhood policy in a different way, and this is the legacy that we give first of all to the new Presidency, neighbourhood policy means different attention to the Mediterranean, it means different attention to the enlargement of the European Union, because we cannot do without Albania , Serbia, Montenegro, and we cannot allow this debate on enlargement to be dictated and spoiled by fear. Of course, it also concerns the relationship between Ukraine and Russia, which has been one of the most sensitive issues of this six-month period and which I fear will continue to go through the season we are experiencing.  In meeting you at the next international events of Italy, starting from the EXPO, which on May 1st will address a great theme, for those who believe in politics: feeding the planet, changing the lives of men. This means making a great investment in lifestyle, but also in the fight against hunger. I would like to leave you not with a thought on Telemachus but with a thought about Ulysses, because it is difficult – reading more than two books is difficult for some of you, I understand it – but I have learned what Europe was not in the corridors of the institutions, I have learned what Europe was, Mr President, in studying the history of my city. In my city there is a great character who is Dante Alighieri, who when he puts in his mouth a small prayer in Ulysses, makes a reference that I find extraordinarily effective today, at the moment when they would like to holed up in the house afraid and upset, dante says making Ulysses speak: facts were not to live like brutes, but to follow virtue and canoeing. I think it's a great message for each of us today.  The European Parliament is at a crossroads, choose whether to imagine living like brutes, chasing a demagogic message that may bring a few more points but which will not allow Europe to govern and, on the other hand, there is the possibility of following virtue and knowledge, that is, of being European. And we, the excited and the responsible, believe that Today Europe is the real place of tomorrow's challenge.  In this spirit, I thank the institutions for their cooperation and say to the President of the European Parliament that Italy, true to its message of civilisation, values and ideals, will continue to work for a Europe that is increasingly the people and less and less bureaucracy.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 3, "date": "2015-01-13.json", "name": "Jean-Claude Juncker", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "  Commission President. Mr President, Mr President of the Council, dear Matteo Renzi, ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, there are times when it is difficult to move from one moment to the next. You rightly mentioned, in opening today's session, the liberation of the Nazi camps. Those born long after the war and those who have a bookish knowledge of the events you are talking about cannot imagine the pains and tragedies that may have swept through Europe between the years 1940 to 1945 but also 1933 to 1945. Watch out for bad beginnings, let's remember the story and learn from it.  And then we are now gathered on French territory. How could I forget at this moment the tragedy, the collective and individual tragedy that has just struck France in the middle of the past week. We remain shocked, outraged, appalled, disgusted by what has just happened in Paris. Yes, we're all Charlie, but around the world there's a lot of Charlies we need to think about today. However, as we are in France, I mean here: \"Long live the Republic and long live France!\". (Applause) We have reached the end of the Italian Presidency and on the eve of the Latvian Presidency. It is an occasion that invites reflection.  This is the end of an Italian Presidency, a Presidency of a founding Member State, and tomorrow the Latvian Prime Minister of a new member country will speak before us. Who would have thought in 1957 that in 2015 Latvia would preside over the destiny of Europe? Who would have thought that tomorrow we would hear the speech of a Latvian Prime Minister who, speaking before us, will symbolize the reconciliation between European history and geography and who will mark the end of the disastrous post-war decree which would have wanted Europe, forever, to be divided into two irreconcilable parts. I say today: \"Long live Europe!\" because tomorrow, as today, we will witness a great European moment and we can be proud of what we have achieved over the past decades. We have arrived at the end of the Italian Presidency to which I would like to pay, my dear friend, carissimo amico, all possible tributes. I have chaired the Council five times in my ministerial life, including twice the European Council. I know this feeling of the end of the Presidency. We are relieved, we are happy to hand over the keys to the next Presidency, but we are also frustrated because we were not able to do everything we had dreamed of before the start of the Presidency. But the Italian government has done many things. In particular, it allowed us to agree on the 2014 and 2015 budgets. On this point, the cooperation, collaboration and complicity between the Presidency and the Commission were total and, together with the other branch of the budgetary authority that you are, ladies and gentlemen, we have been able to do a good job together. But without the commitment, without the daily will of the Italian Presidency, this result would not have been possible and if the Italian Presidency had not been able to do what it did, we would find ourselves today in the middle of a budgetary crisis whose effects we would feel at every moment. The Italian Presidency has ensured that we can adopt all legal decisions on the single resolution mechanism for bank failures, a pillar of the banking union. Secondly, we were able to build on the Italian Presidency's desire to move quickly on investment. We agreed during the election campaign, at the time of the Commission's inauguration by Parliament, that we should put in place a virtuous triangle: fiscal consolidation which remains essential, structural reforms which are important but also a dimension of growth and job creation which has found a first concrete translation in the investment plan that I had the honour of presenting before you at the end of November.  Without the will, without the encouragement of the Italian Prime Minister, the Commission would have had a hard time moving forward as quickly as it did in terms of reviving European growth, which remains an essential dimension of the combined political will of The whole of Europe.  We will adopt - and Matteo Renzi has just said this - today, this afternoon in college, all the legal texts that are related to the establishment of the Investment Fund. We will today adopt a Commission communication on the flexibility of the Stability and Growth Pact, flexibility in the Stability and Growth Pact and not next to and in parallel. On this point as on others, we owe to the enthusiasm of the Italian Presidency many elements inspiring the action of the European Commission.  To make a long speech more understandable, I would like to say here: \"Yes, the Italian Presidency has done, as they say in somewhat approximate French, a good job!\". The Italian Presidency has been up to the task and I hope that the Italian Government, when it leaves the Presidency, will remember the noble inspirations that led its work during the Presidency and that Italy, thanks to the genius of its people whom I continue to admire, will remain European just as it was during this Presidency.

Italy is a heartland of the European Union, of great economic importance, culturally of great importance, historically of great importance for our common European house. That is why, Prime Minister, there were also expectations, and the expectations were high for the Italian Presidency when it was launched six months ago. I would like to begin by thanking you, also on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, for the issues that have been put to the council. The results that we now have a stable budget for 2015 are a success for the Italian Presidency. Thank you very much for that – this signals stability and strength. The Italian Presidency has put migration on the agenda. I would like to say thank you to your Minister of the Interior, Angelino Alfano, who has also raised the issue, put it on the agenda and has thus made a contribution to the fact that we, as Europeans, feel that we have a shared responsibility. And we have had the major issues of flexibility and investment that have been raised in this six months. That is why, first of all, thank you for the work, and also the ministers and the experts for the design.  I would also like to thank you for what you have said on the subject of dimensions, to recognise the historical and democratic dimension of the last six months. Your clear statement that we have given the electorate the choice of who should lead Europe, that you, as President-in-Office of the Council, have also supported this in recent months, was an important sign. The fact that Jean-Claude Juncker is sitting in the seat today has been decided by the electorate because they have made the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats the largest group. This basic statement that the electorate has the decisive word – thank you for emphasising this once again. Now for the future: the tasks do not end, of course. Nor does Italy's responsibility end. I have talked about the old dispute – flexibility, investment. You have referred to this. You said that perhaps we should no longer see the Europe of the economy as so crucial, but rather the Europe of values. Honestly, it goes through my mind: why do we always have to build up conflicts in the sense of differences, do one thing and not do the other so strongly? I think we should be aware that it only works together! We will only be able to justify Europe's values internally to the citizen if we remain economically strong, and, above all, we will only be able to represent them externally if Europe remains a strong economy.  That is why I believe that we should not build up the conflict, but underline together what is important to us. When you talk about the EFSI, the investment pact that Jean-Claude Juncker and his Commission will be legisching this afternoon, then, yes, Vice-President Katainen always points to the investment side that we need to invest more in Europe. But it also underlines that part of the investment package is that we are advancing structural reforms and that we need to do more in terms of budget commitments, of the stability of our national budgets.  If flexibility is decided this afternoon, it is our common desire to clarify what flexibility means. However, Prime Minister Renzi, you also decided in the European Council that the rules – six-pack, two-pack – remain untouched, that they remain as they are. It says, for example, that states should strive to get to 60% of gross domestic product in total debt. I believe that both sides are right, that we interpret flexibility – and the Commission has a great responsibility to clarify what that means this afternoon – but that, on the other hand, we also recall what was decided in the Council, namely not to change the rules. Incidentally, it also has a lot to do with values in Europe, that we are reliable and that we implement what we promise people. Ladies and gentlemen, this week has a different tone, because we are all deeply influenced by Paris and by developments on our continent. That is why, in conclusion, I would like to underline once again what unites us as Europeans. The emotions that shape us all should not prevent us from going down a good path for our continent. Above all, I would like to make it clear that what constitutes the so-called Occtous is not the ideas that many radical forces in all the countries of the European Union have come up with. practiced. The West is solidarity, the West is subsidiarity, the West is Enlightenment, i.e. separation of state and religion, freedom of belief. These are the points that make up the West, and we will continue to promote and fight for them in the future.

On Sunday we were in Paris, the soul of Europe was there, among millions of people.  To those who want to lock us in the house, to those who want to raise walls, instill mistrust, fear, we responded on Sunday by taking to the streets, marching together. The Paris attack is not simply an attack on freedom of thought, of expression, it is an attack on European sovereignty – and European sovereignty means that a people is free to choose how to live and that no one can impose on us a way of life that we do not want.  So be careful not to fall into the trap of terrorism that would like to turn our societies into fortresses under siege: after 11 September, America chose to build more prisons than colleges, let us not make the same mistake in Europe! Europeans want to live in an open society, where freedom and security are together. Rediscovering the soul of Europe is therefore not a rhetorical formula, it means returning to dealing with people's real lives, their anxieties and their hopes; it means giving citizens a free and dignified life and the first freedom is that of need. Blind and deaf austerity has increased unemployment, precariousness and poverty.  The Italian Presidency has laid down the conditions for putting Europe back on track. In July, when you talked about investments to be revived, many smiled, Mr. President. This afternoon, as Mr Juncker and yourself have said, the Commission will approve the regulation of the 300 billion plan. We have a plan for growth, with its strengths and also with its weaknesses, on which my group is committed to taking action to change them. In inaugurating the semester you also talked about flexibility, there was a lot of irony there too: what is this flexibility that Renzi is talking about? It almost felt like a battle of Don Quixote! Renzi Don Quixote who comes here and manages to clear and remove that rigor with which the pact was implemented. Today, the Commission officially presents the communication on flexibility, and I believe that it will contain important elements of which we must be proud. Thanks also to the Italian Presidency, we were able to stop the idea of who actually wanted to commissioner the Member States, imposing sanctions if they refused to implement the reforms decided by Brussels; what was in danger of being bad communication turned into an excellent starting point.  We get an important achievement, the golden rule of investment, it seemed like a dream, a pipe dream: the golden rule on investments is a historic battle of our group, the cofinancing of European investments even those provided for in the Juncker plan will be decomputed by the Stability Pact for those countries that do not exceed the 3% deficit limit. Cofinancing from the Structural Funds, too, seemed like a pipe dream, and that is a fact! A revolutionary fact, of course! Go and talk to the citizens, to the regions, to the private actors, who cannot co-finance the European funds. Yes, we still want to achieve more, but these are important facts and results. Allow me to quote one last quote, Mr Schultz, in a borges story: a child asks a wise man if he is capable of touching the stars and the wise man bends over and touches the earth! So, without noise, with courage but with realism, this Presidency has begun to change Europe, we must move forward for change with you, Mr Renzi!", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 6, "date": "2015-01-13.json", "name": "Ryszard Antoni LEGUTKO", "mepid": "96796", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Group. – Mr President, Prime Minister Renzi, in June you asked how the EU would look if we were to take a selfie. I am just wondering how the Italian Presidency would look today if it were to take a selfie, and my answer is that there would not be much in it – although that is not surprising, because from the very beginning there was going to be a minimalist legislative agenda reflecting the post-election situation. However, your presidency has managed to broker some agreements between Parliament and the Council on legislation, so let me enumerate some of these. First, money-laundering: the problem here is that the agreement reached on the fourth directive should not only address the burden on innocent people who have been tied up in red tape, but should also indicate how we are to tackle the billions of euros that go towards organised crime and terrorism. Second, GMOs: this is a highly divisive issue, and the deal we are going to vote on soon reflects the fact that some governments are definitely pro-GMO, while others are more cautious. Third, the 2015 budget: it is true that you secured agreement on the budget, but that agreement still leaves significant unpaid bills. I think you missed an opportunity to take responsibility for this unsustainable situation. Fourth, migration in the Mediterranean: I think that is a plus for you. Fifth, the Trans-Atlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) talks. We are pleased that, under the Italian Presidency, the Council declassified negotiating directives and, given last week’s publication of the legal proposals by the Commission, it is fair to say that there is more transparency around the agreement, and people’s fears may be dispelled. All in all, if I were to give you a grade, I would give you ‘fair’. I do not know if you would be happy with that.

That is normal in a democracy, but these three main opposition parties are now parties against the euro and against more European integration. So my wish for you is that you succeed in your reforms in Italy in order to stop this anti-European movement in your country, because we certainly need Italy at the centre of the European Union. I would also like to thank Sandro Gozi, who did the concrete work and was the link with Parliament. I remember also the enormous contribution made by Giorgio Napolitano here in this Parliament at the beginning of the year, showing the way for the future. I think when we look at the Italian Presidency, the most important feature of your presidency was to end this discussion, as Mr Weber has indicated, between fiscal discipline on the one side and growth and investment on the other. We need both. I think that can be the conclusion of this whole debate. But that is only the start of this work, because we now need this Investment Plan. I have to tell you, Mr Renzi, that what we need now – and I hope for your support in the next Council – is for all Member States to enter the guarantee scheme of that Investment Plan. The participation of Member States will not count in the Stability Pact – that is certain, and we have known that from the beginning – so there is no reason why all Member States should not enter the guarantee scheme of the Investment Plan to make it a success. I think that it is absolutely unacceptable that some of the Member States are saying that this is not their business. Secondly, we need real structural reforms – not only the announcement of structural reforms – in the near future. Finally, we need a package of legislation to open these key markets, but we shall discuss that with the Commission later. I have only one disappointment with the Italian Presidency, and that is that the Telecoms Package has not been concluded. Let us be honest. We are talking here – everybody is talking – about investment, the digital world, Google… we need to have an answer to that. Are we not capable today, in 2015, of making an agreement with the Member States on the digital market and on the Telecoms Package, getting rid of the roaming charges, installing net neutrality? So that is my only disappointment, but I hope that in the next six months under the new Presidency, the Italians can push forward that absolute need for a digital market.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 8, "date": "2015-01-13.json", "name": "Curzio MALTESE", "mepid": "125192", "text": "  Mr President, president, ladies and gentlemen, i.e. the european Union, we must not Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on Sunday in Paris, millions of citizens finally made the heart of Europe beat and it was a consolation in pain to see Heads of Government parade in the streets, for once in the name of high values rather than locked up in smoky summits discussing 3% decimals.

However, you have promised to commit ambition, energy and courage – skills that I recognise – but there are still words! In six months you have put a lot of energy into looking for small loopholes in treaties that need to be rewritten or scrapped.

Her Presidency was not an easy one, she was playing in these times of transition. It would have been wrong to expect too much. I would have been pleased if you had spoken a little more openly about the problems that have just come to light in recent days; we talked about it very well yesterday. We must all be grateful to the citizens of France for giving European politics a new chance, as it were, with this marche républicaine, to renegotiate the values and objectives that we have been talking about for a long time between the political camps, but also between politicians and the citizens. Judging by the objectives of your Presidency, it is important now to re-talk about how mistrust can become trust again, not only between the different groups in our societies, but indeed between citizens and politicians. I would have been pleased if you had said in this context how you actually see what the European Union's interior ministers have presented as answers to the challenge of freedom. Having seen how much data was available in France about the assassins, the murderers, I feel rather unsettled when the new answer is the old answer and more data is supposed to provide more security for Europe. We are and must talk about integration, about education, about all this. But even as a Green, I know that this security challenge is a serious challenge. Nevertheless, the answers so far are not at all satisfactory. They had made flight, asylum and immigration a priority of the Italian Presidency. At the moment, I would say that these scrap steamers, these scrap tankers that transport more and more people, desperate people, from Asia and Africa to Europe, actually symbolise what we have done with Dublin I, II and III, and that they also symbolise that, although we are not economically at the end, but one of the richest areas in the world, Europe has not yet been able to create an adequate right of immigration. Greece and the euro – a major issue of uncertainty. Yes, there has been a bit of a tightening up on the euro stabilisation policy and crisis policy. However, I would like to say once again on my group that I do not believe that the euro will become stable without the political elite daring to go to the political and economic integration of the European Union.

This seems to us to be the exact description of your Italian presidency.  Today in this House I see a magician pulling the rabbit out of the cylinder, here we hope to amaze everyone by extracting from his jacket the promise of an agreement to ensure greater flexibility in national budgets, we will see! Unfortunately, from the first rumors, we understand that this agreement is only about the minimum of what was expected, namely that only with investments to co-finance works already identified and promoted by the Commission itself. A little less than the premises of last July!

It was a missed opportunity, the appointment of his pupil Mogherini as High Representative for Foreign Affairs, he insisted on a role as a façade when we could and should have asked for a portfolio that could really make a difference. Mogherini who, by the way, has not yet brought home the marò.  It was a missed opportunity to increase employment, which you have so much heralded as a priority for the six months, but on which you have not been able to propose any concrete measures, and we see this in Italy where 43% of young people are out of work and total unemployment has reached 13.4%. It was a missed opportunity to protect our businesses, they were asking you loudly to finally reach an agreement in the Council to defend made in, an agreement that this Parliament served you on a silver platter with a rule, but you shamefully threw in the towel.  There have been missed opportunities: – the agreement on energy efficiency, signed downwards, sold off in the interests of who knows what strong powers; - the REGULATION on GMOs condemning our farmers to put themselves in the hands of biotech multinationals; - immigration policies, miserably limited to a programme, Triton, whose budget is once again left to the goodwill of individual states; - the lack of transparency on TTIP, an agreement that risks further putting European companies in difficulty; – the digital agenda programme, which does not provide for concrete investment to make our economy more modern and competitive.

Otherwise, there has been a lot of talk about European values and about the confidence of the citizens, and then, as a consequence, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, the most important thing is that we now have to reverse all policy, and that must take place now, and that would take place today in the Commission meetings.

The reconciliation between the discipline of public accounts and the survival of the economy and employment or the need not to kill strategic investment just because public spending needs to be contained may seem trivial and, nevertheless, they are not.  The Italian Presidency has taken these issues seriously as topics for discussing Europe's fundamental policies. The European Commission is new, it has changed, Parliament has changed, Europe continues, however, to plunge into stagnation with risks of deflation, with frightening unemployment and with the loss of citizens' confidence in the European project.  True, the Italian Presidency has not yet brought the shock of energy and vitality that Europe urgently needs, but perhaps that would be impossible. But after years of dogmatism, blind and impoverished and hopeless austerity, the new Juncker Commission and the Italian Presidency have begun to open up the issues of interest and point in the right direction. Nothing is concluded, but the doors have been opened to the work we have to do, certainly at the level of each country, but certainly also collectively, now that the limits and gaps of European architecture and, above all, of the single currency are evident. The reflection must continue. I hope that the Latvian Presidency will not miss the moment, but I also hope that Italy, once in the Council, will not lose its way.

These are concrete, very important results, which go far beyond the traditional tasks of a six-monthly presidency, and they have been important in substance.

First of all, I would like to welcome the adoption of the conclusions on the management of migration flows and the launch of the Khartoum process with the countries of the Horn of Africa. This allows for a greater synergy between migration policy and external policies. This is the direction to be taken to establish real diplomacy on migration.

With regard to the area of freedom, security and justice, I note that the doors of the Schengen area have still remained closed for Bulgaria and Romania, despite the technical criteria. The political deadlock must no longer last. Third, we saw what happened with South Stream. Energy policy must be conceived today as an instrument of regional integration that will enable Member States, including Bulgaria, to continue to support the European project while opening up the prospects for mutual benefits with the countries of the Southern and Eastern Mediterranean. In this regard, I congratulate the Italian Presidency on the inter-ministerial conference held in Rome last November with the Euromed countries.

Under Italy’s stewardship the EU responded well enough. We came together to agree on a robust sanctions package in response to Russia’s blatant violation of international law, and this in itself counts as a historic achievement for our common foreign policy. In the southern neighbourhood, several EU Member States, including Italy, joined the international coalition against ISIS which halted its military advance and forced it to retreat. Italy also steered the EU’s response to the immigration crisis in the Mediterranean Sea – the Triton operation.

The first concerns the technically intended budget: I am grateful to the Members of the European Parliament for pointing out things that I did not list in detail, referring to the final text, but I am pleased that there have been recognitions from the reflection on everything and on the work done on the budget to the positive issues that have been addressed during this six-month period that paradoxically have come from this House and not from us. That seems to me to be a good thing.  I must say quite frankly that Verhofstadt is right when he points out some un positive facts: we have not only closed the made in that is an issue on which we will continue to work, but which is certainly an element of objective negativity for us, but also the subject of the telecommunications dossier. A complicated, difficult dossier, which has seen many, many meetings, 11 times we have met with the working groups, which were the subject of a very intensive discussion at the working dinner of ministers at the informal Council in Milan in September, the two draft texts that we have proposed, some aspects have seen progress, net neutrality, not roaming unfortunately , on which I think there have been the greatest divergences.  So, there is no doubt, there are also many aspects that have not been achieved as we would have liked, that part of the debate that has focused on the results of the six-month period is, however, a part of the debate that has particularly impressed us for the attention also given by colleagues from other political forces or other countries to the objective results achieved.  Then there is a second element that is the debate – as is often the case in the country of origin – the opportunity of the end and the beginning of the semester is always the opportunity for a political debate – made more complicated certainly in Italy because the difficult Italian transition has seen the leadership of the government, political governments of one side and technical governments and then political governments of alliances and coalitions led in some cases by opposing components. However, I find it really strange that the Members of the European Parliament representing Italy should show with this great care all the negative aspects of our country – I say this to you, Mr Tajani, who has also served the European institutions in another capacity, not only in Parliament and who knows this well and knows this element even if we come from different political families.  I am thinking, for example, of Mr Maltese, who is not here, when he says Italy has the third largest public debt in the world: it is true! Italy has a significant public debt, think two billion euros! Yet no one points out that Italy has the world's first private saving, four billion euros! And when the 5-Star Members come to highlight how families are getting poorer, this mussel, as sometimes happens, against the reality of the facts and the numbers. Think, in a time of crisis, Italian families have seen their savings increase from 3.5 billion euros to 3.9 (from 2012 to 2014).  Why did this happen? This has happened because the Italian economy – Parliament will forgive me if I am forced to respond also on domestic issues – is experiencing a phase of terror, of concern, the messages that arrive are messages marked not simply by austerity – which is a philosophical-cultural debate that we could hold for a long time – but to terror and fear of the future, to consider the future as a threat. Therefore, we come to the paradox that in recent months Italy has seen its savings and money increase, families are paradoxically enriching because they have concern and fear.  It is very difficult to convince you of the reality, but reality is slowly necessary, as I say to Mrs Moi, a 5-Star Member, who highlights the serious problems of corruption in Italy. Just in 2014 the Italian Parliament, on a proposal from the government, chose – think about it, but perhaps they did not have time to tell it! - unanimously, on the government's proposal, to entrust Raffaele Cantone with the task of leading the anti-corruption authority that has made it possible to commissioner the MOSE, an experience to which Mr De Clercq has put forward a report. Moi referred, which allowed the EXPO to close the season of illegality and to open the great theme of content, which made it possible to intervene with legislation that is unprecedented in Europe.  It is difficult to stress the positive aspects of one's own country when one considers the European gallery as the forum in which to go and speak ill of ourselves. This is not the case with Mr Beazley. Salvini, to whom I recognize a consistency of behaviour rather than content – I think he has done very well he has emphasized the difficulty and also the sense of bitterness that citizens feel when they see the Halls of the Parliament empty. In the meantime, I am very pleased that Mr Syley has done a good deal. Salvini found his desk in the European Parliament given the large presence in the Italian media and the perhaps small presence within the European institutions that has been needed for 11 years now. When Mr President, I would like to say a good report, i.e. Salvini, who is engaged in a national political battle and which I respect, because he is on the other side, will arrive at the election campaign – in three years' time, in four years' time, when he will be (in three years' time, I would not like to extend the legislature!) – when Mr Syley is not here today. Salvini will be in the election campaign, it will be easy for Italian citizens to ask him: ok, we will ask Renzi what he has done in Italy and we will ask Salvini what he has done in these 15 at the service of Europe!  However, I can say here today, and then to conclude quickly, that on this day the political group which represents Mr Sleyley's model is not a political group. For example, Salvini proposed the suspension of the Schengen Agreements. This is an objective which Mr Ayley has just said is a very important one. Marine Le Pen explained not in the Chamber, but she explained very carefully at the press conference. I would like to quote what the Italian Minister of the Interior, a member of the same Party of the Northern League, led by Salvini, said exactly this: suspending Schengen would be the end of Europe, I believe – as Maroni said in that case – that Italy must be totally opposed to the closure of the Schengen area.  This agreement, this consideration, this phrase by Mr Beazley, the commission of the European Parliament, the Committee on The Salvini, who is trying to turn left but will not be able to achieve the political result, shows very strongly and very clearly something very simple and that is that there is an impressive distance between demagoguery and reality. There is a crazy distance between those who invest in an idea of politics that can excite and those who bet on fear. And that, Mr President, is also the final point I would like to leave to the European debate. Let me explain: today, in Italy, there is a derby, it is the derby between those who see the difficulties but stand up and try to solve them and try to imagine for our country a future at least as big as the history from which we come and, on the other hand, there are those who, seeing the difficulties, bet on failure, those who bet on fear, those who bet that we will not succeed. It is perhaps a convenient message at the electoral level – although, I want to say to my UKIP colleagues that they are not there now and who have spoken before shouting that I would call those who are voters brute – I represent the party that has taken the most votes of all in Europe, the Democratic Party 11 million and 200 thousand people and therefore we do not consider the people who vote to be brute; we consider brutes those who deny the reality of the facts and the reality is that we will get out of this crisis situation not by investing in fear, not by betting on failure, but by trying to make it clear that the only possible solution for our children is that Europe is not an heirloom, it is not a place of memories, it is not the wax museum. , is not a set of clichés and phrases made! Europe can only make sense if it succeeds in putting the lives of people who want to believe in tomorrow back at the centre and who are not afraid, and who do not have the concern to regard what is happening in the world simply as a threat. Is the world scary? Yes, I think, I believe and hope that it will be a common conviction that Europe is greater than fears and threats and Europe is much stronger in its values than any attack that may exist. This is the difference between us and those who want to live as brutes, we think that the future that awaits us will depend on the commitment of each of us and if we are able to be consistent with our history, this future is a future that will see the stars of Europe lead the way and navigation, even in our country.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 48, "date": "2015-01-13.json", "name": "Antonio TAJANI", "mepid": "2187", "text": "   Thank you to the Italian Presidency for the work it has done over the last few months.

Madam President, we are almost an hour and a half late, which sometimes happens with the Italian speakers who have gone before us. This was important, of course, but I am a little sorry that the possibility of my colleagues - and there are many of them - to participate in the \"Interventions on Demand\" procedure is limited. For we have come a long way with this dossier on the cultivation of GMOs, as a few months ago the situation was completely blocked on the side of the Member States caught up in endless legal disputes for almost ten years with, to take only the most recent examples, Italy and Poland, respectively condemned in 2013 and 2014 for breach of our European legislation.  The Council finally gave birth to a common position in July so that our Parliament could take second reading of this text on the question of the free choice of European countries to grow GMOs on their territory.  My gratitude goes right away, of course, to the shadow rapporteurs who accompanied me valiantly throughout this second reading: Elisabeth Kostinger for the EPP Group, Gilles Pargneaux, Julie Girling, Lynn Boylan, Bart Staes and Eleonora Evi, not to mention, of course, Giovanni La Via, the chairman of our Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety - I think he is there - who has , with great energy, facilitated negotiations throughout the proceedings. Thank you, of course, also to all my colleagues in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety who, at the end of December, largely supported the result of the trilogue: 42 votes in for, 17 against. It is a very clear support that foreshadows, I hope, this lunchtime vote. I now come to the bottom of this legislation, which aims to revise the 2001 directive on the voluntary spread of GMOs in the environment, but also the 2003 regulation on human or animal feed containing these famous GMOs. It is important, and I do do, to make it clear at the outset that its scope is limited here to cultivation. The text therefore does not concern imports or transport. This is not about opening up the broader debate about the usefulness or not of GMOs in agriculture and food.  I come to the heart of our work, to the voice of Parliament and to the results of this last-minute trilogue, and therefore to this long night of 3 December and, of course, to the progress made in relation to the Council's position last July, which are real.  This is the case on the very important issue of the coexistence of cultures. It was Parliament's almost unanimous position to move forward on this issue. The two co-legislators have made concessions, of course. This is the raison d'être of the trilogue, but it is the Parliament's version that prevails since, contrary to the 2001 legislation, the minority of Member States that grow GMOs will now have to take mandatory measures in the border areas in order to avoid possible contamination of traditional or organic fields.  This is also the case with what is at the heart of the directive, namely the famous opt-out procedures that a Member State that does not wish to cultivate GMOs can resort to.  With regard to phase 1, therefore during the authorisation procedure, with this new role which is de facto given to the requesting undertaking, it is true that the European Parliament has, roughly, accepted the Council's text in the face of - and I must say this and all my shadow rapporteurs will confirm this - to a complete absence of leeway left by the Member States and therefore the Council.  However, the Parliament's delegation forced two major points. First, the lifting of conditionality between phase 1 and phase 2. The Member State therefore has two jokers instead of one, two windows of opportunity to restrict the cultivation of GMOs on its territory. It may negotiate with the seed company during the authorization phase, but it is no longer obliged to do so as in the July version of the Commission.  Moreover, the Member State now has ten years, not two - this is essential - to oppose the cultivation of GMOs on its territory and to operate this phase 2 on the basis of an open list of reasons. I am thinking of agricultural policy, soil and environmental protection or the socio-economic impact during this second phase.  Last but not least, the Council eventually complied and agreed to extend the ban to GMO groups defined by culture or characteristic.  Let us be clear, and I am speaking mainly here to the undecided, there is no credible option but this agreement and the status quo, contrary to what I hear, is not one, except to satisfy this current legal jungle or embark on an unlikely conciliation with an increasingly inflexible Council. Clearly, a status quo would be the best way to prevent President Juncker from carrying out his reform for greater transparency and respect for the majority in the GMO authorisation procedure.  Citizens are asking us to give Member States the means to respect their choice, their legitimate choice. With this legislation, we hear them and move forward.

Some time ago I could not have imagined I would be standing here at the end of a successful second reading. I want to thank the rapporteur, Ms Frédérique Ries, for her efficient steering. I also thank the shadow rapporteurs for their support during the discussions. These collective efforts helped us to reach the agreement with the Council and to complete this task successfully. Allow me to recall some facts about GMO cultivation in the European Union. Currently there is only one GMO authorised for cultivation in the EU. It is cultivated in five Member States. Nine Member States have taken measures to prevent its cultivation in their territory, but these measures have not been considered scientifically justified by EFSA. As a result, they are regularly annulled by national judges. This means that the countries wishing to ban GMO cultivation in their territory cannot do so. This is because the current legislation does not allow Member States to take into account their national contexts and the views of their citizens. This creates extreme tensions between law, politics and public expectations. EU citizens, farmers and the biotech industry may feel that we do not address their interests. It also weakens the credibility of everyone involved in the process of GMO risk assessment at European level – namely EFSA, the Member States and the Commission. This is why, in 2009, 13 Member States asked for a solution. The Commission proposed a legally sound and pragmatic response to this call in 2010. It had a dual objective: firstly to maintain a strong science-based EU authorisation system for GMOs, securing uniform safety across the European Union, and secondly to recognise – in full respect of the Treaty – the freedom of each Member State to decide whether to allow GMO cultivation in its territory. I am pleased that the text in front of you fully meets these two objectives. Member States will have the final say on GMO cultivation, depending on their national situation. The Member States that already cultivate GMOs will be able to continue. Those opposed will be able to restrict or prohibit cultivation in their territory. Freedom of choice will be secured. The EU countries that cultivate GMOs will have to implement measures to avoid cross-border contamination in neighbouring Member States. The criteria used to assess the risk to the environment will be updated shortly. This will reflect the latest scientific and technical progress. Let me stress that Member States will still be able to adopt measures to address unforeseen risks that may be detected after a GMO is authorised. If you vote in favour of the legislative proposal on GMO cultivation, you will provide the Member States with legally-sound tools to decide on GMO cultivation in their territory starting in spring 2015. The EU has repeatedly been asked to do more to live up to citizens’ expectations. I would like to believe this EU legislation is responding to the call. In this context, I would like to make the following declaration: when proceeding with the authorisation of GMOs for cultivation, the Commission will – in full respect of its obligations – take account of elements at its disposal, including the possibility for the Member States to restrict or prohibit the cultivation of GMOs in their territory as provided for by this directive.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 74, "date": "2015-01-13.json", "name": "Elisabeth KÖSTINGER", "mepid": "96882", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report and for the way in which she has been rapporteur for her excellent work. After four months of hard work, we have now succeeded in presenting to the plenary a compromise agreed with the Council on the self-determination of the European Member States in GMO cultivation. After three years of deadlock, we have finally cleared the hurdle in the Council, and I would like to thank the rapporteur, Frédérique Ries, very warmly for their constructive cooperation.  The legal text is a major step towards greater subsidiarity and greater self-determination. In recent years, too, opposition to genetic engineering has formed within governments. In the vote on the approval of Pioneer 1507 in February last year, 19 Member States have already voted against it. This fact cannot be ignored.  The national governments concerned have already taken this into account. Eight EU Member States have banned the cultivation of the GMO plant poppy 810 in their respective territories by means of the only instrument currently available to them, the so-called safeguard clause, and have thus even risked legal action by manufacturers because the safeguard clause allows only temporary bans.  We have now put a stop to this intolerable situation by finding a legally watertight solution. The two-stage procedure, which allows the country to choose whether or not to include the applicant in the opt-out procedure, provides the highest possible legal certainty and, at the same time, strengthens subsidiarity. It is certainly not the wisdom of the last conclusion, but it is a step in the right direction.

The agreement reached on December 3rd in a trilogue is a game-changer. It is important to remember this in this debate. Without this agreement, we would have retained the current situation, where the European Commission allows the cultivation of a GMO because of the lack of a common position in the Council. This situation could not last any longer. It systematically put Member States at odds with Member States that wanted to say no to GMOs, such as France. In this long and difficult negotiation in the face of an inflexible Council, together with Frédérique Ries, our rapporteur whom I would like to welcome, we have succeeded in strengthening the protection of consumers, farmers and Member States. This directive means more security for Member States opposed to GMOs.  For spring 2015, Member States will be able to restrict or ban the cultivation of GMOs in their territories on the grounds of environmental, agricultural and socio-economic reasons. This means more safety for farmers who support traditional or organic crops. Within two years, Member States will take steps to prevent contamination of traditional crops by GMO crops in cross-border areas. This means more security for European consumers. The European Commission has pledged to review and strengthen the rules for risk assessment conducted by the European Food Safety Authority within two years. In another victory for European consumers, we have convinced the Commission not to grant any new authorisation for GMO cultivation before this directive comes into force. It was a tough fight and we got there. I think we have won, but this directive is just the beginning.

The intention was to unblock the wholly unjustified failure to grant final approval of GMOs by the Commission. In other words, we are now present at the final act in a long and expensive process initiated simply to avoid repeated exposure of the Commission’s lack of political courage. On a more optimistic note, this does show that EU competences as defined by the Treaties are not absolute, and I look forward to such flexibility being shown in other areas as my Prime Minister continues his negotiations to reform the EU. Of course, as with all controversial proposals, the devil is in the detail. There are many details here which I find unacceptable. The agreement will permit Member States to proceed directly to national bans post-Union authorisation, rather than first seeking a more legally-sound opt-out from authorisation, as initially proposed. It allows for national bans to apply to groups of GMOs, rather than on a case-by-case basis, and fails to completely rule out the possibility of Member States citing environmental and public health grounds for national bans. This conflicts with the EFSA risk assessment process, whereby the environmental and public health risks of GMOs are examined on a case-by-case basis prior to Union authorisation. On principle, I cannot accept a proposal which allows for the scientific assessment of GMOs to be undermined in this way. The European Parliament’s negotiating position on this file has led to this unsatisfactory outcome. Based on a disproportionate demonisation of GMOs along the ‘Frankenstein foods’ lines promoted in the tabloid press, Members are cutting off a route to higher yields, lower pesticide use and less use of water, and denying access to new-generation GMOs, such as Omega-3-rich camelina, which will have widespread health benefits. I hope that the cobbled-together, legally-fragile compromise that Parliament has promoted will be robust and that the authorisations will start to flow. Member States that want to continue to develop European agriculture as the best in the world are holding their breath, counting on this not being just a charter to ban, but also a key to unlock progress.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "ECR", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 3, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 77, "date": "2015-01-13.json", "name": "Anneli JÄÄTTEENMÄKI", "mepid": "28314", "text": "  On behalf of the ALDE Group. – Mr President, Parliament is now deciding whether eu member states will be given more freedom to decide on the cultivation of GM crops in their territories.

This means adding an article to the former directive which increases the rights of Member States to legally justify a national or regional ban on GMO cultivation. This is a matter for the Member States to decide. The genetically modified product arouses emotions. It is very important that the European Food Safety Agency examines these matters closely. It is important that the authorisations granted by this agency are really well founded so that, after the authorisation, the Member States can decide for themselves and independently what to do. In Europe, Asia and many other countries, genetically modified products are treated much more freely than here in Europe. We have been reluctant about this and, in fact, I think it is the right principle. There is still a lot to explore here, a lot of things that we do not know about today.

The long and winding path to today’s vote reflects the highly controversial nature of genetic modification for consumers, farmers, national governments and MEPs in this Parliament. Consistent polls show that citizens across the European Union continue to be wary of GM – a wariness that biotech companies casually dismiss as lack of understanding. I would argue the opposite. Citizens are acutely aware of the implications of GM. They have seen the impact that GM cultivation has had in America and India: increased herbicide resistance and the need for stronger pesticides and more frequent pesticide use. The ups and downs of this legislation have, unfortunately, ended on a disappointing note. Parliament’s first reading and Frédérique Ries’s report from last year were both excellent rebuttals to the initial weak proposal by the Commission in 2010 and the very worrying Council position of June 2014. The Council position introduced a system whereby democratically-elected governments would politely ask a biotech company to remove their territory from the authorisation procedure. The concept of a private company being placed on an equal footing with a sovereign country is deeply undemocratic and set a worrying precedent. While I welcome the fact that this system has been improved in the final document, I nevertheless believe that the legislation before us is flawed. Parliament wanted to ensure that Member States would be able to use justifications for opting out based on environmental and health grounds additional to those examined in the European risk assessment. Unfortunately the key word ‘complementary’ has been removed to a recital, and the language is contradictory and would be worrying if it were ever challenged in court. There has been further weakening of the text with the change of the legal basis, environmental considerations relegated to the recitals, and the crucial liability scheme being removed. For countries such as Ireland, where the agriculture sector is vital, it is essential that opting out should be definitive. In order for me to vote in favour of this report, opting out would have to be absolutely legally watertight, and I do not believe this legislation makes it so.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 79, "date": "2015-01-13.json", "name": "Bart STAES", "mepid": "4751", "text": "  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Within the Council of Ministers, there is a large majority who oppose the admission of commercial GMO crops.

Because we let the GMO giants play a role in the decision-making process through phase 1. Because the new law is not sufficiently strong on coexistence measures and does not ensure that GMO crops contaminate traditional agriculture and bio-farming, and finally because the scheme does not respond to the financial responsibility of those who potentially contaminate common farmers and bio-farmers.

This Parliament had clearly indicated its desire to include in the text of the agreement certain elements considered fundamental. Among the most important changes was the possibility for Member States to be able to act as managers of public health and environmental risk when it comes to deciding whether or not to grow transgenic plants, to be able to ban their use in view of the environmental and health hazards that EFSA continues to want to ignore, to ensure the application of the 'polluter pays' principle and so on.

On the one hand, the investment required to create a new GMO plant is high. As a result, this technology may lead to a decrease in the number of crop varieties grown. Diversity is agriculture's best asset against disease and pest problems. On the other hand, the vast majority of GMOs are Roundup Ready varieties. Crops can be watered with Roundup, a weedkiller highly toxic to wildlife but also to humans. Other GMO plants secrete pesticides themselves. Some of these pesticides are probably ingested by consumers. It should be noted that the amount of Roundup residues tolerated in soybeans increased fourfold in the United States in 1997 to allow the sale of transgenic soybeans. Roundup is a potentially very dangerous carcinogen. Consumer health here seems to be an adjustment variable. Finally, farmers need to replenish their supplies of GMO seeds each year; they are enslaved and not liberated by this technology.  The new directive you want us to vote on is a trap. You will give a little sovereignty to the states by allowing them to authorize or ban a GMO on their territory. However, due to the principle of free movement, French supermarkets will be increasingly welcoming GMO products from other EU countries on their shelves.

We have a compromise - after five years - that offers freedom of choice and, nevertheless, greater legal certainty. What is important to me is that the assessment of GMO seeds and their safety takes a scientific approach and is not subject to purely ideological debate.

The result achieved is Hungary the european union, as this will give us a Guarantee at European level that our agriculture's GMO exemption, as enshrined in the Basic Law, can be guaranteed at European level. Nevertheless, it must be said that there are many of us who would have liked to have seen more, stricter regulation. However, we must recognise that a realistic compromise has been reached in the current circumstances. In addition to the continued opposition of Member States supporting the cultivation of GMOs, the main objective of ensuring member states' free choice has finally been achieved. However, in terms of research and food safety, we still have a brigade of work ahead of us, and we must continue to address the long-term health effects of GMOs. While maintaining the delicate balance reached by this compromise, we must go further on the ground of science to ensure the highest level of protection for European consumers. We can see that the regulation of GMOs shows that environmental protection is a European issue that does not stop at national borders.

However, there were weaknesses in the legislation that jeopardise real freedom of choice.  Firstly, the new law relies on EU internal market legislation. It should have been incorporated into environmental legislation, as GM cultivation and products remain a potential risk to the environment and public health. The principle of the free movement of the internal market may prove to be a strong weapon in the court for a company wishing to extend the cultivation of its GM potatoes to all Member States.  In addition, the legislation lacked measures to define actions in situations where GM material is inadvertently present in areas for which it is not wanted. This is a common problem, for example in border regions with states. At present, for example, a Portuguese organic farmer would have to pay a financial loss for making his crop unsable to sell.  A system must be set up at EU level that is binding on all states and operators, in accordance with the 'polluter pays' principle. We are not yet sufficiently familiar with the long-term and double effects of genetic variants, so it is better to adhere to the precautionary principle before we make irreversible solutions.  There is no need for more genetic engineering to feed the world's population – we are already importing food for 14 billion people.

This is about authorising Member States to restrict or prohibit the cultivation of genetically modified organisms. A lot is known about the threat of GMOs, but it is worth remembering something. It is not possible to stop the spread of modified genes. Irreversible contamination of GMOs will always follow. This will mainly affect small and medium-sized family farms that cultivate organic farming, in countries such as Lithuania. The cultivation of transgenic plants creates monoculture areas where many traditional varieties perish. The farmer practically becomes addicted to chemical corporations (seeds are patented and have to buy them every year). In addition, the cultivation of GMOs contributes to the decline of production and replaces the natural balance in existing ecosystems. The worst consequences follow below: infertile soil, poor harvest, constant threat of diseases. In addition, pesticides and herbicides become ineffective, forcing farmers to use several more toxic mixtures of them. As a result, the incidence of allergies and respiratory diseases increase among the population.

We regret that all the other groups have refused this debate. It is incomprehensible, especially since you cannot claim that we properly have a full agenda, yet yesterday was without any debate.  As far as this agreement is done, it is important to remember that this Parliament merely approves or rejects the proposals negotiated by the European Commission and cannot make any changes to them. We could make these amendments, the proposal that is being discussed and voted on here would certainly be very different from the one we have, because a profound change in the philosophy, objectives and results of these agreements is needed.  It is important to approve this agreement, it is important for St Thomas and Principe and for the Member States of the European Union, but this does not erase, it cannot erase the overall negative balance of what has been left behind, nor does it erase the need for profound change.

Justified steps to maintain marine fish stocks will result in a continuous and significant reduction in the amount of marine fish fish fished. Therefore, the common fisheries policy should pay much more attention to sustainable fish farming, i.e. aquaculture, and in particular freshwater fish farming. A significant number of fish ponds in Hungary are located in Natura 2000 sites. These farms do not pose any threat to the natural values of these areas, unlike marine aquaculture areas. Moreover, in many cases it is precisely because of our closed-system fish ponds that they have created or preserved individual wetland associations. Consequently, freshwater aquaculture should be freed from unduly strict and unnecessary sustainability standards. These are only justified for marine fisheries and aquaculture.

We voted in favour of consulting the European Economic and Social Committee on the matter, however with the concern that it will no longer be an instrument for legitimising the exploitation of workers and deepening neoliberal policies.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "GUE/NGL", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 467, "date": "2015-01-13.json", "name": "Nathan GILL", "mepid": "124965", "text": "  in writing. — It is the duty of the British Government and the British Department for Transport to write our own legislation, and it is not for the EU to meddle.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "EFDD", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 468, "date": "2015-01-13.json", "name": "Tania GONZÁLEZ PEÑAS", "mepid": "127330", "text": "  in writing. — We voted in favour of this request to the European Economic and Social Committee on the report assessing the implementation, so far, of the 2011 White Paper on Transport: the EU Strategic Document setting out the main lines in transport policy.

To succeed in achieving these objectives, the European Commission has set targets that must be achieved by 2050: - increase by 40 percent the use of fuels emitting less CO2.  - increase by 50 percent the use of trains in long-distance transport instead of cars - gradual replacement of cars running on conventional fuels with cars using alternative fuels or drive.

It is not justified when 19 of the 28 governments oppose the legalisation of the new GMO crop, but the final decision is taken by the Commission without taking into account the positions of democratically elected governments. With regard to today's document, I can only welcome the fact that Member States are given a broader mandate to decide on the cultivation of GMOs in their territories.

The vast majority of European citizens do not wish to grow and consume GM crops - nor are animals genetically modified for consumption. From today, Even Member States that do not explicitly wish to do so have a clear right not to grow GMOs on their territory. A minority of states that already grow GMOs must take measures to prevent contamination of fields by those that grow such crops, we are referring here to fields in border areas. The text approved by the Council and, today, by the European Parliament, enshrines the possibility for Member States to opt out of gmOs on their territory, which I believe increases the rights within the meaning of the subsidiarity of the Member States.

I believe that there is still no complete agreement between Member States and experts on GMOs.

Progress has finally been made in this process, and, of course, this does not mean the end of the debate between those who oppose the cultivation of GMOs and those who advocate them. I believe that member states should be given the right to restrict the cultivation of GMOs, and this requires a single directive. I think it is right that, in relation to GMOs, Member States will be able to intervene and develop the level of restriction transparently in their own judgement. In addition, the restrictions will also apply in specific border zones in neighbouring countries. Uniform regulation can also be a solution to member states' fears of legal attacks by biotechnology companies.

The Commission's proposal was largely aimed at restoring ecosystems, but did not exclude fishing. I have proposed that fishing should no longer be allowed in the most vulnerable areas. This gives overfished fish species a chance of survival and prevents many other species from being caught. In particular, fishing with trawlnets causes a lot of bycatch of dolphins, seabirds and other mammals, which become entangled in the nets and then drown. Scientific advice calls for restrictions on trawlnets. I have asked for a total ban, because this is much easier to control. In addition, I have proposed to prevent the looting of coral reefs by prohibiting the harvesting and selling of red coral, also known as blood coral.

Amendments 14 and 18 have improved the proposed text from the position of small fishermen, especially those dealing with the catch of anchovies.  The last of these accepted amendments is also important because of the experience of fishing in the Adriatic Sea. Croatian fishermen have a higher number of fishing days than the proposed minimum, which included time spent at sea without laying nets. Namely, in more than one third of fishing days on small blue fish, there is no laying of a net in the sea at all for a number of reasons such as: sudden change of weather, appearance of dolphins or tuna that disperse fish, amplification of the current, inability to find fish on certain days, etc. The adopted text amendment provided some flexibility needed for Croatian fishermen to continue the existing fishing practice, i.e. fishing. only that time with registered catches is included at the time of fishing days.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 814, "date": "2015-01-13.json", "name": "Tonino PICULA", "mepid": "112744", "text": "  Written. — I support the proposed package of provisions for fishing in the area of the Agreement of the General Fisheries Commission of the Mediterranean.

In my view, such a provision is fairer to fishermen and that days where there were no catches should not be subtracted from the days allowed for their activities by fishermen. This applies especially to Croatian fishermen swimmers who can only hunt on days without moons and who, unlike floating trackles, are threatened by both predators and corinths.

We have just reminded us, when we came in, that you were sitting in the same place four years ago, when you were a representative of the Polish Presidency, which we remembered as a very successful Presidency, now as President of the European Council, so you have the floor immediately.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 842, "date": "2015-01-13.json", "name": "Donald Tusk", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "  President of the European Council. - Mr President, here, in the Parliament of European citizens, on French soil, I want to honour the victims of the Paris attacks. We all stand with France and the French people. We will not forget. We will not fear. Three messengers of death cannot – will not – intimidate millions of people of good will. That is exactly what we proved in Paris last Sunday. May this brutal act only strengthen our unity in defence of our liberty, of our solidarity, and of our laughter. I last stood here – as you mentioned, Mr President – in 2011 as Prime Minister of Poland. Today, it is my duty and my pleasure to brief this Parliament as the President of the European Council. After an overview of the meeting in December, I will sketch out the work ahead and give you some of my ideas about our Union. You will find that they have not changed since the last time I spoke here. Honourable Members, as you know, to defend everything is to defend nothing. If you have 10 priorities, you have none. That is why, in December, I invited leaders to focus on just two crucially important issues needing our immediate attention. These are injecting investment into the European economy, and the situation at our eastern borders with Ukraine and Russia. On investment and growth, we discussed and agreed the plan to establish a European Fund for Strategic Investment. Today the Commission presented the plan in more detail. At our meeting, leaders gave their support and set a firm timeline. Now it is for you, as legislators along with the Council, to ensure that the fund is ready by June. The aim, as you know, is to unlock billions in new investment in the European economy. The European Investment Bank can already start signing off the first projects this month. This investment plan will complement our economic strategy based on sound public finances and structural reforms. Of course, I know as well as you do that the investment plan is not a silver bullet but only part of our efforts. If anyone has an idea about how to overcome the crisis at one stroke, please speak up. Personally, I am convinced that we still need constant work and many ideas, because the economic ‘philosopher’s stone’ simply does not exist. We also agreed on stepping up the fight against tax avoidance and aggressive tax planning. This is an important issue – and not only for public finances: it is also a matter of fairness and social justice. We will come back to it in June. Regarding the situation in Ukraine and Russia, leaders had a frank strategic exchange. On the sanctions, we agreed that the best thing for now is to stay the course. We will decide the next steps in March. Meanwhile, we will support Ukraine and its government, including financially. The more we help the ‘new Ukraine’, the better our own future will be. That is why we discussed more financial aid for Ukraine. Last week, the Commission proposed lending a further EUR 1.8 billion to Ukraine. Leaders also welcomed the intention to increase humanitarian aid. Ukrainians must know and see that Europe is with them. I also took the opportunity at the December meeting – the first of my presidency – to set out a clear agenda for the months ahead. In February, leaders will discuss ways to improve governance in our Economic and Monetary Union. I also decided, after consulting with the French President, that the February European Council will deal with the challenge posed by the Paris attacks. In March, we will discuss the European economy, the energy union and our approach to Russia, including in the context of the Eastern Partnership Summit in Riga in May. In June, we will take decisions on the digital single market and review the Investment Fund. Going back briefly to December, the European Council also discussed foreign fighters and the passenger name record (PNR) issue, in the presence of President Schulz. We know this is a difficult and delicate topic. This Parliament has rightly taken seriously its role in defending the freedoms of European citizens. But I also ask you to help us protect the security of those who elected this chamber. Yet again we face the everlasting dilemma between security and freedom, and yet again we must find a wise balance between these two fundamental needs. If we are unable to build a coherent security policy for the Union, sooner or later we will put at risk the freedoms that we have built at European level, including Schengen. I do not want to see that happen on my watch. If we do not get a single European PNR, we may end up with 28 national ones. National systems would be a patchwork with holes. They would interfere with the privacy of citizens but would not properly protect their security. One European system is clearly better for security and freedom. That was true in December and, unfortunately, it is even truer today. We do not have the privilege of living in boring times. These are tough political times. This is the time when the Europe our children will inherit is being decided on, day by day. That is why, firstly, we must be clear about our fundamental values: solidarity, freedom and human dignity, including the right to live free from fear. This also means fighting the enemies of those values – whoever and wherever they are. Secondly, we need strong determination to end the economic crisis, especially to reduce unemployment. It is also our responsibility to create a genuine Economic and Monetary Union. I take this task very seriously. Our common currency, the euro, is our advantage. Lithuania’s decision to become the 19th member of the eurozone is a sign of confidence in the currency. (Applause) Thirdly, the European Union must be strong internationally. We will support those in the neighbourhood who share our values. The European Union will not turn a blind eye when borders on our continent are changed by force. We have stood united on this issue and we will continue to do so. Only unity can bring us results. Lastly, the relations between Europe and the United States are a cornerstone of our prosperity and freedom. In this context, I believe one of the most important challenges is to make progress in the negotiations on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP). Leaders were clear in December: the EU and the US should make all efforts to conclude negotiations on a comprehensive, ambitious and mutually beneficial agreement by the end of 2015. With all of these things, all the European institutions must work together for their common good, while respecting the role that each is here to play. We will conquer the challenges facing us with energy and optimism or not at all. Certainly no European nation, and no single state, can conquer them alone. For my part, I will use all the skills I have to keep the work of the European Council results-oriented and focused on what really matters. For a long time now, I have observed that the institutions compete with one another. It is my personal ambition to change this to total cooperation, and the first weeks of my work, together with Martin, Jean-Claude and Federica, are proving that it is possible. Honourable Members, a few words to conclude: I do not think Europe is old, haggard or barren. I have no doubt: Europe is young, dynamic and vital. (Applause) Our continent remains the best place in the world to live, and I think the European Union is the best political organisation in its history: a political organisation, which means that it is a tool in our hands, not a despot, nor a destination. There are some here who do not wish the Union well. Perhaps I could say I respect that, but I do not. If we undo the European Union, no one will be freer. No one will be better off. No one will be safer. (Applause) I believed in Europe when the Polish Solidarity movement was born in 1980. I believed in Europe when the Wall came down in 1989. I still believed when I spoke here as Prime Minister in 2011 and, honourable Members, I still believe in Europe today. I want a Europe of free citizens, a united, internally secure Europe, safe from external threats and confident about its future. We must remember that Europe is a real community of nations and peoples, and that is why we must not be afraid of tensions among us. They are often productive and creative. Equally, we often get better when we agree to disagree. I am sure that in this room we have a difference of opinion on the Charlie Hebdo cartoons, but as Europeans we share the fundamental view that no one has a right to use violence or to murder people because they have a different religion or a different sense of humour. (Applause) Similarly, for instance, we have in this room different views about Russia and different interests in relation to Russia. But no one here, I deeply believe, will ever accept a state invading and occupying the territory of another state or killing its citizens. Politics is about the disagreement we allow to play out on the rock of our principles. However, we will never get anywhere without recognising that the fates of Europeans, of all of us, are fundamentally bound together.

Mr President, Mr President of the European Council, ladies and gentlemen, I will be brief because I have to be brief.  I have to be because the College of Commissioners is still in a meeting, and when we are discussing important issues that require deep meditation, I would not leave them alone. It is therefore a paternal reflex that forces me to reach my colleagues as quickly as possible. I must be brief and I can be brief because the President of the Council has said what needs to be said in presenting before you the results of the first European Council which he was able and had to chair. He did so brilliantly because it was the shortest meeting of the European Council I have ever attended. I hope this will bode well and I would like us to be able to sleep at night when we are in Brussels. He drew your attention to the fact that the European Council supported, in terms of its principles and its main joints, the investment plan that I had the opportunity to present to you at the end of November.  I would like to point out here that the investment plan complements the arsenal of policies that we have at our disposal. I would like to stress once again that the virtuous triangle that we have defined is to continue the fiscal consolidation that is still needed, that it is to revive the structural reforms that European interests in the medium and long term require, and that it consists of stimulating investment in Europe, which has been failing since 2008 since the overall level of investment in Europe has fallen by more than 15% and well beyond in some Member States.  I would like once again to invite Member States to contribute bilateral payments to the capital of the Strategic Fund that we are setting up. Unfortunately, the Council has not been able to collect the first agreements that The Member States could have given at the Council meeting on 18 December, but once the mechanism is in place - and the Commission is in the process of deciding on its implementation - I would like the Member States to contribute in large numbers to give impetus to the investment plan by participating in the financing.  I would have liked to describe to you today in plenary the elements of the Commission's communication on flexibility on the Stability Pact, but as the College is still discussing it, I must postpone this presentation. It will be interesting, I can assure you. But I say once again here that the rules of the pact will not be changed. I note, including in this morning's speeches, that the expectation is great that the pact will change in nature. It will not change in nature or rules, but we will add a dose of flexibility to the pact by applying these guiding principles. Of course, the Commission feels obliged - but this was its initial intention - to present to the Council, by June, a package of measures to combat tax evasion. We agreed and I said that to you in presenting the program.  (Laughs from some EFDD MPs) Some people, when we first discussed this problem, laughed. I see, if only on the daily reading of European newspapers, that there is less and less laughter.  And they will be even less so in the future. We will present an action programme... (Exclamations from EFDD MPs) Sometimes you speak a language that is difficult to understand. I do not see the need to listen to each and every word you say in this House. Really, I do not. Irrespective of this, the Commission will do its job and present to the institutional authorities - in the Council and Parliament - a directive on automatic exchange on early tax decisions. I draw your attention to the fact that we will decide today on the establishment of the strategic fund. We could have done it ourselves - Council and Commission - without involving Parliament in this legislative work. But as I promised, we intended to rehabilitate the Community method. Therefore, we would like Parliament to be closely involved in this legislative work.  Thank you, Mr President of the Council, for allowing me to be as brief as possible. I'm leaving you with a heavy heart.

I would like to begin by offering him a warm welcome on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats to the new President of the European Council. Today is the first time that you have been speaking in plenary and presenting a report. With Donald Tusk, we have a Poland at the head of the European Council, one of the most important institutions of the European Union. He is now the second Pole to lead, after Jerzy Buzek, who was already the pole, as one of the former new Member States, the second Pole. Perhaps it is also time to stop distinguishing between new and old countries. We are a Europe, and donald Tusk also symbolises it. (Applause) I would like to offer him a close partnership with the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and, I believe, with Parliament as a whole, which is also characterised by mutual respect, because we have different roles. The European Council's task is to describe perspectives, to describe the long-term orientation of our continent, given the power of the Heads of Government, and we, as legislators, have the task of implementing them. This respect is expressed in your words. I am grateful for that. I would also like to emphasise that you take concentrating seriously, focusing on the essential points that are now before us, because the citizens expect us to focus on the great things of Europe. I would like to ask you to do the work of the next few years: I would ask you, when communication and press conferences take place after the meetings, to remind you that they do not always just say: 'I have decided I have prevailed, I have achieved'. It would be nice if we in the Council, and I am sure you will try to do so, create a climate where it is said: 'We have moved forward and moved for Europe'. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she We are delighted that Donald Tusk is here. He has already raised a number of key points in the first session. The full support for the Juncker programme, for our President's ideas to stimulate investment, is a great success, given the debates we have had in the Council over months and years. We are pleased that the legislative proposals have been adopted today, and we also assure the President of the Commission that we will do everything possible to accompany the decisions quickly. However, we also want to provide our citizens with answers quickly. With regard to Ukraine, one of the most burning foreign policy issues that surrounds us with our neighbours, you made it clear in the first session that we continue to be partners of these people who stand for freedom and democracy. The support is there, it has also been made clear by the financial support that the European Union has decided on in recent days. I would also like to say explicitly that I welcome the fact that the sanctions are working. Some in the public debate were surprised that sanctions suddenly have economic effects. I think the aim was for them to have economic effects. We hope that, as a result of these sanctions, this economic pressure, the Russian leadership will then return to the path of partnership and cooperation. Finally, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to take up Paris, because that will be the top issue for the next Council. Europe is somewhat in shock. Feelings are mixed in Europe. Between courage, concern, fear, but also self-confidence, the feelings we feel in Europe resonate. Above all, the European Council – we then, but first of all the European Council – must take the lead and make it clear that we are giving serious answers to these challenges. The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats supports this, and the Commission's PNR proposals are already on the table here. We want us to make progress on this. In respect of the data protection rules, we want legislation to be adopted here in order to better monitor those who are at risk. We also believe that we need to do something about the external border debate. In other words, better protection and better monitoring of Europe's external borders is one of the objectives we have to pursue. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she Working on a Europe of security is our common task. It is necessary to give our citizens the answer that we can meet the challenge and also give answers. I would like to extend a warm welcome to the new President-in-Office of the Council. The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is looking forward to working closely together.

On behalf of my group, we wish you the greatest success in your management and a constant, permanent presence in this Parliament. Since this December European Council was convened, we have seen a different passion between the Commission and the Council, a different level of concreteness and commitment. Because the Commission went to the presentation of its strategic investment plan in time; it did so with a consistent amount, which does not satisfy the investment gap that the European Union has, but which is a good sign, which is a good principle. In turn, we have just been told that issues relating to the regulation of the Fund, the impact that the Fund will have on the 2015 budget, and also how to use, more flexibly, within the Stability and Growth Pact, the instruments available to us are being prepared— they are being prepared, they are being discussed. I therefore believe that the Commission has complied. I recognise the Commission's willingness to include the European Parliament through the ordinary legislative procedure. However, the Council has not been specific in the assumption of publicly funded financing commitments in the strategic investment plan. I do not know what they said in the Council; I do know what they said outside. And outside they have made no concrete commitments to the financing of that plan. Nor have they assumed the necessary neutralisation of these funds within the Stability and Growth Pact, nor have some regulations sleeping in the Council that are necessary for the union's growth, such as that relating to the Digital Agenda, been unlocked. A word about the PNR. I believe — coming from a country with experience in matters of terrorism — that legislating at highly emotional times is dangerous. And so what we have to do is, with serenity, agree, to provide more security for European citizens, but not to sacrifice freedoms and rights to advance that security.

This is the first meeting where we have the opportunity to meet you, and it must be said loudly, as you said today, that Europe is facing many difficult challenges today. You also said that we do not live in boring times, we do not have this privilege, but you also mentioned Polish Solidarity, which has won freedom in Poland and which I also understand in the context of European solidarity. Today, much is being said about the plan to rebuild the economy in Europe, about a plan for reindustrialisation, which is to create new jobs. This plan – president Juncker's plan, which stands out here and was the subject of the last European Council – is facing a great challenge today. This challenge is the energy situation in Europe, especially in central and eastern European countries. This is particularly evident now in my country, Poland.  I ask you, the government of the Civic Platform in Poland (the party from which President Donald Tusk came here from, from which he came here to the European Council) has in recent days announced a plan for the decommissioning of coal mines, which is the main raw material in Poland – not only in Poland, but also in many countries of the European Union, especially Central and Eastern Europe. This is very dangerous for our economy, it is very dangerous for many European economies, especially in the age of the climate package, which was adopted by the States of the Union and accepted by the European Council, and if there is no intervention, joint intervention within the European Union countries on this issue, and financial assistance, it will lead to the loss of not hundreds, not thousands, not hundreds of thousands, but perhaps even more than a million jobs by the loss of many industries. , especially the energy industry.  Today in Poland, miners strike 11 mines, strike underground. Their families are terrified, because the prospect of the decommissioning of coal mines in Poland is the loss of thousands, tens of thousands of jobs, the destruction of the existence of thousands of families, the loss of bread, the loss of dignity that work represents for people – the work that they will lose as a result of these actions.  I wanted to call today, but at the same time ask a question, to call for the Juncker Plan, at the time of the adopted climate package, to take into account the needs for change in the energy economy, to take into account the needs of the necessary changes in the extractive industries, to include them in financial terms, so that there is money foreseen for the modernisation of European energy, especially in those countries which, as a result of decades of communist rule, are now still going backwards. , in terms of economic development, in relation to the strong, great states of the old European Union. This is a huge challenge facing the union as a whole today, a challenge that we must meet. I call for this and ask whether the Juncker Plan will take these needs into account, or will we see pictures like poland today in Poland – weeping people, desperate miners, desperate people from the energy industry who are at risk of real job losses? The Juncker Plan should build these places and not allow them to be abolished.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 847, "date": "2015-01-13.json", "name": "Guy VERHOFSTADT", "mepid": "97058", "text": "  on behalf of the ALDE Group. – Mr President, first of all: Mr Tusk, welcome; I should say good luck. I have always been a fan of yours; I always thought you were better in the Liberal Group than in the PPE Group, but that is only a small remark. My only request to you is not to lose your pro-European behaviour and your pro-European opinions that you always had, because you are now leading a bunch of 28 prime ministers. You know how they are; you are one of them, and it will be necessary to see the general European interests and not only the addition of the interests of the 28, and that is your main task. I think you have two priorities for the coming weeks and months. First of all, this investment plan may work. Until now we have called it the Juncker Plan; let us be honest, colleagues, we have to stop this. It has to become a Tusk plan; it has to become a Hollande Plan; it has to become a Renzi Plan; it has to become a Marco Plan, a Michel Plan, a Rutte plan; from the 28 – and that is the reason why I am a little bit disappointed by this Council of December. Let us be honest. It was a short Council; I do not criticise it, but I would have preferred a long Council, and then at the end, 28 Member States saying yes to this Plan and entering into the guarantee scheme of the investment strategy of the European Union. Because it does not count, even for the Stability Pact – we know it. That was one of the elements of the flexibility. So why was it not possible for the 28 Member States simply to say: ‘okay, we are backing this investment plan and we are entering into the guarantee scheme behind it’? Secondly, you have also to make the link with the structural reforms. It is not enough to have only announcements about structural reforms; a link between the structural reforms and investment plans is necessary. Finally, I think that the Commission has to come forward with a number of legislative packages to open up the markets, because an investment plan alone is not enough. But I think also that in that respect, Mr Tusk – I ask you, with your intervention, we have to deploy the Telecom package. We are talking about the digital market; we are always looking to Google because of their monopoly position in Europe. But it is our own mistake, because we have no digital market. A telecom package is the first step to make it possible, and I think your second priority is also very clear: that is, to have a package to counter terrorism after the dramatic events in Paris. Let us be honest. I have here all the decisions taken by the Council in 2001. I was President of the European Council at that time, and we took three big decisions. There is a paper of 21 September, two weeks after the attacks of 9/11; of 19 October, a few weeks after the attacks of 9/11; and then December, Laeken, more than 30 pages about our counter-terrorism strategy. You have to read it, because everything we are talking about today was decided already in 2001, and a number of things have been implemented – for example the European Arrest Warrant – after a long battle with Mr Silvio Berlusconi, who was against it. He thought it could be used against himself, and that could have been possible; well, after a long battle, finally it has been realised. I think we have now the need to have a second package in the fight against terrorism – and that is your task for the coming weeks and the coming months – like we did just after 9/11. I see three elements in this. The first element is to retransform INSEN – what we have today does not work, it is a lose cannon – into a real European intelligence service, because the main problem today is not that we have a lack of collecting information; the problem today in Europe is sharing the information. I can tell you, all those who were responsible for these attacks – last year in Mumbai; in Utoya, Toulouse, Paris, the Jewish Museum in Brussels; in Madrid, London; the killing of Theo van Gogh, the Dunblane killings, Boston – all the perpetrators were known by the secret services. It was a lack of sharing, a lack of common analysis, that we have in Europe, and I think that is the first element of your package. The second element is: let us extend the possibilities of Eurojust, of Europol – blocked in the Council, Mr Tusk, for the moment. Let us also have a European Prosecutor; let us also have (in my opinion) EU P and R but you have – the Commission has – to present a new proposal which responds to Parliament’s request – mainly the request that we need also a data protection regulation and directive before we can start with the P and R. Finally, Mr President (and I shall conclude with this), we have also to talk about strengthening our external borders. It is completely stupid what some people have been saying since the attacks in Paris, that we have to come back to national border control. Would that have helped? If you want to have a border in France, maybe you can make a border, as Daniel Cohn-Bendit said two days ago, between the Beaulieu of Paris and the Centre of Paris. That is the reality. What we need is not to undo Schengen; what we need is to have better external border controls, and that is the package and your task for the coming months.

Mr Tusk, welcome to the European Parliament, but I honestly do not understand why you and Mr Juncker, who has just left, are celebrating the European Council of 18 December 2014. yes, you finished it very soon. But what did you decide on that? You just exchanged wishes: \"Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.\" What have you decided on member states' participation in the European Investment Package? Are you going to join? What amounts? By what criteria will investments be allocated? Will they go where there is more disinvestment, recession and unemployment? Or \"business as usual\"?  Do you know that in December 2014 the European Union and the euro area saw negative inflation, deflation? Do you know that all the Nobel Economics notes the risk of deflation and a new cycle of recession? Do you know that the world economy sees the euro area as the weak link? Do you know that since 2009 poverty and unemployment have increased within Europe and within the euro area and inequalities between north and south, between the rich and the poor, between rich regions and the south? How long will the European Central Bank try to allay the Bundesbank's objections and blackmail and not act as the European Central Bank of all Member States, buying government debt, promoting quantitative easing? Where are the new fresh resources that will succeed in implementing the Juncker Package - or the Fund, say it as you wish, Mr Verhofstadt. I have not seen anyone believe that 1 in 15 leverage can be achieved in this Europe of stagnation and deflation. Only Jesus Christ has achieved such miracles and Jean-Claude Juncker is not Jesus Christ. More and more people are saying that we must finally end this dogmatic, one-sided austerity, which brings recession, unemployment, poverty, but also disinvestment. For six years we've been trying the Berlin recipe. It is time to turn to development, a \"New Deal\" that will bring jobs, reclaim a social state in conditions of the rule of law.

Mr President, Mr Tusk, welcome here. For me, Poland has always been a great State in Europe and, with your arrival at the head of the Council, I think Poland shows that it occupies its full place in the European Council. From that point of view, I look forward to your arrival.  You said: \"Now is the time for serious political challenges\" and I would like to draw your attention first to the seriousness of the social challenges. Europe is the promise of shared prosperity. Today, one in four Europeans is at risk of poverty or social exclusion. One in four citizens is not shared prosperity and I have not read anything about it in the Council's conclusions, other than, of course, the fact that you want to join the investment plan.  But even if he succeeded, which I doubt today, he would not guarantee a return to employment. Even reducing unemployment would not yet be a guarantee of reducing inequality. Look at the U.S.: unemployment is falling and incomes are falling at the same time. There are more working poor in the United States today than there were before the crisis.  So if we want to solve the social challenge, we have to address the tax issue. You have mentioned a few things about this, but we would like to see energy on the Council's side to focus on necessary tax harmonisation, to put an end to the tax war that the Member States are waging. The second category of challenges is environmental challenges. In this area, Poland does not have a very glorious history behind it.  The environment, Mr Tusk, is not a variable of adjustment, it is not a subject that is dealt with when we have nothing else to do. The environment is what allows you, me and all of us to live on this planet. If our environment becomes unlivable, humanity will disappear and, in this regard, I am very concerned that the environment is no longer on the Commission's agenda, is not on the Council's agenda and that, in the end, it is a concern that is left for later.  There, you have a boulevard in front of you with the energy union, which is something other than a purchasing powerhouse to ensure the sustainability and security of our energy supply.  The energy union, Mr Tusk, must be the instrument for the European Union of its energy transition, a transition that puts renewable energy and energy efficiency at the heart of its strategy with a triple dividend. First, strategic energy independence, which is an economic dividend because by leading the energy transition, we will be world leaders in transition technologies, and finally a climate dividend and an environmental dividend because we will have helped solve this existential challenge for humanity. The third challenge I would like to draw your attention to is the democratic challenge. This is the case in Poland as everywhere in Europe: the confidence of our citizens in their democracy declines with every election. People don't believe it anymore! They no longer believe that we are all defending the public interest. Today, when decisions are taken in Europe, they most often appear to be taken under the influence of industrial or banking lobbies rather than in the idea of defending the public interest.  I would like to take a few examples. When we have economic governance that, in reality, imposes decisions on public service, social policy and fiscal policy on Member States without any democratic assembly legitimising these decisions, we are no longer in a democracy.  I was very concerned to read in the Council's conclusions that you were pleased and that you absolutely wanted to reach a free trade agreement with the United States before the end of 2015 at a time when hundreds of thousands of Europeans are saying: \"We do not want the clause on an investor-state dispute settlement mechanism\". What does the Commission say? \"Oh, it doesn't matter, we don't care.\" We are sending a message to our citizens that they do not count in democratic debates. That is the third challenge.  Mr Tusk, you have shown that you are a statesman. I hope that, as President of the European Council, you will be up to these three types of challenges: social, environmental and democratic.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "Verts/ALE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 855, "date": "2015-01-13.json", "name": "Nigel FARAGE", "mepid": "4525", "text": "  on behalf of the EFDD Group. – Mr President, first I would like to give my customary welcome to incoming President of the European Council. I can see why they chose you. You are perfect. You are like the euro record that has got stuck in a groove – a completely out-of-date view of what Europe is. Clearly you have learned absolutely nothing from the results of the European elections. As you know, in the United Kingdom, immigration is the key debate. It is dominating political discourse within our country. At the heart of that is the whole question of the free movement of peoples, but your debate is the other side of the same coin. Your debate is about immigration, and time and again, you have promised the Polish voters that young Poles would return to Poland. At the same time, Mr Cameron has promised the British people that fewer Poles would come to us. It turns out that you have both been wrong and that your country has been depopulated by two million people since you joined the European Union. The reason is obvious. It is money, is it not? You yourself prove the point. You are the newest Polish émigré, and you have gone from a salary of EUR 60 000 to a salary of EUR 300 000 a year. Congratulations: you have hit the EU jackpot. But you have also scored a great victory without trying, because last week Chancellor Merkel went to Downing Street. She spent a few hours with Mr Cameron, and Mr Cameron is now a big supporter of the free movement of people. He said: ‘Let me be clear, I support the freedom of movement’. So on that one you have won a great victory against Mr Cameron without having to lift a finger. But he also says that he will now restrict the benefits of EU migrants working in Britain. In the past you have been very clearly opposed to this. Please answer me today, Mr Tusk: is it right that children who live in Warsaw should qualify for child benefits if their parents are working in London? Please clarify that point for me today. In some ways you face quite a tough test, though not with the UK – our leaders are a soft touch. Despite the Lithuanian lemmings, you have got the euro crisis, a referendum on whether the UK stays a member and, of course, the appalling growth of attacks on Jewish people. I would put it to you, Mr Tusk, that the European elections showed us one thing: the voters in Europe want change.

We may have different views on the views expressed here, but above all we want to express respect for the country, its history, which you represent in this House.  Many elements were discussed during the European Council. What is obviously the most exciting is investment. A colleague from the European Left said that there are only savings, so when the word investment is said, there is a project, i think it should be developed very wisely. The question is whether this level of investment is going to be 300 billion, or whether it is going to be higher, as m.in. Polish said. Perhaps this programme should be more consolidated in terms of the share of public funds as well. Because we may sometimes suspect that some investments, in particular privately funded ones, may be those investments that would have been created anyway, and not necessarily financed, unless public money was also invested there. I therefore call for a question on what this contribution by the Member States should be and whether private sector contributions should be more balanced.  I also stress the importance of investments that concern the energy sector. We understand the energy mix differently, but we believe that energy security should come primarily from the European resources of the 28 Member States that Mr Verhofstadt spoke about here. I would also like to encourage Member States to contribute, as such a contribution should not, in my opinion, be included in public debt statistics. As for fiscal consolidation, we believe that tax avoidance – yes, but this consolidation in terms of tax equalization – is understood differently by different countries.

I also appreciate the fact that we do not see Council conclusions in terms of a shopping list or a Christmas tree which is supposed to make everyone happy, but rather as something which shows what the top priorities for the upcoming period are. I also appreciate that a decision has been taken on the fund. On the other hand, there is one thing that I really miss.

I do not agree: we need that link, otherwise we will be wasting money. The third remark is on one of the conclusions on better regulation. I must say that it is the Council, and therefore the Council structures, including the European Council, that have the worst record on better regulation. The absolute minimum is impact assessment. There is no single effort in the Council to deal with it, and I think that this is something I would like to bring to your attention.

Even this wonderful increase in bread – jesus Christ was mentioned here before – represents only 0.8% of EU GDP per year. Instead of siphoning off mega-wealth and drying up tax havens – as the star economist Piketty demands – insurance companies should invest in highways and schools. When the state invests, it creates wealth for all. Taxpayers have to pay for the return of the financial sharks. This is expensive nonsense. We are calling for a public investment programme of EUR 260 billion per year. This pays off with higher taxes and growth. The ECB should finance public investment through the EIB, rather than pumping liquidity into the banks without thought. We need a wealth levy for millionaires – as demanded by the IMF.

Firstly, having listened to this discussion and the shouting from over there today, it strikes me that the problem of the extreme right in this House is that they are not at all right, only extreme – extremely wrong, and I think that their correct name should in future be ‘the extreme wrong’. Their only idea is disrespect and contempt for other people. That is an idea we have seen too much of. It is so wrong and so extreme that their name should be ‘the extreme wrongs’. Secondly: the investment plan. Do not invent the wheel again. I think it is good to have a plan in order to mobilise capital financing of new investments, but the gap we have in Europe is much bigger than any public investment plan can bridge. The investment plan and the bridging of the investment gap will need real political reforms and structural changes. The digital agenda, the telecom package – do it! The internal market and the service directive – ensure that it is done! This will bring an opportunity for profitable investments with a return on investments, because the nature and the spirit of commercial investments are that they are both commercial and investments – not spending.

First of all, the extreme caution shown with regard to the importance of public investment in The European recovery. Yet, at a time when austerity policies have demonstrated their human and socio-economic damage, at a time when private investment is showing prolonged timidity, is it not time to restore public investment to its full importance in reviving an economy that is still failing at the expense of jobs and people? Should we not consider neutralization in the calculation of the debt of public investments that are the promoters of economic and social growth? Shouldn't we also consider a more proactive attitude by the ECB in supporting these public investments? Secondly, one element I would like to stress is the Council's recognition of the urgency of - I quote - 'redoubling efforts against tax evasion and aggressive tax planning at EU level'. Similarly, the Council stresses the importance of transparency and looks forward to the Commission's proposal on the exchange of information on tax rulings. This is, of course, a vital issue for the very existence of the Union, which cannot be built on fiscal and social injustice.

I am standing in for President Juncker here, and I have just come back from the College meeting where we adopted, on the one hand, a proposal for a Parliament/Council regulation to set up a European Fund for Strategic Investment, and, on the other hand, a communication on flexibility – namely on how to use and apply in full the existing rules of the Stability and Growth Pact. I think this is an example of a virtuous exercise. In November, the Commission presented a plan to relaunch investments here in Strasbourg; in December we discussed it in the European Council; and in January – less than 50 days after that – we delivered a proposal to put the fund in place here in Strasbourg. Now we will obviously need to continue working with Parliament and the Council to ensure their swift adoption. President Juncker will present this in detail tomorrow morning, and the Vice-Presidents and Commissioners competent for the plans and the communications themselves will have the opportunity to present them in detail to Parliament’s competent committees. I also know that a series of points were raised during the debate on the other priorities on which we are working. Let me just mention a few of them. I hope we will continue to work on them in the same way, delivering quickly and clearly: on the energy union strategy ahead of the March European Council and on the digital single market proposals ahead of the June Council. On TTIP negotiations, let me say that my colleague Cecilia Malmström is carrying out the work, both in terms of the negotiations with the US – I will visit Washington myself very soon to tackle this as well – but also internally on the level of transparency. We know that this is not only an issue for Parliament, it is also an issue for our people. We have to make sure that we have a good outcome of the negotiations that is for the benefit of all in Europe – and in the United States as well. However, our job is to make sure that it is a good outcome for Europeans. Many of you – and we had a discussion about this in the Council – referred to the need to develop a coherent strategy on Russia and on our relations to Russia. Let me say that we are working closely on both the Commission and Council sides – and here I should probably change seat a couple of times. Work is ongoing at this time on preparing for the decisions and discussions that we will have in the European Council in March. At a meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council next Monday we will already start to discuss the issue, and we are preparing this work very closely together. The virtuous institutional triangle that we see here today has allowed us to deliver so quickly on some of the things we have discussed today. These augur very well for the next five years.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 899, "date": "2015-01-13.json", "name": "Donald Tusk", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "  President of the European Council. - Mr President, I would like to thank you for your warm welcome here in the European Parliament. It is a nice surprise for me, because I have heard a lot about your temperament here in this Chamber. Let me say a few words in response to your interventions. I can only echo what Manfred Weber said in saying that I have no doubt that good communication between the institutions plays a key role. Let me again assure you that I am ready to change the logic of competition into the logic of cooperation. I can promise that I will use 'we', and not 'I'. Of this you can be sure. As regards the investment plan referred to in the interventions made by Mr Verhofstadt, Mr Guerrero Salom and Mr Papadimoulis, you should have no doubts that 28 Members said yes to the Juncker plan in December 2014. What we need now is for the legislation to be agreed between the Council and Parliament. We decided that the fund will be opened to the contributions of Member States, and they are really interested in this project, but we have to organise the staff and the legal context. I can understand why the Member States are waiting today for more details and concrete arguments as regards the legal context. It is obvious that, in December 2014 – at the beginning of this process – Member States would not declare contributions to the fund. I did not expect that they would announce specific sums of money for this fund. However, this is not because of distance or reservation – this was our plan. Mr Verhofstadt, I took note of your position on PNR. We need an open mind in seeking compromise on that. Nothing is simple in this issue. I believe that better information-sharing and cooperation between the intelligence services will be one of the results of the informal European Council in February. It is also my task to organise the discussion about the very concrete problems you mentioned. Mr Lamberts's intervention was about renewables. There will certainly be a place for renewables in the Energy Union. You should not be afraid, but it cannot only be about renewables because Energy Union is about more than just the environment issue. We need to ensure much more energy security. This is why we want to prepare it, but we will discuss it in March, also in the context of renewables. You can be sure of that. Referring to what Mr Farage said, I am impressed and satisfied. Ever since his famous speech five years ago here in this Chamber about Herman Van Rompuy, I have known that he is perhaps the best example of political and personal culture, as well as of political decency and elegance. What more can I say? I am really impressed. Keep it up, Mr Farage. (Interjection from Mr Verhofstadt: 'He is never there when you respond to him') I know, because this is about political culture, as I mentioned a few seconds ago. Let me now turn to Polish to answer Mr Duda's conclusions or his questions about the crisis in Polish mines and the possibility of possible support through money from the so-called Juncker Fund. There are no restrictions at the moment on the areas, on the part of the economy in which we will invest the money raised in this fund, but from the outset we assumed that the criteria on the basis of which loans or guarantees from this fund will be granted cannot be political criteria, but business criteria. Hence, among other things, the unequivocal intention, supported by all Member States, that the criteria and decision-making process be in the hands of managers and experts rather than politicians. Therefore, a key role in this decision-making process (where the money that we will raise in the fund) will be played by people who are substantively connected with the bank's activities and will be guided by one commandment: that this money should work for the development of the whole of Europe and, above all, to contribute to the growth of jobs. That is why possible energy proposals will be assessed in the same way. In my opinion, if we forget about politics, campaigning, etc., and we talk honestly about energy versus the Juncker Fund, that is, the Juncker Plan, then we would have to look in Poland and other countries for such projects, including in the energy sector, which will have a chance of commercial success in the future, because of course the investment fund is not intended as support for projects for which there is no chance of commercial success. to make them profitable. That's understandable. They must guarantee sustainable development and not be used for emergency assistance. I do not exclude that in this area too – I am talking about energy, also in Poland or the mining industry – there may be projects that will gain the approval of experts. Do not pre-empted any idea, no idea. For now, we are at the beginning of this work, also when it comes to collecting projects and ideas that will possibly be financed through guarantees and loans in connection with the Juncker Investment Plan. And I am convinced that all interested parties, including in Poland, will try to prepare well for this. One final remark when it comes to the Polish MEP, Mr Jurek: I will of course treat everyone equally. When I speak the single currency, I speak the language of the Treaty. The euro is the currency of the European Union, although we all know that not all countries have joined the euro area, but this does not change the fact that the euro is our European EU currency.

At the outset, I would like to warmly welcome President Tusk here in the European Parliament. I remember, as Prime Minister of the Republic of Poland, presenting the assumptions of the Polish Presidency of the Council, and then the main comments were also about the high bar and the great expectations that our Prime Minister not only met, but also moved the bar even higher.  Today, commenting on the beginnings of the new role of our Prime Minister, I am sure that he will not only surprise everyone again with his effectiveness, but also with a new vision of the old Europe. However, returning to the subject of today's debate, namely Jean-Claude Juncker's EUR 315 billion investment plan, the positive signal of agreement from the Council is only the first small step towards rebuilding a strong Europe. The Investment Plan is not a promise of success and growth in the European Union, but an opportunity that we must seize. An opportunity for growth and new jobs and an opportunity whose success depends only on the Member States. We cannot analyse the planned investments in terms of the next guarantee for the expected change of citizens.

That is why I really appreciate the chance of having this debate in Parliament today, and also the resolutions on the table. I talked just a few minutes ago with Bernardino Léon, the UN Secretary-General’s special envoy for Libya. We have been in permanent contact during these difficult weeks and months, and you probably know very well that tomorrow is a crucial time for Libya. Tomorrow, starting in the early afternoon, Bernardino Léon has convened talks and is holding talks among different parties. Not all the actors have yet decided to participate, but many have, and let me take this chance first of all to praise those on both sides who are participating in the talks in Geneva tomorrow, and also to encourage – and I think this debate could also be a way of doing so together – all those in Libya who have not yet decided to participate in the talks, to do so now or later in the process. This is an opportunity that the Libyans cannot afford to miss. The strongest message which can come to them from here is: take this opportunity, because we are not sure there will be other opportunities for dialogue in the future. This is going to be the last chance – and I hope it is not going to fade, and so it will the last successful chance – but it could be in any case the last chance to give the country a future in terms of the political process – and also a present in terms of a ceasefire – to stop the violence which, as we know, since the last resolution, the last debate in Parliament (in September if I am not wrong), has deteriorated significantly. There is no alternative to dialogue; there is no alternative for the international community than to support – when and if it takes place – any decision to move towards a national reconciliation or a national dialogue. This is a decision which is in the hands of the Libyans. Our role can and will be that of supporting a process that needs to start in Libya itself. I can assure you that the international community, starting from the regional community, is coordinating very strongly now. This has not always been the case in the past, but finally it seems to be the case. We will not only have the international community, with regular meetings of the special envoys, but there will also be the African Union, the Arab League, the European Union itself and obviously the United Nations framework. We will have on Monday a Foreign Affairs Council, where I have decided to put Libya on the agenda to make an assessment of what is going to happen – or is not going to happen – in Geneva in the coming days. Your debate today will also be an excellent opportunity to contribute, with the resolutions, to the debate of the Ministers on Monday, and I will be particularly pleased to report back to the Ministers about the debate and the decisions of the European Parliament. In the resolutions there are a number of issues which I might return to in more detail in my concluding remarks, such as the review of the mandate of EUBAM, and other things I know that many of you are interested in. But let me say again that the timing of our discussion today gives us a unique opportunity to send a strong political message to those participating in the talks to go ahead, and to those still in the process of deciding on their participation, not to miss this historic opportunity.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 912, "date": "2015-01-13.json", "name": "Mariya GABRIEL", "mepid": "96848", "text": "  on behalf of the EPP group. Mr President, Madam High Representative, as you said, the meeting announced in Geneva by the UN Special Representative in Libya is an opportunity that should not be wasted. I congratulate Bernardino Leon for his action, and stress that we must continue to cooperate closely with him and the United Nations. I'll insist on three axes.  First, a ceasefire and a roadmap are needed for the resumption of democratic transition. Taking into account the lessons learned to overcome extreme polarization requires the efforts of all parties to continue the Ghadamès dialogue.  Second, the regional perspective is crucial for sustainable stabilization. The positive role of actors such as Egypt and the Arab League should be welcomed, not to mention the negative forces and the need for more adequate responses to regional problems.  As for the role of the European Union, I have three questions on this subject. 2015 might be an opportunity to take stock of the EU's strategy for the Sahel. Has there not been a geographically and thematically restrictive approach? Has the link between security and development been established operationally? We must find a way to stop the proliferation of weapons and other trafficking that have grown and continue to destabilize the entire Sahel-Saharan region.  The EUBAM mission: what about the reconsideration of its mandate and the reallocation of resources to take into account the current situation? Finally, I will conclude by recalling the urgent need to reach a point of no return in the dialogue between the parties to the conflict. Libya must not become a bis repetita of the Syrian case.

I do not want to talk about the errors committed by several of the European Union states in Libya and in relation to Libya in recent years. But we are faced with a situation so serious and so tense that the authorities of this state are not functioning or are hardly working at all. We are close to the typical situation of a failing state. On the other hand, we have a situation where the Supreme Court has decided to delegitimize parliament and government, which creates an enormous complication.  The European Union must act firmly and united in this case, with the singular initiatives of some states having to be avoided because we simply no longer have time to fix what we could spoil. In this respect I believe that: 1) it is necessary to stop the fighting immediately between militias operating in Libya both on their own behalf and on behalf of external actors in Libya; (2) it is essential to prevent the conflict in Libya from turning into a conflict with broad regional implications that may affect an already fragile situation; 3) prevent the possibility of Libya becoming a new base of Islamic State operations knowing that elements of Islamic State are already being implanted in Libya.  In this respect, I believe that the European Union must fully support the efforts of the Special Envoy and the UN Secretary-General for a positive solution, and the European Union must cooperate massively and consistently with it.

The legitimately-elected government, having been forced from Tripoli by Islamists in the summer of last year, is now based in the north-eastern city of Al Bayda’. Whilst it claims – that is, the legitimate government claims – to be in control of all but eight of Libya’s largest cities and to remain responsible for approximately 80% of the country’s oil exports, military power is actually being exercised by an ex-Gaddafi general, Khalifa Haftar, in the form of the ‘Dignity’ movement. Whether one looks to the humanitarian crisis presented by the movement of refugees across the Mediterranean, the allegiance between ISIS and some of the jihadist militias – particularly Ansar al Sharia – or the potential for wider destabilisation of the Sahel region, Libya is a country that the EU cannot afford to ignore.

If there is no progress in Geneva in a final solution to the conflict and in the creation of a state subject to the principles of international law and the rule of law, Libya and part of the region will be in danger of falling definitively into absolute chaos. Chaos, ladies and gentlemen, which, as we all know, will create the perfect conditions for terrorist groups linked to Al Qaeda and Islamic State and tribal warlords to find room to grow and create much more important bases, with the added danger of contagion to neighboring countries.

Firstly, High Representative, I want to thank you for your letter to me of 7 January 2015 regarding compensation from the Libyan authorities for the innocent victims of Irish Republican terrorism in Northern Ireland. The Gaddafi regime funded a campaign of terror and death in Northern Ireland with their partners in the IRA. Negotiations between UK representatives and the Libyan authorities have stalled during the internal fragmentation and violence that Libya is now experiencing. However, the innocent victims of Libyan-sponsored terrorism in Northern Ireland need to see justice and compensation, and we need your support, High Representative, to achieve that. I am asking you to make this a priority of your term of office and to talk and meet with these innocent victims in Northern Ireland. I hope that you can find the time to do this fairly soon. Finally, the issue of the persecution of Christians who live in Libya. We of course have seen the results of violent extremism in France in the last week. Those are dreadful and sad scenes. However, Libyan Christians have lived with these scenes for a very long time.

The massacres in Paris and the threats to Europe by the Caliphate are too acute an alarm not to increase any effort to reach a political solution to the crisis. The humanitarian crisis that is taking place in Libya, with the massive migratory phenomena taking place towards Tunisia and towards our Mediterranean coasts, must be stopped and Europe with the United Nations has a duty to take a strong and effective political initiative.  More than sanctions on the sale of hydrocarbons, we need to take action by introducing a comprehensive arms embargo, because too many countries are feeding the parties militarily.

Such a situation on the shores of the southern Mediterranean requires strong engagement of the European Union, primarily its external service, but also development policy especially in the field of building effective institutions. It is situations like Libya that we want to include development goals on peaceful societies and institution building in the new Global Development Framework. But it's a long-term strategy. Maybe that's what had to be done after the dismissal of gaddafi's regime, but immediate action is needed now. The role of the High Representative here is crucial in coordinating the possible activities of the Member States, in contacts with the US and NATO, but also with other important actors such as Qatar or the United Arab Emirates. It is also important to strongly support the work of un secretary-general Bernardino Leon's envoy, and I am pleased that the High Representative has done so.

It is regional, European and global security that are under threat from a failed state in Libya.  The time has come to join African countries calling for international military intervention, duly led by the United Nations Security Council and articulated with regional partners: the Arab League, the African Union.

Such an agreement between Libyans is possible! And I also hope it will happen tomorrow! But we must not ignore the that today, in Libya, a proxy war is being played, involving the same powers that are behind the so-called Islamic State, whatever the variation of the terrorist hydra. The European Union must use its political and diplomatic influence against such interference and must redirect its own mission and the BORDER Assistance Mission (BAM) within the framework of the Common Security and Defence Policy to meet Libya's real security needs.

As a result, the number of boat refugees is steadily increasing. 130,000 people arrived in Europe in the first half of 2014, twice as many as in the previous year, 118,000 of whom arrived in Italy alone. A recent study shows that the travel planning to Europe is interesting for many refugees! – via Facebook. Behind this is a sophisticated system with information on how best to overcome borders and how to move the asylum procedure after successful entry with good information, and tips on how to bypass authorities' routes in the countries of entry. We must therefore work together on a strategy to help Libya, on the one hand, and to stop this illegal immigration into Europe, but also, of course, to resolve the roots of these conflicts, because people are fleeing conflict, and we must intervene in this regard.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "NI", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 959, "date": "2015-01-13.json", "name": "Tomáš ZDECHOVSKÝ", "mepid": "124713", "text": "   Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to contribute constructively to this debate.

That is why those who spoke of the need to use the limited time we have – and it might be days or hours, not weeks or months – to avoid total collapse are right. Libya is a rich country in terms of resources, but it is still a country that can represent a perfect storm: a perfect mix of risks. Let me name just a few of them: one of the highest concentrations of arms per square metre; oil and gas revenues, so potentially a lot of money ready to be used by different actors; an instrumental use of religion to spread acts that are close to terror; no control of land or sea borders, so a flow of asylum seekers, refugees and migrants that is not under the control of any authority on the ground. Here we have a humanitarian catastrophe, an environmental disaster ready to happen, as some of you mentioned, and a risk of spill-over into the neighbouring countries. Think of Tunisia, of how many refugees Tunisia is receiving constantly. We always concentrate – and being of Italian nationality, I do it myself very often – on how many people we are receiving in Europe, but let us just think about how many people the neighbouring countries are receiving in more difficult situations than those of our European Union Member States. So we are right to be extremely worried, and we should have no illusions about the facts. I am sorry many of your colleagues have left, but there should be no illusion that we can stay away from Libya. We could stay away from Libya, but Libya is not going to stay away from us. The question is how to make sure that we lend a rational helping hand to try and avoid the country’s total collapse, because this is going to affect us in one way or another. Let me express my condolences to, and solidarity with, the families, and also the authorities of Greece and Romania, for the loss of two members of the crew of a tank that was attacked a few days ago. On the same day I was on the phone to the Foreign Ministers of Romania and Greece to express my condolences, and this shows exactly that, one way or another, this is going to affect our security and the security of the region and the security of the world. So, even if we wanted to stay away – and I am not sure that would be the right and wise thing to do in any case – I do not think it would be possible. The question is: what do we do to support a positive process? Many of you – almost all of you – mentioned what should be the outcome of a process: a Libya that is not divided, an immediate ceasefire, a structured dialogue for some kind of national reconciliation, getting to a national unity government or some sort of transition structure that can guarantee some kind of government for the country. But, as we list these elements of a framework – or a horizon – we also have to be clear that even the talks which are taking place tomorrow in Geneva, even the simple convening of a meeting, present huge difficulties that we could not have imagined. It is just by working on this every day, almost every hour, that you realise how difficult it is even to decide who to invite to a meeting, who ought to sit at which table, how to set the agenda, and how to define the next steps. Even calling for a meeting is a major diplomatic challenge, so we are not under any illusion about the difficulties of the exercise. We have to bear that in mind as we reflect on the next steps, namely the role of the neighbours and the role of the European Union. Many of you asked about the role of Algeria, for instance, or other countries in the neighbourhood. First of all, we have to be aware that there is not a single attitude among the neighbours: there are different attitudes among different neighbours, and the neighbours are very different from one another. That is why I believe – and again I would say that the role of the European Union in this is to go hand in hand with the United Nations, because we need a United Nations framework – that in order to shape all these differences in the neighbourhood, which are crucial, into something that it makes sense to support, the exercise has to be undertaken along with the appropriate organisations. That is why the effort we are making is not an EU-Libya one, but rather an EU-Arab League and EU-Arab League-African Union one, with different formats of the neighbours – and I will not trouble you with all the different formats – constantly talking to everyone, and especially to those with different attitudes, be they Egyptians, Emirates, Turkish, Algerians or Qataris or representatives of some of the African countries that are neighbours as well. I said at the beginning that, maybe for the first time now, we are seeing a slightly more constructive and positive attitude among the neighbours in their totality. This is maybe because we are all realising that we are running out of time and that this is the last chance for us too – for the regional community and for the international community – to show some sense of responsibility for what is happening there. The only way of keeping the region united is by working on this multilateral level and with this approach. When it comes to the role of the European Union, I believe it has to be better defined. We will see the day after tomorrow whether these efforts for dialogue are going to produce something or not. We can put a lot on the table there. We have different scenarios on the table, and when I say it depends on the Libyans to define the scenario, the kind of instruments the European Union will be able to put in place also depends on the Libyan reaction. If we have the start of a process of dialogue and reconciliation or a united government, and then a ceasefire starting to take place, then obviously the European Union could work towards measures and instruments to monitor achievements on the ground. We have to think of the review of the mandate of Libya, for sure. The mandate will expire in May, so we have time, and that is exactly why we are holding this discussion with the Ministers on Monday, with some options on the table as to what we can do in one case – positive developments we can monitor and support – or, in the event of a total lack of positive development, as to the kind of instruments with which we could press for a possible engagement, or as to implementing, or working on implementing fully, some of the UN Security Council resolutions which, for the moment, are on paper but not fully implemented. We are living currently in a strange bubble, which is the fact that we have this 24-48 hours, with this last chance of dialogue, hopefully, taking place, to see if this starts a positive dynamic. We will have to be flexible. We use that word sometimes in different scenarios, and in foreign policy too, you have to be flexible. You have to have clearly in mind what your potential is – and we have a huge potential in all scenarios. We have to take stock of what will happen – or not – in Geneva in the coming hours, and define how we can best either push, in one direction, or support the results that the Libyans achieve once this happens. Obviously we also have to get ready to act if the scenario is the worst possible one. We are working on that as well. That is not something I would discuss today, and I thank you for not having that discussion today, because today is the day of sending to the Libyans, and to the region and to the rest of the international community, a clear message: this is the last chance for dialogue, and we should not and cannot waste it. Whatever you can do afterwards, you get ready to do. You always have to get ready for the worst-case scenario, but today is the day of pushing for the worst-case scenario to be avoided, and the responsibility for that lies in the hands of the Libyans, even as we speak. Thank you for a good debate. I think a message can come strongly from here to the Libyans that we are ready to support them because we care, because we know it is in their interest, and also in our interest and in the interest of the region’s stability. We have instruments to do that but, again, the decision has to be their own decision. I really hope that the message from here comes clear and strong to all parts of Libya in the coming hours: that national dialogue and common engagement need to take place. There is no alternative to that. All other options take Libya a step closer to total collapse, and we cannot afford that, and the Libyans cannot afford it.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 965, "date": "2015-01-13.json", "name": "Ioan Mircea PAŞCU", "mepid": "33984", "text": "   The motions for resolutions to be submitted in accordance with Article 123(2) of the Rules of Procedure shall be announced at a later date.

Under the PSDC, the acquisition of these vessels will form a solid base for the Union's defence forces.

Rīt šeit Latvijas ministru prezidente Laimdota Straujumas kundze jums prezentēs Latvijas prezidentūras prioritātes, bet jau šodien es gribu uzsvērt, ka Latvijas prezidentūra vēlas cieši strādāt kopā ar Eiropas Savienības institūcijām, lai virzītu uz priekšu aktuālos Eiropas Savienības jautājumus. Un mēs ceram uz ciešu un konstruktīvu sadarbību ar Eiropas Parlamentu. Mēs ceram uz ciešu sadarbību, lai kopīgi virzītu un pieņemtu lēmumus, kas ir nepieciešami Eiropas iedzīvotāju labklājībai un drošībai un Eiropas Savienības konkurētspējas stiprināšanai. Madam President, I would like to begin by commending the work done by the persons and services involved in the rescue operations. These operations have helped to save the lives of hundreds of people. The Council is deeply concerned by the continuing large-scale arrival of migrants, in particular in Italian waters. In this context the Ministers are, of course, aware of the new phenomenon of ghost ships – large disposable cargo vessels bearing hundreds of migrants across dangerous waters and which are deliberately abandoned, with men, women and children on board, close to EU coastal waters. The very recent rescues of the vessels Blue Sky M and Ezadeen clearly show that action needs to be taken on this new modus operandi. Effective measures should be taken against smugglers and traffickers in order to combat and dismantle criminal networks which exploit migrants and expose them to the risk of hazardous journeys across the Mediterranean, as well as to prosecute those involved in such activities. It is important to recall that in the context of the work carried out by the Task Force Mediterranean, and in the Council conclusions of last October, reinforced border surveillance and the fight against smuggling and organised crime are considered priority areas of action. Several specific measures identified by the Task Force and in the October Council conclusions are currently being implemented. The successful deployment of the Triton operation is a clear sign of solidarity between Member States on this issue. In this context, the Council would like to highlight the very efficient way in which joint operation Triton is conducted by Frontex, the participants of which, with the support of the Italian coastguard, have managed to save the lives of thousands of migrants aboard these abandoned ghost ships. However, recent events clearly show that we need to step up and further reinforce our common action and to increase its effectiveness. On 2 January 2015, in a statement issued in relation to the smuggling of migrants in cargo ships, Commissioner Avramopoulos again stressed the need to combat the criminal organisations which exploit desperate people trying to escape conflict and war. The Council fully shares this assessment. Commissioner Avramopoulos noted that the fight against the smuggling of migrants would be a priority and referred to the development of a plan to be presented by the Commission in due course. The Council looks forward to the proposals that the Commission will submit in this context and will consider them as a matter of priority. The Council will also continue to regularly monitor the migratory situation, in particular in the Mediterranean region, and will address this subject as a top priority on its agenda.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 972, "date": "2015-01-13.json", "name": "Dimitris Avramopoulos", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "  Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I am standing here before you today because the European Commission is determined to take action. We have all heard what happened over Christmas and the New Year. The lives of around 1 200 migrants, mostly Syrians, were saved when the Italian Coast Guard and Frontex, in the framework of Joint Operation Triton, rescued two cargo vessels: the Ezadeen and the Blue Sky M. These are only two tangible examples among the more than 12 cargo vessels that have arrived in Europe since September 2014. Of course, many more people have risked their lives, coming in numerous small boats and experiencing difficult journeys via land borders. This is unacceptable. Why? Because we cannot allow ruthless smugglers to make a fortune through criminal acts, exploiting migrants looking for a safe passage to Europe. People in need of protection should not be risking their lives to obtain this protection. We all know the facts: conflicts in our neighbourhood generate a constant influx of refugees towards Europe. This will not go away. On the contrary, if decisive and coordinated EU-wide action is not taken, the flows will continue. In 2014, more than 276 000 migrants arrived in the European Union, representing an increase of 138% compared with the previous year. The recent events also show that smugglers are finding new routes to Europe and are employing and engineering new methods in order to exploit desperate people who are trying to escape conflict and war. In order to respond to the constantly evolving strategies of smugglers, the European Union, its agencies and the Member States have to step up their cooperation and common action in a spirit of solidarity and responsibility. Better coordination and a more comprehensive approach will help to address the roots of the current flows of irregular migrants and of smuggling. Let me first elaborate on the fight against smuggling and the rescue of migrants at sea. The recent events show that Joint Operation Triton, which started – as you all know – on 1 November 2014 and is coordinated by Frontex, has saved the lives of thousands of migrants. Since the launch of the Triton operation, and together with the Italian Navy, almost 16 000 asylum seekers and irregular migrants have been rescued or intercepted and 57 facilitators arrested. In addition, other European agencies have undertaken many important initiatives to tackle smuggling. At The Hague, Europol’s team in intelligence-sharing and cross-border investigations of smugglers’ networks has been reinforced, resulting in the arrest of hundreds of facilitators. In Malta, the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) has launched a project to gather information from asylum applicants about the routes taken during their journeys. The Commission will support its agencies in order to intensify their efforts, but we also count on the financial and operational support of the Member States. We need to intervene and inform prospective migrants about the risks of entering Europe illegally. Reinforcing intelligence-gathering and the sharing and promotion of practical cooperation between the Member States and EU agencies are also crucial in order to prosecute more smugglers, undermine criminal networks and deprive them of profit-making. Smuggling is a criminal offence, but we need to make our legal instruments more effective. In this respect, the Commission is currently assessing the existing EU criminal framework in an effort to improve its practical implementation. Cooperation with countries of origin and transit is also a cornerstone of the Commission’s strategy to fight smuggling. Given that Turkey has become one of the alternative routes for smugglers to reach the European Union, we are in close contact with the Turkish authorities to quickly adapt our strategy. Of course, the cooperation with third countries cannot be limited to the fight against smuggling. We will cooperate with them in an integrated approach, encompassing broader foreign policy considerations, development assistance and humanitarian actions. One clear example of our integrated approach is the cooperation with many African countries. For the countries of the Horn of Africa, we have made available almost EUR 6 million – not only to support and facilitate the fight against smugglers and traffickers but also to improve the provision of direct assistance to migrants, refugees and asylum seekers. In the context of the Syrian crisis, the European Union – including the Member States combined – is the largest donor, making more than EUR 3 billion available for humanitarian and other aid in Syria and in the neighbouring countries. It also is vital that EU Member States fully implement the Common European Asylum System as soon as possible. Moreover, the European Union and the Member States must work together to establish a truly European programme for the resettlement of refugees. Following a recent pledging conference, Member States have so far offered over 36 000 places to Syrian refugees, making it the largest pledge in the history of EU resettlement efforts. However, a total of 207 000 people have crossed the Mediterranean irregularly. Furthermore, more than 3.5 million Syrian refugees have fled to countries neighbouring Syria. So there is no doubt that Europe needs to do more. We have to increase the number of refugees resettled in European Union countries. In order to ensure that Member States share this responsibility, the Commission has set up a resettlement and relocation forum to develop – always in cooperation with Member States – a fair distribution key. In this critical hour, where Europe is facing a growing number of challenges, the European Union and the Member States together have to take credible and effective action on migration. Europe has to take charge. We have no time to spare. Together, we will move forward with commitment and resolve.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 973, "date": "2015-01-13.json", "name": "Monika HOHLMEIER", "mepid": "96780", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Madam President, I also warmly welcome the Latvian Presidency, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen. First of all, I would like to express my sincere thanks for your hard work, Commissioner, to present in the last nine minutes the integrated approach that we want and must take together. What is striking about the last two ghost ships in the last incidents is that the first, the thirteen before that, have not even been noticed. There were a total of fifteen vessels of this type that came, twelve to Italy, two to Greece, one to Cyprus. If you look at the size of the financial profits of the traffickers, it is simply a ship with 700 to 800 people = EUR 5 million for the traffickers. In other words, this is a brutal human business, which the relevant criminals use and then push their criminal branches of a different kind accordingly. That is why it is important and necessary that we counteract this trafficking in human beings. What depresses me is that all 15 ghost ships came from Turkey. In other words, Turkey, as a partner of the European Union, must also maintain the common links in such a way that we can actually achieve an effective fight against organised crime, which is moving from Turkish soil towards the European Union. Combating it must also be effective and sensible. That, in our cooperation with Turkey, we must then consider how we can solve problems for the countries that have taken in a particularly large number of refugees – whether that is Turkey, whether it is Lebanon, Jordan, Tunisia or similar countries, which are struggling with large numbers of refugees and therefore want our support, including the approach of legal migration. , as far as is possible.

We have reached a point of no return, ladies and gentlemen!  Europe is facing one of the most challenging challenges of recent times and while people in Paris are demonstrating and strongly defending the right to freedom of expression, an unprecedented number of men and women fleeing war and poverty are risking their lives in Europe's desperate attempt to reach European shores. These people need our help because every human life matters! Because human rights are indivisible and inviolable rights and must be protected and promoted effectively.  If we do not want to be hypocritical, there is only one way to do this: to work together to build a common European immigration policy. In order not to be hypocritical, the decision-making command centre must be in Brussels, the European Commission and not the capitals of the individual nation states. If we do not resolve this political issue, we will be slicing our mouths, we will be raising our consciences, or we are going to make some instrumental and demagogic remarks, but we will not solve the problem. The problem is that it is Brussels, it is the European government that must plan the flows, that must have relations with third countries, that must discriminate between legal immigration and illegal immigration, that is, that it must then have the capacity to protect the right to integration of these citizens.  This is a great challenge, Commissioner, which we do not have in this parliamentary term – I say this to you and I say this to the representative of the European Council – if we really want to be deserving of the confidence and esteem of the citizens, we must take this great step forward, otherwise we will not be deserving and, you see, the world is global and globalisation brings out new poverty, there are hotbeds of war , of death, of terror, of disease, from which we flee, and it goes without saying that we raise our borders because raising borders is no use. Those who flee death, disease, terror, will always flee!  The world will never be a sum of shutters or closed classrooms, the world is inter-global, there is only one way: to govern together, to govern this phenomenon at European level, to welcome and take up this challenge and to show that we are worthy of representing our people.

It is hypocritical because the question of why refugees use these unsafe escape routes in the first place is ignored. It is ignored that Frontex itself, through its actions, contributes to ever more and more dangerous escape routes, that many refugees objectively cannot obtain visas at all, and that with the end of Mare Nostrum, the high seas are now left to the smugglers and the smugglers with Triton, and no one asks about the refugees.

Indeed, recently, not a plenary takes place without the subject of migration being discussed among the debates. It is the new methods of smugglers that have, for the most part, motivated today's debate. Garbage cargo ships, departing from Turkish or Egyptian ports, abandoned along the way, which are capable of transporting even larger groups of migrants. This macabre business does not know the crisis, quite the contrary, with networks of smugglers ever more powerful and sophisticated who in passing pocket millions of euros.  If the modalities are new, the causes are not. The conflicts in Syria, in Iraq, the instability in Afghanistan have appalling consequences, forcing tens of thousands of people to take ever more expensive and perilous roads. If the terms and conditions are new, the solutions are not. Like other colleagues, I have repeatedly reiterated in recent debates the need for a comprehensive approach to migration, including the promotion of legal channels.  From an asylum perspective, there are already several mechanisms for admitting refugees without having to risk their lives. Whether we are talking about resettlement, humanitarian temporary admission, a more flexible visa policy or family reunification, solutions exist and others can also be considered. Now the clock is ticking.  Two questions to conclude. What does the European Commission envision, in concrete terms, in terms of legal routes in its comprehensive approach to migration and how do Member States intend to strengthen their cooperation in the area of interception, rescue at sea and the reception of migrants?", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 993, "date": "2015-01-13.json", "name": "Maite PAGAZAURTUNDÚA", "mepid": "125038", "text": "    Madam President.

The number of abandoned ships adrift has only increased, as has the number of shipwrecks and dead in the Mediterranean. This result forces us to rethink the European strategy in the fight against trafficking in human beings and we need legal, operational and criminal intelligence measures aimed, inter alia, at strengthening the roles and competences of Frontex, Europol and ASO. We need to provide them with budgets according to the challenge they face. It has been shown that border control operations alone are not sufficient to address this situation. Police cooperation measures are needed to combat trafficking in human beings. And not only at our borders, but also by cooperating with third countries of origin and transit. I applaud the arrival of the new operation and invite the Commission to promote its development by giving Europol the necessary funds.

Most of you focused on smuggling, and actually that was the main title of this meeting. As I said at the beginning, smugglers have discovered new methods and new routes, but we are determined to address this issue with determination. There is no doubt that smuggling is a criminal offence, but we need to make our legal instruments more effective. I said before that we have decided to proceed with better coordination and – as was repeatedly said – with a more comprehensive approach in order to address the roots of the current flows of regular migrants and also smuggling. It has been said during this meeting today that cooperation with third countries is of great importance. There is no doubt about this. I just want to remind you that about ten days ago we met in Rome during the Khartoum and Rabat processes and, at the same time around the same table, we had countries of origin, countries of transit and countries of destination. We all decided to fight this phenomenon more effectively, but we need the engagement of these countries, including Turkey. As far as resettlement is concerned, the first exploratory discussion with the Member States on a more balanced allocation, or distribution, for resettled refugees has only just begun. The Commission hopes to be able to discuss this point in a more detailed way during the Justice and Home Affairs Council which will take place in March. As far as distribution is concerned, for the time being – I will be frank with you – I cannot speculate on the exact nature of such criteria, although elements such as the total number of asylum seekers per capita and GDP will certainly be included. Our objective at this stage is to avoid extensive negotiations on a comprehensive list of criteria and instead to agree on a minimum set of criteria. This will allow us to launch a pilot as soon as possible. This pilot phase will give us the opportunity to adjust the practical modalities of the implementation of the distribution key. In the light of experience acquired last time, we will consider any possible further criteria in order to take into account the interests of all parties involved including, obviously, those of the refugees. Resettlement and the humanitarian mission remain, and this is my answer to Cecilia Wikström, who is very sensitive on this, the main routes of legal access to the European Union. The Commission, together with the High Commissioner for Refugees, has been calling on the Member States to consider other alternatives, such as more generous family reunification or student-worker visa schemes for Syrians, where feasible and appropriate, of course. Legal migration is also an important tool in this context. Regarding all other forms of entry, such as humanitarian visas: as was underlined before, the discussion so far indicates that there is unanimous opposition from the Member States to even considering such options at this point. We keep trying and we continue the political dialogue. Coming back to what was said before, fighting smuggling will be a top priority in the comprehensive approach to migration. Our discussion today has confirmed that all migratory challenges are closely interrelated and require a credible and coordinated European response. As announced in the Commission work programme for 2015, the Commission intends to present this comprehensive approach in a European agenda on migration. Be sure that we are committed and resolved to move forward.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1024, "date": "2015-01-13.json", "name": "Zanda Kalniņa-Lukaševica", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "  President-in-Office of the Council. - Mr President, honourable Members, I would like to thank you for giving me the opportunity to intervene on the recent events of people-smuggling in the Mediterranean region. I could not agree more with the view that abusing the hopes of desperate people is a crime. We are speaking of a true human tragedy. The Council, of course, is fully aware of the grave risks to human lives and to the fundamental rights of thousands of immigrants, as well of as the challenges for the Union emerging from this new route used by smugglers who ferry out their passengers, mainly from Turkey, towards Italy. The Council’s competent bodies, in close cooperation with the other institutions, agencies and stakeholders concerned, intend to address this issue as a matter of priority. In the context of fighting the smuggling of immigrants on the criminal level, I would like to point out that the Council adopted in 2010 the EU policy cycle for organised and serious international crime, which established a multiannual policy cycle and a clear methodology for setting, implementing and elevating priorities in the fight against organised and serious international crime. In the framework of this policy cycle, the Council set priorities for the fight against serious and organised crime for the cycle 2014-2017, including the fight against facilitation of illegal immigration and trafficking of human beings in the following terms: to disrupt organised crime groups involved in facilitation of illegal immigration operating in the source countries, at the main entry points to the EU, on the main route and, where evidence-based, on alternative channels; to reduce organised crime groups and the abuse of legal channels for migration, including the use of fraudulent documents as a means for facilitating illegal immigration; and to disrupt organised crime groups involved in intra-EU human trafficking and human trafficking from the most prevalent external source countries for the purpose of labour exploitation and sexual exploitation, including those groups using legal business structures to facilitate their criminal activities. During the cycle, four-year strategic goals are defined for each crime priority, which are implemented by operational action plans, one per priority and per year. Honourable Members, the very important and fruitful debate that we had today clearly proved that it is our joint challenge and joint priority to step up efforts to prevent the smuggling of immigrants, to fight it and to prosecute those involved in such activities. We look forward with great interest to the Commission’s assessment of the existing instruments as announced by Commissioner Avramopoulos just now. To achieve the objectives of fighting against these criminal situations, it is crucial that all stakeholders make an active contribution. Along with the Council and the Commission, the European Parliament has a fundamental role to play in this respect.

The subject of the gender balance on company boards is a very important topic. There is a broad consensus in Europe on the need to increase the number of women in decision-making, especially in businesses. I firmly believe that Parliament, the Council and the Commission already agree in principle on the most crucial thing, namely that equality before the law is not enough – we also need equality in practice, and this also means ending vertical segregation. There is no reason in the 21st century why businesses, banks and the economy as a whole should be mainly run by men. Allow me therefore to thank the European Parliament for keeping this issue on the agenda and for insisting on progress. As the Commission has also stressed, European business needs the talents of Europe’s highly-educated women, and increasing diversity is also a way to improve the performance of companies. We look forward to constructive exchanges with the European Parliament’s new rapporteur on this file, Ms Gabriel. According to the latest figures, the average share of women on boards of the largest publicly-listed companies in the EU is now 18.6%. This is a clear sign that concrete measures must be taken to remedy the situation. How do we ensure that our largest companies can benefit from the talents and dynamism of both women and men? It is a generally political question and policymakers have divergent views on approaches and what tools we should use. We should therefore not be surprised if more time is needed to agree. The goal we share can be reached by different roads. As you know, some Member States have already introduced binding quotas. Others are wary of interfering with company law and prefer self-regulatory measures. By means of example, the share of women on the boards of Latvia’s largest companies is 31%. I am proud to say that this result has been achieved without any formal measures of positive discrimination. How do we crack the glass ceiling? What is the EU’s proper role in this? The Commission’s proposal for a directive in this area seeks to answer the question in its own way. The proposal itself is a compromise of sorts. It does not provide for binding quotas. Instead, it sets quantitative objectives. The main obligations that the proposal contains concern the procedure for selecting board members, which should be fair, merit-based and transparent. I note that the European Parliament already adopted its first reading position on the Commission’s proposal in late 2013. In that opinion your institution broadly endorsed the approach suggested by the Commission. It is no secret that the negotiations on the Council side have been challenging. Despite efforts made by successive presidencies, our discussions have not yet been completed. Views still differ between the Member States regarding the best approach. The diversity between Member States needs to be respected in term of company law, the degree of gender balance already achieved and the national measures already taken to improve it. The Member States are taking action but in different ways. We must also remember that the Member States start from very different levels. One thing is becoming clear: from the subsidiarity perspective, any future measures at European level should recognise the fact that there is no one-size-fits-all solution. This was the spirit of the approach taken by the Italian Presidency. Building on this work, we will continue our search for a solution under the Latvian Presidency. On behalf of the Council I assure you that we will take forward this work with a view to reaching an agreement.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1038, "date": "2015-01-13.json", "name": "Věra Jourová", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "  Member of the Commission. - Mr President, honourable Members, I would like first to thank you for adding this item to the agenda because it gives me an opportunity to present here the clear position of the Commission, and of myself, on this important piece of legislation which is – hopefully – in the process of adoption. We are fully aware that major steps on the road to effective gender equality need to be taken. The adoption of the directive on improving gender balance on company boards will be an important step on that road. The directive will help smash the glass ceiling that prevents qualified women from holding top jobs. The directive is smart and flexible: it puts qualification and merit centre stage. This European Union instrument is as necessary as ever. On boards of private companies we still have only 18% women. At the same time, 60% of new university graduates in Europe are female. Their talent should not be wasted, in particular in light of the demographic changes we face in Europe. It is well recognised in numerous studies that a range of talents, experience and skills in the boardroom improves business performance and governance and drives economic growth. If we want to maintain Europe’s competitiveness and stay ahead of demographic changes, we need more women at work, especially qualified women. Some Member States have seen positive developments, mainly those such as France, Belgium and Italy that have introduced, or are considering, legally binding measures. However, in others the situation is stagnating or even worsening. We have tried non-legislative action at EU level, but with limited results as you all know. Only a legally binding measure at EU level can effectively contribute to greater gender equality in the area of economic decision-making. We will therefore intensify our efforts to speed up the process of the adoption of this directive. Let me remind you that what the directive seeks is progress and fairness. We do not want women to be privileged because they are women. We want qualified women to get a fair chance. This is why, rather than imposing a particular result, the proposed directive requires Member States to ensure that qualification, competence and professional performance play the key role during the process of selection to board positions. This approach is in line with the case law of the Court of Justice, which has set rules and conditions for positive action for the under-represented sex in employment. It requires a comparative assessment of all candidates on the basis of objective criteria. Since there are highly qualified women capable of being selected as candidates, this approach is the right one to take. I see that considerable efforts have been made by previous presidencies; this is very welcome and there are concrete results from these efforts. The proposal is moving closer to achieving a qualified majority in the Council. In particular, the Italian Presidency has worked intensively on this directive and I am convinced that, on this solid basis, it is possible to agree that subsidiarity concerns be fully addressed. This should ensure the support of a sufficient majority of Member States. Latvia is among the Member States which have recently adopted a more positive approach to the directive. The Commission is therefore encouraging the Latvian Presidency to use this positive momentum, actively to pursue the discussion and then to reach a compromise solution.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1039, "date": "2015-01-13.json", "name": "Constance LE GRIP", "mepid": "101580", "text": "  on behalf of the EPP group. Mr President, here we are in 2015 and it is clear that, since November 2013 and the adoption in plenary of the Kratsa-Regner report, by our two colleagues Rodi Kratsa-Tsagaropoulou and Evelyn Regner, proposing, following the European Commission, a mechanism to ensure a better gender balance on the boards of major European companies - the Women on Boards project - , the situation has made little progress.  After our own position, little progress has been made in the Council. We were disappointed to see that the Italian Presidency had failed to finalise its work and reach a compromise, especially at the last Competitiveness Council on 11 December. However, for its part, the European Parliament had shown great pragmatism on the basis of the principle of an unconstrained target, accompanied by fairer and more transparent procedures for selecting directors.  The position of the European Parliament had been built on the basis of consensual work between the different groups and struck a balance by balancing the need to increase the presence of women on the boards of large companies with the importance of respecting the legal frameworks, traditions and applicable national laws on management and corporate law in each member state. Moreover, the target of the text is quite circumscribed: the large European companies listed on the stock exchange. There is therefore both a reasonable objective but, at the same time, a symbolic, highly symbolic objective. A strong symbol that should allow us to offer future generations a path to increase female leadership, to finally break the glass ceiling.  With regard to the means, we can see that when legislative arrangements are implemented - and this is the case in all the countries of the Union, starting with my own - results are achieved. We must therefore now put all the goodwill - I would say all the female energy that has been expressed by the voice of the Commissioner, by the voice of the minister and, under the leadership of the Latvian Presidency, the Prime Minister of Latvia - to achieve a compromise.

Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating Mr There are many who claim that quotas do not work, perhaps because it is such a simple solution. It forces companies to hire competent people, but 40% of them are women, and a lack of competent women is not. It is also about changing perspectives. Either we believe that women are not enough, that they do not have the necessary knowledge and experience, which is not true, or we turn it around and focus on the companies and structures there. Why don't they manage to hire women?  It has now been over a year since the European Parliament voted overwhelmingly on the Commission's proposal. Since then, a minority of EU Member States have blocked the proposal in the Council and forced a compromise that wateres down the original proposal and which this minority now does not seem to accept either. These countries point out that it is up to the Member States themselves to introduce any legislation on quotas, and that it should not be at EU level. That's bullshit! I say. Very little has happened in the Member States during this year of blocking. This attitude sends a clear signal to the women of Europe: 'We are not going to do anything to ensure that company boards are more equal'. A signal that there will at least be a crack in the glass ceiling or that competent women do not reach top jobs because they are women. I feel offended by the Council's actions.

Unfortunately, the proposal laying down quotas for the representation of women on company supervisory boards does not create such conditions. This is also clearly demonstrated by the example of Norway, where quotas were introduced in 2006 but did not achieve the desired effect. Norwegian employers' representatives agreed that not only for women in top positions, but also for their overall participation in the labour market, a sufficient number of kindergarten places and well-set parental leave are much more crucial. In addition to some Member States, an example of good practice in the area of parental leave is the European Commission itself, whose employees or employees can take part of this leave flexibly until the 12th year of a child's life.

At that time, the European Commission, under the leadership of your predecessor, Mrs Jourova, put on the table a very intelligent, wise proposal also for the Member States. I can only underline what the Commissioner said: this proposal is smart and flexible, as you said. I find so too. It gives the Member States the freedom to act according to developments in the countries. I would like to stress that I am from Germany. We have had a very difficult time introducing a quota for women, but we are now on the verge of being introduced, including legislative ones. The Bundestag will shortly discuss the bill that the Federal Government has put in place. I would also like to underline this: the first success of the proposal, the directive, is to be seen in the fact that, even in a large country such as Germany, a step has been taken here. So it is a good news thing about the political message that Commissioner Reding has always sent out, to do more for women, to put women in leadership responsibilities.

Gender equality is a fundamental right of the individual, which is now being denied by the hostility of the Council. Gender equality for the things you have heard reported here and also in countries that have had important experiences is a great advantage for the production system, because women are bearers of a particular point of view, an important culture and knowledge that men often do not have.

I have a very wide agenda in my portfolio, and cultural difference and cultural background is prominent in the agenda of equality between men and women, so this might be part of it. However, I must also tell you that I had many discussions on this matter with many ministers and representatives of the Member States, and nobody said that the goal is wrong. Everybody admitted that this is the proper thing to seek, but many of the people I spoke to reacted allergically to the quota. They are criticising the instrument we are going to use. We need to explain better that the quota is the necessary instrument and that the legislation itself – including sanctions – is the necessary instrument, because all the other ways have already been tested and they simply did not work. These are the arguments, and we have some time ahead of us during the Latvian Presidency to explain better the goal and how this instrument will be used, and also perhaps to put more emphasis on the diversity issue. It simply proved useful to have diversity in the boardrooms and to have more women there. They were useful during the crisis, they saw the crisis coming and they brought about good solutions.

Diversity necessarily leads to an improvement in the results and impacts of each production process. No agreement has yet been reached on this important directive on gender balance in companies because several Member States do not provide for national legislation in this area. The problem concerns the sanctions to be applied in the event that a company does not reach the share of at least 40% of female non-executive directors. On the other hand, the real objective of the measure is not to protect women as such, but to promote meritocratic selection mechanisms, in which posts are assigned to the best, without discrimination caused by prejudices about the sex to which they belong. From this point of view, the recognition of rights is not only right, but also useful. For this reason, an alternative way of dealing with this issue is proposed: more than focusing on quota-related sanction mechanisms or simple indications by the EU of a quota to be reached, we introduce and promote reward mechanisms for companies that reach the quota.

This argument can only be considered if countries actually have or are preparing their national solutions and the participation of women in decision-making positions is adequate and proportionate to their qualifications. Not all opponents of the directive fulfil this condition, which puts into question the intentions of opponents. Meanwhile, the waste of women's knowledge and talents limits the competitiveness of the European economy. Women make up more than 60% of masters and 35% of employers, but only a dozen percent of them participate in decision-making processes in governments and large companies, and their share of the labour market is much lower than that of men. Removing barriers such as gender stereotypes or a shortage of childcare institutions and dependent persons can increase employment rates and improve the quality of management in politics and business, and, above all, make full use of citizens' qualifications and talents.

The EU Commission, like many other national and international political organisations and institutions, does not live up to its own ambition. In other words, the EU's political institutions oblige economic companies to have rules that they themselves cannot comply with.

It is our obligation to guarantee our citizens a general area of justice, freedom and security by preventing and combating serious and organised crime as well as corruption. We have to mobilise all our instruments to this end and combine efforts to adopt a comprehensive and coherent approach to crime. Europol’s Serious and Organised Crime Threat Assessment estimated in 2013 that 3 600 organised crime groups were active in the European Union. Criminal organisations are becoming increasingly flexible and are diversifying their activities. Links are steadily growing with a broad range of other lucrative criminal activities, such as drugs or even trafficking in human beings or exploiting technological developments for criminal purposes. Huge criminal proceeds are generated which are infiltrated into the illicit economy. As a result, criminal groups are increasingly capable of influencing the operation of the legal markets, and even the institutional and political processes across the EU, by engaging in corrupt practices. The Council has been continuously engaged in a range of initiatives, targeting organised crime and corruption, and has been treating them as a matter of the highest political priority. A key measure is the EU policy cycle, which was adopted in 2010. This cycle ensures an operational response to organised and serious international crime through optimised coordination and cooperation between national law enforcement authorities, EU institutions, agencies and other relevant partners. Within this framework the Council agreed to a series of operational actions targeting, among other things, counterfeiting and cybercrime, which were agreed as EU crime priorities. Emerging crimes, like wildlife trafficking, illegal waste trafficking or trafficking in cultural goods, have also been identified by the Council as areas which need attention. Such crimes will be closely monitored by Europol, which is expected to submit to the Council an interim Serious and Organised Crime Threat Assessment at the end of March 2015. The Council attaches great importance to the EU Anti-Corruption Report, which was issued for the first time by the Commission on 3 February 2014. This is a valuable tool in consolidating anti-corruption efforts and promoting high anti-corruption standards across the EU, based on a comprehensive approach. We believe it will provide further incentives for the Member States to ratify and effectively implement the existing anti-corruption instruments. The role of asset recovery has been acknowledged as an integral part of the fight against serious and organised cross-border crime. Criminal groups can amass huge profits from the various criminal activities and markets, and it is generally agreed that disrupting and recovering the financial flows of a criminal group is an efficient way to stop crime paying. The new directive on the freezing and confiscation of proceeds of crime, adopted by the European Parliament and Council in 2014, provides broader opportunities for confiscating the proceeds of crime in cases where a conviction cannot be delivered because the person concerned has absconded from justice or has fallen ill. It also provides for a reinforced system of extended powers of confiscation or confiscation from a third party. This instrument is a clear step forward in ensuring that criminals can no longer have access to assets derived from certain types of criminal activity, and this contributes to strengthening the response to serious forms of crime. Nonetheless, during the negotiations leading up to the adoption of the instrument, the Council and Parliament felt that still more could be done in this field. To that end they adopted, together with the directive, two declarations calling upon the Commission to consider the possibility of submitting further proposals on this matter. The Council is looking forward to the Commission’s initiatives in this respect. Finally, please allow me to comment briefly on the review of the internal security strategy. This will be a high priority for the Presidency, as we wish to respect the deadline set by the European Council calling for a review and update of the internal security strategy by mid-2015. In December last year the Council adopted conclusions which set out the Council’s considerations on the general structure and some key principles of the renewed EU internal security strategy. One of these key principles is that the renewed internal security strategy should identify the main common threats and challenges. For the coming years, in the field of internal security, the Council considers that serious and organised crime in all its forms constitutes one of these threats.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1081, "date": "2015-01-13.json", "name": "Dimitris Avramopoulos", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "  Member of the Commission. - Mr President, many thanks for giving me the opportunity to present the Commission policies and actions to fight organised crime and corruption across the Union. The resolution on renewing the internal security strategy, which this Parliament adopted on 3 December 2014, rightly puts this fight among the few priorities on which we should continue to focus our joint efforts in the years ahead. By preventing and combating crime in all its forms, the European Union will contribute to creating a safer Europe and a more trustworthy environment for its citizens and businesses. Combating the infiltration of organised crime into the legal economy will contribute to economic recovery and growth. This is particularly the case with regard to corruption. European citizens are concerned about corruption. In our Eurobarometer Survey in 2013, more than half of Europeans said corruption in their country had increased over the previous three years. Four out of ten European companies consider corruption to be an obstacle for doing business in the internal market. Preventing corruption and promoting integrity has rightfully moved up the European agenda in the past decade. Last year’s first anti-corruption report shows that the nature and extent of corruption varied from one Member State to another, and that corruption affects all Member States. The report identified areas in need of further attention. It is important to build cooperation with the Member States, among the EU institutions and with the relevant international organisations in order to follow up. The next report is due in 2016. There have been calls to include in the second report an objective independent evaluation of all EU institutions. We will consider this request in full dialogue with the other European institutions. The Commission, as you know, has just taken measures to increase its own transparency, which is essential for preventing corruption. Let me turn now to organised crime. The seriousness of the threat is well documented in Europol’s annual threat assessments. The estimated 3 600 organised crime groups involved in serious transnational crime in the EU are involved in many types of crime, including economic crime, corruption and money laundering, cybercrime and environmental crime. Their investments are increasingly transnational too, thus leading to the infiltration of organised crime into the legal economy across the Union and beyond. EU legislation needs to be fully implemented: particularly the 2008 Framework Decision on the fight against organised crime, on which the Commission will issue an implementation report this year. The directive adopted last year on the freezing and confiscation of assets is a significant step forward. Lastly, the recent agreement on the fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive is promising in terms of enabling financial investigations to identify criminal beneficial owners of companies more easily. Alongside legislation, the Commission promotes operational cooperation between Member States, and between them and third countries through Europol. The current operational priorities of Europol include illegal immigration, human trafficking, counterfeit goods, excise fraud, synthetic drugs, cocaine and heroin, cybercrime, firearms and organised property crime. Funding is provided through parts of the internal security fund: roughly EUR 1 billion over the period 2014-2020. I will mention firearms trafficking, as it echoes last week’s tragic events and was identified by Europol as an emerging threat. An EU strategy to fight the illicit trafficking of weapons was adopted in 2013. The Commission is now evaluating the possibility of proposing the approximation of some criminal offences related to weapons and to strengthening the checks for some categories of firearms. Better exchange of information on illegal firearms is also essential. Prevention should be a strong component of the fight against organised crime. The Commission has actively engaged with third countries and relevant international organisations: for instance, we have a full agenda with the United States as regards the fight against cybercrime and child sexual abuse. With Eastern partners the focus is on corruption. Fighting cybercrime, given its clear impact on our societies, is a self-standing priority in the current internal security strategy. Cybercrime impacts on the economy and also, when the personal data of employees or customers are stolen and property is lost, on fundamental rights. The European Union has responded with the creation of the European Cybercrime Centre within Europol and the Cyber Attacks Directive, which Member States should implement by September 2015. I call on Parliament to ensure that the draft directive on network information security, still under discussion, includes provisions on the reporting of cyber-security incidents of a criminal nature to the law enforcement authorities, as proposed by the Commission. Criminal investigations into cybercrime require speedy access – subject to due process – to criminal evidence held by private companies under different jurisdictions and in different locations. The Commission is ready to work with the Member States to ensure that the existing legislation on, firstly, cyber attacks, secondly, payment fraud and, thirdly, child sexual abuse online is correctly and swiftly implemented. The Commission is committed to enabling closer public-private cooperation in fighting cybercrime. This cooperation has also started to address the challenges of the suppression of illegal content from the internet, and to counter online terrorist propaganda and radicalisation. To conclude, let me mention the work, during the previous term, of Parliament’s Special Committee on Organised Crime, Corruption and Money Laundering, which was seminal.

In the fight against organised crime, I still take a somewhat critical view of the European Union. I believe that organised crime in logistics, in the ability to network, in the brutality of the procedure and in the modernity of its instruments, is partly still superior to our measures. That is why we will have to make a great effort to counteract organised crime in its diversity. I am thinking in particular of the area of the Internet, where there are now a wide range of forms of crime, which are being massively promoted by the Internet. For example, the sexual abuse of children has received a real boost via the Internet. The number of children affected has increased significantly. However, I must also say that I regret that some colleagues from other groups have refused to discuss the new studies and findings in this Parliament; we should do so again. If crimes committed via the Internet and the Internet are not punished, then this is a real trigger factor to engage in more criminal activity. In other words, we have many tasks ahead of us. In one and a half minutes, it is not possible to execute them all. But we will still have to deal intensively with the internal security strategy.

Today we want to urge the Institutions of the Union to resume the interrupted path immediately: Parliament, together with the Libe Committee, will follow up the mandate given to it by CRIM; the Commission shall take appropriate legislative initiatives for the introduction of the crime of association with mafia-type crimes at European level, increase the legislation on the confiscation of the proceeds of crime and introduce the measure of delayed seizure or arrest where necessary to acquire evidence or to catch representatives of organised crime; the Council undertakes to coordinate internal security policies between Member States in the field of mafia-type organised crime and corruption. In this last respect, it is regrettable that the Italian Presidency has done nothing to follow up the recommendations of the CRIM Committee that have just been mentioned.

Who are the corrupt Portuguese that Germany is covering up? This is intolerable in the context of European judicial cooperation and, Mr Avramopoulos, the Commission must intervene, otherwise the corrupt, the money launderers and other criminals will continue to use internal market freedom to retain impunity and keep the profits of crime. And why is the Commission waiting to urge Member States to stop the sale of ‘golden visas’, which, besides being immoral, are obviously the source of the importation of organised crime into the EU?

There should also be an organisation to protect these people.

European funds are not intended to finance criminal activities, but to guarantee the well-being of European citizens. Enhanced police cooperation is also needed through more joint teams, cross-border operations and more timely data exchange.

Corruption also negatively affects good governance and contributes to the erosion of trust in public institutions and democratic processes. Slovakia is one of the countries with the highest degree of perceived corruption (CPI) within the EU, but at least in the legislative sphere it has achieved a significant improvement in reducing the scope for corrupt behaviour over the last decade. Examples include the reform of the commercial register, an increase in the proportion of enforceable permits and licences, or the recent approval of a law that significantly increases the incentive to report corrupt behaviour, both by more effectively protecting the corruption reporter from possible sanctions on the part of the employer, but also by the possibility of obtaining financial reward for reported corruption.

First of all, I would like to point out that the Council Presidency is not in a position to make any comments about an allegation that a Member State’s secret services carry out secret surveillance of lawyers and their clients. Under the Lisbon Treaty the maintenance of law and order and, in particular, the safeguarding of internal security are responsibilities of the Member States. The Council is therefore not informed of any surveillance activities carried out by the national departments responsible for safeguarding national security. I would also like to point out that the collection and processing of personal data by such national security services is currently not regulated by EU law, as neither the 1995 Data Protection Directive nor the 2008 Framework Decision on Data Protection applies to them. The 2012 Commission proposal for a directive on data protection by competent authorities for the purpose of prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences explicitly states that the directive shall not apply to the processing of personal data in the course of an activity concerning national security. For the same reason the Presidency is not in a position to express itself as to the compatibility of these alleged activities with the Charter of Fundamental Rights. The EU directive on the right of access to a lawyer states that Member States shall respect the confidentiality of communication between suspects or accused persons and their lawyers in the exercise of their right of access to a lawyer.

The right to privacy, including communication between clients and lawyers, as protected by Article 7, and the procedural rights protected by Articles 47 and 48 of the Charter are of the utmost importance in the EU. However, it should be pointed out that the Charter is applicable only to the Member States where EU law is implemented. The matter of national security remains within the competences of the Member States so, where the Member States initiate secret surveillance activities for national security reasons, these fall outside EU law. Consequently the Charter is generally not applicable. That being said, the exemption clause needs to be interpreted strictly. In the light of settled case law of the Court of Justice, any Member State which seeks to take advantage of an exemption needs to prove that it is necessary to have recourse to it in order to protect the state’s essential security interests. Where the Charter does not apply, the national systems provide fundamental rights protection procedures that are applicable in these cases. The Commission also aims at a high level of protection of fair trial rights in the European Union. Since 2009 we have made considerable progress in this direction, with the adoption of three directives: on the right of interpretation and translation in 2010; on the right to information in 2012; and, recently, on the right of access to a lawyer. The directive on the right of access to a lawyer needs to be transposed by Member States by 27 November 2016 and the Commission will closely monitor this process. Article 4 of the directive clearly sets out the principle of respect for the confidentiality of communication between suspects or accused persons and their lawyer in the exercise of the right of access to a lawyer. However, it should be underlined that the directive focuses on the rights of suspects and accused persons in criminal proceedings. This is why it clarifies, in its recitals, that confidentiality applies only to genuine communication in the exercise of the rights of defence between the lawyer and a suspect and/or accused person. It does not apply to lawyers who are involved in the alleged criminal activities of the suspect or accused person.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1128, "date": "2015-01-13.json", "name": "Jeroen LENAERS", "mepid": "95074", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – The relationship and communication between a client and his lawyer are of a special nature and the confidentiality of that relationship and that communication is crucial to maintain citizens' trust in the rule of law and thus crucial to the functioning of our democracy.

It gives the impression that this debate is a debate on a minor issue on the big issues that this European Parliament can deal with, but it is a false or resoundingly wrong impression, because it is a major debate. We are talking about surveillance of lawyers in the European Union, particularly in the Netherlands, no less than a founding country of the European Union. But we are talking about setbacks in rights and freedoms and threats to the guarantee of the privacy of communications and, of course, to the guarantee of the right to defence, which is professionally implemented by law, not only in the Netherlands, but in all the Member States of the European Union. We are therefore talking about the backward European civilisation, threatened by this mass surveillance, this universal espionage and this disengagement of the rules of law from the intelligence and security apparatus of the Member States which are believed to be in a willingness to destroy everything simply because technology can afford it. We have an obligation to say no. We have an obligation to say no, that we will prevent you, with the law in hand, with the European Charter of Fundamental Rights in hand, with the Lisbon Treaty in hand and with the ability of this European Parliament to act as a legislator on fundamental rights and as a criminal legislator, where appropriate , to suppress, prosecute and punish serious transnational crime, such as that which undermines fundamental rights, the right of access to defence, the right to legal aid and the defence and defence of a fully independent lawyer at all stages of the judicial procedure, including the police investigation. We are therefore talking about the fact that, in terms of parliamentary scrtrolling, this House has an obligation to inquire the Commission about the actions it may take to clarify these facts entirely and to establish European legislation that will make them impossible in the future.

Article 4 of the 2013 directive on the right to a lawyer, as well as the Charter of Fundamental Human Rights, also sets this out very clearly. If, then, if our intelligence services collect information between lawyers and their clients, it means, of course, that this fundamental principle is being undermined and, by extension, the rule of law of the European Union is being undermined in a totally unacceptable way. It now appears that the Dutch law firm Prakken d'Oliveira has been under surveillance for a succession of years by the Dutch security services. There are several other similar examples in the Member States. I now really want answers to the question of the Commission and whether the Council believes that this type of espionage against law firms is compatible with European law, with the Treaties, with the Charter of Rights and all the rights that they give us citizens. Because if it were the case now that you really believe that this falls within the framework of national security, then I really want to know how you define the concept of 'national security' and whether you believe that it should automatically mean that European citizens are rightless. I would now like to ask the following questions, firstly: what steps does the Commission and the Council intend to take to ensure that confidential contacts between lawyer and client are respected? Secondly, do you intend to take concrete action against the Netherlands?

The Civil Guard arrested sixteen citizens yesterday: twelve of them lawyers defending Basque political prisoners; three are part of the defending team of the thirty-five militants of the left abertzale who were to be tried since yesterday at the National Hearing for their political work. The operation took place two days after eighty thousand people called in Bilbo for an end to prison policy, based on the dispersal and violation of prisoners' rights. Police went on to search a union premises to take the money raised on the march thanks to the solidarity of the protesters!  This operation is political and these people have been arrested for their legal work defending prisoners, it is an attack on the peace process. It is inadmissible that a Member State infringes fundamental rights, including the rights of the defence, with such impunity.  It is inadmissible that a Member State rejects the application of Community legislation in order to double sentences already served and that nothing happens. That's not justice, that's revenge. If they were to happen elsewhere, these events would be a major scandal and Parliament would call for an emergency debate. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, it is a question of rights, whether a state is democratic or not and the Spanish state is obsessed with proving that it is not. It strives to move further and further than a rule of law should be. I encourage the European Union and, of course, also the Spanish State to take firm steps to resolve the political conflict peacefully and democratically.

That trust has been betrayed by the revelations in the large-scale wiretapping scandals. It was really only a matter of time before it became clear that somewhere in Europe a secret service is bugging a law firm for a long time.  And it has become the Netherlands, where the Minister of the Interior, Ronald Plasterk, admits that he eavesdropped on law firm Prakken d'Oliveira in Amsterdam for a long time. This touches on the rule of law, this affects our confidence in the government. If a conversation with a lawyer is no longer safe, what about a conversation with a doctor, or someone else with a professional secret? The Council says that this is a national matter, but I say: 'No, it is not.' Because there is a 2013 European directive on the right to a lawyer, which Article 4 stipulates that there is an obligation to guarantee confidentiality. There is also the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which guarantees the right to a fair trial. This is not a simple national competence. Hence my question to you, Mrs Jourová, and to Mr Timmermans, who is very familiar with the Dutch Minister of the Interior: are you going to address the Dutch government on the fact that it has not complied with the law and are you going to oblige the Dutch government and the other Member States to respect the confidentiality between client and lawyer?", "language": "en", "original_language": "nl", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "Verts/ALE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1133, "date": "2015-01-13.json", "name": "Axel VOSS", "mepid": "96761", "text": "    Madam President!

As politicians in the European Union, we are, of course, called upon to maintain and safeguard this as a pillar of the rule of law.
