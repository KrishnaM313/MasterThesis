Poetovani predsjedniee, potpredsjednici i zastupnici Europskog parlamenta, poetovana predsjednice Europske komisije, potovani kolege, izuzetno mi je zadovoljstvo biti danas u Europskom parlamentu i predstaviti preitete prvog hrvatskog predsjedanja Vije-em Europske unije.  Za Hrvatsku i sve moje sugraane ovo i povijesni trenutak. Tek prije 30 godina, u Hrvatskoj su odr-ani prvi slobodni izbori. Time i nakon devet stoljea, hrvatski narod ponovno stekao svoju suverenost, a Hrvatska se vratila na politi-ku kartu svijeta.  Drago mi je da upravo danas - uo-i 28. obljetnice me-unarodnog priznanja Hrvatske, kada su tadaonje 'lanice Europske zajednice priznale Hrvatsku ' imam priliku govoriti u Europskom parlamentu. Priznanje smo stekli u te-kim okolnostima ratne agresije. Hrvatska se, zahvaljuju-i svojim braniteljima, obranila, i prije 25 godina oslobodila, nakon 'ega se obnovila i krenula naprijed putem razvoja, demokracije i europske integracije. I prije 'is i pol godina postala i 'lanicom Europske unije, kojoj je danas prvi put za kormilom.  Na tom putu, europska integracija Hrvatske bila i 'vrst i jasan putokaz u svim naporima i u svim reformama koje smo poduzimali. Veselim se uspje-nj suradnji s Europskim parlamentom u sljede-ih 's 'se mjeseci, u 'elji da na'imrima pokaemo da od Europske unije imaju opipljive koristi.  Nekoliko I va-nih zadaa pred nama. First, an agreement on the new Multiannual Financial Framework: a timely agreement on the entire financial framework for the next seven years is our priority. In this, the MFF should meet the expectations of all our citizens in all our Member States. So it must continue to finance cohesion and agricultural policies, but also be able to address the many new challenges the European Union is facing. It must ensure our togetherness and unity, while respecting all of our differences - economic, social and demographic. It must also make Europe more effective and visible on the global stage. To achieve this, we must act fast. We cannot allow delays in the implementation of our EU programmes, as of 2021. Otherwise, we would be disappointing our citizens. Together with the President of the European Council, who is continuing the MFF talks at the highest political level, we will spare no effort to achieve a breakthrough during our presidency. This would enable us to finalize the entire legislative package under the MFF and we count on close and efficient cooperation with all the Parliament's committees and rapporteurs in this endeavour. We hear and understand all your concerns, messages and expectations, but we find it of crucial importance to continue the talks and negotiations at all levels and to advance all the files. In this we are united by a common goal, as our failure would only strengthen those who do not want a strong Europe. And we can't allow that. Second, the end of the process of orderly withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union: after ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement by the United Kingdom, we have to finalise the ratification procedure on the EU side. In this, the crucial step is the consent of the European Parliament. The Croatian Presidency will, in accordance with the declaration on the future relationship and the guidelines of the European Council, work on the swift adoption of a comprehensive Council mandate for negotiations, on the basis of the proposals by the European Commission. Though we will be sad to see a Member State leaving, the European Union and the United Kingdom share a long history. So this should be a new starting point for building close partner relations in the future, based on mutual interest, respect and a level playing field, especially in the areas of trade, security and other sectoral policies. However, the transition period of 11 months is extremely short, and it will take a lot of goodwill and a lot of work to bring these negotiations to an end in that period and to reach a good agreement for both sides. Ladies and gentlemen, thirdly, the organisation of the Zagreb summit between the Union and the Western Balkans and the opening of accession negotiations with Northern Macedonia and Albania. We are not hiding our ambition to try to get the support of the Member States for the opening of accession negotiations with these two countries. The next European Commission report and its proposals to improve the methodology of accession negotiations will be important. For the credibility of the enlargement policy, it is important to maintain the principles of respect for the political criteria, benchmarks and individual progress of each candidate country on the basis of its results, with EU membership remaining the ultimate objective of the negotiations. This must remain the central focus of enlargement policy. We are pleased that the European Parliament adopted a resolution last October in favour of the opening of negotiations with Albania and Northern Macedonia, underscoring the importance of enlargement for both the candidate countries and the European Union. In doing so, the European Parliament reaffirmed its commitment to a credible policy of enlargement of the Union. The Zagreb summit in May will be held 20 years after the first Zagreb summit, which opened the European perspective to the countries of South-Eastern Europe and paved the way for stabilisation and association agreements. Among these countries was Croatia, which in the meantime is the only one to have joined the European Union. Moreover, today she chairs the Council of the European Union. Our example gives the next Zagreb summit an additional symbolic value. That is why, at the Zagreb Summit, we would like to send a strong message to our partners in South-Eastern Europe, who are still in a kind of European antechamber, and tell them: if you pursue all the reforms and meet all the accession criteria, your European perspective is not in question and you are welcome. At the same time, the Eu will help you achieve your goal by participating in European projects, integrating into infrastructure networks through regular political dialogue at the highest level and promoting European values and principles. Fourthly, the establishment of the conference on the future of Europe. We will address this task quickly so that, on the basis of the Council's position, we can conclude inter-institutional agreements as soon as possible and ensure the rapid start of the conference. It is important that the Council, Parliament and the Commission take ownership of the objectives of the conference and be represented on an equal footing. The conference must also ensure the commitment of all Member States, national parliaments and broad participation of citizens, especially young people. It must be inclusive and open, and its debate focuses on the issues arising from the European Union's strategic programme, on the political orientations of the President of the European Commission and, above all, on the issues of greatest concern or interest to citizens. We are pleased that Croatian Commissioner Dubravka Uica is responsible for preparing the conference at the European Commission. The conference is a new opportunity to bring Europe closer to its citizens and to better understand through dialogue what it is accused of; to understand the reasons for citizens' growing disaffection with Europe; to understand what led to Brexit and why many Europeans in other Member States are developing the same scepticism; to understand the causes of the strengthening of populism and anti-European resentment and to see together what we need to change and improve. It is also an opportunity to give citizens a voice to tell us what Europe they want so that we can better meet their expectations. Dame i gospodo, Hrvatska ulazi u predsjedanje Vijeem uz 'etiri bloka priorityiteta, a oni su: Europa koja se razvija. Nae i glavni cilj osigurati ujedaen, odr-iv i ukljuiv rast Unije koji uzima u obzir posebnosti i potrebe svih draava 'lanica i njihovih regija. To zahtijeva daljnji razvoj politika koje stvaraju kvalitetnije radne i 'ivotne uvjete te pridonose o'uvanju okolia i borbi protiv klimatskih promjena.  Posebnu pa'nju posvetit 'emo Europskom zelenom planu o kojemu 'e Vije'e raspravljati u nekoliko formacija, s obzirom na 'irinu i domet, pri 'emu je vaon osigurati odgovarajue financiranje njegovebe. O tome smo detaljno razgovarali prigodom posjeta kolegija Europske komisije u Zagrebu pro-logo tjedna. Zajedno trebamo raditi na dosezanju klimatske neutralnosti Europske unije do 2050.  Produbljivanje jedinstvenog trei-tta i poticanje digitalizacije, ulaganje u inovacije i istra-ivanje, kvalitetno i cjelo-ivotno obrazovanje te razvijanje vjetina prilago-enih poslovima budu-nsti ulog su u ja-anje konkurentno. A upravo i konkurentnost kljuuna sastavnica osiguranja njezina rasta.  Zbog toga i vaan i razvoj trei-ta rada koje i prilago-eno vremenu digitalne revolucije, novim globalnim izazovima te demografskimjen promama.  Naa glavna misao vodilja mora uvijek biti pobolj-anje kvalitete 'avita svih graana Unije, ali i utvr-ivanje poticajnih demografskih mjera koje 'e izgraditi vitalnije dru-tvo. Europa koja povezuje. Rast i razvoj Europske unije uvelike ovisi o umre-enosti njezina gospodarstva i punom iskori-tavanju njezinih infrastrukturnih i ljudskih potencijala. Povezivost i jedna od najva-nijih pretpostavki za postizanje socijalne, ekonomske i teritorijalne kohezije meu draavama 'lanicama. Stoga 'emo se sna-no zalagati za dodatni razvoj promisene, energetske i digitalne infrastrukture, na dobrobit na-ih graana.  Pritom kao Predsjedni-tvo sna-an naglasak staviti na zbli-ujaje graana kroz obrazovanje, kulturu i sport. Te su veze osobiti odraz nae snage i naeg zajedni-tva. Third is a Europe that protects. Only a safe Europe can provide a peaceful environment for its citizens. In this regard, the efficient protection of the EU's external borders - as well as increased resilience to external threats and hybrid and cyber threats - are of vital importance. Achieving a comprehensive solution for sustainable and effective migration and asylum policies is our objective joint. We will remain focused on further developing our Union as an area of freedom, security and justice, based on the shared values of democracy and the rule of law. Therefore, the adoption of the new strategic guidelines in the area of freedom, security and justice will be one of our priorities. The rule of law is a core value and a fundamental principle of our Union's functioning. We will pursue a comprehensive approach to the protection and promotion of the rule of law, while strengthening dialogue and the unity of the Member States.  Fourth is an influential Europe. No single Member State of the Union is able to address the international challenges on its own. Our unity is our biggest strength. Europe should speak with one voice more often and more loudly, confirming its global role in today's multipolar world. It is crucial to maintain an open dialogue with our North American partners and allies. Our ambition as a global actor should be supported by further development of capabilities and instruments for joint action, including our defence, albeit in complementarity with NATO. It is also important to maintain Europe's relationship with China, Russia, India and Japan - and other big powers - on the basis of mutual respect, while continuing to develop multilateralism and an international rules—based order. In a wide range of policy areas, from climate change and trade to nuclear proliferation, our Union has a unique ability to achieve necessary compromises and resolve crises. Tensions in the Middle East, the highly complex political and security situation in Iran and Iraq, old and new challenges in the Gulf region: all this requires our constant, active and creative commitment, and strong leadership. As a staunch supporter of the UN Sustainable Development Goals and the world's largest donor of development assistance, we have a special responsibility towards African, Caribbean and Pacific nations. During the Croatian Presidency, an Eastern Partnership summit will be held as well.  The European Union is facing, as we all know, many challenges. Every day the world is getting more complex and our tasks are more numerous. Too many actors offer easy answers and instant solutions, often unfounded or based on false information. The expectations of our citizens are growing. We must get closer to our citizens. We must listen and provide appropriate answers to their concerns. We cannot miss any opportunity to do more for the sake of our citizens. To meet the challenge, we need to promote equality, inclusivity and solidarity, while strengthening Europe's democracy as our core value on the global scene. Therefore, as our program says, we need a strong Europe in a world of challenges.

It’s just a few days ago that the College of Commissioners were treated to the very famous and outstanding finest Croatian hospitality. We spent a wonderful 24 hours there. We saw some of the very rich culture, traditional folklore, diversity, all that which Croatia has brought to the Union. It was a phenomenal ceremony at the opening of the Presidency in the National Theatre, which showed the energy and the enthusiasm Croatia brings to the Union, so thank you very much for that.  It’s also a very special moment to sit here and to listen to the Prime Minister speak about the Presidency here in the home of European democracy, because I know, Andrej, that this House is a place that is very dear to your heart. There are not many who can say that they have been a European Parliament trainee, then, later on, an MEP, and then come back to Strasbourg as a Prime Minister chairing the EU Presidency. Chapeau and respect for that. (Applause) In some ways, your story mirrors the remarkable journey your country has taken. As you have just said, in the space of only three decades, Croatia has gone from bitter bloodshed to being here today at the beating heart of our Union. Tomorrow you will celebrate the ‘Day of International Recognition’, marking 28 years since the European Community recognised Croatia. But no one could have imagined then how far and how fast this country has grown. That is down to the will of your people, to the sacrifice they made, to their commitment to European values, and to their determination to join our union of peace, progress and prosperity.  Over the next six months, we will need all that determination, that unity and energy that Croatians are famous for. We will need that determination to find common solutions to issues that have divided us in the past like, for example, migration, which will be one of the tasks we will be tackling. We will need that unity to handle Brexit and budget negotiations and deal with the pressing international issues you just mentioned, and we will need that energy to ensure that Europe can shape the digital and climate transitions. This is the task ahead of us and I am delighted that the Croatian Presidency reflects this fully in the four pillars the Prime Minister just mentioned.  The Presidency’s motto says we need a strong Europe in a world of challenges, and indeed, it’s true that the challenges around us are becoming louder and more dangerous and more intensive by the day. I think it is now for the constructive force to help push back on the world’s destructive tendencies. And it’s always the same. As long as there’s violence taking place, it’s very loud and dominant, but the violence only ends if the talks start again. Here is the strength of the European Union – because the European Union has an enormous amount of diplomatic strength. It is able to focus on de-escalation dialogue because we have good relations with many, many actors in that region and partners in the region. We have relations that are time tested, relations that are reliable, that are trusted. We’ve played an enormous role and still do play in the stabilisation of Iraq, and the same goes for brokering the nuclear agreement with Iran.  But beyond conflict resolution, now is also the time for Europe to be more assertive on the global stage, to strengthen our position as the trading power of the world, to deepen, as you’ve said, our relationship with NATO and to take on more responsibility ourselves, and to build an alliance with Africa that can stand the test of time and help boost both our economies. We will have the college-to-college meeting with Africa and will be preparing the EU-Africa Summit. In this spirit, we will present our comprehensive strategy with Africa during your Presidency.  The next six months will be crucial for our relationship with the Balkans. You mentioned it, Andrej. Croatia knows better than most the power of European perspective. It’s a matter of perspective to have it, a true perspective, and Croatia knows better than most how far it can take countries in transforming their systems and economies. Croatia knows the good Europe can do by engaging and investing in the region. It is now particularly important that we keep up this momentum before the Zagreb Summit on the Western Balkans later this year. If we want the Western Balkans Summit in Zagreb to be a success, we have to do our homework now. That’s a reason why we will put forward our enlargement methodology in a few weeks, so that we can discuss the modernisation that is necessary, but the most important part is to give our friends in the Western Balkans a perspective for beginning the accession talks with North Macedonia and with Albania. They’ve done the homework which we’ve asked them to do, so it’s time to give them a real perspective to move on now. Croatia’s leadership will also be essential when it comes to negotiations on our future budget. Over the next weeks, the Presidency, supported by President Michel, will look to make headway so that we can reach an agreement. We need a balanced budget, yes, we need a fair budget, yes, but most of all we need a modern budget. The next seven years are different from the seven years we’ve just gone through, so it is of utmost importance that the modernisation part – that’s what people expect us to do, that’s the area where all the Member States keep asking the European Union to move forward, be active, be visible – receives a decent budget. If we want to deliver on these topics, we need a decent budget for modernisation. Thank you for fighting for that. This is crucial for us. Mesdames et Messieurs les députés, les six mois de la présidence croate seront également cruciaux pour réussir la transition climatique et écologique. Nous n’avons plus besoin de parler de l’urgence et de l’obligation d’agir. Nous devons passer maintenant à l’action et mettre en œuvre notre pacte vert pour l’Europe. Le travail commence aujourd’hui. À l’issue de ce débat, le collège discutera du plan d’investissement pour le pacte vert et du mécanisme pour une transition juste. Avec ce nouveau mécanisme nous donnerons la priorité aux secteurs et aux régions qui seront confrontés aux plus grands défis et qui doivent fournir de plus grands efforts. Je sais que c’est un point important pour la Croatie et pour beaucoup d’autres. Dès que les propositions seront approuvées par le collège, les vice-présidents Timmermans et Dombrovskis seront ici en plénière pour vous présenter tous les détails. Je compte sur la présidence croate pour avancer sur ce dossier et sur tous ceux qui suivront dans les semaines et les mois à venir. Meine Damen und Herren Abgeordnete! Ich möchte abschließen mit den Worten einer kroatischen Schriftstellerin, die als erste Frau professionelle Journalistin in Kroatien war, Marija Zagorka. Sie schrieb einmal: „Wo Einheit ist, ist Freiheit.“ Und das war schon immer so in Europa. Wo es Einheit gibt – und die europäische Besonderheit ist, dass es freiwillige Einheit ist –, da gibt es Freiheit, und da gibt es auch Kraft. Ich bin davon überzeugt, dass die kroatische Präsidentschaft eine Präsidentschaft der Einheit sein wird, eine Präsidentschaft der Stärke für Europa sein wird, eine Präsidentschaft, die unsere Institutionen voranbringen wird bei dem Aufbau – wie ihr es in eurem Präsidentschaftsmotto nennt – eines stärkeren Europas in einer herausfordernden Welt.

I want to add another story because we have a Vice—President of the European Commission sitting next to Ursula von der Leyen, the Croatian Commissioner who has a similar story: being elected as a Member of the European Parliament and now sitting in such an important role. So, that is a great symbol for what the Croatian Presidency means for the European Union and also for us as Members of the European Parliament. The Croatian Presidency is a great start for this decade because Croatia is the youngest member of the European Union. And first of all, the Croatian people showed that being a member is in the interest of the country. So that is what you showed them the last years as a member of the European Union. For example, after 2013 the country came out of a long recession, and almost 70% of all Croatia’s exports go to the European Union and almost 3 000 Croatian SMEs can now benefit from the EU investment plan. So there are a few examples of this success story and that’s why it is great to have Croatia now in the lead. We see in Croatia also see the beauty of Europe: on the one hand the Roman heritage in Split, the Austrian Hungarian Empire’s influence in Zagreb, the Venetian architecture in Dubrovnik. So Croatia is in a way a good mirror for the European culture. And probably what the prime minister underlined in his speech: the most important thing for today is that Croatia is today an independent nation, not anymore part of any kind of Empire. Today Croatia is an independent nation, part of a family, respected as an equal partner on the European level. This strong European vision is also reflected in your programme. A Europe that gives an answer to the world’s challenges. This is your motto, and in today’s political and social turmoil, no single Member State stands a chance alone. The Croatian programme pinpoints all the critical challenges: climate change, transport, connectivity, enlargement, global relevance, digital revolution and the safety of our citizens. The key to face these challenges is in front of us, and that means unity. It was already also mentioned by Ursula von der Leyen. And I want to describe a little bit what we mean with unity. Unity for us means no first and second—class citizens in the European Union. So, for example, if Croatia wants to join the Schengen area, if Croatia wants to be a member of the euro area, then they have the full support of us as the European People’s Party. Unity means to give a European perspective to the Western Balkans, several times already mentioned. We are aware that the decision of the European Council was a short—sighted decision to not opening the accession talks with Albania and North Macedonia. I, as an EPP representative, am proud that all EPP governments in Council are supporting it and that’s why I hope that Socialists will speak with the Danish friends and our Renew colleagues will speak with the Dutch and also with the French colleagues to open this path for North Macedonia and Albania to become members of the European Union. Unity means for us, ‘one for all, all for one’ on the global stage. We experienced in the last two weeks, the developments in the Middle East and we were close to a real military escalation in the last days. And – yes – the weapons were extremely loud in these days, but we can show together we speak louder than any weapon if we activate the strength of the whole European Union. And for us the first two weeks of this decade are a kind of a wakeup call that we have to strengthen now systematically the capacity of the European Union. To go further with a military pillar for the European Union and we have to put an end to unanimity in the decision—making process in the field of foreign affairs. We have to come to a majority making decisions; we have to bring the European voice to the global level. Unity means for us also on Brexit: our club, our rules. Andrej, you referred to the Eurosceptic parties in all our Member States. Nobody wants to punish our British friends in any way, some would say so, but it must be clear when you are not any more a member of the European Union, you’re losing the advantages of the club. If this is not clear then we will face a lot of problems to convince our citizens that it is better to stay inside of the European Union. That is a challenging development ahead of us, but we have to be clear. And finally on the MFF, the budget must deliver. First, let’s talk about tasks. If we establish a strong border protection then Europeans as a whole will be safer. And if we invest in research and innovation, then it will be better for all Europeans. So, let’s stop the debate about net—payers and contributors and so on. Let’s talk about the task which we have ahead of us and new tasks means for us also fresh money for the European Union. These are the challenges for the Croatian Presidency ahead of us. But it is time now that the youngest member will show the lead, that not only the old – and probably big – countries will show leadership. Now the youngest country can give us the proof that there is a future.

We are aware that we are going through a period of convulsive and full of challenges. In the wake of recent developments in the Middle East, we welcome your commitment to strengthening multilateralism and your intention to work closely with the high representative to ensure that the European Union speaks with one voice in the international arena. In addition, we support your commitment to enlargement policy and to the opening of accession negotiations with North Macedonia and Albania. Among the priorities of its programme one of them is entitled 'A Europe that protects', and under this heading we would have wanted a broader approach, which recognises the opportunity that migration represents to meet the demographic challenge and the maintenance of the welfare state. Yes, Mr Plenkovia, we need a Europe that protects. But a Europe that protects also means a Europe that protects solidarity and the rule of law. A Europe that protects also has to address with humanity the integration of refugees and migrants into our societies. A Europe that protects also means protecting citizens of the Union from exclusion, unemployment or gender discrimination. That is why we are going to ask you for a greater ambition to build the social Europe that we need. Let's be honest, Mr. Plenkovia. Only by organizing conferences will we not be able to address issues such as the gender pay gap, gender-based violence and child poverty. We agree that competitiveness, innovation, productivity and lifelong learning need to be boosted, but we need a real action plan to implement the European social pillar and social rights. For this reason, we regret that your program does not explicitly mention the minimum wage, child guarantee or a true poverty reduction plan and we look forward to and offer our cooperation in order to include these actions during your presidency.  With regard to monetary union reform, we also believe that the non-inclusion of unemployment insurance among priorities is not acceptable. It is a key instrument, which allows us to protect citizens in periods of crisis. Let us learn from the lessons of the last crises and do not resign ourselves to legislating in areas where it is possible to legislate. Your commitment to reach agreement on the new financial framework is supported by us, but let me make it clear. We hope that your Presidency will put forward a proposal at the level of the proposal made by this European Parliament. We've said it many times: we can't do less with less. We said it. And we want to meet the objectives of our ambitious agenda. We need a triangular approach, a greater contribution of gross national income to the Community budget, a proposal for own resources and the promotion of national investments with a reform of tax rules. For the latter we will defend the incorporation of a new golden rule into the Stability and Growth Pact that stimulates sustainable investment in the Member States. We cannot thwart the expectations of European citizens with empty promises. Projects with the ambition of the European Green Pact require adequate funding. That is why I do not want to hide our family's disappointment at the absence in their programme of the sustainable investment plan and the fair transition fund. The programme also ignores the commitment made by the European Commission to include the sustainable development goals in the European Semester. It's not too late, Mr. Plenkovia. The Social Democrat family hopes that their Presidency will deploy the same ambition as the European Commission's work programme, and the same ambition as this House, in the face of the challenges ahead.

It is a proud moment for you, Prime Minister, and for your country, but it’s also a challenge. I saw that you have already brought such energy and a fresh approach to your first Presidency. I fully understand that you want to be, as soon as possible, in our Union’s inner circle in the Schengen area and also in the euro zone. I think that any country willing to integrate into the Schengen area and to share our common currency should be able to do so as soon as all criteria are fulfilled. Our priority is not only to make sure Europe is renewed so it works for our citizens, but we must make sure that the European Union continues to be an appealing organisation for new members to join. The conference on the future of Europe will play a key role, giving also a new prospective for enlargement in a renewed Europe. I am confident that, over the coming months, the EU will send a positive message to the Western Balkans and the Zagreb Summit should play a key role in this and should be the signal.  Colleagues, the migration crisis of 2015 and 2016 has had a deep impact on many of our countries. We discovered our migration and asylum systems are not fit for purpose. We need to move forward. Today, my Group, the Renew Europe Group, will launch a plan with some new ideas in order to fix the system for the next decade. It is time to make progress without waiting for the next crisis and I hope, Mr President, that your Presidency will be inspired by our ideas. Prime Minister, I know you will agree with me that immigration and the demographic challenges need greater recognition and actions. I am pleased to have raised this issue in your Presidency.  Regarding the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF), the Croatian Presidency will be critical in the process leading to the adoption of MFF and own resources packages. I hope you hear the message of Parliament for a strong budget and especially for a new approach regarding own resources. We need a strong budget that matches our political priorities. In addition, I would like to thank you and Mr Charles Michel in particular, for your work on Libya and the situation in Iraq and Iran. We need to be alert and actively contribute to the peaceful settlement of tensions and conflicts. We really need a strong European voice in the world and you take up your responsibilities at a time when our role is clearly challenged in this area. A common position and unity is key if you are to put our future into our own hands.  Mr Prime Minister, I wish you all the best for your Presidency and you can be assured that, in taking up these challenges, you will have a partner in Renew Europe.

This Presidency comes at a very crucial moment, when the new Parliament and the new Commission will enter into full legislation mode and make sure to make all the promises that were given throughout the election campaign and afterwards reality. There is lots to do. We face a huge climate crisis that impacts everyone and we need to act now, both at EU level and also in the Member States. The European Commission has already made some promises in that regard, which we applaud, but it also needs the Member States and too many of them have been blocking environmental progress in the past. This needs to change. We need the Member States along, active and pushing when it comes to climate action. It will be your task to ensure this, and that is a big responsibility as well. To fill this role, we also encourage you and your government to implement your own fair and ecological transition in Croatia.  Another area where we would like to see more action from the Member States is rule of law and human rights, and I’m very glad that you mentioned that. It needs some more peer pressure from governments to bring Member States back on track. Rule of law, fundamental rights and freedoms are pillars of the European Union and should not be weakened and that goes for all Member States. Here, Prime Minister, I’m concerned about the reports about the Croatian police disregarding international law and procedures in their treatment of refugees and migrants. There are even reports of systematic violence and abuse, such as destruction of property, humiliation, beatings and even the use of firearms. These abuses have been repeatedly pointed out by NGOs and have been widely reported in the media, but the Croatian government has so far neither stopped nor investigated those reports. Prime Minister, that is not acceptable in any EU country, but in any country anywhere, refugee rights are human rights, and I urge you to ensure that those rights are being respected. The Croatian borders are European borders and what happens there is a responsibility for all of us, so we will not turn a blind eye.  Croatia is a beautiful country and the youngest member of our family. This Presidency is a big chance for your country and your government to show the rest of Europe what your visions and your ideas for our common future are, but the Presidency will also turn a spotlight on Croatia and how much your global words are met with local action, both on human rights as well as on climate justice. You can count on our support for bringing forward climate justice, social equality and rule of law, but you can also count on us to call out any human rights violation, no matter where, no matter by what government.

You present to us today the three priorities of the Croatian Presidency, but beyond the hope that they can legitimately arouse in you, they can also carry a real risk: the risk of three leaks forward. Firstly, on enlargement, you are telling us that you want to speed up the accession processes of Northern Macedonia and Albania, when everyone sees the truth, namely that these countries, even if they are allied countries and friends with whom we must work, are still today largely plagued by corruption and largely infested by the various Islamist currents. , whether they are Saudi or Turkish, and that, of course, none of the conditions are in place today for them to join the European Union. Emmanuel Macron vetoed France in November and Jean-Claude Juncker spoke of a historic mistake. And then in the meantime, after the bravado, we have surrender and unfortunately Emmanuel Macron explains that he is ready to welcome successively Albania, Northern Macedonia, probably tomorrow also Bosnia and Kosovo. All this, the fact of going from 27 to 29, perhaps from 29 to 31 the day after tomorrow will not lead to strengthening the European Union but to weakening it even more. You also mentioned the multi-year financial framework. In a few days, with Brexit, the European Union will lose more than 10% of its population. This should lead to refocusing ourselves on areas where continental cooperation between nations can be usefully organised, respecting the prerogatives of the nation states and not engaging in a budgetary leak, that is, going ever further in ever-heavier contributions where everything would be directed in Brussels. Some in this House are talking about the possibility of the European Union's own resources: in practice this would be the first step towards European taxation, obviously very bad news for our taxpayers, who will have to pay more and more in order to have less and less in return. You also mention the conference on the future of Europe. It should be a real debate, a debate without taboo on the functioning and direction of the European Union, but I fear that some people want to use it only to go even further in integration, to question the principle of unanimous decisions to move to qualified majority, that is to say to go even further in what does not work. However, it must be noted that the European Union as it is today is unable to protect its borders from immigration, unable to protect itself economically from the major world powers, powerless also on the international scene, absent in Libya, absent in Syria, absent in Iraq or Iran. Today we are finally limiting ourselves to giving human rights lessons to the world and lessons from the rule of law to our Member States. Is that satisfactory? Of course not. And then finally, Brexit. It's a real challenge, a real challenge: Boris Johnson will defend British interests on foot and he will negotiate trade deals with the whole world. We must not accept that tomorrow the United Kingdom will become a kind of gateway for all products, and therefore unfair competition, on the European market. Of course, we must treat the United Kingdom with respect, since it is a great friendly, allied and neighbouring power, but we must defend our interests, that is to say, we must finally be able to establish real economic protections; that's what people expect.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 8, "date": "2020-01-14.json", "name": "Ruža TOMAŠIĆ", "mepid": "119431", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Club. – Dear President, the Republic of Croatia holds the Presidency of the Council of the European Union for the first time after six and a half years of membership. When joining the Union, it was clear that as a state in many segments we were unprepared and that the path of transformation into a developed democracy that holds to democratic principles, the rule of law and the market economy did not end there. This has been a challenging six and a half years, not only for Croatia, but also for the European Union. The migrant crisis has greatly intensified the social revolt resulting from the severe financial crisis, and differences in member development remain large. The political picture of the Union is changing, and Brexit has let us know that if we keep turning a blind eye to the problem, its territorial girth can easily change, too. The fact is that new and smaller members have a better chance of putting some of their priorities on the presidency agenda in less challenging times, when the main Union issues have been resolved, which is now, unfortunately, not the case. But Croatia has also repeatedly shown throughout its history that it is ready to plant its back on Europe in challenging times. I expect the Croatian government not to pass these six months in a zealous tone, but to be well used for the purpose of reforming European instruments, refreshing outdated European policies and better positioning Croatia in the European Union. Although she used to listen too much to other people's instructions and ignore the fact that she is a full member who should have an authentic policy, Croatia now has the opportunity to show that it is ambitious, has a vision and is ready to lead Europe in certain areas.

Mr President, I would like to thank the Before looking at the new year and the tasks of the Croatian Presidency, I would like to comment briefly on the conflict between Iran and the United States that has already been mentioned. It is good that last week the European Foreign Ministers reaffirmed their commitment to the Iran nuclear agreement. This is one of the great diplomatic successes of the recent past. The withdrawal of the United States from these agreements a year and a half ago has triggered an escalation in the Gulf region, which unfortunately now makes us look back into the abyss of a great war. In this situation, the EU must do everything in its power to prevent this impending war as a mediator who defends international law and human rights without any ifs and buts and without false allegiance. The only following to be done is peace and international law. That is why European military bases must not be used for the threat of war, and European soldiers must be withdrawn from the region. But, Prime Minister, 2020 will be a landmark year for the EU. You mentioned the digital revolution. Then there is climate change, and I would like to say that we are facing the greatest societal challenge since the industrial revolution. Making this revolution socially just and democratic is only possible with the appropriate financial resources. So let's talk about the MFF. So far, in the context of the multiannual financial framework, there has been more talk of comma posts than of political decisions on policy. I believe that the cuts in cohesion policy, the cuts in cohesion policy in favour of armament and militarisation, are fundamentally wrong in my group. Anyone who wants Europe to grow together economically and socially must also invest in the regions, and must also invest in the social cohesion of our European society. One final point: the EU has to respect the law and human rights at its own borders. Unfortunately, we are constantly getting news that there are serious violations of human rights at the external borders of the European Union, but also at the Croatian borders. Your government has an exemplary duty to promote a reform of European migration policy, which is committed to the human right and the fundamental right to asylum, over the next six months.

I will make a few points on some of the items you have raised. First of all, I very much look forward to working in synergy with you, Ursula, and with your Commission. We said in Zagreb that your first months will be efficient as possible. We in the Council will help you to be propulsive and pass the proposed legislation as much as we can. In that respect, since migration was mentioned, we look forward to the new initiatives regarding the Dublin package. I think there is a lot of expectation that we will finally be able to create a balance between responsibility and solidarity, but in an upgraded and refurbished fashion. When it comes to Schengen and the euro, which you mentioned, this is clearly a little bit of a Croatian hat. I deliberately didn’t want to mention them at the beginning, but it’s true. My Government has two major objectives. One is to join the Schengen area – I thank the Juncker Commission for the green light when it comes to technical conditions and Ursula von der Leyen’s Commission for the forwarding of the proposal to the Council – and, after our Presidency, we will continue to push for that objective. On the strategy to adopt the euro, we are in the process of working and fulfilling the action plan for the Exchange Rate Mechanism too. We intend to complete this exercise – just – at the end of our Presidency and then a decision is at the Eurogroup level. When it comes to multilateralism and humanitarian aspects, as well as the social pillar, which were mentioned by Ms García Pérez, I think that, when you read the entire programme carefully – and it has been distributed to all of you – you will see a lot on social inclusion, equality and non—discrimination. This is an integrative part of our programme and, when it comes to migration and the protection of the Croatian border, let me be very clear on this. The migratory and refugee crisis of 2015 and 2016 has, without any doubt, after the fall of the Berlin Wall, been the most important phenomenon that has occurred and had political ramifications, not only on the political debate of the EU institutions, but also on the national debates and policies in all of our countries. Therefore, the solution to this issue is to strengthen the external border of the European Union. We should do this with a comprehensive set of tools – foreign policy, security, development, trade, state—building, humanitarian aid – in all the crisis areas around the world as much as we can, but we must also strengthen the external border, notably the one between Greece and Turkey. This is where the problem on the eastern Mediterranean and Western Balkans route arises.  Croatia will not allow itself to become a country that would be an informal hotspot. This is clear. We haven’t opted, unlike some other Member States, to erect barricades and fences, and to create barbed wire. On the contrary, we are protecting our border, with 6 500 police guarding the Croatian border, guarding the future Schengen border and guarding the European Union border. In that respect, we shall apply our law, European standards and international conventions. Any allegations that there were any misdemeanours will be investigated and sanctioned, but none of these allegations should be taken per se as a fact. This is what I’m telling you, as someone who has visited the area of the north—western border between Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia and fully understands the terrain and the conditions. On that, we need to cooperate, use the activities of Frontex and help each other in order to address the issue adequately. When it comes to the issue of enlargement, which was mentioned by Mr Bay, I will simply say one thing. There is no fuite en avant. There is a careful, responsible logic for those who are European states and those who are surrounded by European Union states because, let’s be clear: the countries of south—east Europe have nowhere else to go. They will not become members of the United States, China, Russia or whoever else. The only way forward is Europe. It’s our policy to structure that relationship in a serious manner. If we perennially have the policy of leaving them the impression that they’ll be part of the antichambre forever, it will not be good. They will derail, they will walk away from the objectives and they will lose momentum in the reforms. Opening negotiations doesn’t mean accession tomorrow. It means a long, cumbersome, technical and stringent process. Therefore, the modification of the methodology and progress of the two countries will hopefully come to a conducive situation so that, at the Zagreb Summit, we can have a successful declaration, paving the way for the next ten years. This is our objective. Ms Tomašić, thank you for your suggestions. I really am grateful that you want success for Croatia. We will work with you to enable this. This will not be an exercise, as you said, almost in a protocol sense. We are working hard. We have been preparing hard. We are in the fourth year of our mandate. The people who are dealing with this have been dealing with it – unlike many other actors in my country today who dare to speak on Europe – every single hour of their working, political and professional life to understand Europe, to work for Croatian membership and to make our role in Europe relevant and successful, and this is how we approach it. Finally, on the funds that Mr Kolakušić mentioned, I will just make two points. The balance between traditional policy and modernisation is not a simple equation to be solved. Had this been such a simple exercise, we would probably already have seen an agreement in the previous composition of the Parliament. We all have a lot of responsibility. Positions are pretty distant, but we all need to concede a little bit in order for all of us to gain for our countries and our citizens. This will be the guiding prescient principle for these negotiations in the months to come. Thank you for this part of the intervention.

However, not so long ago, even for generations of my parents, freedom, democracy, but also full belonging to the European family were only a distant and uncertain aspiration. That is why the Croatian Presidency of the Council of the European Union represents another symbol in the great transformation of Croatia. From the difficult struggle for independence and independence that began three decades ago, when I was born, to the successful Member State of the European Union.  Today, at the beginning of the new and institutional cycle, we have common goals, but also common challenges, which are recognized in the Croatian presidency priorities. One of the key issues will certainly be the issue of the European Union's multiannual budget.

All this at the hands of the European Commission, which, instead of consulting Parliament with a view to codecision, preferred to bypass it and act in the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean. That is why it is important to strengthen the link between our States and to stand united against this attempt to delegitimize Parliament, which is the voice of the citizens. Italy, Croatia and Slovenia's commitment to fisheries must be joint, in order to defend and protect fishermen with a view to good neighbourly relations.

Despite european sentiment that is increasingly critical of the European Union, as the recent election polls in France, Italy and Spain, not to mention the United Kingdom, have shown, supporters of the federal Europe are moving headlong towards more integration, more enlargement, less freedom, less identity, less national sovereignty. Croatia's entry into the EU in 2013, in the midst of an institutional crisis, had major consequences for whole sections of the Croatian economy, as well as for shipbuilding workers, a major coastal industrial specialty that had to face the rules of supposedly free and undistorted competition. So you cannot, Prime Minister, knowingly ignore the challenges that are now before you. The programme you are presenting here is not revolutionary and I fear that it will not change anything in the daily lives of the peoples of Europe.

You are talking about Turkey, which is a candidate country, you want to include Kosovo in the EU.

Look at how many people are leaving Croatia, how young people are leaving your country. And if you then take Franjo Tusman and his book 'Croatia and the question of nationality in the present day', you will find better answers to Europe's challenges than what the Commission and this Parliament are doing. The European Union is currently the largest global economy with the lowest growth performance, it has the lowest investment power, but it wants to spend EUR 3 trillion on climate change, which is not necessarily a technology of the future, even if the majority sees it differently here. In this respect, the solution to the question of Europe is more likely to be found in Tusman than in Brussels.

The first one is our budget and the MFF, the second one is Brexit and the third one is the Western Balkans. First of all, where the budget is concerned, I think, dear Prime Minister, it is very important that Croatia and the Presidency convinces the Council to stick to its own strategic agenda, because – and I’m emphasising this – we need the modernisation of the budget, why this? The budget we have right now was agreed in 2013. You remember the year 2013 because it was the year when Croatia joined the European Union. The world was completely different. In the year 2013, we did not have any idea of Daesh. It existed already but we didn’t know anything of it. There hadn’t been the migration crisis yet. Russia had not annexed Crimea and had not yet started the hybrid war in the Ukraine. At that time, we had no Paris climate agreement. We were not speaking of 5G or artificial intelligence. These few highlights show that the world is completely different and that we do need a completely different budget – that means modernisation. One message from my part, and I think I have the support of the Parliament on this: if the overall ceiling is too low, if the budget in itself is too small, the only way out is our own new resources at European level. (Applause) There is an opportunity to introduce that with an emission trading system. The revenues of the emission trading system will grow, so we will not take anything away from the Member States. On the contrary, they’ll have more. But we can also allocate at European level the revenues from the emission trading system to serve the European Green Deal. The second topic is Brexit. Your Presidency comes at a crucial time for the Brexit negotiations because we have to make enormous progress. This is decisive until the summer, until the end of your Presidency, and here we have to decide on – or it’s the UK’s choice to decide on – how close or how distant they want to be from the European Union, but that also means from the single market. In other terms, you cannot have no free movement for people and then expect to have free movement for goods, capital and services. It’s either all four have free movement or none of this is possible. You cannot accept to have a level playing field if there’s a huge divergence in taxation or social standards or environmental standards. So it is the choice of the UK how far they want to align or diverge, but this is decisive for how good access to the single market will be or not. In short, it’s the old proverb: you cannot have your cake and eat it at the same time. And the very last point, the Western Balkans. Ich glaube, beim Thema des Westbalkans dürfen wir eines nicht unterschätzen: Es ist in unserem strategischen Interesse, dass der Westbalkan so nah wie möglich bei uns ist. Wir sollten nicht unterschätzen, wie stark China bereits präsent ist, wie stark Russland dort präsent ist, wie stark die Türkei dort präsent ist – alle mit der Intention, den Westbalkan und die Staaten des Westbalkans so stark wie irgendwie möglich auf ihre Seite zu ziehen. Es ist in unserem Interesse, sie so nah wie möglich an uns heranzuführen, und deshalb mit dem Blick auf Nordmazedonien und Albanien: Wir haben viel von ihnen verlangt. Nordmazedonien musste seinen Namen wechseln, um die Möglichkeit zu haben, die Beitrittsgespräche mit der Europäischen Union zu eröffnen. Und ich glaube, wir können es schaffen, einerseits den Beitrittsprozess zu modernisieren, aber andererseits auch treu im Wort zu bleiben zu dem, was wir Nordmazedonien und Albanien gesagt haben.

Let me say a few points at the end in order to try to collectively touch on some of the matters that you have raised.  First of all, what is the philosophy of our first ever Presidency of the Council? We are a bit of a symbol and a signal, as I said at the beginning. Only 30 years of democracy, 28 years of international recognition, seventh year of membership. Still catching up with those who are more developed; those who were in the Union from the start, or those who joined, like our neighbours from Central and Eastern Europe, in 2004 and 2007. One of the MEPs, Mr Krach, I think, mentioned the first Croatian President Tuđman, and tried to interpret his doctrine. I dare to say that I might know a little bit better what is the legacy of the first Croatian President, and what he wanted for Croatia once we gained our sovereignty for the future and the perspective. It was actually he, 30 years ago on 30 May in the first democratically—composed Croatian Parliament, who said that European integration is the way to go, and everything we have done in the last three decades has been the implementation of this objective. We know what sovereignty means. We know what it means unlike any other country which is present in this hemicycle. What it means to have occupied territory. What it means to have a war on your territory. What it means to have more than 16 000 people killed in your own country, almost at the end of the 20th Century.  That experience remains vivid and we know that Europe is a project of peace and cooperation and reconciliation. That’s how we address our political responsibility today. This is very important to know.  Second, we have taken into account the strategic agenda, the trio programme, the programme of the new Commission and our own programme. Everything that we have put as priorities is very realistic. Therefore, on some of the items, we know that climate change and the climate neutral objective until 2015 will be the driver of our economic transformation. It will become for our economy what embedded human rights are for our foreign policy. This is what we agreed with the Commission in Zagreb last week. We should help to address this issue so as to take into account the different state of play of our industries, our financial capability, our budgetary capabilities, in order to go in the same direction but not to have negative economic consequences.  Secondly, on the dossier of migration, which many of you have mentioned, I will say once again – and repeat this with full understanding – that this is crucially what we must do in the months ahead of us.  We had the arrangement with Turkey that has managed to put down the numbers of illegal migration on the Eastern Mediterranean and Western Balkans route, compared to 2015-2016 data, by 98% – 98% down. These are the numbers we have now compared to 5 years ago, to only 2%. How should we tackle this? Jointly. We speak about a Frontex of ten thousand border police. My country proportionally perhaps has more border police than any other – 6 500. I hear some statements and allegations, which in the reports you read, or the rumours you hear, are almost to become effect. They are not. Whenever there was an allegation, there was an investigation. There were some disciplinary measures. There is strong surveillance within our police to prevent any violation of human rights, or any behaviour which would contravene our own law, European standards or international conventions. This is how we should behave.  But I repeat, once again, unlike many other Member States, we have said no barbed wire between two friendly, neighbouring countries such as Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, and we will not erect fences between nations which are friendly, which will always be together as we were together in the past. Moreover we said clearly we will not erect fences between parts of the Bosnian Herzegovina border where Croats live as constituent people in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croats on the other side of the border. This will simply not happen. This is our policy and we will stay behind it. But what we want to do is jointly address the problem either at the source, or at the first point of entry. The Croatian—Bosnian Herzegovina border is not the first point of entry of migratory waves. Let’s be very clear about it. This is important to note.  On the budget, the stakes are high. We understood the message ‘we can’t do more with less finance available’. That’s very clear. But we need to find a common consensus if we are to embark on the new own resources. By many analysis, by many reports by very able people in a number of years behind us, this might seem the only way to address, as Ursula says, the modernisation expectations of what we can finance jointly – this is key.  On demography, if there is one political element which I would like to leave as a legacy of Croatia in this six months – and also together with the Commission, given that Dubrovka has this portfolio for first time ever in the history of the European Union – it is this, which we feel to be an existential question for the European Union. For almost half of our Member States who have negative natural growth, such as my country, I think there is a need for a set of tools with the great sensitiveness of the President of the Commission who knows in her previous roles how important this issue is, how we can combine policy measures which have proved to be efficient in other countries, how we can offer them to those that have difficulty.  This is the idea – the population is moving from less developed countries to more developed, from rural areas to urban areas. These are our common problems and we should address them jointly. On the Western Balkans and the issue of enlargement, we are not naive. We are not unrealistic. I know more perhaps than anybody, since I’ve been dealing with this issue for almost 30 years, that the level of enthusiasm that the West with open hands offered to the Central and Eastern European countries in the 90s will never happen again, to those who would like to join.  But what we need to do, is intelligently to structure the process for the next ten years. To steer this process, to pilot it. To give an ambitious agenda for those who want to reform, transform and attain the standards that we have in the European Union. This is the idea behind the summit that we want to organise in Zagreb, and therefore I say for those who are afraid of saying ‘yes’ to the opening of the intergovernmental conference with Albania and North Macedonia, we know it’s a complex legal process with so many possibilities to either suspend or to reverse or to ask more or to build another requirement of this exercise. It is just a start of a marathon. It’s not a senseless fuite en avant.  We have to be clear about it. Enlargement doesn’t happen overnight, it happens after years of long reform process and careful scrutiny by the Commission and the input of the Member States.  In that respect I don’t want any of the countries in our neighbourhood to be forgotten, especially Bosnia-Herzegovina which is strategic for my country. I will also mention Ukraine, because you mentioned it Ursula now. I think in the context of the Eastern Partnership and everything we dealt with from 2013 and 2014 until now, we should adequately address their own ambitions for territorial integrity, but also for reforms in the European perspective which we should support. One word on Brexit. I see that Michel is here and this topic is just after our debate. I think the most important element in the last three and a half years, was the unity of the 27. We remain united with full solidarity extended especially to the most concerned countries such as Ireland. In the 11 months ahead of us, with an intelligently drafted and crafted negotiated framework, I think we can attain a good agreement as a starting point for future relations. We should not pretend that in an unprecedented situation we can solve with the first contractual relations everything we’d like to do in the future, after the divorce that is happening literally in three weeks’ time. Therefore we will help you, as the Council, on the proposal of the Commission, to find the right balance for completion in the months to come.  Finally, I just want to reiterate that all of our services, all of our ministers, government, MEPs who are here – and I thank them for their contributions – will be at your disposal to have a good dialogue together and to reach compromises.  This is one of the objectives of European democracy. This is the role of the European Parliament. This is the role of the Member States within the Council and also the facilitating and leadership role that the European Commission has. I thank you very much, Mr President, for this opportunity and for having been with you here today in Strasbourg.

This more than 100 million citizens face barriers to access to education and employment, mobility and an independent, active life on a daily basis. Preparing teachers and trainers to support the full development of children and young people with disabilities is crucial for their future social and professional life, and I therefore hope that this issue will be taken into account in the Council conclusions on teachers and trainers for the future of Europe.

Indeed, having done so would have led to a level of protection far weaker than we have at present, with part two of the agreement dealing with citizens’ rights fully embedded in the whole agreement and with various remedies foreseen should the UK not deliver adequately in implementing these provisions.  This does not mean that we should rest on our laurels and I’m grateful to the European Parliament for having scheduled this debate today. I also welcome the draft resolution tabled as it lists a number of concerns regarding the preservation of citizens’ rights, the administrative procedure in relation to residents’ rights, the limited assistance offered to citizens in this respect or the effectiveness of the UK independent authority due to oversee the implementation of these provisions.  This does not necessarily mean that everything is rosy on the EU side. It is important, as you note in your resolution, to encourage the Member States to adopt a generous attitude regarding the rights of UK citizens having decided to settle in the European Union.  We should also insist that both the Commission and a UK independent authority are rigorous in their monitoring of the implementation of part two of the agreement.  There is also more that can be done regarding the awareness of citizens on both sides of the channel, however protective the provisions of the Withdrawal Agreement. They would be of little use to citizens, especially vulnerable ones, if they are not aware of them, nor of the administrative steps needed to benefit from them. And certainly, Parliament can also play a role in reaching out to citizens and contributing to their information.  Of course all these provisions – even though their effect will last beyond the transition period – will not cover citizens who would consider settling at a later stage. Although we are well aware that the line of the UK Government is to put an end to the free movement of persons, we should make sure that the future relationship that will be negotiated shortly will be ambitious enough in terms of mobility.  This will have to be accompanied with the preservation of certain rights for the citizens concerned.  Let me conclude by noting the large degree of convergence that exists between your positions on citizens’ rights as developed in your various resolutions and the priorities of the Council. This is a clear illustration of the commonality of purposes of our two institutions as regards Brexit.  Our common efforts should help to ensure that the provision on citizens’ rights in the Withdrawal Agreement allows EU citizens and UK nationals, as well as their family members, to continue to live, work or study in their host countries, as they have chosen to do.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 78, "date": "2020-01-14.json", "name": "David Maria SASSOLI", "mepid": "96864", "text": "   President of the Commission. – Mr President, last week I was in London and I had the opportunity to speak to students about the future of the relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union. After I had finished the speech, as always the floor was opened to the students and the audience and the very first question that came was not about trade, it was not about financial services, it was not about security, as important as these topics are. It was of course about citizens’ rights. And the same question came back time and again with different personal twists. One came from a young man who came from Benelux living in the UK who was of course worried about his future. Another came from a British lady who has an Italian husband and who was worried about his status, what’s going to happen with him. And while the questions may have been subtly different, the reason for asking them were always the same. People want certainty about their lives and their future and certainty about the future of their loved ones. And I am speaking here about 3.5 million citizens in the UK who come from a European Union Member State, and about the roundabout one million British people living elsewhere in the European Union. Now these are large numbers but behind each of these numbers are people with their very own personal stories. Some are citizens from another European Union country but they are born in the United Kingdom. Others have arrived later. Many have married, have children, have gone to university, have started their careers, and they work in the UK and respectively in the European Union. They teach children, they treat patients, they care for the elderly, they work in farms or factories, they have started their own businesses and provide a living to many more. So whatever their own personal story is, they all have one thing in common, and that is they want to have peace of mind. They want to have a plan for their futures and the future of their families. And all they want is to feel at home in the place they call home. Therefore, protecting these citizens’ rights has always been our top priority from the moment the referendum result became clear. Thanks to the excellent work of Michel Barnier and his negotiating team, the Withdrawal Agreement provides comprehensive guarantees for these citizens. It gives them the protection and the certainty they need. It allows them to stay where they live today, under the same conditions, for as long as they want and without any discrimination based on their nationality. This Withdrawal Agreement and with what we have agreed on, puts clear obligations on the United Kingdom and on the European Union to safeguard these rights. It is one thing is to put them on paper, another thing is to implement them. So once the House has ratified the Withdrawal Agreement our top priority will be to implement our shared obligations, both in letter and in spirit. And for me this is a legal issue with a moral imperative. The good news is that the United Kingdom has already begun implementing the European Union Settlement Scheme. To date, about 2.5 million European Union citizens living in the United Kingdom have already applied for residence status. Most of these people have now received proof of their right to remain. This is good news. But you also know that there are cases where some have not and many more are yet to apply, and there is a number of concerns that have also been raised. There are the famous cases of the French bakers and the Polish chefs that shine a light on some of the issues. But, seriously, there are many other cases where people are confused or unable to apply for whatever reasons. Or others have received requests for more proof, despite having lived in the country for 40 years or more. So, we are in close contact with the citizens and the UK authorities on these issues. We need to avoid any discrimination or added complexity during the application process. We need to ensure that all citizens – especially the most vulnerable – are fully supported throughout the process. And we need the guarantee that the Independent Monitoring Authority can act in full independence to deal with complaints. This is of utmost importance. From our side, the Commission will keep a close and vigilant eye on the implementation. We are ready to help European Union citizens living in the United Kingdom to ensure they are properly informed and supported. And of course we will do the same when it comes to British citizens living in the European Union. All these questions I have been speaking about I raised with Prime Minister Johnson last week when I visited London. We will closely cooperate with the United Kingdom to make sure that we can get this right and that we can solve any problems as swiftly as possible. Finally, the good news is that there will be continuity for the European Union citizens living in the United Kingdom and vice versa for the British citizens living in the European Union at the end of the transition period. But, after the end of the transition period, the United Kingdom will be a third country. And Brexit will mean changes to those who will want to make their future life on either side of the Channel. We will have to negotiate a new way forward, and we are getting ready to formulate the mandate for those negotiations ahead of 1 February. We have, as we have done in the past, also made in these negotiations citizens’ rights our main priority. And we will always negotiate in good faith to build a new comprehensive partnership with our British friends. As I said to those students in London, it is the good old story about old friends and new beginnings.

We have listened to their stories and understood better the consequences of Brexit for their rights as European citizens. Their concerns have become ours. In all its resolutions, the European Parliament dealt with citizens’ rights, but still today we see risks to the sustainability of commitments agreed in the withdrawal agreement – hence this new resolution. The lack of proper and full implementation of legal solutions on citizens’ rights would have a massive impact on people’s lives and their life choices. The implementation of the withdrawal agreement matters because it provides a minimum of legal certainty that people need. We regret that in spite of the option presented in Article 18(4) of the withdrawal agreement, the UK has chosen to use the application approach for a settled status scheme. I regret, also, that only half the Member States seem to use the approach based on the declaration. We also deeply regret that the UK Government has announced its intention to end free movement of people under the future framework for cooperation. EU citizens, including British nationals, have greatly benefited from the free movement of people and I still hope that the British Government changes its mind on this issue. It will, further, be crucial that we find a way towards mutual recognition of qualifications, that it will be possible for citizens to participate in local elections, that there will be good cooperation in the field of family law on the basis of relevant provisions in international law and that potential regulatory divergence will not affect citizens’ rights. I appreciate the assurances given to us by the UK Government with regard to the functioning of the independent monitoring authority. The European Parliament will nevertheless keep a watchful eye on the implementation process. As we have pointed out in our resolution, the shortened transition period means that there is less time to operationalise governance of the withdrawal agreement regarding citizens’ rights and that an awareness-raising campaign will also be a matter of priority. Ultimately, the proper and full implementation of citizens’ rights would help to build the trust needed for successful negotiations on the future.

That explains why our top priority in terms of Brexit has always been citizens’ rights, not only the rights of EU citizens living in the UK, but also the rights of British citizens living all over the European Union. Listening to the serious concerns expressed by so many citizens and NGOs, we simply cannot ignore that people are extremely worried about the high degree of uncertainty and other damaging implications of Brexit in their lives and legitimate expectations. That is why we are here today to discuss and approve a political resolution tabled and supported by the leaders of many political groups in this Parliament and designed to convey a strong political message. The UK Government can do more and should do more to ensure full protection of citizens’ rights in the context of Brexit. We certainly acknowledge the efforts made on such a difficult issue, but the truth is that the EU settlement scheme currently in operation in the UK could easily be more user friendly and would largely benefit if additional assistance were provided to older and more vulnerable citizens.  On the other hand, as many applicants are only getting pre-settled status, it would be better to take this procedure as declaratory in nature and to ensure proper review by a truly independent authority.

I hope that this House, when we vote – I think it’s tomorrow we vote – on this resolution gives it a huge majority, a huge majority that gives us a mandate for the final discussions with the UK authorities, which will happen on Thursday. I have been invited by the Secretary of State, Mr Barclay, and by the new Minister for European Affairs, Mr Pincher. It’s important that this resolution has massive support so that it gives us strength on Thursday and Friday because there are still concerns that need to be addressed. If they are not addressed now, before the end of the month, they will be on the table before the end of the year. I cannot imagine that the European Parliament will agree, for example, on the free-trade agreement (FTA) without solving the problems and the concerns of the EU citizens and the UK citizens, including freedom of movement.  These concerns have already been mentioned by my two colleagues. First of all, the automatic recognition of citizens’ rights. There is a Tory Government and Tory governments always say that they want less bureaucracy. Well, OK, let’s make less bureaucracy and the best way to do it is automatic recognition so that you don’t need all this. The second is a physical document. Why is it necessary? The UK authorities are telling us that, ‘yes, but it’s not necessary – they have an email’. But can you imagine a case where a woman goes to see her parents on the continent, comes back and at the border they ask, ‘where is your email?’ – ‘I don’t have my email, there is no energy anymore in my battery’ – or maybe she deleted the mail, so she cannot enter the UK. We need a physical document. In a normal world, you have a document. That’s the second concern.  The third concern is the Independent Monitoring Authority. My proposal is simple: why not put a few representatives of the 3million organisation in the Independent Monitoring Authority? Then we are sure that both sides are there, so it solves the problem. These things need to be addressed and I hope that they will be on Thursday and Friday.  Maybe, to finish on a lighter note, I can ask Prime Minister Johnson for a little bit of flexibility. Maybe he can follow the Queen’s example – because yesterday the Queen gave Harry and Meghan a transition period to leave, so maybe some flexibility on Mr Johnson’s side could also be very useful.

Mr President, the European Union is often presented as a vast, mainly economic project, committed to promoting the interests of capital holders. That is somewhat true, but it is not that the European Union and the three million citizens of the European Union who live in the United Kingdom and the 2 million or so Britons who live in the European Union know this well. The freedom of movement, the freedom to establish themselves to study, to work, to retire, a freedom granted to all the citizens of the European Union, is probably one of the pearls, one of the most important achievements of the European Union. This is, of course, what all these citizens are likely to lose with the now inevitable withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union. Indeed, this Parliament and the European negotiators, including Michel Barnier, have done everything possible to minimise the damage - because there is damage - caused by the UK's withdrawal from the European Union. I think what was put in the separation agreement is satisfactory, but it is true that we have a problem of trust with the United Kingdom: it is true that we are concerned about the administrative difficulties that are being put in place or of this threat which is written in black and white in the transposition into British law of the separation agreement and which provides for the possibility for the British Government to abolish outright the independent authority which will ensure the application of the separation agreement in terms of respect for the rights of citizens. Even more worrying are the statements made by some close to the British Home Office that almost portray EU citizens residing in the UK as threats to state security. So my message to the Government of the United Kingdom is this: if you really consider the European Union to be a friendly power of the United Kingdom, make sure that by your attitude towards European citizens, you simply confirm that status as friends.

The resolution debated today accepts this verdict. Three points, however, deserve mention.  First, the agreement states that in future, the parties may decide no longer to accept national identity cards without a biometric identification chip. Such a rule is not unlawful, but there seems no obvious legal, economic or security reason for it. Data protection and privacy were once subjects of fierce political debates. Sadly in our rights-obsessed political climate today, such basic rights seem forgotten.  Second, the agreement freezes EU citizens’ rights as they are being interpreted on Brexit day, while assigning future interpretation to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). The CJEU is, in effect, asked to develop two parallel bodies of case—law: one for citizens’ rights within the EU27 and another for the UK based on pre-Brexit EU law. How realistic, I ask, is this? Finally, clause 18 of the resolution bemoans the UK Government’s intention to end free movement of persons next year. The motion claims that all four freedoms are interlinked and that any comprehensive EU-UK trade deal should be conditional on the UK agreeing to generous free movement of persons rules. This demand is against the UK’s and the EU’s own interests. Free trade agreements – indeed, most EU trade agreements – generally say nothing about free movement of persons. The EU in 2018 had a very large trade surplus with the UK. It’s therefore in the EU’s interests, just as Britain’s, to negotiate a comprehensive trade deal.  If this House is serious about citizens’ rights, then EU and UK citizens have a right that their economic interests be taken seriously by this House.

They got on extremely well. The atmosphere was very positive. This is the right approach. Now we need to make rapid progress on the future relationship between Britain and the European Union, but first of all we have to get the Withdrawal Agreement out of the way.  As you know, the House of Commons passed by a majority of 99 votes the third reading of the Withdrawal Agreement last week. It has now moved to the House of Lords. It’s the duty of this House to give its assent to the Withdrawal Agreement so that it can take effect on 31 January, and I trust that will happen smoothly.  Of course, control of our own borders was a key factor in the vote to leave the European Union. I say to Ms Hübner we should bear that in mind. On the subject of citizens’ rights, this is an area where both the British Government and the EU have been more or less in agreement from the start. I like the first paragraph of the resolution: ‘believes that part two of the Withdrawal Agreement is fair and balanced’. The resolution, quite frankly, should stop there. I feel sure the resolution is designed to be helpful in spite of its misconceptions and some nit—picking. I sincerely hope so, but I am sure some role will be found for Mr Verhofstadt in the future. Historically, of course, no country equals the United Kingdom in terms of protecting the rights, freedoms and liberties of the individual.  Mr President, may I say the resolution focuses disproportionately on the future status of EU citizens in the EU but pays scant attention to British citizens in the remaining 27 countries of the European Union. One paragraph out of 22! The UK is in an advanced stage of preparation but hardly any of the remaining Member States have published plans as to how the system will work for British citizens resident in their countries.

Mr President, I would like to thank the Today we need to talk about the rights of those who play their part in the well-being and prosperity of British society, whether in care, research or self-employed people. Of course, while we are not standing in the way of the UK's decision to leave the European Union at the end of this month, we will have to stand in the way of any attempt to make the citizens, both British and EU citizens, pay for it. This debate has become necessary because there is a well-founded concern that the agreement on citizens' rights and related social rights will not be implemented one-to-one in the course of the divorce process between the European Union and the United Kingdom. This concerns, in particular, the rules on residence status, such as those of self-employed service providers, as well as the applicability of that scheme to vulnerable persons or the elderly. However, we must also think about the future relationship between the European Union and the United Kingdom. As we all know, this is about much more than a trade agreement. It is a question of regulating every single political, economic and environmental aspect that will determine coexistence on both sides of the Channel in the future. Given the complexity and the multiplicity of political aspects affected by the divorce, it is clear to everyone that it is not possible to negotiate a number of international agreements with each other in just eleven months. Anyone who claims otherwise knowingly sprinkles sand in people's eyes. That is why it is necessary for The Government of Boris Johnson, in my view, to request an extension of the transitional period in good time, so that citizens' rights can be protected and that he and us are given the time they need – no more and no less. If this does not happen – and this must be emphasised here – there is still the risk of a hard Brexit, with all its negative consequences. My group has always worked over the past few years to secure the peace process in Northern Ireland and to protect the social rights of those affected. We will continue to do so in the future. There must be no reduction in standards, because the UK government may come up with the bad idea that dumping competition will give it a competitive advantage. This is unacceptable, either on social issues or in tax policy, either on environmental issues or on consumer protection.

Instead of strengthening the independent body, given the history of our immigration and nationality system, given the injustices, given the shared moral and legal responsibility, this is the direction we were moving in. Let’s be clear: these are genuine concerns of EU citizens and I say to the Council, we have genuine concerns of UK citizens in the rest of the European Union. If we don’t get this right, this will be a deep scar and continuing injustice that will define what happens in the future agreements. Of course it will be for many years to come.

And we even heard from Nigel Farage, saying that they could stay and enjoy the same rights as UK citizens because, he said, to row back on that would class you as a banana republic. Yet here we are today. Automatic rights and favourable treatment have quickly transformed into talk of deportations and a hostile environment. The British Government seems to have learned absolutely nothing from the Windrush scandal. And a system is put in place that will probably never reach all the citizens that need it and, by its design, puts many vulnerable citizens at risk of losing rights. The consequence is uncertainty and anxiety for EU citizens in the UK. Because, regardless of Mr Van Orden’s semantic point before, many people have already experienced loss of their rights.

It seems designed to make life difficult for them. And now, Boris Johnson has an increased majority, won, let us recall, on only 43% of the vote.

They tell me that the system is unnecessarily cruel and that it leads to a lot of uncertainty. The basic issue is that they get a PDF by email, which they can print as a PDF, which anybody could fake, which says that they have been granted settled status. That is all. They don’t get any card they can use when they travel. They don’t get any card that they can use when they go to work. They don’t know if the next time they come to the UK, somebody might not find their status. There is a very easy solution to that, which is a card with your photo which they could get, like you get in the US when you’re a permanent resident. Our citizens are being subjected to an unnecessarily cruel system and I think that it should be a priority in negotiating with the UK authorities that, as our resolution says in point 10, this physical proof should exist and be given via a certain and simple process.

We therefore believe that safeguards need to be deepened and improved with regard to workers' rights and other social rights, including the right of residence, the right to non-discriminatory treatment, the right of access to public services, health and education, the portability of social security benefits, the right to family reunification and the mutual recognition of academic and professional qualifications , just to mention a few examples, whether in the context of the ongoing discussion between the European Union and the United Kingdom, or also in the context of the necessary discussion and bilateral negotiations between each Member State and the United Kingdom for the establishment of a mutually beneficial framework for future bilateral relations.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "GUE/NGL", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Left-wing"}, {"id": 132, "date": "2020-01-14.json", "name": "Michel BARNIER", "mepid": "72776", "text": "   Head of the task force for relations with the United Kingdom. Madam President, Madam Minister Brnjac, ladies and gentlemen, before this House and beyond, I have always held a language of truth about the countless consequences of Brexit in all areas. You can give me an acknowledgeal of this language of truth and we know well, ladies and gentlemen, that of all the reasons for Brexit, the ones that motivated the Brexiters themselves, there are two fundamental ones. First, to regain the ability to diverge on the social, environmental and fiscal rules that are at the very heart of the European single market as an ecosystem. Secondly, this was recalled with great clarity earlier, it is the abolition of the freedom of movement of men and women, which has been at the heart of the European project since the beginning. That is the will we have to face and it has far-reaching consequences for the future. This has been said by many of you and we will discuss this in future negotiations with concrete consequences, with regard to the various cuts, from the end of the transition period, on 31 December this year, in terms of the economy, professional qualifications or security installation capabilities. No one on both sides - I say on both sides, ladies and gentlemen - should underestimate the direct consequences of the abolition of freedom of movement, which is at the heart of Brexit. This for the future negotiation which will begin at the beginning of March.  For now, we are talking about the rights of citizens, which have been the priority of your Parliament and the European negotiator speaking before you, and I want to thank you for that. This has also been the priority of all the Member States you represent. I too want to thank Guy Verhofstadt and all your colleagues for this extremely clear resolution, which is before you tomorrow, and which expresses your vigilance and solidarity with all citizens concerned by the direct consequences of Brexit. I believe that Guy Verhofstadt will be able to draw on this vote, which I wish as clearly as possible, in the talks he will have this week in London. As our President Ursula von der Leyen mentioned earlier, citizens need certainty about their future and the future of their families. They need to know what Brexit means to them in everyday life. Objectively, I believe that the withdrawal agreement that you have on your table provides these certainties for British citizens living in one of the 27 Member States and the rights they will have acquired before the end of the transition period, that is, before the end of the year just started. This will allow them to continue to live their lives as before in their country of residence, and this is of course the case for almost 3 and a half million EU citizens who are based in the United Kingdom and who participate in the UK's economy and progress. All these citizens must be able to continue to live, study, work, receive benefits or bring their families for the duration of their lives.  That is what is in the treaty, and we are talking about a treaty with all the legal force attached to it, from the moment it is ratified on both sides. We must now ensure the proper implementation of these rights and we will not accept any half-measures or forms of disguised discrimination. Since my responsibility and that of my team is to ensure, under the authority of the President of the Commission and the Commissioners, the proper implementation of this withdrawal agreement after its ratification, I would obviously have as often as you would like, ladies and gentlemen, to come and report to Parliament on the proper implementation of this treaty. We will continue to defend the interests of our citizens, and I would like to thank the 27 embassies of our Member States in London for their commitment, which are working with the Commission in providing their help and advice. So we will continue to defend the interests of our citizens. And we will do everything in our power to ensure the full implementation of the Withdrawal Agreement. The Commission will do its utmost to ensure that the rights of one million British citizens living in the 27 Member States are guaranteed, that each and every one of them is properly informed and supported and we will watch closely to ensure that the UK Government does the same for the 3.5 million EU citizens residing in the UK. Indeed, the early implementation of the EU settlement scheme by the UK has already led to the identification of a series of concerns, raised in particular by citizens' organisations, but also today by many of you. As the personal case of Emmanuelle mentioned by Caroline Voaden of this House. The Commission will be particularly alert to EU citizens encountering difficulties in obtaining the new residents status. We expect the UK to help EU citizens to meet administrative requirements, as well as to accept requests failing to meet the deadline for good reasons. We are already in regular contact with our UK counterparts on these issues. And I have held a number of constructive exchanges with Stephen Barclay, the UK Secretary of State for Exiting the EU on this matter. I have, and I will continue to insist in particular on the importance of the UK putting in place a strong independent monitoring authority, mentioned by Claude Moraes a few minutes ago, an authority that must be able to act quickly and fairly when faced with complaints from Union citizens and their family. Let me just conclude with a few words on the bigger picture regarding this agreement that has now been approved by the House of Commons and will be submitted to you for your approval on 29 January. In addition to citizens' rights, there are many, many other topics where we must remain vigilant included in this withdrawal agreement. And I am thinking in particular about the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, which guarantees an integrated single market but also preserves the entire island economy and prevents the return of a hard border. I just want to say that the implementation of this protocol foresees checks and controls for goods entering the island of Ireland. I look forward to a constructive cooperation with the UK authorities to ensure that all the provisions set out in this agreement are respected and made operational.

Now, only four weeks later, we are here again with a financial package to back that goal – a European Green Deal investment plan for all the opportunities that the green transition offers and a Just Transition Mechanism, which is our pledge of solidarity and fairness for those who face the deepest challenge to make this journey with us.  Valdis will talk about the European Green Deal investment plan. But let me start with the Just Transition Mechanism. What we’re doing here is sending a message to coal miners in Asturias, western Macedonia or Silesia, to peat harvesters in the Irish midlands, Baltic regions reliant on oil shale and many more. We know that you face a steeper path towards climate neutrality and we know that the prospect of a different future – a cleaner one – might be a welcoming prospect in general, but the road to it looks daunting today.  This Just Transition Mechanism, of at least EUR 100 billion, is a pledge that the European Union stands with you in this transition. We propose three pillars to do this: first EUR 7.5 billion of fresh European money on top of what the Commission proposed for the future EU budget in our Just Transition Fund. This will generate EUR 30 to 50 billion of investment – money that can be used for workers to learn new skills for jobs of the future, support for businesses to bring new employment opportunities, investments in clean energy and repurposing of industrial facilities to prepare the ground for new activities.  Second, we will offer dedicated access to Europe’s investment programme, InvestEU, especially for the Just Transition. This will mobilise private funds for a total up to EUR 45 billion to help regions bring new sustainable businesses to replace the polluting ones and put new skills to use. Wherever industries want to contribute to climate neutrality, we will help with investments to move to new technologies and preserve jobs. And thirdly, special loans from the EIB (the European Investment Bank), backed by the EU budget, for local authorities’ regions and public agencies to fund green projects – to help people insulate their homes, for instance. Affordable loans will even help bring modern heating services to the most vulnerable families who rely on coal or wood to keep themselves warm in winter.  We know that the most affected regions are searching for good ideas and need extra help with projects, so we will deliver project support and bring all regional experiences together in our Just Transition platform.  Today’s proposal is very urgent. This Parliament knows it as it is the auctor intellectualis of this idea. You have come up with the idea of a Just Transition Fund. We also expect the Council to accommodate it in the negotiations on the next seven-year budget for Europe and call for a swift adoption.  We invite Member States to identify the regions that need the money and our practical support and to work with the Commission on a concrete plan for change. This will be a collective effort involving regions, local governments, social partners, industries and civil society. Everyone must be involved. This change will be locally owned so that our citizens can support it.  We know that these EUR 100 billion are a start. Fairness goes far beyond this mechanism alone. Climate change will touch the social foundations of our society. Renewable energy, green jobs, clean air to breathe and fresh water to drink. These are the wealth items of tomorrow.  Everyone, especially the most vulnerable, should reap benefits from this change. Fairness will inspire all our proposals under the Green Deal. We want cars that are clean and affordable, help for people to insulate their homes and green jobs with the minimum wage for a decent living. We want to cut the unacceptable 400 000 premature deaths from the poisonous fumes in our cities and regions. We have the skills, brains and technology to deliver our Green Deal.

We have no choice. We must succeed. This is something we owe to our citizens and to the next generations. The Sustainable Europe Investment Plan or European Green Deal Investment Plan, adopted by the Commission today, fills this commitment with life and with much—needed financing. The strength and novelty of this plan is that it brings together new policy initiatives and existing instruments. We are sending a clear signal to public authorities, companies and investors that we need to think green when we invest.  Let me outline the three pillars of our plan. First comes funding. The plan will mobilise at least EUR 1 trillion of sustainable investments over the next decade. The EU budget, with its 25% climate mainstreaming target, will add up to around half of this amount. We will also use leverage. Through InvestEU, we will mobilise some EUR 279 billion of public and private funds for climate- and environmentally—friendly investments, so the greener budget EU will lead by example. National co—financing for green projects accounts for another EUR 114 billion. As Frans has just explained, the Just Transition Mechanism will aim to reach EUR 100 billion over the next MFF. Beyond the EU budget, we will also tap the innovation and modernisation funds under the Emission Trading Scheme. I would also outline the EIB financing, which aims to raise its share of sustainable financing from 25% to 50% by 2025.  Second, we are putting forward conditions to enable public authorities and private operators to invest sustainably. Clear rules are a powerful incentive. With your support, we recently agreed on taxonomy as a tool to identify our green financial and economic activities. We will now explore how taxonomy can be used not only in the private but also in the public sector. Later this year, we will follow it up with a renewed sustainable finance action plan. We will also propose legislation on green public procurement and revise state aid rules in the light of the Green Deal.  Third, it’s not all about funds; it’s also about concrete projects. We will provide national administrations and project promoters with expertise to design quality projects and implement them. We will work with the EIB and other institutions to align their activities with the Green Deal objectives. Moving to the second part of our debate, which is a roadmap on social Europe, I would like to emphasise, as the Executive Vice—President responsible for economies that work for people, that our green and digital transitions must be just and inclusive. Social considerations remain centre stage. Both you and the European Council have underlined the need to implement the European Pillar of Social Rights. We are committed to it. Today’s communication on a strong social Europe for just transition is our roadmap to turn the pillar into reality. However, we know that many actions will be taken at national or stakeholder level. That’s why we’re launching the broader debate: to seek views on what more can be done. We want to hear what efforts all partners can commit to in order to make the pillar a reality.  Today, we are starting to consult our social partners on the needs and possible directions on the EU action for a fair minimum wage. The Commission has pledged to present a legal instrument to ensure that workers earn enough to support themselves. To be clear, it’s neither about setting a uniform European minimum wage nor about obliging countries to introduce a statutory minimum wage. National traditions of collective bargaining will be respected. Putting economic, environmental and social sustainability at the heart of policy requires a change of mindset. We have taken an important step towards achieving this today.

On behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party, I would like to welcome the proposals that you have made today. And I believe that the Just Transition Mechanism and all of the projects that you presented today are essential for the success of two of the most important programmes of the European Commission this year: the European Green Deal and the negotiations on the Multiannual Financial Framework. This is why my call is: let’s work fast and let’s agree fast in the next month, in the first half of this year, on the Just Transition Mechanism. Because this will unleash the potential of the MFF negotiations and it will also enable the success of the European Green Deal. We have seen in December at the European Council that the European Green Deal will stand or fall with its financing, and my group wishes the European Green Deal to succeed. That’s why we need to clarify the Just Transition Mechanism as soon as possible. How should the Just Transition Mechanism be? Firstly, it should be robust. In terms of volume, there should be enough resources there to really make a difference, to really alleviate the effects of the transition upon the regions the most affected. Secondly, it should not affect existing policies: neither cohesion nor agriculture nor research nor innovation. it is an additional priority. It should be financed on top. Thirdly, it should have a long-lasting positive impact upon the regions the most affected. This is why, particularly from the Just Transition Fund, I say: let’s invest in economic development, let’s support entrepreneurs, let’s support SMEs, let’s not just repeat the professional re-qualification courses which have not had long lasting effects in the past. My last point is the conditions. We should allocate money to the countries, to the regions in conditions so that they are accessible to them.

And there is no doubt that this colossal project needs a real, true transformation of our socio-economic systems, and also of our way of life. The credibility and success of the European Green Pact will depend on funding plans. But they will also depend on how we are able to manage the impact this transformation will have on our regions, with energy industrial models requiring more expensive modernization. The Commission's plans are an important first step. It aims to mobilize a trillion euros over the next decade, to ensure that Europe becomes the first continent to achieve climate neutrality. Moreover, this set of proposals seeks to ensure that the public and private sectors join forces to stimulate investment. However, the Commission itself recognises that the figure of the billion euros it expects to mobilisation is only a small part of the investment required to make this ecological transformation. The Commission's calculations therefore require us to reflect rigorously and consistently. And, in this sense, the first major challenge makes it essential to have a debate about obtaining new income to face this great social, ecological and economic transformation. The Social Democrats have a very firm position on this. We call for the Multiannual Financial Framework to target at least 30% of the fight against climate change. But we also need to talk about own resources including un recycled plastics packaging waste, the European Union emissions trading scheme, fair taxation of the digital sector, a tax on financial transactions and the common consolidated corporate tax base. We need to talk about those own resources. On the other hand, we demand that Member States benefit from a wider room for manoeuvre in their national budgets to stimulate sustainable investment. And, in order to realize the latter, we propose a reform of fiscal rules so that sustainable investments are exempted in the calculation of the debt deficit under the Stability and Growth Pact. And the second big challenge is a fair transition, in which no one is left behind. And no one being left behind isn't just a slogan. It means enging the fair transition fund with additional financial resources so as not to reduce cohesion policy and the common agricultural policy; it means empowering learning skills that enable future generations to successfully cope with ecological and digital transformation; and also means ensuring decent working conditions to eradicate the pay gap and combat child poverty.

In other situations, it has various tools, but there is no vision through which to incorporate these instruments and direct them towards a greater purpose. Today we are starting the year 2020 by putting together, in a debate, different instruments, but which serve the same goal, for a long-term, ambitious vision, linked to the green pact, of the Green Deal, which is clearly oriented towards citizens.  The message that the political group I represent, Renew Europe, supports is that citizens must keep in mind, after this debate, that the European Union is proposing to turn environmental and climate change challenges into development opportunities for an inclusive society with new skills, better jobs and growth. I turn my attention in particular to the citizens of vulnerable regions, such as the Jiului Valley or Gorj, the most important mining areas in Romania, who will come out of the poverty zone and have a modern and prosperous society, a digitalised industry and a clean circular economy through this fair transition. A fair transition means that we are able to create jobs and opportunities, that we are setting up the Youth Guarantee, that Member States will invest in education and training methods for qualification and retraining, that we involve private actors and small and medium-sized enterprises, to support digital technologies and vocational education.  We have over EUR 100 billion for this purpose, and I do not see why we should stop to achieve this truly just transition, in order to fulfil the Roadmap of the Ecological Pact. I call on the Government of Romania and all the Member States of the European Union to use these instruments and to focus on investments in the most important resource of the European continent: citizens.

I do sense the underlying spirit of a social just transition. People take centre stage and not companies, also a clear ‘no’ for subsidies for fossil fuels and nuclear power is just what the future needs. This proposal for a JTF is a good starting point to help particular regions to cope with the transition. However, what I’m missing in the proposal is a clear commitment to European level climate targets. The people and the economy need a clear date when the last European coal plant will get off the grid. We need commitments by every single region to individual coal phase-out plans. This must be a binding condition in order to receive support from the JTF, because funding a transition without the actual happening of a transition is pointless. And of course we have to talk about the money: EUR 7.5 billion, seven years, 108 coal regions. This roughly comes down to 10 million per region, per year. Is that enough to make the transition just for everyone? And in your calculation you then add co-financing from other cohesion funds. But this can be very dangerous because we don’t want to shift money from one region in need to another one in need. You then multiply the JTF with potential private investments, but Mr Timmermans please: we both know that there is not 100 billion in that just transition mechanism, but 7.5 billion. When street magicians try to trick their audience in such a way, we call that a sleight of hand. I’m sure the Commission doesn’t want to be seen a street magicians. So please come clear and let us fight together for a better consistent funding from own EU resources, so that coal workers are not at the mercy of MFF negotiations every seven years.

But there is some confusion of speech, because is this EUR 1 000 billion the same as the 1 000 billion i hear from the EIB about? The extrapolation of resources, in seven years' time, then again in ten years' time, also creates uncertainty. You will also take an advance on the multiannual budget. These negotiations are ongoing, and an agreement is certainly not yet in sight. Own resources also seem unsustainable, because of course, a plastic tax is almost by definition a decrepit yield. Next, you place a heavy burden on the EIB's shoulders. There is, of course, a big difference between mobilising money and self-financing. It is essential that the EIB maintains its AAA status and I call on the EIB to maintain its solid position.  The Commission is also limping on two legs on the transition mechanism. On the one hand, the Fund is open to all Member States, on the other hand it is clearly intended to put money on the brakes on the Member States. The fund is already in danger of becoming such a dangerous grabbelton that divides the Member States. We are absolutely in favour of a circular economy, but against recycling promises and money.

The Commission's proposal on the Fair Transition Fund is, in principle, correct. Poorer, most marginalised people in particular are confronted with the negative effects of climate change. Our task must be to protect these people and to protect them socially. The proposed financial support, for example for the retraining of jobseekers, is to be welcomed, but will be far from sufficient. In order to fully counteract social exclusion, we must also take into account people who are not active in the labour market. The aim of the Sustainable Development Agenda is to eradicate poverty in all its dimensions by 2030 and not to reinforce it further. The way to be climate-neutral must be a common inclusive process that largely excludes discrimination of any kind. It is therefore essential that Member States involve civil society and social partners in the preparation, implementation and evaluation of their regional plans.

With regard to the Juncker Fund, we have found that money has disproportionately gone where the most resourceful applicants sat. Secondly, we must pay attention to additionality. We do not need to redefine or redefine investment, but we need to trigger additional investment. There is no point in a large number of projects end up with the label 'sustainable investment', so that the Commission meets its target, but we have not made the bottom line any more.

The promised job creation is an illusion propagated by our masters in the Commission who roll out their seven year Soviet—era Gosplan in the misguided belief they know how to create economic wealth. Most of these career bureaucrats have never created a business in their life, and certainly don’t have any understanding of what they’re doing to the industrial base of Europe. This is not Schumpeter’s ‘creative destruction’ – this is a made-in-Europe version of destructive destruction. The German automotive industries already announced over 40 000 job losses due to forced conversion to electric vehicles. The promise of green new jobs reminds me of the American Major in the Vietnam War who said ‘to save a village, you first have to destroy it’.  The same economically illiterate logic is used by the EU Commission. They think they have the power to magically create new jobs once they have destroyed existing ones. The unJust Transition Fund budget of just over EUR 30 billion is meant to assist countries such as Poland and the Czech Republic. My prediction is that the number will triple as the Commission pays for the folly of the Green New Deal and is forced to rescue large swathes of Europe’s obsolete industrial base that has been intentionally destroyed.

With the European Green Deal, we want to make Europe a front—runner in climate—friendly industries but, at the same time, I am sure that climate action benefits the most vulnerable and does not leave low—income households behind. Yes, we recognise that workers in carbon—intensive activities need the required protection to be able to benefit from this transition because, ultimately, the jobs of tomorrow will require different skills and we need to make sure that our current workforce adapts, while the future workforce is prepared for these jobs. At the same time, green practices, goods and services should never be out of reach for the least well-off. I believe that we require an inclusive Just Transition based on three main pillars: participation, support and creation. Participation of affected workers and communities in planning and advancing climate action; support through targeted financial programmes and capacity building that prioritises the most vulnerable; and creation of high-quality and sustainable jobs and strong social measures, including reskilling and upskilling of workers.

I come back to the Commission's proposals: I would like to highlight two of them, which contain significant innovations. Firstly, finally, a fund with resources dedicated to making the transition socially fair, because we must attack climate change but also avoid leaving someone behind, especially in sectors that will face important industrial conversions, because sustainability must be agreed with everyone in order to be achieved. Secondly, the explicit reference in the investment plan to the opening of a debate on the demeriming of sustainable investment in the Member States from the calculation of the deficit in the Stability Pact must be grasped. I am aware of the timidity with which the reference is included in the text, but I would like to reiterate, as some of my fellow Members have already done, that this issue must be tackled with determination in order to ensure that the Member States too are able to make their essential contribution to this challenge. This is the path that Europe must take: to keep up the level of ambition on essential issues such as environmental sustainability and, at the same time, to reach out a hand to those who risk falling behind in society.

Thank you, Mr Vice-President, for presenting us today with the Sustainable Investment Plan and the Fair Transition Fund. I believe that these are two essential instruments for the European Green Pact. Two comments on this. With regard to the Fair Transition Fund, my colleagues have said, I think we must be sure that it will indeed lead to a transition. And, therefore, that criterion of conditionality, of getting out of coal and really committing to climate neutrality must be an essential component. So, first of all, I would like to ask you to have that incorporated into the Fair Transition Fund, which is a central element. We can't leave anyone behind in that. And so I think it's a good thing to put it as a real priority. And then, on the investment plan, what we know gives me the feeling that we lack a little ambition when it comes to getting resources for that investment. I think it's kind of a Juncker 3.0 plan, a little refried with national contributions. And I think that's where we need to go a little further. We need new sources of resources to be able to come up with a plan that is extremely ambitious. I doubt that with what has come to us, what we have on the table, we can reach that billion euros.

Even in richer regions, people face challenges that we would not have without coal phase-out. That is why we need to do something about this. Nor should we have the illusion that Europe can do this on its own. We also need national support, and the Commission must approve this under state aid law. We also need to talk about own resources from the ETS. That is another reason why my group is in favour of extending the ETS.

Financial support for coal-dependent regions, for example in Poland, must, of course, lead to the decarbonisation of fossil fuels and to a clear transition to renewable energy.  Secondly, and at least as importantly, people must be at the heart of the transition. A fair transition is about creating new jobs and ensuring sustainable development for those people who will eventually lose their current jobs when fossil fuel is phased out.

However, on the other hand, it is also necessary to take into account those consequences that the transition and the Green Deal will have on our industry, on our society, and in this sense I would emphasize the four principles.  First, when it comes to environmental protection and the Green Agreement, there needs to be a strong and precise assessment of the effects of regulations that need to be based on science, not ideology.  Second, it must be clearly defined how the most deprived will be helped and there is a Just Transition Fund of utmost importance.

Promoting a healthy lifestyle is of great importance. Half the population of Europe is 50+, and the other half want it to be very much. It would be good to promote a healthy lifestyle, for example by bringing VAT to 0 on fresh European fruit and vegetables – and not just organic ones – and that we should eat less meat, but european meat.

Things will get out of control, we will reach tipping points and the effects for humanity will be disastrous. If we do not shape the fourth industrial revolution that is happening right now at breakneck speed, others will shape it for us and I believe that some will be big winners, but many will lose out. So that’s the writing that we see on the wall. If you see writing on the wall, you can react in three ways. You can just ignore it and continue as is – as some seem to advocate here – you can be afraid and hide under the bed – which I would not advocate – or you can start acting. This is what the Commission is doing with the Green Deal. This is what we are doing with the Just Transition Fund. To those who say it’s not enough, you’re right, it isn’t. More efforts will be necessary. But it is a first step in the right direction and any journey starts with a first step. We will start discussing the elements with you in the next months and years so that we get it right. I want to explicitly thank President Buzek for having made this proposal.

He stood for something I believe in, which is freedom, openness and dialogue. I really would like just to mention his name here today because he deserves that and we should never forget him.  Let me end on one thing. Yes, as it was said, I am a grandson of coal miners. That’s right. But I also know the writing is on the wall for coal. There is no future in coal and, if you want to ignore that reality, you can continue subsidising mines for years and years to come, at great expense, but how are you then going to explain to people who suffer from bad air quality that more than 400 000 people in Europe die prematurely because of bad air quality and you do nothing?  Do you really believe that our children and grandchildren are looking forward to a job in a coal mine? I think they’re looking forward to other jobs and the Just Transition Fund should help bring about those other jobs in those regions that in the future will no longer be coal regions.  This is the very idea of what we’re doing and ignoring the writing on the wall – as you do – is not an option.

I think it shows that we share the same goal, the same sense of urgency, and the same aspiration for the economic transformations we are facing to be just and inclusive.  Our target is set. Now we need to work together towards a green and socially sustainable European economy. But we cannot do this alone. We can steer the policy but we need to bring European citizens and businesses along with us. We have the funding to move forward and to make sure that everybody can stay on board. We have enabling rules to guide us through this transition and we have the technical assistance to ensure that there is a strong pipeline of sustainable projects.  Coming back to some of the questions which were raised in today’s debate, there were many questions raised on the overall impact of this green transition on the European economy and whether a sustainable European investment fund and the Just Transition Mechanism are enough to deal with this. First of all, I would like to emphasise that our studies are actually showing a moderately positive impact on the economy from transition to the carbon—neutral economy. Yes, there will be jobs which will disappear like the ones in the coal industry, but the green economy will be creating many new jobs. So our task is to take this opportunity, but, at the same time, support the people and regions most affected. That’s why we have the Just Transition Mechanism and the Just Transition Fund, and yes, that’s exactly what the Commission proposed. This was also a question which was raised a number of times.

Transfering financial instruments from the Structural Funds to climate protection also goes against the principle of fairness.

It’s not an understatement to say that the recent tensions in Iraq and in the surrounding region have the potential to erase the hard-won progress of recent years, thereby affecting the lives of millions of people.  Allow me to begin this debate by stating one thing very clearly. I am committed, as High Representative, and, as the European Union, we are all committed to working to stop the current cycle of violence in Iraq, which must cease before it spirals out of control once again.  This is also why I convened an extraordinary Foreign Affairs Ministers Council on Friday – coming back from Croatia sooner than expected – from which I received a strong mandate to carry out all necessary diplomatic efforts to contribute to de—escalation in the region, support political dialogue and promote a political regional solution. These are the precise words of the conclusions of the Council. The President of the European Council and the President of the European Commission have also been fully engaged in these de—escalation efforts and this is how it should be. During the past six weeks – in fact already since last year – we have seen an increasing escalation of tension in Iraq, which culminated in the killing of Iranian General Soleimani by a US drone attack, followed by attacks by Iran against bases in Iraq housing troops fighting Daesh, which thankfully did not harm anyone. While it may appear as if, for the moment, the current situation will not escalate further, we, and I personally, have since the very beginning of this crisis been active in urging calm, restraint and de—escalation to all of the relevant parties inside and outside the region, from Iran to Iraq, the UAE, the United States, Turkey, Russia, China and others. We want to ensure that everyone with influence uses this influence to good effect and that we reach a temporary calm. Why are we so concerned about the current crisis and how it can affect the region? Well, the current situation in Iraq and the risk of further military escalation could jeopardise the substantial achievement in stability and, in particular, the fight against Daesh in recent years. The current situation could generate a number of dangerous consequences. The resumption of Daesh would have a catastrophic humanitarian impact, possibly leading to a dramatic increase in the number of displaced persons. We must avoid that at all costs. For this to occur, preserving the achievements the global coalition has won collectively in the fight against Daesh is imperative. Such a situation would also risk diverting attention from the necessary political reforms that Iraq must undertake, starting with government formation – there is still a caretaker government – and the need to tackle essential social challenges, including fighting corruption.  We have already invested significantly in Iraqi stability, reconstruction and development with the financial support of more than EUR 1.2 billion since 2014. This has focused on humanitarian aid, support for internally displaced persons, stabilisation in the liberated areas, civilian security sector reform through the CSDP EU assistance mission and supporting good governance and job creation.  We need to make sure, with our continued support, that the reforms legitimately demanded by the Iraqi citizens are delivered promptly, also bearing in mind the global commitments taken in Kuwait in February 2018 at the reconstruction conference held there. On this the EU is fully delivering on the pledges we made, with over EUR 400 million mobilised in the last two years to support governance reforms and promote sustainable job creation. The situation in Iran is also something that we continue to follow closely. We have had a number of tragic incidents, such as the Ukraine International Airlines plane crash on 8 January with 176 people on board, including a high number of EU citizens. Iran has now taken responsibility for this crash. As I said in my statement on 11 January, this was a deplorable tragedy and, once again, I want to send my condolences to the victims’ families. We expect that Iran will continue to cooperate fully and undertake a comprehensive and transparent investigation. In the same week, 59 people died in a stampede during the funeral ceremonies for General Soleimani on 6 January, and 20 individuals lost their lives on 9 January in a bus accident close to Tehran. In this case also, I convey my deepest condolences to all of them.  In the current tense situation, it is more important than ever to keep hold of the instruments that are serving to promote security and, in this context, the JCPOA remains crucial for non—proliferation purposes. A failure to preserve the deal will only add to tensions in the region. Imagine for a second what the situation would be today if Iran had nuclear weapons – and without the JCPOA they would have been able to obtain those.  On 5 January, Iran announced its fifth and, according to its own announcement, final step in the reduction of its nuclear commitments under the deal. This is a worrisome announcement, but it is important to see what the International Atomic Energy Agency reports on how Iran implements this step. As coordinator of the JCPOA, I have been in touch with all the participants on the diplomatic way forward, seeking to preserve unity in the group.  You will have heard that, earlier today, the Foreign Ministers of France, Germany and the United Kingdom invoked paragraph 36, the so-called dispute resolution mechanism, and informed me, in my capacity as coordinator, because they believe that Iran is not meeting its nuclear commitments, referring to the five steps that Iran has taken so far. As coordinator, I will guarantee that the dispute resolution mechanism provides an opportunity to address the issues indicated by France, Germany and the UK and I will oversee this process. I will be in touch with all the participants on the next steps.  I want to underline here that the dispute resolution mechanism is, first and foremost, a process to resolve issues related to the deal’s implementation. The objective of the dispute resolution mechanism will therefore be to find solutions and return to full compliance within the framework of this deal. It is not a matter of imposing sanctions, as some newspapers have been claiming since this morning.  All the remaining participants in the agreement have been clear about their determination to preserve the JCPOA. This unity is crucial and I intend to work hard to preserve it. The European Union position is clear: without this deal, we would lose a crucial element of the international non—proliferation architecture and an important contribution to regional security. A failure to preserve the deal can only add further tensions to the regions.  The time is running out. To reach de—escalation we have to witness this as a broader regional dimension. Tensions in Iraq reflect several of the region’s fractures and have the potential to affect difficult situations elsewhere in the region, from Syria to Lebanon, to Yemen and beyond. In short, the stakes are extremely high for Iraq, for the region as a whole, for the world and, of course, for us. In this context, there have already been calls for months for the European Union to play a bigger role, given that we speak to all – all means all – and we are not, as a group, perceived as having a hidden agenda. Our partners see us as standing for dialogue and peaceful and negotiated resolutions of disputes. As I mentioned at the beginning, last Friday I convened an extraordinary meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council. During the meeting, we once again reaffirmed our call for urgent de-escalation and maximum restraint. We also reaffirmed our steadfast support for Iraq’s unity, independence and territorial integrity, and underlined our commitment to our partnerships with Iraq and to our continued support for the stability and reconstruction of this country. We also underlined our joint determination to preserve the JCPOA, which we strongly believe to be in all our shared interests and the interest of the region for peace and security.  We were also very clear that a durable solution to the ongoing crisis can only be regional and that we would continue to explore the role that the European Union can play in that. So, with the strong backing of the Council and the Commission, I will personally continue to remain engaged in all of these issues, as I said, talking with everybody and travelling everywhere. I am looking forward to working with you to promote safety, security and prosperity in the region, which is strongly and dangerously jeopardised by the latest events.

After the events in Baghdad and Tehran have changed without our intervention in the last few days, we have been able to contribute to de-escalation through a large number of contacts. On the ordered killing of the head of the Qods Brigades, the US Secretary of Defense Mark Esper has issued his technical opinion on the assessment of the specific danger satisfactorion to American persons and facilities. I have nothing to add. In Iraq, the fight against ISIS is not over. For this, too, we need a functioning Iraqi state whose government is not a puppet of Tehran. I would like EU Member States to be able to continue their support for the Iraqi forces within the NATO framework or bilaterally. In this sense, you should also make use of your contacts in Iraq and, above all, thereby help secure our extensive civil reconstruction aid in the long term.

The American administration and Iran are playing with global security and, as the EU, we are faced with the possible security risks. The assassination of Iranian General Soleimani is the latest in a long series of provocations by the United States since the withdrawal from the Iranian nuclear agreement. This has created a very dangerous spiral of instability in the region. It is crucial to support the efforts of the High Representative, to de-escalate tensions and to save the nuclear deal with Iran. This is even more important since the triggering of the dispute resolution mechanism earlier today, but we must also acknowledge the diverging interest with the current US administration and the American withdrawal from the region. This for us can only mean one thing: that the time has come for a realistic debate on Europe’s strategic autonomy to safeguard our own security and interests. We offer, of course, our condolences to the families of the victims of the Ukraine International Airlines flight and urge the Iranian authorities to allow international observers to undertake a full and transparent investigation.

The withdrawal of the Americans from Syria, the Russians taking over, the elimination of Soleimani: Europe stood by and looked at it.

Iran must never become a nuclear power and I would like to thank you very much for your rapid position-taking. But this is not enough. Iraq is in danger of falling into new chaos, and IS is in danger of being freed again in that chaos. Mr. Borrell, you are someone with the right gut instinct.  So use that, and make sure that Europe has one voice, a role in the Middle East.

The upcoming elections in Iran and the US unfortunately pose an additional challenge. I hope the latest controversy over the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq will not cause more conflict and casualties. Likewise, full support for the Iran nuclear deal implies the realisation of commitments, including INSTEX, especially in the context of humanitarian trade. The European Union needs a proactive policy, proposing diplomatic solutions aimed at iran's compliance with the nuclear deal. This really contributes to peacekeeping and promoting security.

S’il fallait que je décrive à quelqu’un la position du Parlement après vous avoir écoutés, je ne saurais pas l’exprimer parce que ça va du blanc-blanc au noir-noir, et les points de vue sont très différents à propos d’une crise qui est très dangereuse pour nous tous, vous en avez tous convenu. D’abord, je voulais vous dire que personne n’a abandonné l’accord sur le nucléaire iranien. Nobody has abandoned it. It’s not me who believes that the JCPOA is essential for our security and has to be kept; it’s the Foreign Affairs Council and it is also the three Ministers of the E3 who share this point of view.  I know that there is a certain contradiction between the letter that I received signed by the Foreign Affairs Minister of the United Kingdom, and the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom saying something which looks quite different from the letter I have read, but what counts for me is the letter, which is an official document which has to follow my action. The British Minister says that the action they are proposing is not to abandon the deal and substitute the Obama deal with the Trump deal. It says that they want to keep the deal alive and what they want is to use this mechanism, this process, in order to have leverage in regard to Iran.  No, nobody has abandoned the deal. The International Atomic Energy Agency continues to monitor and inspect Iran’s nuclear activities, and let’s not forget that the JCPOA is embodied in a United Nations Security Council resolution. It’s not something that we Europeans wrote one night here together. It took 10 years to reach this deal and it was approved by a United Nations resolution, which nobody has cancelled. It is still alive. So don’t blame me and say, ‘Mr Borrell, you have to change your mind’. I’m coming here to explain not my mind – that too – but mainly what the Foreign Affairs Council, after a long debate, has decided and what the letter from the three Ministers says. We are certainly strongly committed to defending Iraq’s sovereignty, its territorial integrity and the importance of Iraqi ownership of the country’s internal political reform process. When my colleagues in the Foreign Affairs Council give me a mandate to do whatever I can, to use all the tools of diplomacy and to talk with everybody – everybody means, I say it again, everybody – in order to look for a regional political solution, I understand that it is an invitation to keep in touch with the Iraqi Government. Well, for the time being, the Iraqi Government is a caretaker government, but immediately afterwards – this meeting was on Friday – I kept in touch with the Iraqi Government, even if it is a caretaker government, and on Monday, the Vice—Minister for Foreign Affairs of Iraq was here having political consultations with the Secretary—General of the European External Action Service, and we agreed that we have to do more.  Someone asked me who can do more and how. Well, just by developing the Association Agreement that we signed, which was ratified and entered into force in 2018, just doing that is a lot of things. It is a lot of work and a lot of possibilities. We have a mission there and we can reinforce this mission. This Association Agreement opens the door to a lot of relationships on trade, economics and security, and certainly we have to decide what we are going to do from the point of view of the foreign, defence and security policy with the mission that we have there.  The soundest thing would be to reinforce it in order to help the Iraqi Government to avoid the country falling apart in any way because, after listening to all of you, I understand that all of you are completely aware of the very dramatic consequences that could come for our security if we have a crisis in Iraq similar to the one we have been witnessing in Syria.  That is why in the next days and weeks I will be engaged in a diplomatic consultation with the Iraqis and will offer our support and our help in order to continue the reform process in this country and avoid losing all the process and progress that has been made in the last years.  We can have a lot of discussions about what the future will be, but for the time being one thing is clear: Iran is not a nuclear power today thanks to the JCPOA and I don’t see how we can build an alternative agreement. I really don’t see it. Everybody talks about this deal. Some of you have been curious enough to have a look at it. It is a book like this, thick like this, full of technicalities, which it took 10 years to agree on.  I really don’t believe that it’s going to be easy to build another agreement with the same complexity, dealing, in a much more complex and conflictual environment, with the current situation. So that is why I have to insist that for us Europeans – and I am talking on behalf of the Foreign Affairs Council – we have to do whatever we can in order to make this deal survive, and for that we clearly have to push and influence the Iranians in order to fulfil all their commitments.  But let me tell you one thing that I think I already told you at the beginning. The Americans withdrew unilaterally from this deal and the Iranians have respected their obligation for 14 months without any kind of contretemps. Now they have certainly said that they don’t feel bound by the constraints of this agreement, but it is one thing not to feel bound and another to go over to the other side. There only the International Atomic Energy Agency can tell us how much and when it has happened. That’s why you have to rely on the reports from this Agency that, until now, has been a wise testimony of what is happening there. More engagement with Iraq and try to deal with all parts of the nuclear deal in order to keep it alive. I can certainly also talk about the Ukrainian plane. I can talk and try to answer all the many interesting issues that you have raised during your interventions, but unhappily it would take too long. Let me just say thank you for your contributions. I am sure we will continue to have to deal with this issue in this Parliament.

Without a doubt, no tears should be shed for General Soleimani, whose imprints remain all over conflict zones in the Middle East. Yet the dangerous escalation, brought by Soleimani’s assassination in violation of international law, pushed the region in a spiral of tragic events and led to hundredths of innocent victims. Instead of giving hope to moderation and normalisation, Trump’s ‘fire and fury’ strategy plays into the hands of emboldened military leaders and extreme hardliners.

Madam President, the European Parliament has a responsibility to speak with a strong, clear and above all united voice when it comes to human rights. Therefore, throughout the negotiations, I have tried to find the consensus that would allow us today to put to a vote a report which would be an expression of all our battles, of all our convictions and which would be carried by a very large majority. This united voice is not an end in itself but allows, in a context where we aspire to universality, to affirm our deep common respect for democracy and human rights. Human dignity, the affirmation of it, again and again must in our European Parliament go beyond the borders of political groups, be a shared value that allows us to be credible when we demand over and over again in our international relations respect for human rights. Especially since this European voice, together with other democratic voices around the world, is more than necessary in view of the content of the report on the state of democracy and human rights in the world. The report expresses its deep concern at the attacks on democracy and the rule of law. One point of particular concern to me is the rise of authoritarianism as a political project. It is also not a question of falling into the forced pessimism and the report also welcomes the fact that in a number of countries peace and democratisation processes are being implemented, as well as constitutional and judicial reforms. I would also like to stress that civil society and its commitment to democracy and human rights are now, much more than yesterday, in an encouraging sight. We support those who raise their voices to defend democratic values. However, one point remains particularly dark for humanity: the scourge of conflict and military attacks, including ethnic cleansing, continues to cause civilian deaths and mass displacement. Often, these places of extreme violence and non-law give way to the expression of the inhumanity in which men can fall. These places then become a space where cruelty and horror are lived on a daily basis. We are in the unspeakable. Each of us, all of us, has a human obligation to denounce this loud and clear, and as Members of this Parliament we have a political obligation to provoke action against this human misery. The report also highlights the issue of the rights of indigenous peoples, who are often violated, even though national and international laws protect them. It stresses the importance of advancing gender equality and the rights of women and girls around the world. Women and children are in fragile environments and are most likely to be victims of violence, most vulnerable to abuse and shameless exploitation. The report pays particular attention to freedom of speech and expression, as well as media pluralism, which are at the heart of truly democratic societies. It deplores the injustice of human rights defenders, including academics, journalists and politicians. It denounces the murders committed as well as the application of the death penalty, persecution and arbitrary imprisonment. The report stresses that trade and human rights can and must strengthen each other and stresses corporate responsibility. It fully supports human rights dialogues with third countries in the promotion and protection of human rights. Last but not least, he stresses that the right to freedom of thought, conscience, religion and belief must be guaranteed throughout the world and preserved unconditionally.

Thank you to the rapporteur, Ms Isabel Wiseler—Lima, for her work. I have to start by saying that human rights and democracy are and must remain at the heart of our work. It’s part of our DNA. At the very first Foreign Affairs Council meeting I chaired in December, we discussed with all EU foreign ministers our collective efforts to protect and promote human rights and democracy, taking into account the worrying trends, including shrinking space for civil society and increasing attacks on human rights defenders. The ministers agreed on the political appropriateness of establishing an EU global human rights sanction regime, and work on this is being taken forward in the Council and we hope to move forward as quickly as possible. This global human rights sanction regime is one of the targets, one of the purposes, objectives that we, all together, have to try to achieve as soon as possible. On my second day in office, I engaged with grassroots environmental human rights defenders from around the world at the Human Rights Forum, focusing on how to build a fair environment for the future. Many of the issues that you address in your Annual Report on Human Rights and Democracy, which was adopted in May last year, were already addressed in this report. And we delivered and streamlined a report using concrete country—specific examples. We are fully aware of the strong interlinkages between the two reports and for the next EU annual report, covering 2019, we are aiming for a timely adoption this spring. Your report calls for a more effective EU human rights foreign policy. It’s a welcome contribution to the ongoing work on the new Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy. This will be a roadmap setting the EU level of ambition and priorities for the next five years and it will reflect the transition to a digital world and the changing geopolitical dynamics. Human rights and democracy are and should continue to be at the centre of our relations with third countries. The European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR) is the largest financial instrument in the world dedicated specifically to human rights and democracy and payments for EUR 135 million were made under this flagship in 2018. Let me give some examples: the 2018 global call for proposal led to the selection of five projects on LGBTI rights and there was EUR 70 million to spend on that. They cover such difficult countries on this subject like Russia, Malawi, Zimbabwe, Guatemala, Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Colombia and Peru. This project supported capacity—building of specialised NGOs and offered legal aid to victims of LGBTI—related human rights violations and to human rights defenders. Beyond development cooperation, your report correctly points out that trade and economic policies should be linked to political dialogue and that human rights violations should be fully taken into consideration in any action that the European Union is undertaking. You are very well aware of our human rights guidelines, the regular dialogues and a strong public diplomacy. We have a special representative for human rights that has reached out to governments and civil society globally and his leadership has already raised considerably the profile of the European Union human rights policy. In particular, the European Union has contributed to moving forward on rights of the child and, together with a group of Latin American and Caribbean countries, we have been tabling three resolutions on the right of the child. Two were presented during the March session of the Human Rights Council. One concerned the 30th anniversary of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and the second focused on empowering children with disabilities so that they can enjoy their human rights, including the right to inclusive education. Your report also correctly draws attention to the rising backlash against women’s rights worldwide. The EU remains strongly committed to the full enjoyment of human rights by all. Our broad commitment to gender equality and women’s empowerment is demonstrated, in particular, by our Spotlight Initiative on ending violence against women and girls, signed in September 2017 in New York. This initiative is backed by a substantive EUR 500 million investment over the period 2018—2024. Two pillars were implemented: the Latin American pillar against the gender—motivated killing of women and the sub—Saharan pillar to prevent and eliminate sexual and gender—based violence and harmful practices. These need to remain at the forefront of our efforts, particularly in view of the 25th anniversary of the World Conference on Women and the Beijing Declaration. Also, your report welcomes the Council conclusions on democracy of last October and highlights the significance of transparent, inclusive and credible elections. This requires me to thank the Member States – and also the Members of this Parliament – who have joined our election observation missions. This election observation mission structure is a good example of how our institutions are working efficiently together. I don’t want to read the whole list of those missions, but I just want to point out some of them: Salvador, Kosovo, Malawi, Mozambique, Nigeria, Senegal, Sri Lanka and Tunisia. I am sorry that we were not in the last elections in Bolivia. We are going to mend that and will continue to do such important work in order to defend the basis of the human rights, which is an efficient democracy.  Let me say that this exchange of views was very useful.

This is our commitment and our responsibility, and it will be the task of future relations to go into more substance, to make this a crucial issue of our identity, without ifs and buts, in order to really win the challenge in the world on human rights, also making strong choices – I imagine at the next G20 in Riyadh – to condition our participation in that meeting to put the issue of human rights also in a large country like Saudi Arabia.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 327, "date": "2020-01-14.json", "name": "Charles GOERENS", "mepid": "840", "text": "  on behalf of the Renew Group. Madam President, the annual discussion we have on the human rights report contains a risk: that of the routine settling into our debates when they deal with respect for human rights in the world. There is a risk of making the same observations, of resorting to formulas that are similar from one year to the next and of always renewing the same hopes. Today, it is different. This concern is quickly brushed aside. We have before us a well-thought-out, well-structured report, as precise as possible. The report presented to us by Mrs Wiseler-Lima is an essential reference for the weeks, months and perhaps years to come in terms of discussion of human rights. It covers almost all subjects without getting too lost in the details. It also addresses the heavy trends that condition respect for human rights in the world and among these heavy trends, it regrets, of course, the decline of multilateralism. The retreat of multilateralism means a betrayal of a proven method and abandonment of a human rights achievement. We can see that some countries of the European Union, the Council of Europe and within the Atlantic Alliance have allowed themselves to be led in this drift. It is particularly unfortunate to find among them the very members of the European Union. Finally, as I have little time, I would like to ask the Commission what consequences it intends to set aside for our proposals. Last year I presented a report on the ban on forced marriages and underage marriages and we, as the European Parliament, voted overwhelmingly to make the ban on underage marriage and forced marriages an element of conditionality in our approach to external relations.

So many questions. Let me start by answering a very concrete question about our Special Envoy for Freedom of Belief: yes, we have a special envoy – Ján Figeľ. President Juncker created the function and appointed Ján Figeľ in May 2016. He supports implementation of the European Union Guidelines on promoting and protection of freedom of belief, as the name of his mandate says. He is engaged in visiting countries where the freedom of belief is at risk, engaging with national authorities and institutions, human rights organisations and religious leaders and communities. He participates in dialogue with them and promotes respect for diversity. It is a little bit of a reiteration – I’m saying the same thing in different ways – but that is what he’s doing, and he also serves as Special Adviser to the Commissioner for Development Cooperation. I cannot remember who asked the question – they are no longer here – but this is the answer I can provide to him: I will review the job, the mandate, of this special envoy and see how we can improve it, and what is the justification of this job. The subject requires for sure for someone to take care of it, but I will learn more about it; to tell the truth, I was not aware of the existence of this Special Envoy for the Protection of Freedom and Belief. Maybe next time I will be able to give more information. The other big issue that has been raised is business and human rights. It is a big issue for sure, and someone has been saying that Western consumers are very happy to consume cheaper goods without paying a lot of attention to the way these lower costs have been obtained. Why is it cheaper? Is the production procedure more efficient, or is it because the human rights of the workers are not respected as we require them to be respected in our economic system? The European Union is maybe the most engaged organisation in the world on this issue – to address human rights abuses connected to the activities of business entities. We have binding schemes in areas such as trade in diamonds and other conflict minerals, export controls on torture goods, and schemes against trade in lethal injections and the work of the child. I can give you examples of what we have been doing: we have some agreements with Asia-Pacific for close cooperation on business and human rights in Asia, where we have been investing more than EUR 5 million on this programme, and we have a similar project ongoing in Latin America. But we need to do more. We need to build up the necessary consensus. I don’t have a mandate to work more on that, so I count on the right of initiative of Parliament – you have it, use it – to help me in this task, in which I am very interested. You have capacities: use these capacities, because, as you know, I am only the representative of a set of people who very often don’t agree on every issue. In order to have a mandate, it would be very useful if Parliament used its right of initiative in order to build a European Union binding treaty. I think this is a very important issue – maybe the most important one worldwide. What other issues have been pointed out by you? Many of them. Due diligence legislation: yes, we have called for further EU due diligence legislation during the previous mandate, and some Member States such as France and Netherlands have adopted their own national legislation, but others have not done this. Once again, when you deal with a subject which is highly divisive, and when you don’t have an agreement among Member States, it is difficult to advance in something even if you are strongly convinced that this is needed. Here again, we can build an alliance between Parliament and the High Representative in order to push things that I, myself, do not have enough capacity to develop.

Mr. Borrell, you have named the tools: we have the observation missions, we have your action, that of a representative for human rights and for freedom of religion. You said, 'What are you asking us?'. There are certain things that have come up every time during all these negotiations while we are working on this report: we must not let people who are guilty in the field of human rights go unpunished, they must be prosecuted, there must be a follow-up. We have to do everything we can in that direction. We must also insist on multilateralism, insist that trade be done in a way that we can be proud of. In that sense, I would like to talk about the follow-up mechanism that should be when we talk about trade because asking for certain things to be done is one thing, monitoring is another.

The first two weeks of this new year have reminded us that the European Union’s security environment is today more volatile, more unpredictable, more complex and more ambiguous than at any time since the end of the Cold War. Let me underline the three main findings of my annual CFSP report.  Firstly, multilateralism is at stake. In such challenging times, where multilateralism is increasingly called into question, we – as a European Union – must take a firm stand against this trend, putting multilateralism at the core of our efforts to prevent and resolve conflicts. In the current setting, the CFSP must effectively promote our interests and values in our neighbourhood and around the whole world. We should take advantage of the new political cycle of our institutions to build a stronger, more proactive and strategic European Union.  Secondly, reinforcing the European Parliament as a pillar of the CFSP: during the past legislature, this European Parliament has played a prominent role in mediation in the peaceful resolution of protracted conflicts. Our efforts were successful, for instance, in Ukraine and in North Macedonia. These efforts, especially in the framework of the Jean Monnet Dialogue, should remain a priority in the upcoming years. We should also strengthen our role and oversight and scrutiny of the CFSP – but also, of course, of the EU external instruments. In this context, we must aim for a more strategic approach and greater coherence, consistency and complementarity between the external financial instruments and the common foreign and security policy.  Thirdly, strengthening the CFSP to counter global threats: I am, for example, convinced that qualified majority voting would make the EU’s foreign and security policy more effective and speed up the decision—making process. The need for unanimity is keeping us from being able to act credibly on the global stage. On the EU’s common security and defence policy, we need to strengthen capacity on EU— and Member State—level to act autonomously, as well as to foster partnerships with regional organisations. The announcement by the Commission President to build a genuine and operational European defence union within the next five years is welcome.  Finally, no single EU Member State can respond effectively to today’s global challenges on its own. We must continue to promote our European values whilst staying committed to a rules-based international order and economic cooperation. The European Union is a major player when it comes to diplomacy, trade, development cooperation, humanitarian aid and – step by step – also in the field of security and defence. Our European Union should act strategically by using its wide array of policies and instruments to respond to the challenges in our direct neighbourhood and beyond. The time has come, as the EU, to take our destiny into our own hands and embrace our role as a fully-fledged sovereign political and economic power in international relations, and I can only commend what the High Representative/Vice President has announced in the first weeks in office. I think he has a huge support here in the European Parliament. Finally, I would like to thank all our colleagues for their good contributions – especially, of course, the shadow rapporteurs – for a very good and fruitful cooperation.

Madam President, Mr High Representative, let me first of all sincerely thank all the shadow rapporteurs who, whatever their political groups and sometimes strong differences, have all sought to make substantial contributions to this annual report. This has given rise to some rather passionate exchanges, but I take this as a mark of interest for a subject that has not always aroused so much in this Chamber. In my opinion, there is room for a realistic picture of the defence situation and for pragmatic proposals for improvement. It is in any case in this spirit that I have drawn up this report, which has nevertheless been much amended. The realism of the observation is to insist on the profound degradation of our security environment. Our entire neighbourhood is in crisis; I will not go into detail on the conflicts in Syria, Libya, or Ukraine, on jihadist attacks in Europe itself, in the Horn of Africa, in the Sahel and on the boiling Middle East. The crises are simultaneous, more and more interconnected and all unfortunately reflect the desolate image of a Europe relatively powerless to contain them. The extreme volatility of the situation at our doorstep should upset our certainties and comfort, because even our alliances and partnerships are less reliable. Recent examples in the Middle East illustrate this dramatically. Many hope that this confusion is only a bad time to pass, only an unfortunate parenthesis. Maybe, but maybe not, and to tell the truth, I'd even be tempted to say, probably not. It seems to me irresponsible today when we are Europeans to think that our security will continue to be ensured eternally by others, without a substantial effort to assume our own responsibilities. The realism of the observation is therefore also that of a relative European failure to influence events, we should find ourselves around pragmatic recommendations so that Europeans can finally act and not just be outraged, condemned, deplored and commented on. Pragmatism is to be ambitious without having vain chimeras. Member States are and will remain the key players in defence. But pragmatism is also about recognising that none of them, even the most active and ambitious - and it is a Frenchman who tells you - can face the magnitude of the task alone, and you illustrated this again yesterday in Pau, Mr High Representative, about the Sahel. European collective instruments are therefore needed and support for recent initiatives must be affirmed, but we will have to be clear:01 these arrangements (European Defence Fund, permanent structured cooperation) will not in themselves make a major strategic difference in the short or even the medium term. The real question of this debate is finally relatively simple to ask: are we Europeans satisfied to be merely spectators, substitutes, even beggars of international security in the face of global and regional powers without complexes or do we finally want to be actors and give ourselves the means. I know how much debate is being debated about the concept of strategic autonomy. I just want to highlight two non-exhaustive points about this concept. First of all, it is obviously an ambition to be built and not an absolute reality today. Secondly, being autonomous does not mean putting an end to alliances or partnerships, quite the contrary, but being able to assess for themselves situations of crisis and to be able, if necessary, to respond to them alone by providing an answer in line with our interests and priorities. To see that security priorities for us Europeans are sometimes not exactly the same as those of our non-European allies is not a shameful disease, it is not a rupture, we must be able to assume it. At the beginning of the mandate, there is much talk in the Chamber of climate emergency, environmental emergency and social emergency, it seems to me that it is also urgent to consider our strategic posture and to work on it in a credible way.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 358, "date": "2020-01-14.json", "name": "Josep BORRELL FONTELLES", "mepid": "28267", "text": "   vice-président de la Commission et haut représentant de l’Union pour les affaires étrangères et la politique de sécurité. – Madame la Présidente, merci beaucoup Monsieur McAllister et Monsieur Danjean, pour le travail que vous avez fait. Nous préparons ces rapports sur la PESC (Politique étrangère et de sécurité commune) et la PSDC (Politique de sécurité et de défense commune). Permettez-moi de commencer avec le rapport PESC. Tout d’abord, je suis heureux de voir que nous continuons à porter ces valeurs au centre de notre action. Nous sommes et nous devons continuer à être une puissance basée sur des principes, et le multilatéralisme est un ordre international basé sur des règles, c’est la base de notre politique étrangère. I am also pleased that you recognise that we need to be more assertive. We now have to prove that we need to be more assertive with respect to Libya, with respect to almost everywhere, in terms of the problems we are facing. We need to be more assertive in protecting our vital interests. We live in a world of power politics and we need a truly integrated foreign policy that combines the power of Member States with the coordinated mobilisation of our instruments, and as your report states, we need to strengthen the links between internal and external policies. This has been said many times. It is good to repeat it; it would be much better to implement it. I welcome the emphasis you put on the importance of securing adequate financial resources. For external action under the next Multiannual Financial Framework, we are going to see soon if it is possible or not. In particular, we need to preserve the envelopes for the neighbourhood and sub-Saharan Africa in the new proposed instrument. Yesterday I was with the President of the French Republic and with the Presidents of the five Saharan countries, and the issue of the resources that we need in order to help them to face their security problems – which are our security problems – was on the table. I wonder if the answer we are going to be able to give to them the next day is good enough. Partnership: you rightly point out that for everything we want to do, we need partners. We want to be multilateral, but one cannot be multilateral alone. To dance the tango you need two; to be multilateral you need several. We need to link up with like-minded allies, with the regional blocs like the African Union or ASEAN, and above all, the United Nations. Take, for instance, climate change. The Council asked me at the last meeting of the European Council to develop a strong climate diplomacy in order to ensure that our climate ambitions can be shared in partnership with other states in the world, because if not, our efforts will be completely useless. We must engage with others in order to ensure that they are on board in our climate action in order for it to be really successful. Credibility: it’s clear that we will lose credibility as a geopolitical power if we cannot deliver stability and security in our immediate vicinity. If we are not able to solve or help to solve the problems of Libya or the Western Balkans, it’s going to be quite difficult to convince anyone that we are a geopolitical power. It’s clear that we must step up our support to Kenyan sovereignty and resilience. On Kosovo, we haven’t been able to travel to Kosovo because Kosovars don’t have a government, but even if they do not have a government by the end of the next month, we will have to travel to Kosovo and Serbia in order to reiterate our commitment to the European perspective for the entire region. We have some complicated relations with some of our other neighbours. Recent activities by Turkey affected the security and the interests of our Member States in the wider region and are of real concern. The central Mediterranean is suffering an extraordinary change from a geopolitical point of view, and some actors like Russia and Turkey, which were not showing up there six months ago, are now taking the lead in trying to solve this problem. You have to pay special attention, you are right, to the southern neighbourhood – Libya, Iran, Iraq – which are protagonising the debate today. We have been at the forefront of efforts aimed at de-escalation, but in the end, who is sitting at the table with Sarraj and Haftar in order to try to reach an agreement on the ceasefire is not the European Union, it’s Russia and Turkey. Africa: let’s talk a lot about Africa, a continent of both promises and challenges. The Council mandated the High Representative and the Commission to present, by the June meeting, a comprehensive action plan for Africa, and believe me, from now till June there’s not too much time to build this comprehensive action plan with Africa, because we cannot do it alone. We cannot have a plan for Africa without the Africans. It started in the Sahel, and President Macron yesterday called a very interesting meeting, asking the G5 countries of the Sahel to come and to talk about what we can do together, much as we will do the same thing in our college meeting with the African Union in Addis Ababa next February. Latin America: Latin America is burning, from Chile to Mexico. There are a lot of great difficulties there, and we should work to strengthen our cooperation. To pursue our interest in Asia, which remains stable and prosperous, maybe the most stable and prosperous region in the world today. Tomorrow we will be travelling to New Delhi to attend the Raisina Dialogue and strengthen our strategic partnership with India, and also we will do that soon with China, to prepare the summit. CSDP: the CSDP report, which addresses the impressive development of the Union’s common security and defence policy on the challenges that lie ahead. Here the urgency is clear. In a geopolitical world, the EU has no choice but to strengthen its capacities to protect itself and become a more credible security provider. The beating heart of the CSDP are today the 17 missions and operations deployed in different regions beyond our borders. And I have to salute the enthusiasm and devotion of the thousand men and women who are serving the European Union Flag in sometimes dangerous circumstances. In your report you point out, rightly, that we need to address persistent structural issues that are affecting our missions. We need to make sure that the CSDP missions become more robust, both in terms of human resources and of their mandate. I welcome the political support for the creation of the proposed off-budget European Peace Facility, designated to help our partners to take care of their own security by building their own capabilities. This is important when it’s again, for example, in the Sahel countries. Taking a greater role in the world requires developing what is called a ‘strategic autonomy’: some words that are sometimes conflictual, and not everybody understands them in the same way. This is a sensitive term, but in this context it essentially means that we have to strengthen our capacity to act with partners where possible, alone if necessary. And your report highlights that this does not mean that the European Union is forsaking its partnership; on the contrary, it will make the European Union itself a stronger global partner, and it will also benefit NATO, because a stronger European Union and a stronger NATO go hand in hand. Let me highlight the importance of the Permanent Structured Cooperation and European Defence Fund. You, the Parliament, will have to decide the amount of resources devoted to this defence fund as much as to the Peace Facility, which will be the cornerstone of our future CSDP projects. Many things can be said about what we are trying to do, and your report covers them very well. I can say that I agree a lot with everything you present in this report. I just want to stress the importance of the new frontiers of artificial intelligence, which will have geopolitical implications by empowering both competing state and hostile non-state actors. We need to remain in the lead, both in the global discussions on norms and rules as well as in the development and application of all technologies to promote our own security. I’m sure Europeans are not aware of how important this issue is: what are going to be the consequences of the developing of artificial intelligence technologies for our security in the future to come? Not a long-range future; the next five years will be decisive for that. Space and maritime are other strategic sectors where we need to ensure our coordinated use of different European Union internal and external policies and instruments. Here I would like to highlight, as your report does, that the European Union Satellite Centre will require relevant structural funding, especially from the European Union budget, to maintain its contribution to our actions. It’s becoming quite impossible to believe that we can develop actions all over the world if we are not able to observe how the world is. We have a satellite centre that cannot be lacking resources in order to fulfil its mission. In conclusion, the stakes are high and the challenges formidable. We need to keep the momentum on strengthening our common security and defence policy, and there are some problems in our immediate neighbourhood and the immediate future that will represent some proof of the capacity and the willingness of the European Union Member States to play this role. Libya: let me give this example. Just imagine that there is a ceasefire, and in Berlin we get an agreement in order to build a political solution – let’s imagine. But any ceasefire can last not a couple of weeks without a strong monitoring procedure. Are we going to be ready to do so? That’s a question that we will have to answer in the near future.

First of all, I would like to thank Mr McAllister, our rapporteur on foreign policy, for his work on this report, with which we have been able to work side by side.  These two reports are made from the absolute realization that the world facing Europe today, which is addressing Europe, is different from that which had developed over the last few decades. Competition between great powers is threatening our way of understanding the world: a world based on rules, multilateral structures, which believes that cooperating is better than competing and that rules go hand in hand with cooperation and dialogue. In the face of this finding, Europe must decide to take its own fate into its own hands. And so we make a strategic commitment, for our autonomy, for our sovereignty as a continent, to have our own capacities to defend ourselves and enforce our interests and values. It seems that Europe today is a herbivorous continent in a world of carnivores. In this reality, what it must do is mobilize sufficient resources, have new defence capabilities, also strengthen its partnerships, especially with Africa and Latin America, and coordinate its efforts, all of them those of states and those of the European Union.

This includes the areas of foreign policy, development cooperation and foreign trade, as well as security and defence policy.  Quite a lot has been done in the CSDP compared with some years ago, but more needs to be done, and this idea of common EU defence needs to be taken seriously by all EU Member States. With EU strategic autonomy being the goal, the EU can and should greatly contribute to the strengthening of European and transatlantic security. The EU must work together with NATO and like-minded partners. To have stronger EU defence does not mean undermining NATO: a stronger EU is a stronger partner for NATO, be it by bringing about more European military capabilities, investments in defence technology invention, or by some other means. Taking into account the size and capabilities of the EU, it is only elementary that it should be able to defend itself. Also for that reason, very good cooperation with NATO, the US, Canada and others is extremely important.  But to be able to defend the principles of international law and multilateralism that form the basis of the EU defence and security dimension in its international relations, the EU must have also a military capability. So the EU, in its defence policy, must aim to have everything from military capabilities in personnel and technological capabilities to an effective defence industry. This requires enough financial contributions and overcoming political disagreements, otherwise we will not have a say in matters next to big players like the US, China, Russia and other rising powers.

Nothing, perhaps, is closer to the bone of national sovereignty than our national armed forces – so increasingly, of course, the EU wants to bring them under its control. I also recognise that the top strategic priority for both the UK and the European democracies must surely be the continued, wholehearted commitment of the United States to our security and defence through NATO. My concerns on both these points were the reason that I have led the opposition to CSDP – what some might call the EU army – throughout my time in this Parliament. The reports before us advocate qualified majority voting on matters which should be national prerogatives. We find that Mr Danjean’s report is all about ‘strategic autonomy’. Basically, this means ‘separate from the United States’. It gives little thought to the implications of this; it pays lip service to NATO; it devotes one paragraph to the United Kingdom, the leading military power in Europe; it seeks a European defence union – at a stroke, the separation of Europe from our transatlantic allies, otherwise what would be the point?  The lessons of the past have not been learned. We all need to enhance our national military capabilities. We all need to be more capable and willing allies. We all need to do better in explaining the need for strong and credible defence to our citizens, but that democracies need to stand in solidarity in the great NATO alliance and not build alternative structures that will deliberately lead to division.

In the field of defence, Member States have a strong mandate and do not share a common understanding of European defence.

Our Union started off as – and continues to be – primarily a peace project. In the area of defence, we are a bit of a late starter and that’s probably why there still appear to be colleagues who are very uncomfortable with discussing defence and the European Union in the same sentence.  I believe there are at least two different strains of critics of the EU’s defence ambitions. First, there are good people who seemed to sincerely believe that all conflicts in the world can be resolved without any use of military force at all. Secondly, there are those who insist that the EU should leave all military operations to the Atlantic Alliance. I do not believe in the first category, and as to the second, well, while I do believe it’s preferable, when possible, to act in unison with our friends and allies on the other side of the Atlantic, I’m afraid that there will be occasions when we have to act on own, and so we also need the means to be able to do so. In this Chamber, I’ve heard many colleagues lament the limited role our Union plays in helping to resolve the world’s crisis and conflicts. The limited ability to play a role is in remarkable contrast with the ambition we have expressed, including in our global strategy. Being able to meet our ambition is dependent on us having the necessary capabilities, which do not come for free. They don’t even come cheap. So if we really do not want our calls for a greater role in global affairs to ring empty, we will have to be ready to provide the necessary resources.

I would like to congratulate Mr David McAllister and Mr Arnaud Danjean on the excellent reports that they have done. In these first reports, the European Parliament clearly recognises and explicitly underlines that no European country is able by itself to address the foreign policy and security challenges we are facing. For me, the key issue in this regard is EU relations with the Western Balkans. Apart from the overall common foreign and security policy objectives, we should guide these countries towards the accession they deserve. In the meantime, we continue with the common security and defence missions, such as Operation Althea (EUFOR) in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It’s a first European mission that works well on our continent and plays a pivotal role for the security and stability of the EU and the European continent as a whole. We as a Parliament should do everything within our possibilities to show our support for the region’s European perspective, and in this regard, we should strengthen Parliament’s involvement in the external financial instruments. As the co-rapporteur of the Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance (IPA) III, I strongly advocate that Parliament needs an improved oversight and increased role during the scrutiny and the steering of the programmes. In our immediate neighbourhood, the Western Balkans region belongs in the European Union and it’s a security issue. It’s about time that our institution embraced that fact and works towards this enlargement and to finish the business that has been started.

But what is crucial is not only that Europe cooperates more closely in the field of defence, but also how it does, and there are already differences here. I cannot understand at all, for example, why the intensification of cooperation should be accompanied by a drastic increase in the cost of armaments. First of all, THE military expenditure of the EU states is already many times that of Russia's military expenditure. Secondly, if European arms cooperation is to be more efficient than parallel national development, why do we need even more money for armaments than we do today?

Madam President, I thank the two rapporteurs. I think these are two very interesting contributions to the great debate on the European Union's foreign security policy. Someone said, 'You were sitting there, you changed places.' Yes, this is the Commission, this is the Council, and you are well aware that the High Representative is both someone who represents the Council and someone who sits on the Commission. Therefore, as long as that is the case, I will have to change places and that is not the case, we will have to change the treaties and, believe me, we will not do it tonight because it takes a little longer. I do not understand some Members who are afraid that we will build a monster in the service of multinationals or that we are going straight to the federalist cliff: today, whether we like it or not, the Commission, a federalising body, or at least a Community body, has no competence in foreign and defence policy. You could say: it is strange, if it does not have the competences, why was the Defence Union created? Because the Defence Union has nothing to do with defence policy but with defence industrial policy. It is based on defence and the defence industry, but defence is still a separate thing. So, like it or not, today we are in a world where the common foreign policy is managed unanimously by the Council. It is still a far cry from what you call \"federal.\" What kind of federalism is that?  The same goes for defence policy. I do not understand the fear that some people have when they say, ''We are going to rush into the black hole of federalism'. We're a long way from that. I believe that the European Union needs to deepen the dimension of its capacity to act together in the world. I honestly believe that, but I think some members of this Parliament do not believe it. Frankly, I believe in it and I defended it when I ran for the position. I believe that we Europeans, through our Union, must be able to have a more determined and stronger action on the international stage, and that is why we are trying to work together, by defining a common policy. However, common does not mean unique. Remember, when we had the common currency, it was not unique. We had the shield and everyone still had their change. For some things we worked together and for others, each at home. How long did it take Europe to move from the common currency to the single currency? How long did it take for Member States to renounce monetary sovereignty? Twenty years? More than that. And money, while being a symbol of sovereignty, is not even the strongest symbol.  Defence, peace or war, international relations, the defence of the interests of every country in the world, all this is much closer to sovereignty. It is therefore not surprising that it takes time to move from the common policy to the single one. This report shows us very well what the difficulties are and, believe me, I was confronted with them in person. When we try to discuss a subject as close to us as the situation in Libya, we immediately find different national positions. And that's where our weakness lies. It will certainly be a long road, but in my opinion we must build common capacities in order to have the opportunity to decide, not unanimously, but by qualified majority. These reports show a bit of a way with all the difficulties. That is why I welcome them and thank the authors. I hope to have the opportunity to discuss this further and directly because the future of Europe will be built around its capacity to act in the world. It is impossible to believe that we will solve problems within our borders.  Everything requires action to the rest of the world. Everything: climate change, migration, today everything is geopolitical, that's the buzzword. And it's true, everything is geopolitical. And to be a true geopolitical player, you have to have powerful military and diplomatic capabilities. It is often said that you have to choose between being an \"actor\" (player) or a playfield. I think, for my part, that we are an actor, but an actor in search of identity. We don't know yet what kind of actor we want to be. It is through such reports that this existential question for the future of the Union can be deepened. I thank all the Members who wanted to participate in this debate.

Madam President, thank you to all the colleagues who took part in this debate. There have been many interesting contributions I regret that some interventions are always marked by a kind of trial of intent. I find that our reports are not ideological relationships. These are rather pragmatic reports that point the finger at a reality, which is that of an extremely troubled world, in which Europe must be able to play a role, including on the military level. I hear colleagues indignant at the militarisation of the European Union: it is a fable, it is a view of the mind! I hear a colleague say that we need to rebalance things between the civilian and the military in the common security and defence policy. But if we rebalance the civilian and the military in the common defence security policy, we must do a lot more military because today, the common security and defence policy is almost exclusively civilian! We have 11 civilian missions in the CSDP and five are military, so we have to be careful what we say. The reality is not exactly what has been described by some colleagues and it is a bit of a pity because, once again, I have acquired my convictions on this subject in contact with reality, exercising modest responsibilities but in just about every crisis area in which the European Union is present. I see everywhere the need for Europe but for Europe in the form of its Member States, in the form of the Commission, in the form of joint troops or national troops. I was going to say, whatever, let's be pragmatic. But there is a need for Europe. To my colleagues who are concerned about decoupling with NATO: no one replaces NATO in terms of collective security, but on the other hand there are places where NATO cannot intervene or places where NATO has no interest in intervening. I hear, earlier this week, President Trump announce that American troops will drastically withdraw from Africa, thus Somalia, Mali, Niger. And we have to rely on the Americans? Of course we have to be able to take on responsibilities on our own, that is exactly what I said in my opening remarks. There are places where priorities are not the same, that does not mean that we are not allies or that a historical relationship is being challenged. It is simply common sense that Europe must be able to affirm, display and assume its priorities and interests where others are not able to do so alongside us. This seems to me to be a matter of course and common sense, and if we do not want to disappear from the geopolitical map, it is a responsibility that we must assume.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 408, "date": "2020-01-14.json", "name": "Lívia JÁRÓKA", "mepid": "28141", "text": "  The debate is over.

Quizá en los próximos días podamos tener algún rayo de esperanza, pero desde las Navidades los ataques de las fuerzas de Haftar se han intensificado, los bombardeos sobre áreas civiles también. La matanza de treinta militares cadetes en la escuela militar de Trípoli. Condenamos este ataque. Pero nos pasamos el día condenando ataques. Y el coste humano de esta guerra por delegación está empezando a ser insoportable para el pueblo libio. Bueno, hace tiempo que es insoportable. Hay trescientas cincuenta mil personas desplazadas en el entorno de Trípoli, miles de combatientes, trescientos civiles muertos, ataques a hospitales, incluyendo personal sanitario y ambulancias, doscientas cincuenta escuelas cerradas. The war has been fuelled by several external players sending more weapons and mercenaries every day. It is no longer the war without warriors, as it was called at the beginning – a war without warriors. No – now there are a lot of warriors coming from many different countries, and it has become expanding and escalating, augmenting the risk of terrorism, regional instability, migration in our borders. The United Nations special envoy, Mr Salamé, came on Friday to the Foreign Affairs Council, and he said that no other conflict ever saw a gap between nice words and helpful actions so wide as in Libya. Since April, the United Nations Security Council met 15 times to discuss about Libya and failed 15 times to call for a ceasefire. The Security Council: 15 times. But as I said, there is hope that a ceasefire maybe can enter into force. We hoped it was going to enter into force yesterday, but this morning we knew that there was no agreement in Moscow and that General Haftar left Moscow without giving his agreement to this ceasefire. We have been repeating many times that the Europeans have to overcome our divisions, our rivalries, and that we have to be more united in order to face the situation. Germany is about to announce (I don’t know if it has already formally announced – there were some rumours that it was going to be announced today, but I don’t know exactly) if there is a formal call for the Berlin Conference for next Sunday, after months of preparations, in which we have actively taken part. It should give way to a roadmap for the consolidation of the ceasefire, de-escalation and a return to political negotiations. This could be a good occasion. The Special Envoy was coming here on Friday, Prime Minister Sarraj of the internationally-recognised government was in Brussels. He visited President Sassoli and President Michel; we passed the same message. It was impossible to have a meeting with the other party, with General Haftar. We have been talking with several regional colleagues – Egyptian, Russian and Turkish counterparts. Everybody seems at least a bit concerned that things in Libya are getting out of control. But I cannot assure you that the ceasefire will take place and that the Berlin Conference will take place next Sunday. At the last Foreign Affairs Council, I called for talks about Libya and Iran. We strongly supported the Berlin process. We tried to travel to Libya, but it was not possible due to security reasons; I wonder if it was really for security reasons or there was a lack of will to receive us. The fact is that we had to meet here in Brussels, where we had the visit of Sarraj but not the one from Haftar. Now we have a mandate from the Foreign Affairs Council to strongly engage with all parties. If there is a ceasefire, and if there is an agreement on the framework of the Berlin process, then we will have to deal with monitoring the ceasefire and effectively controlling the arms embargo. But I wonder who is going to do that seriously. We are spending a lot of money in Libya: more than 630 million in cooperation in the last five years. The African Union-United Nations agencies have been able to evacuate more than 5 000 people needing international protection and sent over 50 000 migrants back home voluntarily, with reintegration support. But there are 700 000 sub—Saharan people in Libya. Not all of them want to go to Europe; most of them have a job and a livelihood, and they prefer to stay in Libya as far as the conditions allow them to do so. But if the situation becomes worse and it is impossible for them to stay in Libya, maybe they can try to go to Europe. So there is another threat of a push of illegal migration through the central Mediterranean, where the Turks and the Russians are taking the lead. Six months ago in the central Mediterranean these two actors were not present, but today they take the lead, and this is a big change in the geopolitical structure in the Mediterranean basin. Six months ago we Europeans were more or less active but we were alone. Now, we are still more or less active – more active today then six months ago – but in fact the Russians and the Turks are having a strong leverage because they have engaged militarily on the ground. Not directly, not through the regular army, but everybody knows that the flow of arms is increasing, and Libya is a kind of cancer which has been metastasizing to Sahel. What’s happening in Sahel has a lot to do with the fact that the big amount of arms and the fighters in Libya are contaminating the whole area. Now intelligence reports tell us that a lot of Sudanese, Syrian and people coming from the Middle East are arriving in Libya to fight on one side or the other. This is the situation. Maybe we will have good news in the next 24 hours, maybe not. Maybe the Germans will call for the conference, maybe not. Maybe we are going to have a ceasefire, maybe not. I really don’t know. I hope that we will have a window of opportunity. Libya is a rich country, one of the richest countries in Africa, despite years of civil strife: rich and with a small population, only 6 million people, who could and should lead a secure and prosperous life. Instead, it is entering the ninth year of an immensely destructive and disruptive political crisis. It was never going to be easy for Libya to emerge from 40 years of an annihilating dictatorship and miraculously become a stable democracy. It was going to be difficult, we knew, but no one ever imagined a catastrophe like this – and yet it could become even worse for the Libyans, and for us, if we do not try our very best to halt this conflict and find a political solution. With the support of all Member States and of the Parliament, for sure, I really intend to do just that, hoping that this strong engagement can be part of the solution to keep Libya united and to look for a peaceful solution to this conflict, because we are saying that there is no military solution. But this mantra – there is no military solution – we have been repeating about the Syrian war. ‘There is no military solution, there is no0 military solution’ – and at the end there has been a military solution. So maybe here the same thing can happen. We Europeans, since we don’t want to participate in a military solution, we barricade ourselves in the belief that there is no military solution. In Syria there has been a military solution brought about by the Turks and the Russians, and this has changed the equilibrium in the eastern part of the Mediterranean. I cannot prevent such a thing happening, and this is something that should be of very great concern to all of us, because I’m sure nobody will be very happy if in the Libyan coast there is a ring of military bases from the Russian and Turkish navy in front of the Italian coast, controlling both routes of illegal migration towards Europe in the eastern Mediterranean and now maybe in the central Mediterranean. At this time, at this hour – 10 o’clock at night – I think we can speak frankly among all of us and deal seriously with the situation we are facing. Let’s hope that we are going to have good news in the next hours.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PSE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "PSE"}, {"id": 411, "date": "2020-01-14.json", "name": "David McALLISTER", "mepid": "124806", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done.

For far too long, this drama has received far too little attention. The United Nations figures are well known: since The start of General Haftar's offensive in April, more than 1,100 people have lost their lives, there are more than 340 000 internally displaced people, and 900 000 people are in need of humanitarian aid, two thirds of them women and children. The need is great. I believe that the ceasefire in Libya, which has been in force since Sunday, is a step forward. However, we have heard that the country and the people need lasting peace. The Federal Government, and the Federal Chancellor in particular, have been supporting activities to establish a lasting peace in Libya for some time. And this conference, Mr High Representative, which I understand will take place next Sunday in Berlin, is intended to make an active contribution to this. What we, as representatives of a European Parliament, must also make clear is that this is not the first time that we have debated this conflict. All states directly or indirectly involved in this conflict must ensure that this civil war can finally end and that peace can be restored in Libya.

Mr High Representative, although I have prepared a speech, I commit next time to just listen to your intervention and then to come with some political remarks instead of something I prepared in advance.  Early this morning, Khalifa Haftar walked away from the negotiating table without signing the ceasefire agreement that would have formalised the fragile truce in Libya that went into effect last Sunday. This is, of course, a major blow for the suffering people of Libya, for peace, and for the stability – as you said – of the wider Sahel region. Over the past nine months, 280 civilians and 2000 fighters have died, and almost 150 000 Libyans have had to free the violence. Increasing external interference, including Turkey’s recent decision to send troops, is turning Libya into another proxy conflict right on the EU’s borders. It is of vital importance that the current informal ceasefire holds, to prevent further escalation and misery.  High Representative, I commend your indispensable efforts of the past week and call on you to continue doing everything in your power to facilitate the ceasefire’s formalisation and implementation.

The bad news today is that the truce has not been confirmed, Haftar is not signing. Everything to be redone then? Yes, but this also opens up an opportunity to be seized: if we want to prevent a new Syrian scenario on our borders, we must prepare for sunday's Berlin Summit by putting on the table a new proposal, a United Nations fact-making mission with the participation on the front line of European countries – first and first of all my own – of the neighbouring countries – i.e. the United Nations, the European countries. , for example, Tunisia and Algeria – representatives of the Arab and Islamic world and of anyone who cares about the future of the Libyan people, who most of all are suffering from this proxy war.

The problem is that we haven’t been united on Libya. Let’s tell the truth. We Europeans have had different positions with respect to Libya and now maybe we are paying the price for the fact that we haven’t been able to represent a political approach shared by all Member States. It’s true that some regret that Turkey has a role, but Turkey has a role and Russia has a role.  The latest news we have is that, after not signing the ceasefire – he is a man who refuses to sign the ceasefire because it seems that it would require them to agree with the agreement between al—Serraj, who is heading the internationally recognised government, and Turkey. But he will commit to staying in Berlin next Sunday – so the bad news is that there is no ceasefire and the good news is that it seems that, in spite of not having a ceasefire, they will be at the Berlin Conference. Maybe there we can make the first step towards a political agreement. Maybe you have been following all the statements that we have been delivering about Libya from the Foreign Affairs Council and by the High Representative himself. Let’s hope that in Berlin there is a possibility of reaching an agreement between the parts and then we will have to deal with the implementation of this agreement. This will require two things: first, to monitor the ceasefire; and, second, to control the arms embargo. I will present to the Foreign Affairs Council concrete proposals for the Europeans to be more engaged on fulfilling these two duties. Let’s see if we have enough will in order to act all together and start a new period of engagement with Libya.  That’s what I can tell you right now. Other aspects have been dealt with by many of you. I cannot answer all your questions one by one, but I think I can summarise by saying that, if there is an agreement in Berlin, subsequently there will be a ceasefire and then it will test the political will of the European Union to be more engaged on the Libyan issue.

Unfortunately, we are here today to address a further deterioration of the political crisis. This is a result of the outrageous attacks against the constitutional and democratic functioning of the National Assembly, and the takeover of legislative power by an illegitimate President.  Force and violence were used against President Guaido and many lawmakers on 5 January to prevent the legitimate election of the National Assembly executive board. Impeding access to the National Assembly is not a major attack against democracy and the rule of law, it is, but it also polarises further and creates more obstacles to a peaceful solution to the crisis. The so-called election of Luis Parra is not legitimate. It did not respect the legal procedures nor the democratic constitutional principles. There was no verified Quorum, there was no voting majority and general legal provisions were not respected. Any acts or decisions taken by the assembly over which Luis Parra presides cannot be recognised by the European Union.  The EU and the International Contact Group reacted swiftly and rejected the attacks against the National Assembly, reiterating clear support for Juan Guaido as the legitimate President of the National Assembly.  Many other international actors qualified the harassment acts as inadmissible and condemned this violation and expressed support for Juan Guaido. These developments require a strong response, and further restrictive measures targeting those responsible for undermining democracy are being considered. Of course, these measures shall in no way harm the Venezuelan people that are already dramatically affected by the crisis. Targeted sanctions cannot be the only tool, we need other complementary constructive avenues that can contribute to a peaceful solution. Even though the future looks bleak, and we don’t see prospects for a short-term resolution of the political impasse, we must continue trying to create political space for negotiations. We continue to believe that a sustainable resolution of the crisis can only arise from genuine negotiation that leads to an inclusive and representative negotiated electoral path.  When we talk about restoring public institutions we mean in particular restoring the credibility of the National Electoral Council and the Supreme Court of Justice.  Without them, there can be no free and credible legislative and presidential elections and no lasting solution for Venezuela. We have said many times the EU will spare no efforts to continue helping a genuine and inclusive process towards a reinstatement of democracy and rule of law with free and fair presidential elections. Another dimension of our efforts is to craft a more consultative approach to the Venezuelan crisis by the international community. I intend to ask a special adviser Iglesias – don’t mistake which about Iglesias I’m talking about; I am talking about Enrique Iglesias – to make a tour to outreach to key international actors and assess what more can be done.  As closing remarks, I will say that we will continue to follow closely developments, in contact with other key international actors. One thing is sure, we need more concerted efforts by the whole of the international community and we need them urgently. This is what I can summarise – what they wanted to tell to you – and I’m sure that the debates will go to these conclusions which I am anticipating. We need more concerted efforts by the whole of the international community and we need them urgently. We need them urgently. The stalemate cannot last forever, and that’s what we will try to do in the following days, looking for strong support from all actors involved and asking the Contact group to continue working. The so-called Oslo process is also in a stalemate, and the suffering of the Venezuelan people and the political situation require that we push stronger in order to look for fair and free elections, as has been required for a long time without any success, but what has happened in the election of the Presidency of the National Assembly puts a marking point on the dynamics of a situation which requires from us a stronger commitment. We hope it’s going to happen in the next week.

He condemns and denounces the tyrannical regime of Nicolás Maduro for attempting to orchestrate a parliamentary coup d'e rule to control the only democratic institution that demonstrates the farce of his regime. And it does so in an absolutely intolerable way from harassment and violence to democratically elected and elected parliamentarians. He recognizes and supports Juan Guaidó as legitimate interim president of the Republic of Venezuela and the National Assembly as his only chamber of democratic representation, while demanding respect for his deputies, denouncing the harassment and intolerable repression of the Maduro regime. It challenges the European Union and the High Commissioner to lead and intensify efforts to restore democracy to Venezuela by following the roadmap adopted by the National Assembly and the various initiatives with the Contact Group. It requires extending and intensifying sanctions to those responsible for human rights violations and repression. And he calls on the Member States that have not yet recognized Juan Guaidó as the legitimate president to do so. It also calls for its political representatives to be recognized as such.

Since Maduro came to power in 2013 there has been an increase in human rights abuses and a shrinking of civil and political spheres. He has stifled dissent, targeted the opposition and presided over the collage of the local economy. Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, and expecting a different result. Repeatedly, socialist dictators come to power promising the sun, the moon and the stars, and we get the same result: collapse of economies and abuse of human rights. The proven oil reserves in Venezuela are recognised as the largest in the world, totalling 300 billion barrels. The United Nations Human Rights Office has denounced ‘widespread and systematic use of excessive force’ against demonstrators, saying security forces and pro-government groups were responsible for the deaths of at least 73 protesters. The EU must send a strong and clear message that it supports democracy and the rule of law and opposes dictators.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "Renew", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Liberals and centrists"}]
