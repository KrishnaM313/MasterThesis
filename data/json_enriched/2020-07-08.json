Mr President, Madam President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. It is a pleasure for me to address the plenary of the European Parliament at the beginning of the German Presidency. Like most of you, I have the direct encounters with people who miss face-to-face conversations, and for me this is now the first trip abroad since the outbreak of the pandemic, and it leads me consciously and with complete conviction to you, to the heart of European democracy. At a time when the European Union wants to strengthen this crisis, the European Parliament needs it. The tasks ahead of us are enormous and they require enormous efforts. They need a parliamentary debate, they need political mediation, they need cultural translations into the various countries and regions. And that's what you need! It is therefore a special honour for me to present to you today the priorities of the German Presidency. Five issues are particularly important to me at this time: our fundamental rights, cohesion, climate protection, digitisation and Europe's responsibility in the world. These five issues are important because we need to change Europe sustainably if we are to protect and preserve Europe. Only then will Europe, even in a rapidly changing global order, be able to play its own role sovereignly and responsibly. We are all aware that today's visit is taking place against the background of the greatest test in the history of the European Union. The global coronavirus pandemic has also hit people hard and relentlessly in Europe. We have more than a hundred thousand deaths in Europe alone. Many citizens could not even say goodbye to their loved ones in the last hour because of the strict quarantine rules. This must not be forgotten with all the commitment to the new beginning, with all commitment to economic recovery: the mourning for the dead, the pain of the impossible farewells. That will be with us for a long time to come. Our economy has been and is being severely shaken throughout Europe. Millions of workers have lost their jobs, and in addition to concerns about the health and health of families, many citizens have also been left with fears about their economic existence. They all need our common support now. In order to break the chains of infection, the most basic fundamental rights had to be temporarily restricted. That was a very high price, because generations in Europe fought hard for these fundamental rights. Human and civil rights are the most valuable asset we have in Europe. And they can only be restricted for very important reasons and only in the very short term. A pandemic must never be a pretext for undermining democratic principles. Every country in Europe remembers differently its own historical upheavals, the different struggles for freedom and the rule of law. At the same time, it is precisely this achievement of fundamental rights in Europe that united us. For me, who have lived thirty-five years of my life in a system of freedom, restricting these rights in the pandemic was a decision that i found infinitely difficult.  At this historic stage, Germany is taking over the EU Presidency. This task fills me with respect, but also with great passion. Because I believe in Europe. I am convinced of Europe, not only as a legacy of the past, but as a hope and vision for the future. Europe is not just something that has been handed over to us, something fateful that obliges us, but Europe is something alive that we can shape and change. Europe does not deprive us of any means of action, but in a globalised world, Europe gives us first. We can maintain our convictions and freedoms, not without, but only with Europe. And for that we need this: more than ever, the orientation towards fundamental rights, but at the same time, more than ever, mutual support and Community cohesion. Europe will remain only Europe if, on this basis, there are innovative responses to the challenges of climate change and digitalisation and if it rises to its responsibilities in the world.  These are the big tasks, but I am confident. Think of what Europe has already passed in terms of trials and conflicts. Think, for example, of the failed Constitution for Europe fifteen years ago or of the economic and financial crises that we fought hard about. Or think of the refugee movements five years ago. It's never been easy. This has always led to injuries. But even the most bitter crises have helped to better understand each other's needs and needs. We learned together. Europe survived all these crises because, in the end, everyone was aware of what is essential: fundamental rights and cohesion. Human and civil rights, the inviolability of human dignity, freedom for individual personal, political and social development, protection against discrimination and contempt, not least equality – the equality that has been asserted, but also achieved – are the ethical and political foundation on which Europe rests. These are the rights that apply to everyone. They do not apply to one more and the other less. They do not apply to some and only sometimes to others. They apply. This is Europe's promise that we must guarantee: that citizens can really be free to live their religious beliefs, their cultural or political beliefs, that they can attach their respective ideas of happiness or good life. Democracy, including European democracy, thrives on public critical debate. A democracy in which opposition voices are undesirable, a democracy in which social or cultural or religious diversity is undesirable is not one.  The pandemic has made it all too clear to us how precious fundamental rights are, how fundamental the freedoms they guarantee are. Strong institutions in the European Union, the European Commission, the European Court of Justice and the European Parliament, are vigilant over the protection of these fundamental rights. Fundamental rights, they are the first thing that is close to my heart in this Presidency. This must be supported and supplemented by the second principle that makes up Europe: our cohesion. For Europe will only emerge stronger from this crisis if we are prepared – despite all the differences – to find common solutions if we are prepared to look at the world through the eyes of the other and show understanding for the other perspective. After the crisis, Europe will become stronger than before if we strengthen common sense. No one is coming through this crisis alone. We are all vulnerable. European solidarity is not just a humane gesture, but a sustainable investment. European cohesion is not just something that is politically necessary, but something that will be worthwhile. And that is also the leitmotif of our Presidency: 'Together. Make Europe strong again.\" I will devote myself to this task with all my passion, together with the Federal Government. But I need you for that! In order to protect this common sense in the EU, Parliament is needed. Because you are the mediator of the mutual understanding that we need in order to reach compromises. They represent almost 450 million citizens in 27 countries. They are the translators of European principles. They explain Europe to the people and thus mediate between Brussels, Strasbourg and their home regions. Not only do you communicate in 24 languages, but you live with this diversity of perspectives and experiences. Who, if not you, could explain to the people of Europe the attitude of other Member States? That is why I ask you, as mediator and mediator of cohesion, for your support at this difficult time. Help us deepen mutual understanding of each other. Help us strengthen Europe's cohesion. The highest priority of the German Presidency is for Europe to emerge from the crisis united and strengthened. But we do not just want to stabilise Europe in the short term – that would be too little. We also want a Europe that gives hope. We want a Europe that is confident and courageous in facing up to the challenges of the present. We want a Europe that is sustainable and that innovate and sustainably asserts its place in the world. We want a new start for Europe. This conviction is also followed by the german-French initiative of mid-May. Together with French President Emmanuel Macron, I have proposed a EUR 500 billion European building fund. I am pleased that the European Commission is taking many aspects of this german-French initiative into account in its proposal on the Multiannual Financial Framework and the reconstruction programme. On this basis, the European Council, headed by Charles Michel, is currently discussing this. Our common objective is to reach agreement as quickly as possible, because the depth of the economic slump is urging us to hurry up. We must not waste any time. Only the most vulnerable would suffer. I very much hope that we will be able to reach an agreement this summer. This will still require a great deal of willingness to compromise from all sides, including you. The situation is exceptional, indeed unique in the history of the European Union. That is why Germany has also advocated this extraordinary and unique effort of this magnitude of 500 billion. It will now be important for us to reach european unity. I am convinced that the social dimension is as crucial as the economic dimension. A socially and economically just Europe is crucial for democratic cohesion. It is the best recipe against all those who want to weaken our democracies and question our commonalities. For this reason too, during our Presidency, we will also pay particular attention to young people and children. They are Europe's future and particularly hard hit by the crisis. That is why, among other things, we want to promote their development with a European youth work agenda and actively support them on their way to their working lives with a strengthened Youth Guarantee. We must not be naive. In many Member States, anti-Europeans are just waiting to abuse the crisis for their own ends. We must now show all of them where the added value of cooperation lies in the European Union. We must show that a return to nationalism means, not more, less control, that only joint action as Europe protects and strengthens us. That is why it is right and important that the regions particularly affected by the crisis, and especially the people who live there, should be able to count on our solidarity. It is in our own interest. At the same time, however, the result always means that the effort that is now necessary for the benefit of all must not unilaterally place undue burdens on the economically strong Member States, that each of us is required to put ourselves in the position of the other. So you also consider what the individual Member States can and cannot do – economically, socially and politically. In all this, I ask you today, as a Member of the European Parliament, for your support. I am convinced that everyone in this crisis is ready for extraordinary solidarity. Germany is. The management of the pandemic and its consequences will shape our Presidency. At the same time, we must always keep an eye on the other major challenges of our time that still exist. These are the issues three, four and five that will matter to Europe. First, climate change. About six months ago, the President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, presented her climate protection programme in this House. She has spoken forcefully to you, stressing that Europe must act now if our planet is to remain viable. I, too, am convinced that a global solution to climate change is only possible if Europe takes the lead in climate protection. The strategy for a green deal by the European Commission is therefore an important guideline for us. With their close support during our Presidency, we want to create the transition to a carbon-neutral economy and society, to a green economy with strong and innovative companies – an economy that protects and strengthens Europe's natural livelihoods and competitiveness for future generations. It is important to me that we legally establish Europe's climate neutrality by 2050. I therefore welcome the European Commission's consideration of reducing emissions to 50 to 55 per cent by 2030 compared to 1990 levels as an intermediate step. In this perspective, we will also accompany the work on the European Climate Protection Act. The other major challenge and the fourth point, which is particularly important to us during our Presidency, is digital change. It, like climate protection, requires that we change the way we live and operate sustainably. This triggers fear in many people – fear of the loss of the familiar, fear of the pace of change. And that is understandable. But let me be very clear: the commitment to digitisation as well as to climate protection does not mean that we are abandoning everything that has been established and thus putting the jobs of millions of Europeans at risk. On the contrary, it is a question of a necessary change in our society, which will offer more protection and more sustainability in the long term. It is precisely in recent weeks and months that Europe's digital dependence on third countries has once again become clear to us. Many of us have undoubtedly noticed this in the course of our daily digital communications, whether in technology or in services. It is important that Europe is digitally becomes sovereign. We want to make progress in key areas such as artificial intelligence and quantum computing, but also in building a trustworthy and secure digital infrastructure. However, it is also crucial to protect our democracies effectively from cyber threats and disinformation campaigns. A democracy needs a public in which knowledge and information can be shared, in which citizens can exchange ideas and communicate on how they want to live. We are experiencing it right now: lies and disinformation cannot combat the pandemic, as little as hatred and hatred. Populism denying the facts is shown its limits. (Applause) In a democracy, truth and transparency are needed. That is what distinguishes Europe, and germany will be pushing for this in its Presidency.  And fifthly, for Europe's responsibility in a globalised world. A glance at the map shows that in addition to the United Kingdom and the Western Balkans, Europe is surrounded at its external borders by Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Israel, Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco, among others. At the same time, we are living in a time of global upheaval, in which the fields of power are shifting and Europe – with all the involvement of many Member States in the transatlantic alliance – is more on its own. We can and must decide for ourselves who Europe wants to be in this rapidly changing world order. It is more important than ever whether we are serious about Europe, whether we want a Europe that preserves its freedom and its identity even in times of globalisation. In this situation, there is a need for a strong European foreign and security policy. The UNITED Kingdom is and will remain an important partner in this. The design of our future relationship will occupy us a lot in the coming six months. The progress made in the negotiations so far is, to put it mildly, clear. We have agreed with the United Kingdom to speed up these negotiations in order to conclude an agreement in the autumn, which would then have to be ratified by the end of the year. I will continue to push for a good solution. However, we should also make provision in the event that an agreement does not come about. During our Presidency, we should make every effort to make progress in three other foreign policy areas, firstly with Northern Macedonia at least with Northern Macedonia, and, if necessary, Albania – an important step on the way to giving the western Balkans an accession perspective – and, on the other, for our relations with our neighbouring continent, Africa and the African Union, which we want to deepen in a forward-looking manner at an EU-Africa summit. This will continue to include issues of our migration cooperation. There are more people on the run than ever before. That is why we have a special responsibility to move forward on an issue as central to Europe as asylum and migration policy. This is a question that requires a great deal of political sensitivity, but we must not look the other way, but must face up to this humanitarian and political task together. (Applause) Last but not least, our strategic relations with China, which are characterised by close trade links, but also very different socio-political ideas, will be of great concern to us, first and for all in respect for human rights and the rule of law. Although the EU-China Summit in September cannot take place, we want to continue the open dialogue with China. During the German Presidency, we also want to continue our reflections on whether or not we want to maintain the principle of unanimity on foreign and security policy issues, and what lessons Europe should learn from the Coronavirus crisis, for example with regard to how Europe's sovereignty in the health sector could be strengthened. We should also have this debate in the context of a conference on the future of Europe. The one proposed by the European Commission last year, on which it has developed many ideas with its resolutions. I call for a conference that focuses on a few issues, offers concrete results and brings together citizens from and in different Member States for discussions. I have already spoken to the President of the European Parliament, David Sassoli, on this subject today. Mr President, Madam President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has Do we want Europe? Then what I have been talking about today is needed. Then we need fundamental rights and cohesion. Then you need answers to climate change and digitalisation. Then europe's responsibility in the world is needed. Then we need to make Europe greener, more digital and therefore more innovative and more competitive. Europe should stand for an international order of law, and Europe should stand internationally for innovation and sustainability. That is the vision for Europe. Let me conclude with a personal thought. I am a music lover, so it is a great pleasure for me that there is a very special anniversary during our Presidency. In December 2020, the composer of the European anthem, Ludwig van Beethoven, would have turned 250 years old. This Ninth Symphony still fills me again and again. Every time I listen, I discover something different in music that hits and impresses me, just like Europe. It can be rediscovered again and again, and it still impresses me. And so let me end today with the wish that the message of this music, the idea of brotherhood and harmony, guides us in Europe. What message could be more appropriate than this that this Europe is capable of great things if we stand by each other and stick together.

Wir freuen uns auf die deutsche Ratspräsidentschaft. Ratspräsidentschaften kann man sich ja nicht aussuchen, sondern sie werden nach einem strikt festgelegten Muster verteilt, und Deutschland ist in der Tat in eine Phase gefallen, die herausfordernder nicht sein könnte. Die Erwartungen an die deutsche Ratspräsidentschaft sind hoch – ich weiß, das drückt –, aber das ist ja auch etwas Schönes, denn das zeigt ja auch: Man traut euch etwas zu. Die Corona-Krise stellt vieles in Frage: gesellschaftlich, wirtschaftlich, auch unser eigenes Selbstverständnis, die Art, wie wir uns selber sehen, und die Art, wie wir uns auch im Verhältnis zu anderen sehen. Das Ganze spielt sich ab vor einer Kulisse, einer Welt, in der die Halt gebenden Strukturen sich auch immer weiter auflösen. Wir denken – durch die Corona-Krise ausgelöst – über den Wert von Solidarität und Gemeinschaft anders und neu. Wir denken neu und anders über den großen Wert, den unser gemeinsames Europa hat, das jeden Tag neu erarbeitet werden muss. Und ja, es war am Anfang so, dass viele nach innen geschaut haben, auf das Kleine und zu wenig auf das Große und das Gemeinsame. Aber dann haben wir uns zusammengerissen und wieder mit europäischen Augen gesehen und wieder mit einem europäischen Herzen gefühlt.  Frau Bundeskanzlerin, auch dank des Beitrags Deutschlands in den vergangenen Wochen ist dieser Geist für die Verantwortung für das Ganze wieder in Europa zu Hause. Im Angesicht dieser Krise hören wir aus allen Himmelsrichtungen unseres Kontinents inzwischen Worte und sehen wir Taten, die Anlass zur Hoffnung geben, dass wir es gemeinsam schaffen können. Was gut ist für Europa, das ist auch gut für uns. Wenn ich das höre, dann weiß ich: Das ist wieder der Klang Europas, den wir hören wollen, und dieser wiederentdeckte Geist der Verantwortung für das Ganze. Das ist kein schlechter Wegbegleiter, wenn man in den Startblöcken einer Ratspräsidentschaft steht, die wegweisend sein wird für die Zukunft unserer Union. The challenge ahead of you, the rotating Presidency, and ahead of us all in the next six months, could not be more extraordinary. In the last six months, more than 100 000 lives have been lost in Europe because of COVID-19. We have entered the worst recession in almost 100 years. The summer forecast from yesterday shows a contraction of more than 8% this year, with only a partial rebound next year. This crisis is deeper and it is way broader than the one ten years ago. But the one ten years ago is still vividly present in our minds. Some of our Member States during that crisis endured sky-rocketing youth unemployment. They saw young people leaving their homes in droves in search of job opportunities elsewhere. They saw an unprecedented drop in public investment to historically low levels, all of which ultimately damaged public programmes and public infrastructure severely. For many, this was a traumatising experience.  But it does not have to be that way. In other parts of our Union the economy was supported by strong public investment from the very beginning of the crisis. People were able to stay in their jobs. That was when the concept of ‘Kurzarbeit’ was implemented on a large scale and this allowed some to come out stronger from the crisis than when they went in. We should draw lessons from this and this time we should do it together. If we do it right we can also emerge stronger from this crisis thanks to a common European purpose and thanks to Next Generation EU. And this Presidency has chosen one word at the core of its programme – ‘gemeinsam’, together, ‘tous ensemble’ – and that’s the engine of our Union.  There are two points I want to emphasise. First of all, solidarity means that those who need it get more support. But what it does not incentivise is a lack of action, and that is why in Next Generation EU investment is linked to reforms based on our existing country-specific recommendation in the European semester. Let me tell you each and every Member State has homework to do. There is not one Member State that does not have country-specific recommendations that should be linked as reforms to investment. If we want to come out stronger from this crisis, we must all change for the better. There is not a single Member State that is exempt from that – we must all change for the better. This is also what European people expect from us. They are certainly very different in their individual expectations, but are completely united in wanting to drink clean water, to breathe fresh air, to see their children grow up in nature. What they certainly do not want is that politics contributes to increased flooding, to heat waves, to droughts, to the loss of millions of species. This is a very real scenario in case of non-action and therefore economic recovery is inseparable from the European Green Deal, from digitalisation and from resilience.  My second point is: do not neglect the core Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF), our seven-year budget over Next Generation EU. We need them both. (Applause) Next Generation EU is for the acute crisis, but the MFF is there to stay. It is the most important tool with which to implement our long-term goals – research, innovation, migration, foreign policy, security, to name but a few. These policies need real European added value, and they need a strong seven-year budget to bring all that to life.  All this has to be agreed now, in the next weeks, to clear the path for all the other topics that we want to tackle. By the end of the year we will have to chart the path towards our goal of a climate-neutral Europe. In September, we will propose the European Union’s new 2030 climate target, underpinned by a robust impact assessment and here, cooperation with the European Parliament and the European Council will be vital. We will also aim to click the digital transition into a higher gear.  Mesdames et messieurs les députés, au cours de cette présidence, nous ferons le maximum pour trouver un accord avec le Royaume-Uni sur nos nouvelles relations, tout en respectant nos principes et en préservant notre unité européenne. De même, il est important pour moi de maintenir une relation transatlantique forte, même s’il y a beaucoup de problèmes. Le partenariat avec l’Afrique figure au cœur du programme de la présidence allemande ainsi qu’au cœur de mon programme. En faisant face à ce virus, nous devrons montrer que ce partenariat avec l’Afrique n’existe pas uniquement par beau temps mais que nous sommes également solidaires quand le ciel se couvre. Et nous devrons également continuer à travailler avec la Chine pour bâtir un partenariat plus équilibré. Enfin, et surtout, le moment est venu d’ouvrir la conférence sur l’avenir de l’Europe. Nous voulons tous donner le coup d’envoi dès que la situation sanitaire le permettra. (Applaudissements) Pour toutes ces questions, je suis heureuse que nous puissions compter sur l’expérience de l’Allemagne, en commençant par le Conseil européen de la semaine prochaine. C’est le moment d’agir ensemble, et pour reprendre votre devise: «Gemeinsam.

He’s a junior doctor in a hospital in Bergamo. He faced the question that no doctor should ever have to answer. He wants to save lives, but in this hospital there are no more beds available and he is forced to decide between life and death. At the same time, the neighbouring countries in Europe block the export of protective masks. Fear reigns, national self—interest triumphs and the neighbouring countries hang Francesco out to dry. And it’s not just Francesco. Many people all over Europe are asking themselves: ‘What happened to solidarity; where is Europe when we need it the most’?  Hohe Erwartungen liegen auf der deutschen Ratspräsidentschaft, liebe Frau Bundeskanzlerin, liebe Angela Merkel. Europa vertraut dir. Wo andere trügerische Stärke suchen, indem sie spalten, führst du zusammen. Was für Adenauer der Staat der europäischen Einheit, was für Kohl der Euro, das ist wahrscheinlich für deine Kanzlerschaft jetzt der Wiederaufbau Europas nach der schweren Corona-Krise. Ja, die deutsche Ratspräsidentschaft darf keine Fußnote der Geschichte werden. Es geht um nicht mehr und nicht weniger als um den Zusammenhalt Europas und die Frage, ob die 20er-Jahre gute Jahre werden oder nicht. Looking back at the last ten years, all people can see are the euro crisis, the migration crisis, the Brexit crisis, and now the corona crisis. We are stumbling from one crisis to another, and why? Because, all too often, we are led by fear and fear is the enemy of solidarity, fear is the enemy of the future and fear is the enemy of our freedom. Look again to Francesco. He was not led by fear. He showed courage, courage that we need in Europe now more than ever before, courage to show solidarity, and the first important step is now the Recovery Fund. We need a solution this month. Courage in the future. We cannot spend the money we borrowed from our children on the past. We need to build the future — climate, digital, industries — simply the most modern continent. Courage to be fair. When you borrow money, you need to say honestly how to pay it back. Does anybody here in this room seriously believe that you can pay the debts of the European Union without digging into own resources? I think not, and that’s why we need a repayment plan before 2028 with, for example, a new digital tax. And courage to be free. Europe is not a cash machine. Europe is a union of shared values. The rule of law must be respected.  (Applause) And you referred to several other points in today’s introduction of the German Presidency. We have to deliver on concrete solutions on migration, on Brexit, on trade and a lot of other things. But, colleagues, I am afraid that this is simply not enough. Seventy years ago Robert Schuman was confronted with even greater challenges. Europe lay in ruins with millions dead, people displaced, hunger. Nevertheless, Schuman had the courage to look beyond the everyday events. He had faith in Europe.  Today we also have an immense job to do. The digital revolution, a hostile Russia, American in retreat and an assertive China are putting us to the test. The North Pole is melting, Australia is burning, and the liberal democracy, in which we all believe so strongly, is heavily under attack. Yes, the everyday is testing us again, and again the question is whether we, like Schuman, now have the courage to look beyond the everyday. And what is my question when I talk about ‘beyond the everyday’? I think we have to talk about identity. Today we justify Europe on the basis of small everyday success stories — roaming charges, no border controls, the euro, we build motorways, no foreign exchange rates, and so forth. But this perspective is quite an egotistic perspective. If Europe delivers for me, then Europe is good. If Europe does not delivering for me, Europe is bad.  This is not enough anymore. This view of Europe leaves Francesco high and dry in the emergency room once again. No community can survive without community spirit, without shared beliefs, without its own identity, simply — I would mention it in EPP terms — the European way of life, as you described it, Madam Chancellor: democracy, the independence of our courts, the prohibition of the death penalty, the social market economy and, above all, freedom. In the United States they still have the death penalty and no national health insurance, and in China there is no democracy and no freedom at all. Our European way of life is unique and that makes us Europeans. It is good to be a European and I am proud to say that I am a European.  We need to rediscover our courage for the future, the courage to take the next step. Solidarity will only last and our values will only win at the global level if we can create a shared community spirit. Therefore, we need a truly European democracy that people can connect to. That is why we need to think big — like Václav Havel, Helmut Kohl and Lech Wałęsa  to mention only a few.  Chancellor, I trust that the German Presidency and you yourself will be up to the task: to deliver not just on the daily challenges but also, looking beyond, for the next step in European integration, building a living European democracy. Yes to a truly European identity. Yes to the European way of life.

There are times in history when vision and courage are required, and this is one of them. That is why we have your experience and your German quality of building consensus, beyond particular interests, to work in the general interest of Europe. We have six months ahead of us that will set the course for the Union and we must take advantage of them to address shortcomings that have become apparent in recent times. We must be able to react more quickly and more closely to crises and strengthen our strategic sectors and resilience as a society. The next Council to agree on the recovery plan and the next budget will be decisive, yes. And that's why there's a lot of talk about money these days, but this isn't just a discussion of figures: this is a political project discussion. When Robert Schuman proposed to Konrad Adenauer the Coal and Steel Community, Konrad Adenauer clearly understood its historical scope. It was not a technical project, nor material, but a moral responsibility towards the peoples of Europe. Germany's future today remains dependent on the future of Europe and vice versa. I ask that in the next six months we work side by side to overcome the differences and divisions between north and south, between east and west; that we should reforce our Union for the sake of citizenship. Let us show the world that it is possible to create a more just, sustainable society that thinks about the environment and future generations; an egalitarian society with women in leadership positions in all institutions; a society that values public policies, such as health care or education; protecting workers; demanding fair wages; that values diversity and is able to manage migration flows with solidarity. All this is on your agenda, and you'll count on us to work. What is clear is that the formulas of the past are no longer valid and that we have to be bold. In my political group, together with my colleagues at the SPD, we have worked on a roadmap to a more effective Europe close to citizenship. And that is why we have two major outstanding subjects: on the one hand, own resources, in order to solve transnational problems; and, on the other hand, reconnect with citizens through the Conference on the Future of Europe.

Mr President, Madam Chancellor, while I was listening to your speech, I felt a strong emotion. We both come from the same side of Europe. We have both experienced another Europe, the one often referred to as Eastern Europe, ravaged by decades of communist dictatorship and other totalitarian regimes. And there are many of us here in this room, coming from this often overlooked part of the continent. But today we all want the same thing: a free, strong and prosperous Europe. To do this, we must fight against the disenchantment, discouragement and decline of the European idea. We must show ambition and relaunch a significant number of European issues and projects because only hope, as you have said, will triumph over disillusionment. You talked about the conference on the future of Europe. The urgency now is the adoption of the stimulus package and the new multi-year financial framework. The latest European Commission forecasts on our economy show us, once again, that we have no other choice. The future of Europeans is at stake. And to give in to divisions now would be a historic mistake. I have no doubt, therefore, that you will be on the side of the President of the Council to forge a compromise as early as next week. I have shared with you the emotion I felt when I listened to you, but I cannot hide my concern from you either. You recently said that you have to have the money first before you talk about the rule of law. Let me disagree on this point because Europe is not being built on a purely accounting approach. Europe is being built, as you have said, around a project, a vision and solid values. Today, too many European leaders continue to torpedo these projects and all that they represent. And the perfect example is Viktor Orban, who is also a member of your political family, but he is not the only one. It is time, Madam Chancellor, to twist the arm of those who want to turn the tide of history. It is time to start conditioning EU funds on the rule of law. The political opportunity is clearly there. This unprecedented 1,800 billion euro package must be used as leverage. Stand on the side of the Europeans - of all Europeans - so that they can live in a free, just and prosperous world.

Never before has the EU been in existence has this been more necessary than it is today. But what you deliver here has nothing to do with prudence and foresight, but a lot with ignorance, infamy and ideology. Unfortunately, you are not the noble custodian of the European idea, as you are so happy to be celebrated. They are, in fact, their gravediggers.  (Interjections) Europe's ideals are based on cultural identity, enlightened reason and the freedom of the individual. But they trample it all underfoot. You want to replace the cultural identity of Europe, its Christian-Jewish roots, its beauty and diversity with an ultimately cultureless and contourless multiculturalism. We have recently seen where this leads us during the serious riots in Dijon and Stuttgart. Those who do not want to see this are ignorant and overlook the true interests of the people. By the way, they first feel French, Italian, Poles, Hungarians or Germans, and only then as Europeans.  Reason grown out of the Enlightenment demands a policy based on the knowledge of the sciences and respect for the law. Their chaotic and headless monetary and fiscal policies ignore all of this, and with 500 billion of the Green Deal and 750 billion for the Recovery Fund, you are finally leaving the basis of sensible decisions. That's infam. However, the most serious thing is the ever-increasing restriction of people's freedom. What you are pumping up with the Green Deal, with debt-sharing, with the insane spending excesses, is the exact opposite of freedom. To the delight of the French president and other Mediterranean friends, Mrs Merkel is casually giving away 500 billion. Ms. von der Leyen spontaneously packs a staggering 250 billion on top. It is not your money, but it is the money of the taxpayers who have not been interviewed to pay this bill. It is state paternalism in the most intense form. All this is driven at the heart of socialist ideology. It is downright a rape of freedom. And then, Mrs Merkel, you talk about the need for Germany not only to think of itself, but to be prepared to act of extraordinary solidarity. Do you know that the average wealth of Germans is much lower than that of the French, Spaniards and Italians? Are you aware that the home ownership rate in Germany cannot keep pace with that of those countries and that Germany has a significantly higher retirement age than all Mediterranean countries? What kind of absurd understanding of solidarity do you have, Chancellor?  You, Mrs Merkel, and you, Mrs von der Leyen, together with ECB President Lagarde, have long been a triumvirate of economic policy horror.  Instead of using the German Presidency to abandon this disastrous course, you are even increasing the speed of your political ghost journey once again.

(Applause)  It is certainly a place where we can see the difficulties of the European Union, but where, in a very large majority, we are all working to make this Europe better for the citizens – even if we sometimes differ in how we want to get there and what exactly that means – and a place where we must work even harder to better represent the diversity of the European Union – in this House. Germany takes over the Presidency of the Council in very difficult times. The Corona crisis has also become a historic test for the whole of the European Union. At the beginning of the crisis, the Union threatened to disintegrate into national components: trees were back in Europe, and citizens' confidence in the common Europe suffered dramatically. But the crisis is also an opportunity to finally build the Europe of solidarity that we so desperately need. It is now also up to you, Chancellor, and the entire German Federal Government, to seize this opportunity to set off and to re-enter Europe. I would like to congratulate you explicitly on the german-French proposal on the building fund. For he is counting on courage instead of hesitation and on solidarity instead of national selfishness. I believe that it is a sign that some of us would have liked to see before. But voilé, here we are.  But nothing has been won yet. It still takes a lot of work before such a fund, a programme, actually stands. This requires strong partners. We Greens in the European Parliament are ready to support an ambitious reconstruction plan. We stand for a fund that enables future investment, paving the way for an ecological and social transformation of the economy that addresses the challenges of our time, a fund that helps the countries most affected in the European Union without increasing the debt levels of some countries even further, and a fund that defends the rule of law and protects the climate, but which does not repeat the old mistakes and rely on economically damaging conditions, a troika. This is what we Greens are committed to everywhere: here in Brussels, but also in the national parliaments.  The terrible Corona crisis shows that we can act decisively and achieve a great deal. We also need this courage and determination to confront the climate crisis. Because climate change is not waiting until we have time to deal with it again. We are the first generation to feel climate change first hand: whether in heat waves, forest deaths or stronger storms that threaten our health and threaten the livelihoods of humanity.  And we are also the last generation that can still stop climate change halfway. We have the answers for renewable energy, for the green future, for the clean environment or for sustainable transport. We just have to do it, we just have to implement it.  The German Presidency can make an important contribution to this. Central to this are the Climate Act and the EU Climate Targets for 2030. But they must be ambitious, because, as a major historic greenhouse gas emittor, we must ensure that other countries are also on board and shoulder our historic responsibilities.  That is why we are calling on the whole of the European Union to adopt a 65% greenhouse gas reduction by 2030. I appeal to you: show courage in Europe and show courage in the fight against climate change! The world is waiting for a signal from Europe. Overcoming the Corona crisis and preventing the climate crisis: it can succeed.

Germany is taking over the rotating Presidency at the most difficult time in the history of our continent since the Second World War. Unfortunately, up to now, the European Union's response has been slow, limited in effectiveness and lacking a real spirit of solidarity between the Member States. Yesterday, the Commission revised down its growth estimates in Europe: - 8.7 % in the euro area, over - 10 % for France, Spain and Italy. Today we have only one certainty: there is no more time, it is time to act. Reaching an agreement next week is a necessity; it is a duty to ensure that money reaches citizens and businesses as soon as possible. That is why we do not want a down-to-the-bottom compromise, but we want an ambitious agreement. Germany has a huge responsibility during these six months: to put selfishness aside and to recover the original spirit of the European Union, avoiding the mistakes of the past. No more austerity and conditionality, we need to breathe new life into the economy, supporting the companies and sectors most affected, implementing favourable trade policies and relaunching the internal market. But the internal market must be balanced: greater flexibility in state aid must not exacerbate disparities between Member States. It is all very well to demand responsibility for the use of resources, but it is wrong to impose constraints that undermine the principle of state sovereignty and autonomy. We say yes to greater environmental sustainability, but without compromising the economic sustainability of our businesses. Failure to reach an agreement would make any discussion about the future of the Union hypocritical, and let us be clear about this: we do not need centralist brussels taxation, but rather we want a More Flexible European Union that is more respectful of the prerogatives of the different countries. It is unacceptable for democratically legitimised national governments to be hit with the club of alleged violations of the rule of law simply because they are not politically aligned with the thinking of Brussels. We also need a breakthrough on migration policies: your Home Secretary acknowledged yesterday that many Member States have been left alone in managing flows. There is not only the problem of reforming the asylum system but, above all, the need to firmly defend the external borders against uncontrolled immigration, including the naval blockade to stop trafficking in human beings. Migratory blackmail is one of the weapons that Erdoğan is using against Europe: it is intolerable that Turkey should continue to expand its influence in the Mediterranean in total silence of the European Union. It is essential to reach a virtuous agreement on Brexit and strengthen transatlantic relations; the fight against terrorism and international trade can only be issues where we will be stronger if we reach an agreement with our historic partners. We want a European Union that deals fearlessly with China, that strongly stigmatises the attitudes of some Member States that wink at Beijing, that actually defends Hong Kong's autonomy, that knows how to protect commercial interests, that is able to counter unfair practices and defend European assets from the risk of hostile operations. Yours is the country of Joseph Ratzinger, a true European patriot. (Mixed reactions from some Members) I did not listen to the same screams when others spoke, this does not seem to me to be a civil fact. I have listened carefully and this Parliament must listen carefully to everyone. Yours, Madam Chancellor, is the country of Joseph Ratzinger, a true European patriot. The Pope emeritus has repeatedly stressed that one cannot think of a common European home by denying one's own identity and common roots.

Mr President, Chancellor, I would like to say that the Rapporteur. with this Presidency of the Council, you have been given a second chance. The Europe that you quoted a lot in your speech has not forgotten that the German answer, that your response to the financial and economic crisis at the time was austerity. The south of Europe, in particular, paid the price for the crisis at the time. Massive youth unemployment has been mentioned, privatisation, the dismantling of public services of general interest, lower wages and lower pensions.  This wrong policy almost tore the EU apart at the time. I hope that you will find the insight of this Presidency to correct the mistakes of that time. Instead of a policy of austerity, Europe needs a policy of solidarity. Chancellor, you will be judged on whether the Corona pandemic can be mastered economically and socially. But has anyone in this debate noticed today that there has been no mention at all of those who have kept society going day in and day out in recent months? Has anyone noticed here that those – nurses, medical staff, educators, salesmen at petrol stations, supermarkets or bakeries – have not been mentioned here at all in this debate?  Our political task is to act for these people and against poverty and against precarious work. Europeans are now scaly about the dispute between the Member States. Clarity on the multiannual financial framework and the building fund is needed now, before the summer. When I hear again, Chancellor – here in this debate gladly presented by your party friends, but today, for once, by the President of the Commission – that the allocation of funds should once again be linked to reforms, that is to say, to savings and privatisation again, one wonders whether the Conservatives have not been watching any news in recent months.  I would like to give you some advice, Mrs Merkel: so far, the German Finance Minister, Olaf Scholz, has blocked the digital tax in the Council and has always referred to the OECD. That excuse has lapsed now that the Trump administration has pulled out of international negotiations. Germany must stop blocking important projects in the Council. In addition to the digital tax, for example, so-called country-by-country reporting, which would be so important to block and hinder the tax avoidance practices of large companies. The socio-ecological transformation is a key project – we all agree on this – for the future of Europe. This requires a climate change policy that is committed to the objectives of the Paris Agreement. The Green Deal, as you have presented it today, is miles away from that, as Mrs von der Leyen keeps portraying here.  If you really care about climate protection, Chancellor, why are you sticking to a trade agreement such as the one with Mercosur, for example? You know as well as I do that the far-right Brazilian President Bolsonaro is partly responsible for the mass deforestation of the amazon jungles. Incidentally, I do not think that democracies with right-wing extremists should conclude any trade agreements at all. Or, when it comes to business, when economic interests play a role, do the European values mentioned suddenly no longer play a role?  At Europe's external borders, these European values sink to the bottom of the Mediterranean every day with every drowning. This is an intolerable state of affairs. These people are not helped by dirty deals with any autocrats or warlords, but by a policy based on human rights based on solidarity. Please also tell your Minister of the Interior, Mr Seehofer. However, you can increase confidence in European democracy, Mrs Merkel, by reducing lobbying influence on the Council and by making the Council minutes transparent. You have also stressed this: transparency is a leitmotif of your Presidency. That would be a sensible step, which of course many more will have to follow. But that would be a sensible step to turn the Member States' side-by-side and opposition in the Corona crisis into a coexistence, the aim of which is a socially just, ecological and more democratic European Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 1, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 14, "date": "2020-07-08.json", "name": "Martin SONNEBORN", "mepid": "124834", "text": "   Mr President, Chancellor Merkel, I would like to thank the Rapporteur on the work she has Who, if not you, could lead the European Union out of this crisis?

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report and for the way in which I can actually be brief. I would like to thank those who have sent me good wishes. It is clear, I believe, that the 'collective' does not only refer to the Member States, but also to work with the European Parliament. It has also become clear in the speeches that there are very different ideas about what is really to be achieved. In other words, it is not only up to us Heads of State and Government and the President-in-Office of the Council to find a solution, but we will all have to come together if we are to achieve something. I would like to make it clear – and I have not spoken at length about the rule of law and fundamental rights for nothing – that these are also an absolute priority for the German Presidency in Europe. Nevertheless, we must also, so to speak, create the basis for us to work. This includes the medium-term financial framework, including the building fund, and I would like to point out today that we will certainly also need to be willing to compromise with Parliament in our discussion – I also discussed this with the President of Parliament – because I can tell you – as the President-in-Office of the Council will also tell you – that, of course, the ideas are still far apart among the Member States today. What is not acceptable, I would like to say quite clearly, is, so to speak, the duct of the claim to absoluteness of certain opinions which declare the rest of the world absurd. This is incompatible with democracy and tolerance, and then we will not come up with any solutions. I would like to make that very clear here.  (Applause) We will indeed also be talking about difficult issues. Manfred Weber raised the issue of \"own resources\". I would like to draw attention to one aspect here: i understand the subject on the one hand, and it is also a matter for the European Parliament. On the other hand, for example, certain appropriations, which the Commission may now classify as own resources, are already planned in the national budgets. In other words, we must take account of each other, and we must be careful that, at an economically difficult time, we do not use the word 'own resources' to send out actual false tax increases – I am not explicitly opposed to digital taxation, I want to make that quite clear – as a factual false sign, as if we had, for example, general tax increases. That would be a difficult answer now in the difficult economic situation.  With the digital tax, I would like to say the following: of course, it is always better if a tax can be agreed internationally on a global basis, and I therefore think it is perfectly legitimate that we have set out to wait for the work of the OECD, because everything else could then lead us into difficult trade conflicts. We have already seen this in a number of examples in Europe. If, however, no solution is visible here, then we must seriously consider how we can find a solution for Europe here, because it cannot be the case that a certain type of value creation, which is now increasing through digitisation, has, so to speak, come through the area almost tax-free, and I believe that we have already had good successes in international financial market rules in terms of transparency, including tax havens. Unfortunately, working on a digital tax seems to be a little more difficult here.  One last thing: I believe that we need to make a very clear distinction between the euro crisis or the financial crisis that we have experienced in the individual European countries as a result of the global financial crisis and today's pandemic. It is undisputed that we are all in international competition, every Member State, and we can only live our social model if we do not become vulnerable. And if we all have excessively high levels of debt, then we know how vulnerable we become in our model. That is why it was right that there were reforms in the Member States, but in return, of course, there was also a great deal of solidarity. I am thinking only of the structure of the ESM and other things. Today's crisis is a crisis that is not the fault of countries, but a virus that has come upon us, for which no one can do anything, and which has affected the countries in very different ways. If something like this happens, then we need completely different instruments and completely different answers, and that is why I am promoting this building fund.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 16, "date": "2020-07-08.json", "name": "Daniel CASPARY", "mepid": "28219", "text": "   Mr President, Chancellor, I would like to thank the Rapporteur on the work she has done on this I am campaigning that, in view of the terrible economic development of legislation in the Presidency of the Council, we are not simply continuing as before.

We will never approve an agreement that lowers the ambition of the reconstruction plan, that does not give hope and a future to the citizens of Europe. The Commission's proposal is the minimum trade union, it is a starting point, but it certainly cannot be the end of the day, let alone a watered-down compromise.

How can you talk about solidarity? Finally, is solidarity only for you if Germany supports uncontrolled migration and the opening of borders?

I would like to congratulate you on having overcome three taboos of German European policy with the german-French proposal for a reconstruction fund.  The three taboos are: solidarity grants and investment instead of the unfortunate talk of the transfer union; secondly, the question of shared debt, which is used to finance large joint investments, instead of the repeated miserable talk of Eurobonds, and, finally, support for European taxes.  But, Chancellor, this is, of course, a 180-degree turnaround from politics back in the euro crisis. But at the same time, you probably already suspect that something is coming. The question, of course, is this confession must now be more than a one-off. So far, it has been said that the building fund is unique. Yes, crisis management is unique, but the principle of investment financed by solidarity must become the permanent economic policy principle of Europe. If we now act together and in solidarity only once, then your 180-degree turn will be turned into a pirouette in a few years' time. That is why it is so important that the Corona crisis does not allow the rift in Europe to diverge further. It will become clear in this Presidency, Chancellor, whether you want to be a crisis manager or an architect of a stronger Europe. Only if the Reconstruction Fund becomes a lasting expansion of economic and monetary union will Europe take a major step towards a solidarity-based investment union.

I think now it’s needed more than at any time in European history and I think that your decisiveness in presenting the Franco-German proposal has opened the possibilities for the European Commission to present to all of you the unprecedented proposal where we are looking at how we can best combine the next seven-year budget, the next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) with the Next Generation EU instrument. I will not go into detail because I think that the next debate will be very much focused on that and that we will also have a chance to debate it with the President of the European Council, Mr Michel. So let me go a little bit in the other direction – into what else which will be so crucial to the German Presidency. Madam Chancellor, I very much appreciate your strong words on European values, on the importance of solidarity, on underscoring how important fundamental rights are and the fact – which sometimes we forget in the heated debates we very often have in the Council – that cohesion is the sustainable investment into the future and that the successful projects in our Member States are making the whole European economy much stronger, much more resilient for the future. I think this is exactly what you need. I think you saw from the Chamber how much your clear stance on fighting dangerous populism and hatred and the push for rule of law is appreciated by this House and by this Chamber.  I think that we both lived large parts of our lives under a regime where we were longing for freedom, longing for the possibility to travel across Europe. Therefore, maybe for us, it’s a little bit different when we talk about the importance of democracy, about sensitivity for freedoms, about the importance of the Schengen system being restored as quickly as possible, because we know how it was when we didn’t have that opportunity.  So, whatever happens next week, and of course we are all very hopeful and optimistic that we will clinch the historic deal for the European Union, the German Presidency will coincide with the fateful moment in this European debate and in our history. I think if the European Council reaches an agreement, then the real work will start and we will have ahead of ourselves, together with you, a frantic semester of legislative activity to make sure that this investment can indeed re-energise Europe and revitalise the European economy to make it greener, cleaner, more digital and more resilient. And, to answer to my good colleague, Ismail Ertug, I believe that batteries will also be very high on the list of priorities.  To conclude, I would like to thank all of you for this very important debate and to thank Chancellor Merkel for a very ambitious programme for the next six months, which I know had to be adjusted because of the COVID crisis realities. But I believe that today, and in the next week, we will reach a very important agreement which will open a new chapter in European history, a new chapter in European integration.

Mr President, I would like to thank the Yes, I just want to finish.  I would like to thank you for all the speeches. In the second round, the question has once again emerged: advocating the rule of law. We do this on the German side and also name the issues to our colleagues, even when it comes to Viktor Orban and we have disagreements about what is going on in Hungary. I believe that it is above all the absolutely legitimate interest of Parliament, but also of the European Council, for the money to arrive where it should go: that is, on the ground. We will, of course, monitor this together and attach great importance to this.  I can also reassure those who say that we should not just make german-French proposals. We know that Europe is made up of 27 Member States, and yet it is the case that if Germany and France have very different opinions, then most of the time, things are not really going ahead in Europe. In other words, one thing can be done, but never with the claim that a german-French proposal is now a European one, but then work must be done on it, and we will do so next week. I was pleased that the issue of agriculture was raised again. On closer examination, it is, of course, the case that we already have different views on this, if I only mention the keywords 'pillar 1' and 'pillar 2'. But if we want to be an ecological continent, we must also have organic food production, and we must have food production with us.  In other words, we must also accept and recognise farmers in what they are doing, while insisting that the issue of animal welfare be given better consideration, that the sustainable use of land be taken into account. For this, however, the economic and market-based framework conditions must also be made available, so that these constraints can really be managed. I was pleased that the issue of technology has once again played a role here, I think we can now take temporary debt, we can set up a building fund. However, we must then organise the repayment and agree on it immediately. And whether we start there in the next period or not better underline the credibility of the repayment by starting repayment within the next seven years, I think that is important. Permanent indebtedness cannot be Europe's response to international global competition. In other words, we must, on the one hand, rely on new technologies, and I hope that we will also be able to reflect this to some extent in the MFF. It is, of course, a danger if we have the Structural Funds on the one hand, and then, on the other hand, expenditure on innovation. However, Germany will also be in favour of strong funding for technology, especially as I very much welcome the fact that the Commission has adopted the hydrogen strategy today. We also have one in Germany, and many other Member States have one. I think it is good that we have these European projects of strategic interest. In addition to battery cell production, which has now got off to a good start, we will certainly have to do something about quantum technologies as well.  I would like to say to those who ask whether we want to renew Europe: of course, we must renew Europe every day. The world is changing, and if we stop, we will fall behind, so much is certain.  The fact that we have taken the country-specific recommendations as a basis is not a gown! Germany, too, is being criticised there, and rightly criticised, because we need to invest more in the future. We must all get on with this, try to get better and, in particular, use the resources of the Building Fund to do so. This will not be the last meeting with the European Parliament in these six months.

Germany had already taken on ambitious goals, and these will overlap with the difficult challenges facing the whole Union at this point, caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. I am confident of Chancellor Merkel's ability to manage such moments of crisis. The German Government's commitment to the European project is well-known and will hopefully give a new impetus to the European Union. I consider the current situation to be favourable, and the auspices seem to be on the Union side. I urge the current Presidency to pay close attention not only to the Union's difficult internal challenges, but also to the complex international situation, in which the EU is a key player.

More important than the size of the recovery fund and the financial framework, however, is how the money is spent. In order for the debt now to be taken out to create the conditions for future growth, investments must be made correctly. In relation to the proposals now on the table, additional funding must be channeled towards new growth: education, research, defence, digitalisation, the transition towards a carbon-neutral society and investment in infrastructure. In the last MFF proposals, funding for the CEF and defence sectors, for example, has sunk far too low, and leadership is needed from Germany in this. In addition to the Recovery Fund and the financial framework, there are three acute challenges to be solved, in which we must finally move forward. The first is the rule of law, where problems can be addressed when the financial framework is agreed. The second acute challenge relates to immigration policy, for which common solutions must be found before the new immigration crisis.

I will say more about this in a minute, but our initial discussion highlighted that some elements of the Commission proposal were simply not acceptable for a number of Member States. That's why, after our meeting, I launched the process of bilateral talks with all the leaders. I then called a physical summit, the first since the crisis, on 17 and 18 July.  There are three issues in particular that I would like to discuss with you. One is my traditional debrief to you on the leaders' video conference in June. The second is to clarify the outcome of my bilateral meetings with leaders and share with you my intentions for the upcoming European Council. And lastly, I wish to make a strong appeal for ambitious cooperation between the Member States and with you, the European Parliament. We need to work together if we want to make this work. Our last video conference of the European Council on 19 June was the first time EU leaders discussed together the Commission's proposals for the multiannual financial framework (MFF) and the Recovery Fund. This summit was a necessary step to prepare for the decisions we need to take. It served as a bridge connecting the consultation phase to our current negotiation phase. We noted the areas where consensus is emerging. First, Member States agreed on the need to address together the MFF and the Recovery Fund. They agreed that an unprecedented crisis required an unprecedented response and third point - they also agreed that we would focus on the regions and sectors most affected.  But we also observed areas where our views still needed to converge. For instance, the idea of loans for grants is still difficult, even very difficult, to accept for some Member States. Similarly, some leaders showed reluctance to accept the allocation criteria suggested by the Commission because they considered that there is no link in the current proposal with the COVID—19 crisis and the consequences of the COVID—19 crisis.  Last week, I concluded my first round of bilateral discussions. They have been intense and sometimes difficult, even very difficult, but always in a constructive spirit. This allowed me to identify the six building blocks of a possible future agreement on which I think we need to find the right political balance. First, the size of the MFF. Firstly, the size of the next European budget. You know that there are different opinions about the level that is acceptable. And the second point, which is linked to the first, is the question of corrections, the 'rebates', since, for some Member States, this point is essential. For others, this point no longer needs to be. This will certainly be one of the issues that we will have to rely on in a possible comprehensive agreement. The third point is the level of the recovery fund - you are aware of the proposal put forward by the Commission - not all Member States share the conviction that the proposed amount must be accepted. The fourth point, as I mentioned earlier, is the issue of borrowing and subsidies. The very principle of subsidies poses difficulties for a number of Member States. And the balance of balance between borrowing and subsidies is another sensitive issue on which decisions must be taken. The fifth point - I would like to dwell on it for a moment - is the question of allocation criteria under the recovery fund. Many Member States expressed their reluctance in June to the extent that they consider that the Commission's proposal, which is based on pre-crisis data (these data being the level of unemployment, the reverse GDP criterion and the population criterion), is not sufficiently dynamic, adequate, to take into account what the real situation will be in terms of economic impact , and therefore social, for regions and therefore countries and sectors that are more affected. That is why we are testing the idea of taking a slightly more dynamic approach to the allocation criteria in question. Finally, the sixth point, which is a very essential point is the question of the link between this recovery fund, the reforms that need to be implemented in the different Member States and how to organise governance, the role of the different institutions. There is certainly a debate here which also concerns the European Parliament and its role very directly. Also in terms of conditions or links with the recovery fund and with the MFF issue in particular, the question of the rule of law is also an issue that needs to be debated. The issue of the link with climate ambition is also extremely important. You will recall that a few months ago we proposed before the start of the crisis that a significant part of the MFF should be directly linked to our climate ambition. And I would like to remind you that in December we set this very strong ambition for the European Union to achieve climate neutrality in 2050. There are also other issues at stake which I know are crucial to you, the European Parliament. First, own resources and I'm aware that these are key for your agreement. We worked a lot on plastic waste and on the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS). There is some reluctance on that, but we have also looked at other possible resources that have gathered some support, like digital taxation and financial taxation. Flexibility in the MFF for cohesion and agriculture is also an important topic for some Member States and there are two other issues that we need to tackle in order to try to reach an agreement. The first is the issue of the front—loading in the Recovery Fund and the question of the commitments and payments, the timing we need for both, and the issue of the repayments. When do we start the repayments? You know that the Commission proposed to start the repayments not in the upcoming MFF, but in the next one. Maybe it would be useful to propose to start the repayments earlier. Looking at the next steps, as you probably know, I have announced that I intend to publish a negotiating box by the end of this week. Together with the German Presidency, we will discuss this further in Coreper, the meetings with all the Ambassadors, and these processes allow us to prepare thoroughly for our July European Council summit.  I can assure you I am doing all I can to secure an agreement. We need to find a workable solution quickly. My assessment, my impression, after this extremely intense round of consultations over the last few days and the last two or three weeks, since the last Council, is this: we are not yet at the end of the negotiation, a great deal of work remains necessary and my conviction is that we can make progress on the condition that the Member States are determined to cooperate more with each other. My conviction is also that it will be essential, because the crisis is unprecedented, that cooperation between the European democratic institutions is also unprecedented and up to the challenge we are facing.  Be sure that I am listening to this call from the European Parliament to be fully mobilised, to take full responsibility for the decisions that will have to be taken. You can count on me in full partnership with the Rotating Presidency to ensure that, as best we can, we can make progress together. Finally, a common-sense conviction that I must share with you: we will only succeed if everyone agrees to take a step towards the other. If everyone, Member State or institution, remains frozen, blocked, immobilized by its initial problem, there will be no solution and we will not be up to the challenge for this European project that brings us together. The only option is to take a step towards each other in order to be able not only to carry this European interest with ambition, but also with the realistic conviction that one must take into account the point of view of the other, in order to be able to make decisions together. It is this call that I want to make to all of you today. In conclusion, more than ever, this debate is very fundamental, because the amounts at stake are unprecedented in the history of the European Union, at the same time a European budget for the next seven years and a recovery fund, the amounts discussed are indeed totally gigantic. My conviction is that we must be inhabited by three objectives, which we cannot lose sight of, which we must try to achieve in parallel. The first is the objective of continuing what has fuelled this European project from the beginning: convergence, ensuring that we can continue to work, to work tirelessly for the European convergence which is also and will be the strength of this European project.  Working also - recent history has shown - for resilience, the ability tomorrow to be stronger, to learn from this crisis, to learn from this crisis and to ensure that we have the capacity to respond better, more appropriately and stronger. And finally, the third objective that I think must, constantly keep in our political sights: the transformation of the European project on the basis of the digital agenda, on the basis of this need to take into account the climate as an opportunity to make the European Union stronger, stronger, whole oriented towards a future that we must build confidently , in an optimized way. I can see that the issue is difficult, I can see that the stakes are high. Be convinced, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, that I am very determined, not only to move the debate forward in the European Council, but very quickly, as long as it has been able to move forward and take a step forward with a decision taken, I intend, to be entirely focused on positive dialogue, constructive with the institutions and especially with the European Parliament.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 1, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 74, "date": "2020-07-08.json", "name": "Maroš Šefčovič", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission. – Mr President, as we discussed just a moment ago, it’s quite clear that our Union is undergoing a great crisis – one that has engulfed not only Europe, but the whole world. The COVID—19 pandemic has had a horrific human and economic cost. I would say that it also has changed us. Therefore, I am sure that you would agree with me that there is no going back to the way things used to be. Therefore, we must now look to the future. If we act decisively we can find opportunity in this disaster. But for that we need the right tools for the job. As you know, I often say that this Chamber is the heartbeat of European democracy, a place where policy is debated and shaped, but no matter how much we talk about the political priorities, we must have the money to implement them.  Ahead of the European Council next week, I would like to focus on two points with you, both of which hold great significance for our future. First, the state of play with regard to the Next Generation EU recovery plan and the revamped Multiannual Financial Framework proposals.  I really would like to thank the President of the European Council for his very active approach for the very dynamic bilaterals he had with the heads of state and governments of the European Union and for the close cooperation with the Commission. All this is needed, because this is a very ambitious package that responds directly and forcefully to the needs of our Union. The future MFF reinforced by the Next Generation EU crisis instrument will bring the total financial firepower of the EU budget to almost EUR two trillion in today’s money – that’s a very impressive, but at the same time a very necessary figure. It is a necessary response to what is a crisis without precedence in the history of the European Union. It is the plan designed not only to see us through the first years of recovery, but also to ensure our financial programmes can deliver strong support for our priorities until 2027 and beyond.  I would like first to stress that the European Parliament plays, and will continue to play, a vitally important role in this process. Later today, President von der Leyen, together with President Michel and Chancellor Merkel, with President Sassoli, will meet under Article 324 where we will start, through – and I believe thanks to – our leaders, the first convergence of views creating an atmosphere conducive to the compromise which will be needed at the leaders’ summit on 17 and 18 July to which President Michel just referred. The meeting will follow on from the encouraging discussions the leaders had during the recent video conference. Overall, we in the Commission feel that there is a positive dynamic in support of the proposals which I have just described. In particular, there is an agreement that this unprecedented crisis required an exceptional response. There is an agreement that this response should be financed through Commission borrowing and there is also agreement on the fact that own resources really need to be increased. In addition, we feel there is agreement that our efforts should be targeted towards Europe’s most affected regions, fostering cohesion and convergence and that this crisis and the response which we are debating right now will create a unique opportunity to reform our economies and make them greener, more digital and more resilient. The proposed package reflects much of what was expressed by Parliament in the resolution of 15 May. In particular, I would like to thank this House for its continued support for the new own resources. Like you, we are convinced that this is the right approach. New own resources will support our shared objectives. They will help us repay what we borrow for Next Generation EU without compromising the funding of our future programmes. While we are taking a big step forward in the coming weeks by agreeing on the proposals already on the table, we can take a giant leap when we set out new proposals next year. We will soon put forward a roadmap for these extra resources, on how to achieve these new own resources. In the meantime, I count on you to help relay the message, also at home to your governments, to your constituencies and to the national parliaments, as to how much we need their support, because time is of the essence, leadership is needed more than any time before, and we have only a few weeks left. We all know that it’s absolutely crucial for our response to the crisis to reach agreement before the summer break if we want to make sure that before the end of the year we will also complete the process of national ratifications needed for the own resources decision. Not only are we unable to start borrowing without this decision, but if the national parliaments endorse the debate, the results and these new instruments, I believe that it would also ensure the democratic legitimacy of these innovative proposals on an unprecedented wide scale.  To continue, I also would like to underline the fact that this would also help us to create the new tools not only for sustainable economic recovery, but also for clear demonstrations that our democratic rules will always prevail even in times of crisis. So an extremely constructive approach by all institutions is required and therefore I think that we need to listen to each other and factor in our different views at all stages of the process. Certainly, the involvement of this Parliament in all aspects is fundamental. Every euro will be spent through programmes co-designed and co-decided by this Parliament. You will play a strong scrutiny role through the budget discharge and because of legal constraints we are relying on an extraordinary system to mobilise the extra recovery funding, but this should in no way prevent either this Parliament or the Council from playing their roles to the full. Special arrangements will be put in place to ensure that this is the case. We are ready to work with you and the Council on the institutional declaration, to put this on a formal footing and to ensure that cooperation among our institutions is as fast as it can be. As I said already, time is short but I’m confident that with the right mix of ambition, realism and leadership we can deliver for the citizens of the European Union. The Commission will need your help, and we will need to be quick in all phases of negotiations. This includes agreement on our bridging proposal to jump start the recovery plan under the current MFF as well. The sooner we can launch REACT-EU and the solvency support instrument, the better. My second point today concerns Brexit. As you know, my colleague Michel Barnier is today in London where another round of negotiations is taking place. I think it’s very important because we are now less than six months away from the end of the transition period. Together with the United Kingdom, we recently took stock of the ongoing negotiations where we jointly stressed our willingness to undertake all possible efforts to come to an agreement, seeking solutions that will allow us to sign a one-of-a-kind partnership. Since then, as you know, not much progress has been made. Yet the simple truth is that the negotiations will in a few months one way or another. So if we are to reach an agreement, we will have to resolve a number of serious divergences on fundamental issues. These relate to the robust guarantees for a level playing field, a balanced agreement on fisheries, and an effective governance framework.  You of course know these points very well, and you know that they are important for us because of the principles of fair competition, the protection of our citizens – principles which are at the very heart of our Union. We will do everything possible to reach an agreement but here, too, time is very short and no one can say with certainty where the negotiations will lead us by the end of the year. Even if we do reach a deal, many things will still change in our relationship with the United Kingdom – for citizens, for businesses, for administration. We therefore need to plan for these changes and we will continue to assist the national authorities and other stakeholders in their preparations.  Alongside the negotiations, as President von der Leyen emphasised to the leaders, we must continue our work to ensure proper implementation of the Withdrawal Agreement, which is a precondition for the establishment and maintaining of trust. As a Co—Chair of the EU—UK Joint Committee, I can add that we are also moving into a higher gear on this front and will remain very attentive on all its dimensions.  European unity continues to be our main asset, and the European Parliament is of course also in this regard playing an important role in all of its work. I am deeply grateful for your unwavering support as laid out in the report adopted by this Parliament on 18 June.  Thank you very much for your attention and for all the support that will be needed in the coming days and weeks.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 1, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 75, "date": "2020-07-08.json", "name": "Siegfried MUREŞAN", "mepid": "124802", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, I would like to welcome President Michel to the European Parliament. We are listening to you. We are worried, and we do not agree with you. We are worried because you are not informing and not involving Parliament in talks on the budget as you should, because this House is a budgetary authority. And we cannot agree with you because you are going to propose a smaller budget for a European Union that has to do more, and simply we cannot do more with a smaller budget. The EU budget is not the same as magic beans, and does not become bigger just when the members of the European Council look at it. I have to be clear: the European Parliament can only give its consent on the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) if the MFF will finance properly what we have jointly agreed on.  What are our demands? Firstly, that we finance properly the traditional priorities of the European Union – agriculture and cohesion. Secondly, that we keep our promises and finance, according to our promises, the new priorities – digitalisation, greening, protecting the environment, research, development, innovation, external borders, migration. We cannot solve the coronavirus crisis by creating problems in other areas through under-financing. Please convey to the European Council members the following message: we cannot hide a small MFF behind the recovery package.  On the recovery package, money should be well spent. Firstly, it should be spent on modernising Europe, it should be spent on projects with European added value. Secondly, the more money we spend, the better the control needs to be. Thirdly, we need to provide a repayment plan. Every citizen, every enterprise, when they take a loan, needs to provide a repayment plan. They need to say when and how they will pay it back. As the European Union, we should do the same.  Own resources: we should introduce the plastic tax now, pay the interest rates and start repayment before 2027 and have a binding plan, a binding calendar on the other own resources. Only if these demands of Parliament are met will we be able to give our consent in the end. And whatever deal, whatever compromise you reach in the Council, we are ready to talk to you, to negotiate beforehand, because the deal of the Council will not be the final deal; the views of Parliament will need to be taken into account.

In turn, this human catastrophe has caused a social tragedy, because the virus has confined the expectations and future of millions of young Europeans. This generation, which was in the 1920s in 2008 and now in the 1930s, is facing its second economic crisis in just twelve years. Many generations have been forged by traumatic events; events so often marked by fear and uncertainty; life-changing events that force people to take risks. And, on this life journey, time also conditions life. After several months of pandemic, July must be the month for the agreement on the recovery fund and the budget of the European Union. Present and future generations must feel that the European Union is an economic security space in their lives. And, thanks to Parliament's power in this negotiation, I am convinced that we will be able to do so. The Social Democrats will not accept less than EUR 500 billion in subsidies provided for by the Commission. Nor will we accept any kind of macroeconomic conditionality, because we already know what austerity means: weaker conditions for workers and deep cuts in social spending. We cannot allow us to return to austerity policies. And, of course, in the allocation of aid, our support will depend on strict compliance with the rule of law and the proper use of funds. Young people are the least affected by the virus, but they are much more exposed to the economic consequences, so the pandemic cannot be an excuse not to tackle inequality through the European social pillar, with the implementation of the children's guarantee and European unemployment insurance. Because no one in a society can feel safe without a job. Our commitment and solidarity with future generations also requires the transformation of our economy to address the challenges of climate change and the digital revolution. And in order to finance the recovery fund and the ecological and digital transition, without strangling the public accounts of the Member States, we need to address the debate and the proposal of own resources. That is why this debate is so fundamental to us. If the most disadvantaged classes rescued the financial sector in the previous crisis, it is now up to markets and multinationals to contribute to a fair recovery. The bankruptcy of the social pact leads to radicalization, populism and confrontation between generations. The future of a generation and the survival of the European project will depend on the success of this plan. Mr Michel, I ask you — and I also know you will — that, during the negotiations in the coming days with the Prime Ministers, I look you in the eye and ask you this: if we cannot guarantee the citizens that their lives will be better, then why are we here? This Parliament is really clear and we are going to work for it.

Mr President, Mr President of the European Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this recovery plan is unprecedented and it must be the advent of a concrete Europe. The final agreement that will come out of this Chamber will have to change the daily lives of Europeans, from Brest to Athens, from Sofia to Helsinki. For this reason, 500 billion subsidies are a minimum to avoid economic and social erosion.  Mr President, our political family will be vigilant on two points in particular. Two points that will determine our support, or not, for this interstate agreement. The first condition is to make new resources of their own, in the plural, to repay the loan. Let's be clear! We will not satisfy the plastic contribution alone. I recognise that taking a common position on this issue is not an easy task. Nor is it in this chamber. But we did. We have surpassed our divisions, sometimes calibrated our ambitions, to move forward. Today, the urgency of taking out this great loan without weighing on future generations must guide the agreement between states. Let's put the burden on GAFA, multinationals that practice tax optimization, big polluters.  The second condition is a mechanism for the protection of the rule of law, effective and activatable in the facts. That is a value in our treaties. It is no less important than the objective of economic convergence. In other words, we no longer want the autocrats Orban, Kaczynski and their friends to use the taxes of European citizens to establish their autocratic hold in their country, in our Europe.

So I wonder: but what could you possibly tell them? Because, in the end, there are recalcitrants. So what could you possibly tell them? You could say to them: yes, you are afraid of the amount, but frankly what are we talking about? We are talking about 1.5 percentage points of GDP for three years, in the face of a recession that this year may be 9 or 10 per cent of GDP. Compared to the efforts that are being made, for example in the United States, you are talking about \"huge\" amounts, but in reality they are not that huge. So let's put it in perspective. And I'm sure you're already using that argument. The second objection that we can make to you, and to which I am sensitive, is this: are we not finally going to go into debt to, in fact, spend that money on lost funds? In other words, will all this not get lost in unnecessary uses, tax giveaways, what else do I know? And there is the question of conditionality. I know it is a theme that is trapped but I think it is very important. And I think that the conditionalities that are required in the world that we have today are: conditionality in democracy and the rule of law and conditionality in terms of useful investments. And what could be more useful today than to invest, certainly in countries in difficulty, but in tools that will improve the economy of the entire continent? Indeed, it is in the investment in the ecological and solidarity transition and in the investment in the digital transition that the conditionalities must be found. If we really imagine that it is by imposing austerity, as we did ten years ago, that we will improve our common lot, then hello! We tested for you, we saw the results, I think it's completely next to the plate. The last point that I think should be made with regard to the recalcitrants is this: what will they say - pass me the expression - if the result of the non-decision in favour of a European plan is the break-up of the euro zone? I would like to know where the prosperity of the Scandinavians will be, the prosperity of the Austrians, the prosperity of the Dutch when the monetary union is passed by profits and losses. And in its wake, perhaps, European integration. It is a matter that our prosperity, individual at the national level - and here I totally disagree with Mr. Lebreton - depends on the prosperity of the whole. And so I agree that there is no question of investing with lost funds, but it would be a total historical mistake to risk the end of monetary union and therefore the end of the European Union for reasons which, let me put it bluntly, are vulgarly electoralist.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "Verts/ALE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 80, "date": "2020-07-08.json", "name": "Johan VAN OVERTVELDT", "mepid": "125106", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Group. Mr President, I think it is an understatement to say that the corona crisis has seriously shaken the economic fabric, society in general. The worst economic crisis in 100 years. It is now up to the authorities – and, of course, the European institutions – to provide citizens and businesses with the necessary security, because citizens and businesses are in danger of going head-to-head in a tsunami of uncertainty. The recovery fund that has been proposed certainly contains levers that can contribute to this, but I think we need to see this above all in a dynamic perspective.  We don't know where all this is going to lead. There could be new lockdowns. The situation we are experiencing is certainly having consequences that we do not yet know or which we are not yet able to correctly assess. The dynamics of this crisis are therefore of great importance. We still need to continuously assess and adjust the exact impact in the longer term, or adjust and assess it. This also applies to the consequences of Brexit. In other words, it is now a matter of increasing the resistance, resilience, resistance of our society and our economy. In order to guide citizens and businesses through the turbulence we are experiencing, I would argue that, in the context of the multi-annual budget negotiations, the renewal of the economy, the innovative programmes, should be given absolute priority and to be prioritised.  As far as the negotiations on the multiannual budget are concerned, I think it is very clear that Parliament has clearly articulated its objectives and desiderata a long time ago, including recently. There has never been the slightest discussion about that. There is, moreover, great unanimity in Parliament on this. I therefore call on all those involved, including the Council and the Commission, to do everything possible to avoid an interinstitutional blockade. The chances of that happening are real, but we must avoid it at all costs.  I started my intervention by pointing out the importance of combating uncertainty. If we were to achieve this interinstitutional blockade, we would really be in a very difficult place to create a great deal of uncertainty and the European institutions – which may never be the intention – to contribute to a lack of momentum to achieve an economic and social recovery.", "language": "en", "original_language": "nl", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 81, "date": "2020-07-08.json", "name": "Manon AUBRY", "mepid": "197533", "text": "  on behalf of the GUE/NGL group. Mr President, as we debate today, the European Council is secretly negotiating what you deceptively call the European recovery plan. But behind this bombastic name, how dare you talk about a recovery plan when the funds will have to, at least in part, be reimbursed rubies on the nail by the European peoples? Because you mustn't be fooled! Until there are sufficient own resources, the debate on the distribution between loans and subsidies is at least partly theoretical, because it is ultimately the European states that will have to repay, and therefore the European peoples who will have to pay the bill. How dare you talk about a stimulus package when it is really a meagre 0.5% boost to European GDP when it will fall by at least 8% in 2020 alone? How dare you talk about a stimulus package when only a quarter of the funds will be available by 2023? It is now, right now, that the Member States need money. But European aid will arrive after the battle. At the same time, the European budget will probably be reduced and that is the danger we are hearing. So, simple sleight of hand, give with one hand and take back with the other.  How dare you finally talk about a stimulus package without any democratic debate being held to define its direction? Who can guarantee here in this Chamber that Parliament will have a say in ensuring that the funds are not allocated without social and ecological consideration? No one. Who can guarantee that this plan will avoid the cascade of social plans that has already begun across Europe with thousands of layoffs in companies like: Nokia, Airbus, Renault or Sanofi, some of which for that matter, have taken advantage of the crisis to make profits, like Sanofi. No one. The only certainty we have at this stage is that the Commission will come out stronger to impose austerity on the Member States. I note, moreover, that Mrs von der Leyen is becoming increasingly clear, as President of the European Commission, about the return by the small door of the European Semester and therefore of budgetary control and austerity imposed on the Member States. This recovery plan, as you understand, is therefore very badly named. If there is a revival, it is your liberal ideology, not the economy. In the end, it looks more like a broad communication plan to swallow the pill of new liberal reforms. And yet another path was possible. First, by allowing Member States to respond quickly to the crisis through direct loans from the European Central Bank and partial cancellation of their debt. Then, by putting in place a vast ecological reconstruction plan, financed by a tax of multinationals, polluters and billionaires. This is what we need today: a plan and implementation, not a slogan, nor a communication operation or a staging - as is the case at the moment, with the famous Franco-German couple.

In the recovery plan as it is today, I can’t see the guarantees that the funds go to the most desperate European citizens, enterprises and SMEs, and I can’t see the guarantee that the funds will not lead to an increase in Member States’ debt that will eventually lead to austerity and an increase in social inequalities. I’m appalled by the idea that funds are distributed by governments that are in cahoots with either corporate businesses, on the one hand, or with a domestic oligarchy on the other. How can we expect that under such circumstances, funds will go where they are most needed? These guarantees should be included in this agreement before the Recovery Fund, and the MFF, are adopted.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for the various interventions, for the messages that are addressed to me.  I recognise that, on the methodology, I do not fully understand what Mr Mure-an has said, because I have the impression that the cooperation between the European Council, the Commission and Parliament is unprecedented and we will continue to mobilise to ensure that, not only on the formal level, as is the case today, before a plenary assembly , we will continue to mobilize to ensure that there is permanently this close dialogue. And I am convinced, I repeat, that we will all have to demonstrate an ability to be creative, to innovate, to reach out to each other. It is not by repeating almost threateningly, hour after hour, day after day, that progress will be at the rendezvous, it is indeed by having the sleeves rolled up, with the intellectual will to conclude an agreement that we can actually reach an agreement that must meet in my eyes, I can not be clearer, a very specific objective : a robust Europe, a strong Europe. The facts have shown that, that is what we need. And those who make the illusion that it would be the national retreat, that it would be the scraping that would be the solution are wrong. We do need strong, robust Member States that are up to the challenge and we need a European Union that can carry this forward-looking ambition with a clear vision of the levers at our disposal.  And we have a clear vision of the levers we have, we know that the climate agenda, we know that the digital agenda must be priorities. Coincidentally, the fact that it is now that we will decide on the next European budget for the next seven years, must lead us to learn the lessons, in the budget, and to take into account the consequences of COVID in the next European budget, in parallel with the launch of a very exceptional fund which must be, I think, , a moment of transformation for the European project. Mrs Hayer, I think, is right: the issue of own resources is a very important issue which can be a turning point in the history of the European project. Perhaps that is why this debate is so difficult from a political point of view, because there are indeed different views on how to look at this debate on own resources. And, I note, in the different political families represented in the European Council, as is the case in this European Parliament, opinions do differ. I thank Mr Lamberts who, with goodness, with great realism and common sense, says that the majority is not like unanimity. In the democratic context, there are institutions for which the majority allows us to take the step forward and then then say that Parliament is united. I heard the first round of the table, I did not hear exactly the same messages expressed a few moments ago. But there is indeed a majority of Parliament which has a common position and that is very good, it is a very strong encouragement that I take into consideration. In the Council, we must work to try to achieve unanimity, this is not simple and to try to be ambitious it is essential for me, that is why I am fully mobilised. Finally, the rule of law and values. I believe, as many have said, many have expressed, that we must also consider that governance, the rule of law, fundamental values, is the backbone of this European project and, in this sense, we must take this political moment into account in order to move this ambition in the right direction as well. And then I conclude by saying that, from my point of view - this is also revealed by this crisis - prosperity, it is not just measured by an indicator that would be quantitative growth. For decades, we have considered progress to be measured by a parameter, with a criterion that is the percentage of GDP. Well, this element, it is interesting, it is not enough. This does not reflect the concrete impression that citizens, in a country or within the European Union, have a better life than it was the previous year or a few years ago.  It is in this, I think, that, in this transformation project, which I believe we must implement, perhaps we must also ask ourselves how. When one carries this conviction of economic reform, of social reform, how can one have this democratic debate which tends to set the objectives that one wants as a society on the European plan? The question of the quality of education, the question of the environment, the question of the reduction of inequalities, access to quality and indiscriminate health care are certainly parameters that we must take into account in order to measure the progress that is possible through this European project which must bring together and not divide.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 84, "date": "2020-07-08.json", "name": "Andrey NOVAKOV", "mepid": "107212", "text": "   – Mr President, I will speak my mother's Bulgarian language.

I was quite extensive in my introductory remarks, so now I can be much briefer. I would just like to react to the four most frequent issues which have been highlighted by the honourable Members.  The first is the sense of urgency mentioned by Mr Mureşan, by Mr Lamberts and by Mr Andresen, who made reference to ‘Zeit, zeit, zeit’, and also to Mr Tajani, who highlighted how important it is to send a strong signal now. I think that this should be the absolute priority for our leaders. I think we cannot wait any longer. We need to get a deal at the next European Council because that would be the best signal, the best response we can provide, first to our citizens. It would be the best response to the crisis. It would help us to secure jobs, and I think it would be a very important sign to our global partners, financial markets and representatives of industry that Europe is back, that we are overcoming the crisis, we are introducing new policies and will be emerging from the crisis stronger than when we entered it. A second very important group of remarks referred to the social aspects, to the thrust of the policies to make sure that we would underpin the green and digital transformations together with resilience. There have been some question marks on how all this would be organised, so I just want to reassure all honourable Members that the recovery plans would be drafted by the Member States themselves. Of course we want to make sure that the issues, the accumulated problems which have been building up in all Member States year by year would be tackled. Gradually we would be removing them and by that we would really be achieving the resilience which should be stronger in our Member States and for the whole European Union.  The Commission will, of course, be in a close iteration process with our Member States and we are ready to inform the European Parliament, as we always do, under the consultations, under the structured dialogue, under the hearings, when it comes to the European Semester process. The European Parliament will have strong oversight over all expenditure as it does right now when we are reviewing expenditure on an annual basis. This was also, I would say, the thrust of the remarks by Ms Aubry, Mr Pieper, and also by Ms Hohlmeier, to make sure that this process is transparent and that the role of the European Parliament is properly maintained. As Ms Marques suggested, I think right now we have the first meeting of our leaders and Presidents under Article 324 and, as I said in my introductory remarks, we are ready to make a proposal for institutional declarations which would really put in a very clear framework how we see our close cooperation among the institutions on the important parts of implementation of Next Generation EU and the MFF in the future.  The last point, which was raised by Ms Virkkunen, who was our last speaker, but also by Mr Benifei, Ms Hayer and Mr Cormand, was on own resources. Indeed this is a very important question, because we have to propose new ways of how we are going to pay, with money which would be raised on financial markets, to finance our resilience and recovery instrument.  We are considering, as was highlighted, the emission trading system; also the carbon adjustment mechanism, but also an own resource based on operations of enterprises in the European Single Market and the Digital Tax. We continue to work on our plastics tax and on some other ideas which are coming along in this process of deliberations and discussions.  What we want to propose to you is that we are ready to work on the roadmap, on how we want to assess, when we want to propose, and how we want to debate these potential new resources because we know that it’s important for this Parliament. It’s also very important for the national parliaments, because as you know, if we want to increase the ceilings of our resources and financing, we need to get the support of all EU Member States’ national parliaments. So to conclude, I really would like to thank you for your support, for the sense of urgency, for your readiness to cooperate in the very dynamic way which would be needed for the next Semester. I’m very much looking forward to our debate.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. This is a first for me today, a very special moment. I have been a Member of my home Parliament for 22 years and I have now been Minister of State for Europe for seven years, but I have never been allowed to speak before the European Parliament. I am not doing this ad personam, I am doing it for the Council. I am very grateful for this opportunity and I look forward to the next few months. I am always at your disposal and I look forward above all to constructive and critical cooperation at this difficult time. The fight against money laundering and terrorist financing is one of the central issues of the German Presidency. As you know, it is also an issue to which the Council as a whole is very committed. Parliament, the Council and the European Commission have worked closely together in recent years to create an effective system for combating money laundering and terrorist financing. We have made considerable progress here, not least in the legislative field, and this is, of course, mainly due to your commitment, ladies and gentlemen. I would just remind you of the amendment of the anti-money laundering directive, the banking package, the regulation on the European Banking Authority and the new legislation in the field of criminal law and the use of financial data for law enforcement purposes. However, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, this is really no reason to rest on any laurels, as we are still too often reminded that there are still alleged cases of money laundering involving European banks. This must be unacceptable to all of us! In the meantime, there has been a wide-ranging political debate in and between the institutions of the European Union on how to make our framework for combating money laundering and terrorist financing even more effective in the future: what needs to be done, where do we simply need to improve? Your resolutions, our conclusions and the Commission's communications are exemplary for these considerations, but of course we must not stop at the deliberations.  I would like to mention a few examples which also show how we have been engaged. In December 2018, the Council agreed on a concrete action plan to combat money laundering, the implementation of which we are continuing to monitor. In December 2019, the Council adopted strategic conclusions in which it invited the Commission, inter alia, to look at ways and means of achieving greater harmonisation in the area of combating money laundering. And the question must be examined of the advantages and disadvantages of a supervisory body located at European level. As the latest example of our commitment, I mention the Council's conclusions on improving financial investigations, which was approved on 17 June, a few weeks ago. Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. We agree that we need to make substantial progress. On 7 May, the Commission presented its current anti-money laundering package. On the one hand, it contains the Commission's action plan and, on the other hand, it provides in particular for very important legislative proposals to be presented in the first quarter of 2021. Our Presidency warmly welcomes this package of measures and we propose that this important issue be put back on the Council's agenda. In particular, we intend to give the Commission further guidance in the form of Council conclusions, on the basis of the Commission's action plan. We hope that these conclusions will help the Commission to draw up the legislative proposals that it intends to present next year, so that we have a system for combating money laundering and terrorist financing that has the greatest possible impact. There's really still air up there. Ladies and gentlemen, i have so far, in the preparations for this item on the agenda, given the impression that you, as a Member of Parliament, the European Parliament as a whole, the Commission and the Council alike, are aware of the urgency. What is more, I would like all of us to have the utmost political ambition so that we can tackle the major problem of money laundering in the European Union even more effectively than has been the case so far!", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 107, "date": "2020-07-08.json", "name": "Valdis DOMBROVSKIS", "mepid": "28618", "text": "   Executive Vice-President of the Commission. – Mr President, thank you for this opportunity to present the Commission’s approach to fighting money laundering and terrorist financing. We have made a clear commitment to deliver a comprehensive approach to fighting dirty money, to better protect our economy and financial system in the future. This is one of our top priorities and I know that they can count on your full support.  The Commission fully shares the European Parliament’s view that it is high time to create an effective enforcement policy in this field, where all the pieces fall together and where the roles of the private sector, and the competent authorities in the Member States and in the EU are clearly set out.  The Commission adopted an action plan on 7 May on a comprehensive policy to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing. This ambitious and multifaceted plan sets out measures that the Commission will undertake over the next 12 months to better enforce, supervise and coordinate the EU’s rules on combating money laundering and terrorist financing. Our aim is to shut down any remaining loopholes and remove any weak links in the existing EU rules. Any flow of money of dubious origin, any company created without a real business behind it, any offer from a suspicious investors to buy property – these all create opportunities for criminals and we must crack down on each and every one of them, wherever they are in Europe. Our first and most critical objective is to make sure that everyone in both the private and public sectors applies the relevant rules rigorously. The Commission is doing its bit. We have launched numerous infringement procedures to ensure full transposition and application of our two core directives, the Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AMLD 4) and AMLD 5. Since I took office in December, the Commission has referred three Member States to the Court of Justice for non—transposition of the Fourth Anti—money Laundering Directive. We have sent out three reasoned opinions for the incomplete transposition of the Fourth Directive, issued four letters of formal notice for non-conformity in the transposition of the Fourth Directive and 17 others for non—communication of measures under the Fifth Anti-money Laundering Directive. We have also closed nine cases for non—communication under the Fourth Anti-money Laundering Directive, recognising the important efforts undertaken in some Member States. AML rules must be effective. That is why Commission proposed in May to issue country—specific recommendations to 11 Member States in this area. The European Banking Authority now has additional powers and I expect it to use them in full. In terms of the next steps, I would like an EU AML supervisory body to conduct systematic on—site checks in Member States. We need to build up our preventive capacities. But we also need to go further and strengthen our rules and tackle remaining weaknesses.  Let me highlight some key issues. Cases of online money laundering are on the rise. Authorities in all Member States should have the powers to freeze suspicious transactions of this kind. However, we are also aware that the way rules are currently implemented is not optimal for legitimate businesses. Clearer and risk—based rules will avoid companies facing unexpected consequences due to divergences in the way rules are applied. Our rules should not make life harder for honest operators.  Honourable Members, the Commission fully concurs with you – national supervisors cannot supervise rules on their own. This has become abundantly clear from the string of scandals we have recently witnessed. Dirty money is highly mobile. If it is dealt with in one Member State, it moves to another one with weaker supervision and enforcement. Dirty money should have nowhere to hide. This is why we will have to establish EU—level supervision. An EU supervisory body would require direct supervisory powers over the riskiest financial institutions, with oversight for the non—financial sector. Different options for EU supervision are possible, as set out in our consultation. We may propose a new EU agency or add to the responsibilities of the European Banking Authority, depending on the feedback we get and on our own assessment. However, if the European Banking Authority is to become the EU supervisor, both its track record and governance will have to improve. Let’s be clear, an EU supervisor cannot effectively enforce AML rules in the EU unless additional flanking measures are in place, and they are critically needed in three directions. First, our work towards better preventing and fighting money laundering will be supported by the European Public Prosecutor’s Office, Europol and Eurojust, but also through better protection of whistle—blowers with a comprehensive new regime that Member States will need to transpose by the end of next year. Second, we will set up a mechanism to improve how suspicious flows of money are tackled and reported and better coordinate this analysis across Member States. We know that too much money laundering takes place across borders. Third, AML does not stop at the EU borders, so strong rules and enforcement in third countries is also essential. Not all countries, however, have strong regimes in place.  The new methodology issued alongside the action plan provides the EU with the necessary tools to take action. In this respect, I commend the positions taken by both the European Parliament and the Council with respect to the delegated act on the list of high—risk third countries, which recently entered into force.  To conclude, to effectively fight money laundering, we need to act in multiple directions. Let me assure you that the Commission is fully ready to play its part to ensure that our internal market and financial system are protected from criminals. The Commission thanks the European Parliament for steering as this debate towards a successful conclusion.

Criminals earn EUR 160 billion per year, 1% of the Union's gross domestic product, and each year taxpayers lose 825 billion in uns paid taxes and another 50 billion in VAT fraud. This money laundering, unfortunately, is largely unpunished. According to Europol, 99% of the profits of criminals are not confiscated and are available to them. We must remedy this problem if we are to build a fairer society. Recent scandals, such as luanda Leaks or the murder death of Daphne Caruana Galizia, show that Member States are not doing enough and that Europe is not leading in this area either. That is why we believe that the European Commission should take a more ambitious approach and Parliament adopts this resolution, with a large majority, with five demands which I would like to stress. First, the creation of an anti-money laundering supervisor with sufficient resources. Second, the creation of a European financial information unit to eradicate the most sophisticated forms of evasion. Third, use the European Public Prosecutor's Office to combat bleaching.

The Commission has made very clear, including to Member States, that we are going to be very assertive about proper and timely transposition of these directives and also, on the way forward, that we need to move away from directives to regulations, at least in a substantial part of the legislation, which will allow for more effective direct enforcement at EU level, and we need EU—level supervisors.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. We are all dealing with an exceptional health situation which has a massive impact on our societies and our people. At this moment, we are certainly thinking of the more than 100 000 Europeans who have lost their lives so far because they have been infected with COVID-19.  In these weeks, we are discussing very intensively what we can learn from this serious crisis for our health care and for coordination within the European Union in the context of an effective and as preventive fight against pandemics as possible. We are also, of course, talking about the massive social and economic consequences. Last but not least, the Federal Chancellor has once again made it clear that this is one of the major priorities of the German EU Presidency, and I am sure that all of us, including here in the European Parliament, share this commitment to make every effort to ensure that we come out of this serious crisis as quickly and as united as possible and as united as possible. However, I would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere thanks to the nursing and health care workers who have done immeasurable work in these difficult and dramatic times to protect human lives and provide the best possible care for patients. In order to shape the European Union's future public health strategy, we need to be honest. We must talk openly about what has been achieved, but we must also talk openly about what has failed and, above all, what was our weakness at the beginning of the fight against the pandemic. Only then will we be able to respond better, faster and more comprehensively to another crisis in the future, and we all know that this crisis is far from over. We are still dealing with a very volatile situation. In some countries, the committed approach has been able to contain the crisis, the pandemic. But also in Europe, and also in our immediate neighbourhood, we see that nothing is certain.  We must therefore be vigilant, and this, of course, in liberal democracies such as ours, always involves an imposition on the population. This too has been the subject of intense debate here in the European Parliament, but also in the Member States: how can we protect the health of citizens without disproportionately restricting citizens' freedoms and constitutional rights? That is why our Presidency aims to adopt conclusions on the lessons of the COVID-19 crisis in order to gain useful insights for future action. I would like to thank you for the great interest and commitment you all devote to this issue.  Globally, and not only in Europe, the pandemic continues to spread faster. We have around 200 000 new cases every day worldwide, and we all know – and this is obvious – that a global crisis of this magnitude naturally also requires global responses. No country, however good health care, is in a position to fight this pandemic on its own. This also makes it clear that a policy of national isolation, a policy of small-stateism, a policy that weakens Europe and the European Union, always goes along with unacceptable risks to the health of our citizens. It is a very painful experience, admittedly, ladies and gentlemen, but perhaps it also encourages us to work together even better in a spirit of solidarity and shared responsibility than we have done so far in order to overcome the pandemic. This means a lot of work that lies ahead, because we will not be able to deal with the economic crisis successfully until we have also combated the virus in the long term. A comprehensive and successful strategy to overcome the pandemic for Europe and, of course, for the whole world requires the development of safe and effective vaccines and therapies, as well as equal access to them. The pandemic can only be defeated once and for all if it is wiped out everywhere. A lasting solution can only lie in science and solidarity.  The European Union is committed to making newly developed vaccines against COVID-19 a common, public, global asset that is available to all who need it. What we need is a vaccine for Europe as well as for the rest of the world. There can be no cannibalisation of \"everyone against everyone\", but we must all stand together here. Here, too, we are all to protect people's health, wherever they live, in Europe or in the world.  I am very pleased that the European Union, together with its international partners, has pooled its forces within the framework of the global crisis response initiative. A record amount of EUR 16 billion – as of 30 June – has now been raised to accelerate the development, production and delivery of vaccines against COVID-19. We must act decisively so that we can take the next steps. So we need safe and effective vaccines, we need to encourage their mass production, so that all people really have equal access.  In this context, I would like to thank the European Commission for its recent legislative proposal to enable the rapid conduct of clinical trials on COVID-19 vaccines and therapies, and I also thank the European Parliament for the decision to adopt a position on this dossier today. I am pleased to inform you that the Council approved this dossier last Friday.  As regards the elements of the European Union's future public health strategy, the Commission has recently proposed an ambitious EU for Health programme as part of the Multiannual Financial Framework and the Building Package. It reiterates that health in the European Union must be given a higher priority and that we need to be better prepared for health crises. One thing has been shown in the crisis: high-quality health care is still a great protection for our people from such a pandemic. That is why we give this dossier a very high priority in the Council, and we hope that, with your support, we will be able to adopt this dossier at the end of the year. We look forward to working very closely and with confidence with you on this important proposal.  However, it is also crucial that we improve the availability of medicines, medical equipment and other crisis-related goods in the Union. You know how this started at the beginning of the crisis. That was not ideal, but I think that we, as the European Union, and the Member States have also drawn the right conclusions. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the problems arising from the European Union's dependence on third countries for the production of pharmaceutical active ingredients, raw materials, pharmaceuticals and medical equipment. Now we do not want to take globalisation off the hook – by no means! However, it must be ensured that, for key goods that guarantee the protection of the citizens of the European Union, we can ensure, on our own European strength, that these funds are also produced in the European Union – that is, European sovereignty. We must, of course, also be better able to deal with these crises, gather information, evaluate assessments and then act quickly in the event of a crisis. Close cooperation is essential for this, between the Member States and the institutions, bodies and agencies of the European Union, such as the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control or the European Medicines Agency, as well as with international organisations such as the World Health Organisation. One of our objectives is to strengthen and develop the functioning of these European institutions and agencies.  The EU for Health programme should focus on the lessons of the pandemic, while supporting longer-term projects. It should focus on the availability of medicines, vaccines and medical devices, reducing the number of antimicrobial-resistant infections and the EU's role in global health policy. In addition, the programme will also serve to implement the EU's medicines strategy and the European plan to combat cancer, which the Commission intends to adopt at the end of the year.  The Corona crisis has once again painfully demonstrated to us the need to expand our digital capabilities in healthcare. We need to overcome the fragmentation of health data and improve EU-wide implementation within the health system. In their recent conclusions on the shaping of Europe's digital future, the members of the Council have called for the creation of a European area for health data. I would also remind you of the controversial debate about an EU-wide app that can be used everywhere to protect people even better, and there is also a Need for improvement, you all know that at least as well as I do.  Equally important is the reference to the fact that investments in health are also made possible through other instruments of the Multiannual Financial Framework. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. One thing is clear: health will be a central area of activity at European Union level in the future, and this is not at all painful for the Member States, because the pandemic has shown that we need more Europe here too, a Europe that is more capable of action, because it will benefit the interests of the citizens. And the COVID-19 pandemic has also given us the opportunity to reflect on what measures we need to take to overcome the current pandemic and prevent future health risks. Together we can make the European Union and the world a healthier and safer place. Many eyes are on us, and we should show that liberal, democratically constituted societies are able to deal well with such serious crises, which lead to existential hardships for many people, and that our primary objective is to protect the people of the European Union, but also to provide solidarity at global level.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 8, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 18, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 139, "date": "2020-07-08.json", "name": "Marcel KOLAJA", "mepid": "197546", "text": "  We will now continue with the debate on the Council and Commission statements on the EU’s public health strategy post—COVID—19 (2020/2691(RSP)).

Today we meet as countries relax restrictions and open up for travel: a chance for people and our economies to breathe after months of lockdown. But this is an opening which comes, as we all know, with considerable risk. Whilst no one knows with certainty how the coming weeks and months will develop and while it is still too early to speak about life ‘post-COVID’ (I speak of the ‘new normal’), it is certainly the right time for us all to reflect. We need to reflect on the painful lessons we are learning. We need to reflect on the areas we need to improve and where our actions should be strengthened to protect the EU from future cross-border health threats. And we need to reflect on what the EU’s role in health policy should be more broadly, in respect of Member States’ responsibility for their health policy enshrined in the Treaty. Next week, on 15 July, we will present an Action Plan setting out a number of immediate short-term actions to help EU Member States prepare for and manage possible new outbreaks of COVID-19. I want to be absolutely clear: a full-blown second wave is, unfortunately, not inevitable. It is, however, up to us to control it and prepare, if and when it comes. Our actions should focus on reducing the burden on health systems, particularly if new outbreaks coincide with the influenza season in the autumn and winter. COVID-19 has shown us very clearly that a united approach is critical, but that we must also strengthen the EU’s current preparedness and response mechanisms to better protect the health of our citizens. Many, including members of this House, and our citizens, have called and are calling for a stronger role for the EU on health. I cannot but agree, and say that I stand ready to work on this together. As a first step, we should increase our capacity to support Member States. This will require stronger and more operational EU agencies. In the coming months we will be proposing to strengthen the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, to improve its coordination capacities and its mandate to respond to health crises. We will also be proposing to strengthen the European Medicines Agency to ensure it can effectively coordinate our actions in preventing medicine shortages. We also want to look at how to strengthen our EU framework on cross border health threats. Beyond the immediate priorities, now is also the right moment to reflect on the EU’s competences in the area of public health, and its limitations. I, for one, have, from the very beginning, said that we need more Europe in the area of public health. The Conference on the Future of Europe provides an excellent forum to really debate this, whether we need to look again at who does what between the national and the European level, and particularly so as regards threats that touch us all, regardless of borders. Even within the deepest crisis, however, come opportunities – opportunities from what we have learned. Strengthening the strategic autonomy of our health and pharmaceutical systems is a case in point from the current crisis. With our proposed EU4Health Programme and the unprecedented EUR 9.4 billion envelope we proposed, we send a very clear message that public health is a priority area for our recovery, that we have been listening to citizens, that targeted investment in crisis preparedness and stronger health systems for the future is key. What is now required is very close cooperation and a swift agreement between Parliament and the Council in the coming weeks and months to ensure it can be delivered. I fully count on your support to take the ambition forward. In parallel, and I am very aware of the importance, our new Pharmaceutical Strategy will be coming later this year – an opportunity for us to ensure and reinforce the strategic autonomy of our pharmaceutical sector and ensure access and affordability of essential medicines for our citizens. I have been in contact with stakeholders for this strategy over the last few weeks. The next six months are critical. Now is not the time to let our guard down. The situation remains very fragile, and we see this in a number of Member States. Stable numbers change very quickly. A safe and effective vaccine likely remains the only permanent solution to this pandemic, but this is still some time away. Together with the Member States, we are fully engaged in negotiations with vaccine manufacturers to ensure access to vaccines when they become available. We will ensure that the EU continues to play a leading role in international efforts to develop, manufacture and deploy a universally-accessible vaccine for all Member States of the EU, leaving no one behind, and for the world. We are not going to say ‘us first’. We will continue to support countries inside and outside the EU to protect all people from new outbreaks, especially the most vulnerable. Solidarity will remain key, because it saves lives. And here I just want add that from the beginning of this pandemic, I have held over 26-27 meetings with all the Health Ministers and I am in constant communication with them, because this is the only way that we can build up this level of coordination, consensus and working together so we can deal with what it means to move forward. We need to pool resources, we need to tackle jointly the issues that affect all of us. This is the first and possibly the most important lesson learned from this crisis: we need to respond to the expectations of our citizens, ensuring a stronger role for the EU when citizens’ health is at stake from threats – threats which do not stop at national borders. And we all have a collective duty to ensure that.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 12, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 141, "date": "2020-07-08.json", "name": "Peter LIESE", "mepid": "1927", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report and for the way in which In March/April, at the beginning of the pandemic, I went back to practice like many medical professionals. And the first thing I noticed when I asked my colleagues was: we didn't have masks. I had to look patients with fever and cough in the throat without being able to protect myself. It was a queasy feeling for me. For many nurses and doctors in Bergamo and Madrid, this has meant that they have become infected and that they are no longer alive.

This time, the text of the joint resolution presented really reflects a broad agreement across the political spectrum. Today we are facing an unprecedented situation, and new unprecedented solutions must also be based on this. Old tutorials and corny \"business as usual\" will not help us now, we need fundamental reform. Health care in the European institutions has always been such a Cinderella, it also shows that around 10 people are doing it in the European Parliament and we all know each other well. The COVID-19 pandemic has shown in full banity that the EU does not currently have sufficiently strong tools or competences to address extraordinary health problems. The establishment of a Health Union along the pattern of other deeper integrations seems absolutely necessary in today's light. However, I am afraid that we are able to achieve something similar with the incoming German Presidency, because it is the German Government that has been blocking for years the completion of negotiations on, for example, the HTA Regulation, which, from today's point of view, is a complete step in the area of expanding cooperation. For me, the question of where we need to move is the joint purchases of medicines by the Member States, at least in the case of those for rare diseases and vaccines. As far as vaccines are concerned, intellectual property rights, such as patents, should not restrict rapid access to them and other treatments. Scientists around the world developing these vaccines and treatments often use huge amounts of public money. Large pharmaceutical companies should not profit from this pandemic at the expense of people's health, and they should not pay for research already paid for with one of the public money. GUE/NGL wants to ensure guaranteed access to COVID-19-related diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines for all.

It therefore makes no sense to plan new health strategies if we do not first make a great political choice, which sees investment in health, research and welfare not as costs, but as an answer that we must give to our citizens, who ask us to be treated in the best possible way, with high medical and health standards, regardless of the macroeconomic conditions in the country in which they live. The Stability Pact must therefore not only be suspended, it must be permanently cancelled even after the COVID emergency.

In other words, we must now learn that we are not only setting up pandemic plans that will take effect immediately – because this will not be the last pandemic, we must be clear about this – but we must also address the health systems in the various European countries to the extent that we create framework conditions that must be taken for granted, for example, framework conditions for the Under-examination of infants and young children. in order to alleviate or completely avoid and reduce misery, hardship and suffering in advance through early detection.

We know that some 33 000 people in Europe die from antibiotic resistance, which is something that may actually also be important to consider in the face of future health crises.

A great deal was said and I must say I share much of what was expressed. Peter Liese said that health threats do not stop at borders and I think that we have all been witness to this. He spoke of the situation that we had with PPE when we had the shortages, as many of you have also pointed out, and I wanted to just say here that in EU4Health, as part of our crisis interventions, we have strategic stockpiles not only of PPE but also of medicines and vaccines that can be deployed to Member States for any crisis when needed, because it does not mean that COVID-19 will be the only crisis that we will be faced with. A number of you have said that no Member State can cope with this on their own, and I think that we have all seen this. Some of you have also mentioned the issue of subsidiarity, and I want here to be absolutely clear. Even within Article 168 as it stands now, there is a great deal that we can do. In EU4Health all the actions that are promoted are within Article 168, so there is a great deal that we can do and it is still a game changer for health within the EU.  Ms Trillet-Lenoir used the word tragedy. She said that and I immediately shared that feeling with her because for myself in the last five months, if I may say this, it has never been just about numbers, it has never been about waking up every day and being told about the numbers of new cases and the numbers who lost their lives because behind every number there is a story, there is a person. So yes, we have been seeing a lot of personal stories and tragedies in the last months and we need to do something. We have already mentioned that part of our vision and ambition is changing ECDC and EMA and strengthening our agencies.  As Ms de Sutter has said, prevention is part of EU4Health – prevention, the issue of One Health, the issue of looking at non-communicable diseases as well, and really stepping up on promotion and prevention and building up the resilience of health systems. These are part and parcel of the objectives of EU4Health.  Ms Konečná said that we have an unprecedented situation, and this is why we need an out-of-the-box and unprecedented solution. This is what EU4Health is: an ambitious and innovative proposal that can be a paradigm shift within the EU.  Ms Rondinelli said our European strategy is possibly too ambitious and not realistic. I agree with her that it is ambitious, she is right, but it is realistic and it has to be ambitious if we’re going to be able to make a difference to the lives of European citizens. It is a dedicated programme for the next seven years.  You spoke of better coordination that we need at all levels and of course we must ensure that working together the European Union remains as one of the healthiest regions of the world, so we need to look at it in that way and as a matter of protecting human and patients’ rights as you have said. You mentioned the budget. Yes, we are aware that there are issues with this and we’re looking at it with our legal department, but we do depend on you to support the MMF so that we can move forward and, of course, Next Generation EU because only by doing this are we going to be able to move forward with programmes which are ambitious and innovative such as EU4Health. Last, but not least, Mr López mentioned the issue of health systems’ resilience. This is included in EU4Health, and I also want to tell you that the issue of stress tests are going to be included in next week’s communication. So all in all, you have touched on very many issues which are already in the programme. The way we are working as a Commission,  we are working very closely now going forward with the European vaccine strategy because we are very aware that the virus is still circulating amongst us and no one is safe until everyone is safe.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. Thank you for the inspiring debate. I can only agree with those of you who have just stressed once again that the virus does not have a passport and does not care about national borders. In this respect, no one should be afraid of an ideologically charged debate about competences. No one is being taken away from anything – the opposite is the case. In the face of this crisis, we all have a duty to ensure that we better protect people. In this respect, it is a question of regaining the ability of the European Union to shape things that, in a globalised world in the face of a pandemic, no longer possess the nation-state. What are we talking about at the heart of it? I am grateful that we have achieved a high degree of agreement on this.  Firstly, the European Union must help to build high-quality health care throughout the European Union.  Secondly, we need more European sovereignty, less dependence on third countries, for medicines and essential goods.  Thirdly, we need more exchange and coordination. Especially because we were very afraid at the beginning, it is important to learn from each other and from each other.  Of course, it is also important that the institutions of the European Union – Parliament, the Council and the Commission – send a clear signal to the citizens that hygiene and distance regulations must be respected, precisely because we are fighting for a free Europe, for a europe without borders. And it is more important than ever in the holiday season, when many people are still worried about whether they can travel at all, that we are sending a clear signal here too: no one has to be afraid, but we must be vigilant.  Then, of course, it is also a question of ensuring that the vaccine that we hope to find soon – which science, research will hopefully find soon – is available to all people and that we do not exclude anyone here. It is also, of course, a question of us fulfilling our responsibilities in the world and, above all, in our neighbourhood. I am a little concerned that no one mentioned it. It has been said time and again that the European Union is incapable of acting. We have supported the Western Balkans alone, worth EUR 3.3 billion, in the decisive and far-reaching fight against the pandemic there too. Solidarity is also needed here, not only within the European Union, but also towards our neighbours.  I would be very pleased if we could reach a rapid agreement. The German Presidency is very prepared to do so, as far as it can.

The place where your crib is located should no longer determine the number of healthy years of life.  Thirdly, protection of the people on the front line must be paramount. Not only the many healthcare workers, but also employees who can be exposed to the virus on a daily basis. Prevention through a healthy working environment is also an essential part of this. Our respect for those who take care of care must be more than symbolic applause.  Let us learn lessons, not only for another crisis, but also structurally.

However, the COVID-19 epidemic has shown that in cases of critical risks to public health, cooperation between all Member States is required to protect public health and to coordinate appropriate actions. These unprecedented pandemic experiences identify 3 areas where closer cooperation between Member States is indicated, coordinated throughout the European Union, namely: – ensuring the supply of medicines and medical devices for the EU4Health programme, the New Pharmaceutical Strategy and the EU Medicines Shortage Report, – ensuring the supply of strategic supplies such as intensive care equipment, respirators and personal protective equipment , – digitisation of healthcare: we must place great emphasis on health computerisation activities and on the development of remote forms of care, including telemedicine and efficient data collection, respecting privacy principles, as well as the possibility of efficient exchange and comparability.

Of course, the EU Public Health Strategy should respect the fact that financial resources and competences in the health sector are mainly at the national level. However, health threats do not stop at borders.  There are many steps the EU can take to better prepare for future crises and to ensure the health and well-being of our citizens: a Health in All Policies approach; increased funding for health research and innovation, hospital infrastructure and health services; strengthening cross-border healthcare cooperation and adequate human resources healthcare capacity throughout the EU.

The new regulation would be science-based and strengthen the resources and mandate of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). The regulation should also set a minimum level of investment in health in order to ensure that member states' health systems are well prepared for future pandemics.

We need stronger cooperation in a wide range of policy areas to better protect our citizens, to act more effectively, to keep pace with medical progress and to improve the health of our citizens.
