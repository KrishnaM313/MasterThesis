[{"id": 0, "date": "2017-11-15.json", "name": "Ryszard CZARNECKI", "mepid": "28372", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Mr President, common values such as human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and human rights are the cornerstone of the European Union. Each Member State must therefore respect, protect and promote them.  After the debates in January and September 2016, this is the third time that the Council has been asked to intervene in this House on the situation in Poland. The continued debate on these issues shows again that the protection and promotion of the rule of law and human rights are a constant challenge. This challenge requires unwavering attention and efforts across different policy areas. The Presidency – and, indeed, all of us – agree that the protection of the rule of law, democracy and fundamental rights in our Union cannot be taken for granted. We also agree that there is never a time to be complacent about the state of fundamental rights protection in Europe. Our core values are put to the test every day as we are facing multiple interrelated crises, be they in the area of migration or internal security. Ensuring the rule of law is an absolute priority and has to be our joint commitment, of the Member States and EU institutions together. Equally, fundamental rights need to be upheld and defended as our best guarantee for sustaining stable, open and free societies.  Only one month ago, on 12 October, the Justice and Home Affairs Council had an exchange of views with the Director of the Fundamental Rights Agency, Michael O’Flaherty, on the priorities in the protection of fundamental rights. After this debate, the Council adopted conclusions on the application of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights in 2016. These conclusions reaffirmed that democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights lay down the foundation of the European Union and our societies.  A few days later, on 17 October, the Council held its annual Rule of Law Dialogue. This year, the specific focus was on media pluralism and the rule of law in the digital age. Let me assure you that the rule of law, including the independence of the judiciary and the balance of powers, are at the heart of our concerns, and the EU is not alone. Our strongest partner is the Council of Europe, which is fully engaged in the promotion, protection and development of human rights and the rule of law.  According to our information, the Polish authorities are in contact with both the Venice Commission and the European Commission, following the opinions and recommendations issued. The Council has already been informed twice about the situation in Poland by First Vice—President Timmermans, and I am looking forward to the update he will now present to us on the latest developments. From the Council side, it is worth mentioning that on 11 July this year, the Ecofin Council adopted country—specific recommendations in the context of the 2017 European Semester, of which one specific recommendation concerning Poland addressed the issue of the rule of law. The issues raised go to the heart of our commitment to the Union. We therefore trust that all sides will act responsibly and constructively to reach a swift solution that leaves no doubt about our core values.

It is not my intention to repeat everything I said then, it would take too much time, but let me start by saying that an issue pertaining to the rule of law never affects only the country concerned: it affects the whole construction of the European Union. That is the basis upon which I believe this Parliament’s engagement is so important. I want to recall that on 26 July the Commission adopted a third Rule of Law Recommendation addressed to the Polish authorities. This was necessary after four laws adopted by the Sejm would have had a very significant negative impact on the independence of the Polish judiciary and would have increased the systemic threat to the rule of law. Two of the four laws were sent back to parliament by the President of the Republic. The recommendation also recalled the situation of a systemic threat to the rule of law, resulting from the changes to the Constitutional Tribunal, which have led to a serious undermining of its independence and legitimacy as the result of its complete recomposition, contrary to the normal constitutional process for the appointment of judges. Moreover, the Polish executive persists in its refusal to publish a number of the Tribunal’s rulings. Unfortunately, the Polish reply regarding the third recommendation did not announce any concrete measures to address the issues raised by the Commission. We have now sent four letters to the Polish authorities since July, inviting them to meet. Sadly, these invitations were not accepted. I have not had the opportunity to talk to Polish Ministers about the issue. So our exchanges have essentially been in writing. That said, my invitation still stands, and I hope I can have a dialogue with the Ministers of Justice or Foreign Affairs as soon as possible. In parallel to the Rule of Law Recommendation, the Commission has also initiated infringement proceedings in relation to the Polish Law on the Common Courts Organisation, which discriminates against individuals on the basis of gender. This is contrary to Article 157 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and to the 2006 Directive on Gender Equality in Employment. In our reasoned opinion, the Commission also raised the issue that giving the Minister of Justice discretionary power to prolong the term of office of judges who have reached retirement age, as well as discretionary power to dismiss and appoint court presidents, would undermine the independence of Polish courts. To be very clear: the Minister of Justice in Poland is also Chief Prosecutor and the Chief Prosecutor now has full discretionary powers to appoint and dismiss presidents of courts. Just let this sink in for a moment. The Commission understands that, on the basis of this law, a considerable number of court presidents have already been dismissed. The Commission is currently finalising its assessment of the Polish authorities’ reply, with a view to deciding on the next step. President Duda also presented two new draft laws on the Supreme Court and on the National Council for the Judiciary. The Commission is now analysing these new draft laws very carefully and will follow closely the related developments. At this preliminary stage of our assessment, the Commission already notes that certain issues in connection with the new draft laws could raise serious concerns. The Commission will continue to assess these issues thoroughly and objectively, including in the light of the Venice Commission opinions which will be forthcoming in December. The Commission is not alone in its assessment of the gravity of the situation. Other critical opinions have been issued on the draft laws, not only in Poland by the Supreme Court, the Council for the Judiciary and the ombudsman, but also at European and international level. I would refer to the recent opinions of the European Network of Councils for the Judiciary and the Consultative Council of European Judges. I would refer, too, to the preliminary observations by the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, who also takes the view that the independence of the judiciary is under serious threat in Poland today, and has expressed serious concerns about the two draft laws on the Supreme Court and the National Council for the Judiciary. Every Member State carrying out judicial reforms must respect the rule of law as one of the fundamental values to which all Member States signed up when joining the EU. It is up to the Member States to organise their justice systems, including whether to establish a council for the judiciary, or not. However, where such a council has been established to safeguard judicial independence, as in the Polish constitution, the independence of that council must be guaranteed, in line with European standards. So let me recall for the record what it is that the Commission expects from the Polish authorities to avoid further escalation. First, the Polish authorities should restore the independence and legitimacy of the Constitutional Tribunal as guarantor of the Polish Constitution. Second, the Polish authorities should bring the Law on the Common Courts Organisation into line with Union law by abolishing gender discrimination and by abolishing the Minister of Justice’s influence on judges through the retirement regime and the dismissal or appointment of court presidents. Third, the Polish authorities should bring the law on the National School of Judiciary into line with European standards on the independence of the judiciary by eliminating external influence on assistant judges, notably, again, by the Minister of Justice. And finally, the Polish authorities should bring the two new draft laws on the Supreme Court and on the National Council for the Judiciary, proposed by President Duda, fully into line with EU law and with European standards on the independence of the judiciary and the status of councils for the judiciary. The legislative process on these two draft laws, which is about to commence, will provide a key test for the Polish authorities, to show to the outside world whether or not there is willingness to respect the rule of law and take full account of the Commission’s concerns and the forthcoming opinions of the Venice Commission. The Commission is looking for real, constructive dialogue in order to redress the situation in Poland with regard to the rule of law. This Parliament’s support for our efforts is essential if we want to succeed.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 2, "date": "2017-11-15.json", "name": "Janusz LEWANDOWSKI", "mepid": "23781", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - It is the fifth time that the European Parliament reacts to the abuse of power in Poland, because this is what this debate is about. What I feel today, I will express in the words of my compatriot, who recently committed a desperate act of self-immolation in the center of Warsaw: \"I am ashamed that I have to explain to my Western friends that Poland is not the same as the Polish government.\" The source of this debate lies in the Polish government, in the abuse of the mandate, which was won in democratic elections, but it would probably be weaker if people knew that they were voting not only for a wide distribution of money - which helps the poor, but debts the country - but that they also vote on trampling on the constitutional order, an independent judiciary, and even cutting down the last existing forest in Europe, but also on prosecuting participants of peaceful demonstrations, as well as tolerating manifestations of xenophobia, racism and neo-fascism on our streets. It is all very clearly visible. This cannot be hidden. Some new iron veil will not come down. Polish democracy is doing well only in the imaginary world created by the media, also appropriated, which have become the mouthpiece of government propaganda. But this imaginary world ends where your daily brainwashing ends. In fact, no government has ever so quickly ruined the international position of its own country, has so quickly and so painfully compromised its country on the international stage. And it is about Poland, which we could be very proud of as a collective work of Poles, reaching for the highest positions in the European Union, the greatest funds, influence, and translating its ideas into European Union programs, such as the Eastern Partnership, and the energy union. The question arises about the future of Polish women and Poles, and it is not only about respect, image, money and influence, but about safety. Today's loneliness of Poland, the self-exclusion of Poland, is completely contrary to the Polish raison d'état and the lesson that history has taught us. Because it's like someone he asked that the curse of Polish fate, the curse of Polish geopolitics, would return. Free and democratic Poland has friends in a free and democratic European community, not in Turkey or Belarus. The free world, the democratic world stands up for Poland as a member of its own family, it stands up in the name of the principles which hide wisdom through trial and error. The wisdom of how to organize a free society to protect civil liberties from dictatorship, how to organize a good economy that thinks about the next generations. These are the principles of our constitution and EU treaties. Whoever breaks them takes away people's freedom at first, but in the end may also take people's future. The current ruling camp has a certain inconvenience when we recall how it behaved when it was the opposition, how gladly it was here, in the European Parliament, he initiated various hearings, interrogations, which, moreover, had no meaning, because they were unreliable and relied on untruth. But then the current PiS MP - the ruling party - cheerfully tweeted (it was December 2014): “It is good that the opposition organized a public hearing in the European Parliament on the threat to democracy (that is, they initiated it). We are in the Union, this is also our Parliament. \" Yes, this is our European Union, this is our Parliament, but we are not looking forward to these debates because we do not want to be ashamed of the rulers of Poland.

I am well aware that your government will try to pass this debate off as yet another attempt to rage against Poland. It's false. We love your people and we love your nation. We have done everything possible, as Vice-President Frans Timmermans pointed out, to keep the dialogue open with the Polish authorities, and we continue to do so today, as Timmermans said, ready for dialogue. But dialogue is divided into two, and if there is deafness on one side it is difficult to make a dialogue. We are always open to discussion, as long as the principle on which our living together is based is not questioned. First principle: freedom, democracy and the rule of law. The European Union is not a restaurant, which one enters and serves à la carte, but it is a democracy that lives, it is a community of values ​​to which all its members are bound. This morning I would have liked to discuss how to defend the rights of Polish citizens in the face of the consequences of Brexit, how to prevent many young Poles from having to leave their country to go abroad, and instead we are all hostages of the Polish government, which does not he comes to Brussels to deal with the problems of his citizens and continues to provoke us with an attitude of closure. I ask the Polish authorities: you say you represent the majority of Poland - you have had the votes, yes certainly - but your fellow citizens have never given you any mandate to attack the independence of the Constitutional Tribunal, to reduce the autonomy of the judiciary, so why do you do this? The real truth is that your attempts to undermine the independence of the judiciary are a weapon of mass distraction from the difficulties you face in government. You lied to your constituents and you don't want to confront you on concrete problems. But behind your projects there is also another thing, another deeper thing. There is contempt for liberal democracy, hostility towards human rights and constitutional rules, the cult of the law of the strongest, and seeing the streets of Warsaw manned by far-right squads last Saturday reminded me of the darkest pages in European history. To all Poles, to those who oppose this government today, but also to those who voted for it, to all Poles I say that we will not leave you alone. The Socialist and Democratic Group with its Polish delegation is close to the Polish people. We are not against Poland, we are against deviating from the linear path of a rule of law. We want this path to be corrected. We want Poland to fully experience its being a central member of the European Union.

Ladies and gentlemen! As a man a bit experienced in politics, I thought there was a limit to shamelessness, but after what I heard from my colleague Lewandowski, I change my mind: there is no limit to shamelessness. Well, you can fall even lower than the Lord fell today, telling these incredible things. I just can't figure out so far that there's really no inner moral control, that you can say such gross, untrue things. Outrageous! Please state! As for the substantive answer regarding the reform of the judiciary and contacts between the Polish government and the European Commission, I sent it to your mailboxes. You have very detailed, precise information on this subject. If any of you want to engage in a dispute with me on this subject, I am of course open. However, here in this room, as during the previous editions, it is not really about any dialogue. This is not a debate. Well, let's face it - this is another Orwellian screening. This is a show of strength in relation to the Poles and the Polish government. This is not about the rule of law. It's not about values, it's about power, right, who has the power. This is another version of the same. After all, a few or several hours after the announcement of the bills on the judiciary, our colleague Weber and other MPs had already launched a pan-European, anti-Polish campaign. After all, Mr. Weber does not speak Polish. He did not know the content of these laws. He did not know any expert opinions. He wasn't interested at all, but he already knew. Just a couple of hours and we have to launch this wave, this next crusade against the Polish government. Besides, the socialists did the same, the liberals did the same. Is this an invitation to a debate? This is not an invitation to debate. Do not kid yourself. You have some obsession, some persistent compulsion when it comes to the Polish government, right? You could see you keep coming back to it. (Applause) Come on people, have mercy. This is also an example of the incredible arrogance that is widespread among the political elite in Western Europe, not to mention the media. Well, the German media. I do not know what to call it, what is written there about Poland. This is some anti-Polish orgy, or simply dyrdymały. These are complete dyrdymales. It's such a Niagara of lies that instead of six and a half minutes, I'd have to be six and a half months to get it all straight. Well, I can't do that. Or the barbaric behavior of the German Defense Minister. Just like, without trying, Soviet diplomats, too, did pledge to help their friends in the satellite countries. Or President Macron's statements about Poland and other Eastern European countries. These are some of the ... I see in this the old colonial habits that show up here. And this Eastern Europe suddenly dares to do something, right, to decide about itself, amazing, without our knowledge. Please acknowledge that the process of empowerment in Eastern Europe is taking place and that you, I do not know what you have been doing or not doing here, will continue. As for the Commission, President Timmermans, I have actually said everything in previous debates. Please don't tell me here that the Lord represents the law, that the Lord represents values. All these actions of the Commission against Poland are unlawful actions which violate European treaties. And the fact that these actions are stuck here in Parliament does not make them any less unlawful. You have the majority here. You can vote anything you want, even if two plus two is five. But the truth is, these are illegal activities. These are also - I have spoken about it many times - these are the double standards that are inherently associated with your name in Poland. You are a party to an internal conflict in Poland and you do not hide it, do you? When various bad things happened in Poland, then The Lord was silent. When bad things happened in Spain, you spoke here in such a way that it was not really known what you were talking about. If a tenth of the things that happened in Spain are happening in Poland now, you would change here into Saint George who fights the dragon. (Applause) The Commission, unfortunately, has this bad habit of simply ignoring all the responses of the Polish government and repeating the same thing over and over again. The Commission calls it a dialogue or an invitation to talk. Mr. President, this is not a dialogue. This is not an invitation to talk. There is a concept that suits this. This is an ultimatum. You say: it has to be done, and if not - you will be punished. It's more or less a dialogue, right, Commission style. This is what Shakespeare called the insolence of office, right? This is the insolence of the offices or the insolence of the authorities. You can do anything. You believe that you can say anything and command everything. (Applause) Ladies and gentlemen! It won't really hurt Poland. We dealt with bigger problems. It harms the Union.

(Interjections from the floor) If there is one sensible, reasonable, colleague of ours, sometimes even a little bit boring, then it is Mr Lewandowski. And to say that he has lost his senses, well, I think it is the Polish Government that has lost its senses and not Mr Lewandowski. (Applause) Mr President, on Saturday 60 000 fascists marched in the streets of Warsaw – neo-Nazis, white supremacists – and I’m not talking about Charlottesville in America, I’m talking about Warsaw, Poland, 300 km more or less from Auschwitz and Birkenau. Well, I have to tell you, I thought that it should never happen in Europe, and that it should never happen also in Poland; certainly not in Poland, because we do not have to give lessons to Poland. That’s not the point. It’s the place where, before Magna Carta, before Habeas corpus, there were free cities, a beacon of creativity and of freedom. It is the country that liberated itself from two authoritarianisms, from fascism and communism, and they did it alone.  And at the same time it is also, since their entrance into the European Union, a country that was really at the heart of Central and Eastern European democracy, and moreover also of economic growth, before Germany. So there is nothing to say about Poland – we are not attacking Poland. What we are attacking and what is being said is that over the last two years there has been a government, and behind that government there is a personality, Mr Kaczyński, who thinks that he can copy someone – and I apologise to the PPE Group – namely Mr Orbán, who also thinks that he has to establish illiberal states everywhere in the European Union. To copy Mr Orbán is, I think, not in the interests of Poland and Polish society and Polish citizens. And that is the point of our intervention today.  And unfortunately, in this case, we will ask you, Mr President, to activate Article 7 – and not, I have to tell you very clearly, to punish any Polish citizens. That is not the point. My proposal is even that, when we have sanctions, the European money should go directly to Polish cities, to Polish civil societies and to Polish citizens, because we can never allow Polish citizens to be the victims of this reactionary agenda of the Polish Government and of Mr Kaczyński.

I would like them to understand that we are not punishing a member country, that we respect the multiple sovereignties of which the Union will increasingly have to be composed. The reason why we will adopt a third resolution on Poland is to remember together the reasons that keep us united, the legal foundations that all member countries have signed up to. I mean the rule of law in the deepest sense of the term. I invite you to read recital E of the resolution. The rule of law is distinct from the rule by law. Rule by law means government by law, where the law is the act used by those who exercise power on the basis of a parliamentary majority. Rule of law is a notion in which a substantial concept of law enters, as a set of fundamental rights, independence of judges, separation of powers, free expression, rights of refugees and women. Whoever wins the elections obeys this set of rights, does not grant them. Once elected to this Parliament, we all have the task of representing all citizens of the Union, without distinction of nationality or constituency, and at the same time the primary duty to ensure that the foundations of citizenship, fundamental rights and freedoms, are fully guaranteed. By asking for Article 7 (1) to be activated, we are asking for nothing more than to honor this commitment and to take responsibility for continuing open dialogue with the government of a Member State.

Somewhere in the debate someone comes and says that there are two measures. That it is a political game. That one country is tackled and the other is not. That the ruling party still has a majority in Parliament and that all decisions are therefore democratic. Also, someone will say that changes to the constitution, the composition of the Supreme Court or the financing of newspapers in another Member State are regulated in exactly the same way. And then someone really gets blazing because the people and the country are not treated well. Mr President, those are you-tots and you-tots kill the debate. Ventilating concerns about laws passed by a government is not the same as attacking a population. It is important that we do not lump the people, the country, the government and the party together. Because the majority exists by the grace of the minority. And those are also members of the population, including people with rights and needs. The way to debunk your bins is to show that we embrace them, that we are critical ourselves, that we are willing to identify the shortcomings in our own system and that we do not look away from abuses, in any European country. So today we are debating the actions of the Polish government and not the country or the people. The Greens see a trend of shrinking civil liberties.

The logging ban in Białowieża Forest is being ignored. Women's right to self-determination is under threat.

Ladies and gentlemen! Let's establish some facts. First, this parliament has absolutely no right to judge the actions of a sovereign Polish state. Why? Because on the one hand, we have a European Parliament here, which is an empty shell. He is some kind of European joke. On the other hand, we have over a thousand-year-old Polish state. Poland will continue long after the entire history of the European Union turns into one tiny paragraph in a huge textbook on the history of stupid political doctrines. Secondly, this whole debate was summoned by the inspiration of some Polish-speaking politicians to cover up their political problems in Poland, to cover up their re-privatization scandals, the memory of their inept rule and the current lack of any idea for Poland. These Polish-speaking politicians looked too much at the party of treason, the Rzewuski and Szczęsny Potocki families, and dreamed that they would rule Poland by the grace of Brussels or Berlin lords. Third, this parliament is reaching the heights of hypocrisy and hypocrisy in today's debate. So everything is fine in Spain, where there are riots, where there are over seven hundred wounded, where there are political prisoners. So everything is fine in Germany, where political censorship is rampant. So everything is fine in Belgium, where the military has to patrol the streets in fear of Islamic terrorists. But it is not fair in Poland, where a legally elected government keeps its election promises. Hypocrisy, hypocrisy and falsehood - that is what this debate is. Ladies and gentlemen! A few days ago, on November 11, we celebrated the anniversary of Poland regaining independence. We regained freedom thanks to the titanic work of wise Polish politicians and the high national awareness and our society.

The first words I ever heard a Polish person say were ‘Be not afraid’. Growing up in Malta, Saint John Paul was our inspiration, and he still is. To me, Poland will always be the nation of my Pope of Solidarity, who stood up to be counted when it was easier to sit down – a land that inspires hope and has symbolised courage in the face of so much adversity. Poland joining the European Union was the crowning moment for the children of that revolution and it proved just how far the nation had come. We cannot allow it to take any further steps backwards. But Poland has been let down by those leading it, who are weakening the democratic institutions and safeguards in the country, and who think that having an electoral majority means they can now do what they like. That is not how it works in our European Union. The rule of law is important because it is our fail—safe to protect democracy. It is the basis of everything. In a time of free and social media, it is absolutely impossible to hide the truth and the true picture of the deplorable developments in Poland. We have eyes and ears. Nobody has to inform Brussels what is going on – we already know. Human rights and the rule of law are in increased danger – and no one is here to attack Poland. Poland is a country that must be at the very heart of our Union, but, to that end, it must respect the rule of law. Its leaders must engage with the Commission in a constructive dialogue, and must respect the people who are courageous enough to stand up to them. Yes, we still have serious concerns about the proposed law on the National Council for the Judiciary and about the proposed law on the Supreme Court. These must be addressed. We must send a message that we will not stand idly by while the very bases of democracy and the rule of law in Poland are being undermined. We must insist that the Polish authorities respect their moral and legal obligations as an EU Member State. In conclusion, I look to my Polish colleagues – colleagues like Mr Lewandowski – and I look to Poles demonstrating that the Polish nation and the Polish Government are not one and the same. I know that Polish courage is something which still inspires. These are Polish patriots, standing up for Poland, and I salute them. Be not afraid.

In a democracy, you have debate: you have dialogue, questions and answers and an exchange of positions, and he just gives a monologue and leaves. That is called cowardice. What I did not hear in his totally irrational seven-minute rant was one single word of condemnation of the fascist march and the fascist slogans of last weekend. It was just a rant, and I have not heard where he stands. I would also like to hear about the rest of the ECR Group, because by not speaking out they are tacitly agreeing with the position of the PiS Government. Think about it: do you want to distance yourself from this, or do you want to side with a government that does not condemn fascists and that is restricting the freedom of other NGOs? Think very carefully about where you stand.  The government speakers represent – or claim to represent – the Polish people, as if there is only one opinion and one truth. Do you know what that is called? Absolutism. This is an authoritarian government that does not respect pluralism and does not respect the opinions of others. We know better, because we have seen the thousands who took to the streets to protest against the government – thousands of very courageous people, many courageous women – who spoke out against the government and for pluralism, for democracy, and for civil society.  So, Mr Legutko – who is not here – if you are asking for respect, then why do you not respect others? You have no respect for women’s rights, no respect for LGBTI people, no respect for people who do not share your religion, and no respect for people who do not share your opinion.  What I find very striking is how much the agenda of the PiS Government looks like the agenda of Mr Putin. They are always saying ‘we don’t like the Russians’, but their agenda is identical to that of Mr Putin. (Applause) Finally, I would like to say that this debate is not about Poland; it is about the rule of law. I welcome the words of the Council, but now we need some action. We need a real, broad mechanism that applies to all the Member States and that does not leave it to the Member States to judge themselves. We need a broad, independent mechanism, as has been proposed by the European Parliament.

This connection between the attack on democracy, the attack on women's rights and the increasingly fascist authoritarian regime is so obvious. However, not all colleagues in here actually see it.

He is representing one voice in the Polish debate. I actually asked my Polish friends what they would like to hear mentioned in this debate and, in no time, dozens of people answered by messages, emails and comments. Many points were brought up: amongst others, the government’s reaction – or non—reaction – to the fascist march last Saturday; LGBTI rights; minority rights; the question of free elections and free media; independent courts; the cutbacks to NGO funding; teachers’ rights; the question of Białowieża Forest; and also – over and over again – women’s rights and sexual and reproductive rights were mentioned by Polish citizens, and I wanted to bring this up in the debate.  But the story that took my breath away, I must say, was the story of Piotr – a middle-aged man from a small city in Poland who burnt himself in the middle of Warsaw in protest at this government. He wrote a manifesto, bringing up demands that he would like to see considered by the PiS government in Poland. One thing that he said really struck me. Despite the fact that he wants people to stand up against this government, he said, ‘remember, however, that the PiS electorate are our mothers, brothers, neighbours, colleagues and friends’. This is not about fighting a war; it is about creating a dialogue, and I think it is now on us and Mr Timmermans to create this dialogue and to stand up for the rule of law and for Polish citizens.

It is indeed an inverted hierarchy of values. It is a profound misunderstanding that Poland is undergoing a reform of the sick state and the judiciary.

It is a little strange, but oh well. What I wanted to say is that Mr Timmermans really encapsulated it all when he started, when he said: ‘I hope I can have a dialogue with the Polish authorities’. But we are not having a dialogue with the Polish authorities; we are not having a dialogue with the Polish Government either. It is again a bit like yesterday – poor Mr Matti Maasikas who has to stand up for something which I am sure he would rather not have to stand up for. The Polish Government is just as absent as their loudspeaker in this House, who gave out a seven-minute statement about essentially not much and then left with most of his colleagues and spent the rest of the morning with the Polish press – his friends, I suppose – outside of the plenary hall. This is the way in which this Polish authority, this Polish Government, this Polish majority, acts. Sophia in ‘t Veld was totally right when she explained that. It is apodictic; it is absolute; we are all wrong; we have no idea what is happening there; we get it all wrong and they are all right. The problem in Poland is that they are trying to change the state and to model it so that generations to come will have no chance to change it back for the better.

Poland was a respected partner in the EU but now its political clout is being tarnished. The new Government is busy justifying its unjustifiable breaching of the rule of law. The strength of our European family is the rule of law. It is about shared values and democracy, an independent judiciary, freedom of assembly and freedom to demonstrate, and women’s rights. Poland, like all of us, embraced those values, and the family cannot be fully functioning if one of the Member States breaches the trust between us.  With our resolution, we are reaching out to Poland. We call on the Government to listen to the voice of its own people and to the independent European institutions, to engage in constructive dialogue, to reconsider its action, and to address the legitimate concerns raised by the European Commission and the Venice Commission. These concerns are based on hard legal facts, not politics. It is not Europe against Poland – it is Europe with Poland. We want to cooperate with the Government, and it is in their hands to avoid further action by the Commission. Turning their backs on this opportunity is leading Poland, together with populists and Eurosceptics, nowhere other than marginalisation, and it is creating tension.

Dat hij mij persoonlijk aanvalt, vind ik geen enkel probleem. Dat ben ik gewend, dat raakt mij niet. Maar dat hij de beweging waaruit ik voortkom aanvalt en de sociaaldemocratie beschuldigt van collaboratie met totalitaire regimes, kan ik niet laten voorbijgaan. Sociaaldemocraten waren de eerste slachtoffers van de bolsjewieken. Sociaaldemocraten waren de eerste slachtoffers van de fascisten. Sociaaldemocraten waren de eerste slachtoffers van de nazi's. Ze hebben zich altijd verzet tegen totalitaire regimes. Ik laat dat dus niet passeren. Zeker niet uit de mond van iemand die misschien eens in de geschiedenis van zijn eigen beweging kan duiken voordat hij de geschiedenis van andere politieke bewegingen durft aan te kaarten. Mr President, we are talking today about the rule of law in Poland. If you want to play football you abide by the rules of the game and you accept the fact that there is a referee that makes sure that those playing the game abide by the rules. If you join the European Union, you do this as a sovereign decision. You sign and ratify a treaty. Once you have signed and ratified a treaty, the rules of that treaty apply to you. Then if you simply say ‘I am a sovereign nation, I don’t care about the rules’, it is like saying: ‘I want to play football but I will determine for myself which rules I will apply and which rules I will not apply’. Then you cannot play football!  The European Union cannot function if Member States start saying ‘We pick and choose which rules we have adhered to, are applicable to us, yes or no’. I think this should be the starting point of our debate. Concretely, in Article 2 of the Treaty, all Member States have said very clearly that they will respect the rule of law. One of the fundamental elements of the rule of law is that you accept and maintain a separation of powers. An independent judiciary is essential in the rule of law. You cannot pick and choose and use the argument that you have the majority to simply ignore the law. You can use that majority to change the law. You can use a majority to change the Constitution if you have one, but you cannot simply say ‘I ignore it because I have a majority’. You cannot use democracy against the rule of law and this is the argument that is often used in this debate.  Just imagine, I would say to those of the European Conservatives and Reformists Group (ECR) who still remained in the room, just imagine the shoe were on the other foot, and in this Parliament a majority would say, ‘Hey, we have the majority, we don’t care about the Rules of Procedure of Parliament, we have the majority, we dictate what happens!’ In what position would you then be? The rights you now claim for yourself as a majority might not be granted to you once you no longer are a majority. This is a fundamental problem for Europe because, as some of you have said, once you have destroyed the independence of the judiciary, even if you lose an election, the new powers that be will have no other option but to try and revert it and then it becomes a perpetual machine of not respecting the rule of law. This will never stay limited to one Member State. If it happens in one Member State it affects the Union as a whole, and this should never be disregarded. Had Mr Legutko still been here I would have said to him: you took seven minutes to say nothing, not one word, about the points I made about the independence of the judiciary. And I would also have said to him, after his vile attack on Mr Lewandowski, I would suggest to Mr Lewandowski to wear this as a badge of honour. Why? Because in the last two years, I have learned that if you have no arguments, if you have nothing to say, if you don’t know how to react, you start with personal attacks. This is also my experience in the last two years. So every personal attack on me is proof that they have no arguments, that they don’t know what to say and that they don’t have a point at all.  Finally, you know the old joke about the ‘ghost rider’ [driving the wrong way on the motorway]. Somebody is sitting in his car listening to the radio, and on the radio the announcer says ‘Be careful, on the A2 there is a ghost rider driving the other way’ and the person sitting in the car says: ‘One? I see hundreds!’ This is how I would react to Mr Legutko. It is not the European Commission only. It is not the European Parliament only. It is organisations of European judges, it is the Venice Commission, it is the United Nations. Are all these people wrong? Are all these people wrong? Is the only one who is right the PiS government in this? They will say yes! But if you want a real dialogue, at least have the courtesy to go into the points that are made.  And a final remark about what Guy Verhofstadt and others said about last Sunday. There is a very thin line between proud patriotism and terrible nationalism. It is a very thin line. I admire proud patriotism but I also believe that all those who believe in proud patriotism have a responsibility not to let that slide into terrible nationalism, because if we fall into the trap of nationalism we bring back to life the most terrible parts of European history, and some of this was seen on the streets of Warsaw last Sunday. I do applaud the fact that President Duda clearly said that he distances himself from the expressions of extremism, of anti-Semitism, and other expressions.

I did not want to participate in a show of hatred without any substantive foundations. G. Verhofstadt's statement only confirmed the rightness of this decision. At that time, I decided to lay flowers in KL Natzweiler, a German concentration camp set up near Strasbourg in occupied France. Over 50,000 people passed through the camp and the sub-camps scattered around it. prisoners, over 22 thousand. was lost. Among the prisoners from 30 nations, Poles were the largest group, including those of Jewish origin (13,606 prisoners). The museum was burnt down by neo-Nazis after the war. Although there was a collaborative government in Vichy in France during World War II, no one tries to attribute to the French participation in the Holocaust, as it is easy for Poland to do. Such \"random\" mistakes do not happen in the modern world. I pay tribute to the victims of the KL Natzweiler concentration camp, which was one of the thousands of links in the extermination industry planned and consistently implemented by Nazi Germany.

There is an important question: has there been no breach of the European Convention on Human Rights in previous legal solutions? I answer: yes - it did. Here are some examples: 1) Polish law does not guarantee a minimum standard of protection to individuals evicted from their real estate. Selling premises with tenants in Poland leads to a real violation of basic human rights; 2) Polish law tolerates depriving Polish citizens of their acquired rights regarding pension rights, which recently applies to officers of uniformed services, mainly those who ended their service in the People's Republic of Poland.

Freedom of the press is also under threat in more and more EU countries: Malta’s country’s most respected investigative journalist is being killed for coming too close to embarrassing cases such as the Azerbaijani bribery scandal.

We cannot allow this situation to happen again. We have to make full use of all resources and instruments that are at our disposal. According to the data supplied by the Greek authorities more than 15 000 migrants are present on the Greek islands as we speak. The hotspots are overcrowded, and living conditions could become very difficult due to winter conditions. Furthermore, there are still thousands of refugees and migrants stranded in the Western Balkan countries that may face a difficult situation if the weather conditions worsen.  No single country is able to handle this kind of situation alone. Efforts should be made not only by the most affected countries, but also by all other countries in order to support them. The Commission is the EU institution best placed to coordinate and help in such situations. The Commissioner will brief you on the current plans to mitigate the situation, as well as on other forms of support that can be provided to the most affected countries or planned ahead as contingency measures. Funding and concrete plans alone are, however, not sufficient to help us tackle this difficult situation. Lasting stabilisation of the situation on the eastern Mediterranean route will be key to improving the situation of these refugees and migrants. We need to further implement the EU-Turkey statement.

Our clear priority is to provide all Member States and our neighbours with support in their task and efforts to protect the refugees and migrants during the winter season. We all know that this is not a new issue, and the Commission has been proactive in assisting and supporting the authorities on the front line throughout all previous winters. But our collective preparedness has to be structured because – yes – winter comes every year and nobody knows or can predict how heavy it may become. We all know this is a demanding exercise for national authorities, notably in those countries which host a large number of migrants. Looking first at the situation in Greece, it is indispensable to recall the enormously positive and stabilising effect brought about by the activation of the EU—Turkey Statement in March 2016. Since the very beginning of the crisis, the European Union has made available around EUR 1.3 billion in support to Greece for tackling its migration and refugee challenges, making Greece the largest beneficiary of EU home affairs funds, as well as the exclusive beneficiary of the new EU emergency support instrument. This EU funding enabled the upgrading of the hotspots and ensured the operation of the open accommodation site of Kara Tepe on the island of Lesvos. Necessary services such as washing, cleaning, catering and food provision, housing, transportation, legal aid, medical services and educational activities are not a luxury. They are a must. They are essential for the dignified treatment all migrants must enjoy. Without EU financial support directly to the Greek authorities or via implementing partners such as the UNHCR and the IOM, many refugees and migrants would have been deprived of their fundamental human rights. Last year, the Commission also funded the purchase and installation of prefabricated houses and heating devices. This has also significantly contributed to the overall improvement of the reception conditions on the islands. But today we are again facing a situation of severe overcrowding on most of the islands. Yes, the situation has become very difficult. This is due to a combination of factors: the recent increase in arrivals on the Greek islands since the early summer of 2017 – even though limited – together with the still insufficient and not always adequate reception capacity and the still limited returns to Turkey. We cannot have a repetition of last year. The shocking images from last year must not return. Effective solutions must immediately be found. I have personally just come back from Greece, where I had constructive discussions with the Greek authorities. My colleague in charge of humanitarian aid, Commissioner Stylianides, has also been in close and regular contact with the Greek side. Solutions have been identified and we will continue to assist Greece in addressing the situation, notably on the islands of Lesvos, Chios and Samos. This is why, in order to tackle the situation on the islands effectively, the Commission has also taken concrete steps to expand the scope of the rental scheme funded by the Emergency Support Instrument. By the end of the year, the rental scheme will reach up to 2000 places, adding thereby up to an additional 900 places to the 1 122 places already available on the islands. To do this, the full engagement and cooperation of the local authorities is essential. EU funding was mobilised during the summer under the Greek AMIF National Programme specifically to support winterisation works in the hotspots on the islands, but there are winter-related works which still need to be completed. More precisely, electricity grids in hotspots should be upgraded, all housing units should be connected to electricity and further heating appliances should be provided for those housing units that are not equipped for winter conditions. Additional prefabricated units should be transferred from the mainland where possible. The Commission has also been calling for the creation of appropriate reception facilities, including closed facilities, on the islands. Let me add at this point that the cooperation of all actors, at all levels and in particular with local authorities, is key. They are the ones who are most closely confronted with the dire situation on the ground. They all have to work together and support each other in the efforts to exit the crisis mode and move towards sustainable migration management. Only if everyone does their part and all parts of a comprehensive strategy are fulfilled will the situation improve. The continuous, full implementation of the EU—Turkey Statement is key for the situation on the islands to improve. Again, let me repeat that continuous support and timely delivery from all partners – the national authorities, the Commission, EU agencies, the UNHCR, the IOM and other implementing partners on the ground – is essential. It is equally key that the Greek authorities continue to invest in swift asylum and return procedures, which contribute to further improving the situation on the islands. The emergency support instrument is providing accommodation in rental apartments all over Greece, not just on the islands, and we are ready to finance up to 30 000 places. As of 7 November, 15 458 refugees are already living in rental apartments, whilst the Greek Government is in the process of organising more transfers from the reception centres. Furthermore, all 21 long—term Commission—funded reception centres in mainland Greece are winterised, with the Greek Government having undertaken to close substandard temporary reception centres before the end of the year. I would like to emphasise that our clear objective is to ensure that most people on the mainland are living in rental accommodation. The Commission is also ready to fund additional places should such needs be confirmed. But our joint efforts on this matter are not just about Greece. We, as Europe, as a continent, have to remain prepared. We are closely following the situation in all Member States, in particular the front-line Member States, including Italy and Bulgaria, where there seem to be no imminent challenges concerning refugees and migrants for the winter. The preparation of the authorities and funds we have provided since last year have yielded clear results. For example, in Bulgaria, the International Organisation for Migration has implemented an action for the purchase and distribution of winter clothing kits and shoes to migrants in all reception centres in Bulgaria. According to information from Bulgaria, these kits have already been available since October. Regarding Italy, no specific winterisation needs have been identified, but progress is being made in swiftly mobilising EUR 35 million of emergency assistance to support Italy in further catering for the needs of those arriving in the country and improving the efficiency of procedures. Work is also under way on the possible mobilisation of up to a further EUR 100 million to assist in meeting needs on the ground. Any emerging winterisation needs could then be supported in this framework. Let me now turn to Serbia and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The European Union has been using all possible tools to help cope with the refugee crisis in both countries and is providing significant financial and technical support. Last winter, the Western Balkans faced considerable difficulties due to cold weather and heavy snowfall, especially in Serbia. We all recall the images from last year. Expanding reception capacities and ensuring that existing centres are adequate for the upcoming winter has been one of our priorities, and we are working closely with the Serbian authorities to this end. A special measure adopted in March 2017 with a budget of EUR 23.5 million aims, amongst other things, to cover accommodation costs; both running costs and refurbishment. Under the EU Trust Fund, an action of EUR 21 million was approved in June in response to the Syrian crisis. It includes a EUR 16 million direct grant for Serbia also covering costs related to the running of centres, including staff and utilities, education and health care. Signing off on this by the end of this year is a priority. Until then, humanitarian aid has allowed us to support the provision of food and non-food items, as well as protection to refugees and migrants in formal education and transport to schools. The more than EUR 83 million allocated to Serbia overall, both through humanitarian aid and pre-accession assistance, makes European Union is the largest donor to Serbia. In total, more than EUR 118 million has been allocated to Serbia in past and planned EU financial and technical support in the field of border migration and asylum management. For instance, IPA funding for the current deployment of 50 guest officers from EU Member States has been extended until the European Border and Coast Guard Agency can deploy teams with executive powers. Negotiations to allow for such deployment are ongoing both with Serbia and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Since the crisis broke out in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, the Commission has allocated EUR 19 million specifically to help that country cope with the refugee crisis. This is part of over EUR 50 million allocated in past and planned EU financial and technical support for the country in the field of borders, migration and asylum management. We will consider additional funds as needs arise. More generally, the European Union is looking into providing additional support based on the needs agreed with our partner countries. We are all sensitive to this issue. It is, above all, a matter of our humanitarian duty.

In the first ten days of November we already had 1,603 new arrivals.

At the same time, 1,500 people live in tents, risking their lives when the weather changes. A similar situation is observed in Chios and Samos. As you know, the resettlement programs ended on 26 September, making it impossible for new refugees to move from the country to other Member States.

Therefore, the timing of the adoption of the new regulation is unknown.

I agree with my colleague. It is not just a matter of Greece, Italy and the Western Balkans being responsible for the situation that has arisen, we ourselves stand as a whole as the European Union - including the member states including the Commission, including ourselves, who have political responsibility here in the European Parliament - a duty to prevent events like those of the previous year from happening again. That, I think, should bind us all together and shouldn't lead us to somehow blame anyone, but rather to make us very clear about what to do now. First of all, we have to say: We have a problem with the implementation of what has been concluded as a deal, as an agreement between the EU and other countries, that we now have a situation such as that of Greece Islands certainly also on the part of the EU - certainly not with bare intent, but it is still allowed - to be treated as, for example, Australia, Papua New Guinea, as an island, in order to ultimately dump the refugee problem there. We can no longer allow that to happen. Much has been funded through the Commission. But we also know that, for example, a large part of the money cannot go directly to the Greek state, but to refugee initiatives or the UNHCR. We also know that part of what you have committed yourself to ultimately could not be implemented. 2,000 homes were to be built on the Greek islands. They weren't created, it's only 1,100! There is also a lack of commitments that have been made on the mainland. 28,000 places in homes were to be created by the UNHCR. 9,000 are still missing. The funds for this are already there, they have been made available been! The Greek government was obliged to create permanent facilities with 12,000 places. She almost achieved her goal: I think 200 places are missing. We should really start by saying: we need concrete practical solutions. There is a suggestion to rent hotel rooms, for example. But now the rules say - both on the part of the UNHCR, but also for the Commission: That is not possible. We cannot finance hotel rooms. But! We have to find a solution! Because the apartments will not come so quickly. Nobody can tell me that, for example, a hotspot like Moria, which is permanently overcrowded - instead of 2,500 there are 5,000 to 6,000 refugees there - can be winterized. That will not do! But if I can't create the apartments on the islands either, then I really have to see how I use the potential of free rooms there that can be rented, and then I have to change the rules! There has to be a way to do this, it's a practical solution! So: besides what has already been done, more has to be done. Secondly, I would like to point out that the problem is exacerbated precisely by the fact that the many Member States are not complying with their rules. I saw a short report on German television yesterday. Several refugees were shown on hunger strike because of the conditions in the camp. In the meantime I have noticed: They were on a hunger strike - thank God they have now ended it - because they are supposed to go to Germany and Germany will not accept them. But German television doesn't say that. It gives the impression: It's the Greeks again, they're too stupid for anything, they can't do it. But we as the Federal Republic of Germany are not fulfilling our obligations. And so it affects many other countries as well.

The temperature is currently 25 degrees in Damascus, 30 degrees in Lagos and 30 degrees in Bangladesh. No one should have to sleep in tents as the migrants in Sweden did in the winter of 2015. However, there is a simple solution: We say no from the beginning. Europe, and especially Sweden, has taken its responsibility - a responsibility we have never had, because Sweden has not started a war in over 200 years and has not had any colonies in 300 years. When does the responsibility end? I ask. There is a simple solution to this: Put the resources on travel home for the economic migrants in question. Say no before they go over so we do not have to be blackmailed by Turkey. I will now present the solutions, and we'll see what you do with them.

These false refugees take advantage of the European asylum system and the inept Italian government, with the complicity of Brussels, offers these immigrants years of free room, board and services.

I can only conclude here today that the implementation still leaves a lot to be desired, especially when it comes to the situation on the Greek islands. More people arrive every day than leave and so many more people arrive at the hotspots than ever intended. This has all kinds of consequences for hygiene and housing and leads to mutual tensions. We all still have those images from last winter in our retina, with appalling circumstances for very vulnerable people. Citizens all over Europe have seen those images and were shocked. How can we explain to them that money and resources are available, that hotel rooms can be rented, that prefabricated houses are ready, that there are sufficient stocks of blankets, stoves, etc., but that we somehow fail to deal with all those means to give 15,000 people a warm place in winter? Where exactly is it going wrong and what are we going to do to prevent it? I welcome the commitments made by the Council and the Commission that all means and instruments will be used to avoid a repeat of last year. But Parliament will hold them to those commitments.

Definitely, countries like Italy – and especially Greece – deserve great credit because, despite the economic travails that they have had over the last number of years, they are still taking in the refugees and trying to deal with them. We should be giving them every support possible to help the situation. If migrants are illegal, they should be sent back. If they are legal, they need to be given the best possible care – especially with the onset of winter. It would be tragic that anybody who comes here looking for freedom and is legal would die because of the lack of warmth, clothing and comfort that they deserve.

With winter already on our doorstep, curbing efforts is not an option. Funding at EU level is not an issue, and I know that we can count on your support for this. Through our various funding instruments, we are already responding, and we will continue to do so for any additional needs. We cannot keep having these discussions over and over again. We need a structurally ingrained response system. This is why we need to speed up the reform of our Common European Asylum System, which includes better and more adequate reception conditions across the European Union. The current system is not sustainable in the long run. We cannot continue to leave responsibility for the vast majority of applicants, whether in law or practice, to only a few Member States. We need to be ready for the future and to design a system that is effective but fair to all. This includes the Dublin IV Regulation, which Ms in ‘t Veld mentioned, and I could not agree more with her remarks. It is important that the European Parliament sends a strong message on the need to revise the Dublin Regulation, and it is time for the Council to advance it. Many of you mentioned relocation. Ninety per cent of the relocation requests submitted by Italy and Greece become effective relocations. This is a success. Thanks to the cooperation of Member States, EU agencies and international partners, we have relocated more than 30 000 people, reaching an average of 2 200 relocations a month. This is a success. Through the implementation of the scheme, we have managed to build trust among Member States, and I can tell you that this was not one of the easiest tasks I’ve had. For the future, our first priority is to relocate all those eligible under the two Council decisions. The potential for solidarity with Italy and Greece has not been exhausted, and the European Union should continue relocating. We continue to provide financial support to those Member States sustaining their relocation efforts beyond the current schemes. I hope we will not have to repeat this discussion again in the future. We are all working to achieve the same goal: decent living conditions for all migrants immediately and better, sustainable migration management in the long term. Now allow me to say some words in Greek. Mr President, as I said before, we are all working and must work together for the same purpose; all over Europe, because this phenomenon will not stop - have no doubt. We must therefore approach it with prudence, strategy, cooperation and coordination. First of all, we must continue to wage war against traffickers, destroying their business model and severely punishing these criminals. As for the European Union-Turkey declaration, I would like to note that it has contributed substantially and effectively to this. Its full and continuous implementation will contribute even more, as has been agreed. We must all contribute so that the Greek authorities can intensify the implementation of the declaration, speeding up all the procedures provided. Of course, and I agree with what has been said before, we must send a clear message that no one should risk their lives at sea to reach Europe illegally, because they will simply return to their country. This, ladies and gentlemen, does not mean that we turn a blind eye to the human tragedy taking place in the wider Central and Eastern Mediterranean region. Instead, we encourage, we support politically, we take initiatives and finance the resettlement of refugees. It is already worth noting that, of the 50,000 new posts we have announced, Member States have stated that they are ready to fill almost 35,000 of them, and we expect even more commitments. In the near future we must work together so that none of the people we are temporarily hosting find themselves again unprotected in weather conditions like the ones we experienced last year. I would like to note something else; there is neither room nor time for mutual accusations. It is true that the geographical location of Greece exposed it to great refugee and immigration pressures. This is the reality and, as I have said repeatedly, at the beginning of this unprecedented crisis, both Greece and the whole of Europe were unprepared, and I would say that they were also unprotected. Europe, however, did not leave Greece alone, just as it did not leave Italy alone, from the very first moment. Assistance has been, is and will continue to be, in the future, substantial and continuous, in means, possibilities and money. But the pressure has not stopped and we do not know when it will stop. The unpredictable weather changes and the heavy winter that broke out last year, showed a dramatic aspect of this issue. Unacceptable conditions for civilized Europe and images of shame that must not be repeated. That is why, in cooperation with the Greek authorities, all the necessary measures I mentioned above are now being taken, in order to complete the preparations without further delay. We must continue to prepare for winter and manage to do so. We must intensify cooperation at all levels. Special mention, however, must be made of the local community and the citizens of the islands who, by their attitude, have sent a message of humanity, sensitivity and culture to the whole world. Ladies and gentlemen, the A Europe of prosperity, culture and humanity cannot fail to offer protection to 10,000 people.We all share the responsibility for this: European institutions, Member States, civil society.So the responsibility is collective, the collective and the work that we have to do to fulfill this humanitarian duty.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "S&D", "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 106, "date": "2017-11-15.json", "name": "Juan Fernando LÓPEZ AGUILAR", "mepid": "96812", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Mr President, honourable Members, the Presidency, like all of us, is aware of the difficult situation that the refugees and migrants are currently facing and may face in some regions of Europe.

As you heard from Commissioner Avramopoulos, the Commission is indeed working with the Member States concerned, and with other international actors, to be prepared in case the winter conditions worsen.  There were references, some quite emotional, to the reform of the Common European Asylum System. First, I warn against reducing this issue – the whole reform – to just one piece of legislation, the Dublin Regulation, and within the Regulation to just this one issue of relocation, when making these statements here. This reform consists of seven pieces of legislation, of which three are already in the trilogues with Parliament. The work is ongoing, the Presidency is well aware of the urgency and of the importance of this reform, in particular the Dublin Regulation.  As for relocation from Greece and helping Greece, work has been done and the work is ongoing. The Commissioner referred to some particularities there, such as the eligibility issue and the issue of returns, and these need to be taken into account as well.

There is not a more representative place where any European politician could express his views on the future of our European project.  Even the timing of my address here could hardly be better. In two days, Slovakia will celebrate the day when we made our first steps to democracy. It all began with young people, with students whose courage to stand up against the regime had opened the door to the Velvet Revolution. Twenty-eight years ago we went into the streets and we called for freedom, human rights and democratic institutions. We forced the Communist regime to dissolve, after four decades.  When I try to comprehend what we have achieved since 17 November 1989, I almost cannot believe how far we have managed to get. I stand here as the president of a proud, free and democratic country – a member of the European Union – whose citizens can travel freely across the continent and use the same currency as countries from the opposite side of the inglorious Iron Curtain.  None of it would be possible without the attractive power of peace and prosperity of the European project. We have succeeded because we had a vital vision to become a part of the West, and because we were granted the opportunity to fulfil this dream through the European Union. Indeed, the success story of Slovakia is a success story of European integration.  (Applause)  The timing of my speech here might be a lucky chance, but it is no coincidence that I have decided to begin my remarks with the success story of European integration in the part of Europe I am coming from. Because in the middle of the overwhelming pessimism of the past few years, it seems almost out of place to talk about success. And yet, I am convinced that these doubts about the ability of the EU to cope with common challenges, to overcome present difficulties, are greatly exaggerated. Make no mistake, this does not make them less dangerous. They are in our heads, they influence sentiment in our societies, they tamper with our electoral decisions. In the end, they even drive our political and policy actions. So I am not here to downplay the dangers of populism, nationalism and extremism fuelled by dissatisfaction in our societies and amplified by professionally-orchestrated propaganda. I am not here to underestimate the consequences of Brexit, or the real challenges we need to address in the monetary union, border protection or elsewhere. But I am here to forcefully reject the idea that there are some fundamental flaws in the architecture of the EU that will lead us to a bleak future. That something is rotten in the European project and it has been somehow responsible for the recent rise of extremism and nationalism. I am here to refuse the popular game of ‘blame it on Brussels’ whenever it serves to cover some pressing domestic political issue. (Applause) Let me point out where I do see a weakness in upholding the EU project. There is no doubt we defend the right cause – the project of peace, prosperity and human dignity. Facts speak volumes about the success of European integration. Of course, anti-European populists and extremists cannot beat us in providing solutions to improve the lives of our citizens. But too often it looks like they beat us with their limitless confidence and passion for their case. We need real, stronger leadership, more confidence and devotion when acting and speaking up on behalf of the EU.  We are aware of this problem in Slovakia. A month ago we adopted a joint declaration of the President, the Speaker of the Parliament and the Prime Minister, which strongly and decisively reinforces our membership in the EU as a strategic interest without any alternative for the future of our country. We have agreed that we will communicate with our public responsibly. That we will not use double language abroad and at home about EU decisions. (Applause) I consider this point especially important. We can see how often the EU is misused in political campaigns, and how well it serves populists to present all victories as national, and all defeats as European. We cannot get trapped by images of doom portrayed by those who would like to see us in another crisis. The EU is not a sinking ship and we do not have to radically reform the way we operate. The most pressing issues can be solved by finishing what we have begun years ago. This is valid for the euro zone, Schengen or the single market.  Not all of our past decisions were picture perfect and it will take some fine-tuning to overcome the challenges we face. But we do not need revolution. We just have to focus on what the EU Members have mastered during 60 years of integration – solving the issues together, helping each other and learning from each other. Solidarity and mutual trust are crucial to our success and our strength to overcome whatever comes next. But the recent migration crisis unfortunately left wounds on our mutual trust. And it will take time and effort to eventually heal these wounds. So let me today just say something that I used to repeat again and again during our heated domestic discussions. It is our moral duty to help children, women and men who flee their homes to save their lives, and Slovakia should never hesitate to show solidarity to our friends and partners in the EU. (Applause)   Slovakia openly pursues its strategic interest to be at the core of European integration, but I think we should focus on substance, on achieving convincing results, and not lose too much energy in debates on a core or so-called multi-speed Europe. This discussion is not new. Only players and contexts differ.  There has always been and there always will be EU countries willing to do more than others at some point in time. To explore more areas of cooperation is certainly not against the unity of the EU when agreed rules are respected, but it is crucial that new initiatives are open to anyone interested. And I know for sure that Slovakia will not look for back seats when new projects are on the table. While we invest our effort in the consolidation of our internal affairs, we shall not forget the role of the EU beyond its borders. Because there are many threats out there with a significant impact on our common future, security and well-being.  The EU today is an economic superpower, but its voice in the security challenges around us is quite limited, whether it is dealing with Russia over the illegal annexation of Crimea and its support of separatists in Donbas, or the situation in Syria and Libya. But the EU was built to be the project of peaceful economic integration, not a common military powerhouse. It always feels a bit cheap to criticise perceived lack of geopolitical prestige or a lack of operational capability during sudden crises, if one is not willing to equip the EU with proper abilities and powers. Or if one is not ready to respect common actions when they matter the most.  We in Slovakia are in favour of a more ambitious foreign and security policy of the EU. I do not think it is sustainable to limit the EU to the role of a money-raising benefactor after the dust settles, a benefactor trying to rebuild what has been left or destroyed by interventions of unscrupulous players on the international scene. Looking at the world today, it must be clear that the EU needs to transform itself into a more powerful global player.  But I suggest we address this task rather honestly. No common policy can be efficient if it is pushed aside any time someone deems it convenient. I am content that we have abandoned the idea of some European army as a starting point, because we need first to agree on what it really means to strengthen our cooperation in this field.  Also, let me be clear: in Slovakia, we have never seen this initiative as an attempt to compete with the defence guarantees provided by NATO and a strategic partnership with the United States. But we see lot of room where enhanced European cooperation can fill in and play a crucial role. Without merging our resources together, we would never be able to stand up to our ambitions. That is why Slovakia welcomes the idea of ‘permanent structured cooperation’. While speaking about security, let me add one remark. I am following an ongoing investigation in the United States about the scope of Russian interference in their presidential elections. Then I look back home where I can hardly see any action at all. And I always tell myself how lucky we are to live in Europe where, apparently, no Russian influence is felt, as none is being intensively investigated ...  But, on a more serious note, while we start talking about the European defence projects, we should act together against the imminent and dangerous threat we all face – the Russian propaganda and information war. It would be ridiculous to work on our defence hardware but leave this vulnerability open to attacks. Honestly, it would be shame to let the European project fail because of our inability to halt the dissemination of hoaxes and fake news ... (Applause)  ... because propaganda has real consequences in our everyday lives. It shaped the moods in the EU and influences attitudes of our citizens. It seeks to spread chaos, to weaken our stability, to undermine the trust of people in our institutions, and to make us afraid of every upcoming election.  One of the biggest threats comes from inside. We need to look into organised financial and personal schemes linked to media, non-governmental organisations, business entities or political parties. It is no secret that people in our countries get hired and used to destabilise our societies. In many cases, we simply ignore it or feel it inappropriate to take action. But Russia becomes more bold in its efforts to destabilise Europe and it is ready to use any situation to this end. I really appreciate that this Parliament approved a resolution on Russian propaganda last year. It was a bold and much needed first step. It is clear the problem should be dealt with the utmost political and expert attention at the European level and it should lead to active defence. We shall not tolerate disinformation interfering with our strategic interests. We must defend ourselves, in words and in deeds. I have mentioned the post-Communist journey of my own country as proof of the success of European integration, and I will go even further and say that enlargement itself has been the most successful EU policy since the fall of the Berlin Wall. (Applause) It has been the most important contribution of European politicians of the past three decades to keep the continent peaceful, free and prosperous. I have no doubt that our common future will be determined greatly by our capability to accept new members, by our ability to secure the stability and prosperity of our neighbourhood. No matter how serious our internal challenges seem to be right now, we must not give up on enlargement. The fate of the Western Balkan countries must remain one of our priorities. Yes, there are reasons to be disappointed by the lack of progress in reforms, in overcoming old divisions, but rather than relax our attention, the EU should engage more. We have horrific experience of what could happen if the Western Balkans stay at the margin of our attention. The security and stability of the region is closely intertwined with the security and stability of the EU, so we cannot afford to give up on them. That means we cannot kill the vision of successful integration for them.  A failure to offer hope is empowering adversaries of a prosperous, peaceful and integrated Europe. We simply cannot lose our friends in our neighbourhood, especially in the Eastern Neighbourhood. In this situation it is ridiculous to spend months in discussions on how to avoid any reference to a membership vision, instead of focusing on what we can offer them. Let me be more specific. Moldova is one of the poorest parts of Europe. People there desperately long for better lives that can be achieved through reforms and a realistic vision of a better future, something that the EU can offer the best. Without our help, they will be left vulnerable to the Kremlin’s interference. Georgia, a country that has been doing its best for well over a decade; our true ally in the region. But also a country that suffers from a recent war with Russia. A big part of its territory is still illegally occupied and people are left suffering. I touched the barbed-wire fence that can divide your garden overnight and leave you with no access to your family. And yet, Georgia has not lost its strategic direction towards the West. So let’s not put this bond at risk by our ignorance and indifference that could lead to irreparable damage.  And finally, Ukraine, our biggest neighbour, is fighting its war for a territorial integrity while carrying out reforms at the same time. I often hear they do not do enough. But they will not do better if we lose our interest, cut off our support and leave them on their own. Moreover, if we get back to business as usual with Putin’s regime, if we lift the sanctions without forcing the Kremlin to respect international law and principles, then we are willing to trade our own long-term security and stability for dubious individual short-term profits and interests.  European integration embodies everything that is dear to us – life in peace, life in dignity where every human being is respected. It is our common heritage; our precious and verified plan to survive, our only meaningful path to the future. I am sure the European Union has many great years ahead.

That really is not the case, and it makes it look as if Parliament is being managed. I know you sir, and one of the reasons I voted for you – and I think you are a good man – is that you promised to protect minority views, and I know that you do. Perhaps you have not seen this, but it is bad if they put out propaganda that does not look as if it represents all the views. I would like to bring that to your attention.

It was a great feeling to be part of the Olympic Games again. While I do know how much we hate rapporteurs’ two-minute speeches before a valuable voting time, in this case it would be wrong if I were silent about one issue, which is the Belgian candidate. In the Committee, we had the vote which did not support him because he was accused of some violations of rules on misbehaviour or something like that. But we are not the court here, and unless the person has not been proven guilty, he is innocent and we should keep that in mind. On the other hand, we have the report adopted in 2014 by this Parliament, written by Ms Inés Ayala Sender, which basically says that we do not recommend than two more periods in office at the Court of Auditors in Luxembourg. On this occasion, this candidate is applying for a third. If you want to vote in favour, use my first excuse, if you want to vote, against use my second. The other concern which there has been in the Court of Auditors is a gender balance. It is regrettable, but very big and old Member States have never considered promoting a woman candidate. It is not only for Finland, Estonia, Bulgaria and other small states to promote gender balance. It is also for Italy, Spain, Hungary, etc. (I did not mention Poland today, they got their share earlier in the morning). Finally, the thing is that we should also consider if we want our former colleagues, politicians, to become members of the Court of Auditors. If we do, we have to be consistent. If we prefer to have professional auditors and accountants there to inspect our everyday dealings with financial matters, we should be also consistent. What we have is a mix. Sometimes bigger political groups take one deal, sometimes the other, depending on a candidate’s political background. We should come up with a decision – what do we really want?

Today we remember and commemorate more than 100 million victims of totalitarian regimes, all those who vanished in Stalin’s gulags, Hitler’s death camps and Mao’s great famine, and those who were killed by other dictators and tyrants inspired by Communists and Nazis.  The consequences of these totalitarian regimes are felt to this day. Like many of those who were left behind the Iron Curtain under Communist rule, I have experienced totalitarianism myself. My grandparents perished in the gulag, my mother spent 17 years there, my father eight years, and I was born there. From day one of my life, my parents had to check me in with the KGB every month. I had no rights at all. I was born with the label ‘enemy of the people’. For those crimes not to be repeated, we need remembrance and education to build immunity for our societies against every temptation of totalitarian solutions. And let me quote the great Hannah Arendt: ‘Totalitarian solutions may well survive the fall of totalitarian regimes in the form of strong temptations, which will come up whenever it seems impossible to alleviate political, social or economic misery in a manner worthy of man.’  Moreover we need to recognise and confront totalitarian trends wherever they manifest themselves, whether it is North Korea which poses a global threat, whether it is Russia where Stalin is once again admired, or whether it is totalitarian jihadist Islamism which is at war with our values and with true Islam. We should not close our eyes to the fact that China is emerging as a superpower under Leninist autocracy, or to the case of Venezuela, where populist rule has evolved into a dictatorial regime.  The clear link between populism, extremism, autocracy and dictatorship around the world is one to bear in mind as we face the challenges in our own societies. Our own Euro-Atlantic family of nations with shared values has not been immune to very obvious populist and authoritarian trends. Populism is a form of authoritarianism that distorts democracy without destroying it, but under populist rule, democracies become illiberal, with populists defining themselves as the entire people, and all those who disagree as enemies of the people. Therefore we need to clearly recognise and resist populists and radicals on both the left and the right and not let them hijack and denigrate our democratic values.  As we are facing the rise of autocratic global powers, we in Europe  should find ways to revitalise our core values within our own family of nations.

Thanks for the invitation to the Presidency to take part in this discussion. Let me start by recalling the resolution of the European Parliament from 2 April 2009 on European conscience and totalitarianism, which calls for the proclamation of 23 August as a Europe—wide day of remembrance for all the victims of all the totalitarian regimes. There is this famous sentence by the philosopher George Santayana: ‘Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it’. The topic of today’s discussion incites reflection on how we can learn from history. The 1917 Bolshevik revolution was a turning point in the history of a great nation, Russia, and it changed the history of the whole continent. Historians are still discussing the scale of the impact of the 1917 revolution, and rightly so. We cannot close our eyes, either, to the worrying tendencies still there, one century later, in Russia and beyond its borders. The Bolshevik programme of peace, land and bread won the party considerable support among hungry urban workers and soldiers. It was effective propaganda. But it brought about destruction, famine and war. As the historian Anne Applebaum recently put it: ‘it created not a beautiful new civilisation but an angry, unhappy and embittered society, one that squandered its resources, built ugly, inhuman cities, and broke new ground in atrocity and mass murder’. The totalitarian regime and machinery that was built on this ideology also led us to the enforced division of Europe for half a century. This we have overcome, fortunately, through the positive, transformative force of European integration. But are we entirely out of the woods? Are we safe from foreign interference, from attempts to undermine our achievements? Let me also remind you – just as Sandra Kalniete did just before me – my generation of Estonians, Latvians, Lithuanians, Poles, Romanians and many other nations spent the first half of their lives under the totalitarian regime that the Bolsheviks created and spread throughout the eastern part of the European continent. I was 25 when Estonia freed itself from the Soviet occupation. For me, the Russian revolution is not something from history books, it is something very real. When I look around in today’s Europe, I find the real consequences, the real legacy of Bolsheviks, more than I like to. In 1967, the year I was born into the Orwellian society of the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic, illegally annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940, the great George F. Kennan, in an analysis of the Bolshevik revolution half a century on, wrote: ‘the Bolshevik leaders brought ... a complex of attitudes toward the Western governments... Among these attitudes were a fundamental challenge to the legitimacy of the Western governments, a pervasive cynicism about the parliamentary and democratic sources of their power, a denial that their peoples owed them loyalty.’ You would have thought that was in the past. However, last week, the Russian ambassador to the EU, Vladimir Chizhov, gave an interview to the Baltic Rim Economies Review where he states: ‘In the Russian view, the subsequent policies of NATO and EU enlargement, export of democracy and erosion of continent-wide arms regimes have put to rest any hopes for a truly inclusive governance of Europe.’  The EU’s ‘export of democracy’ – a cold breeze dating back a century – reminds us of anxieties we thought had long ago disappeared. Let me now turn to the worrying phenomenon of populism. I am addressing this issue here because in today’s Europe, the populists target this Union of ours. They try to undermine the achievements of over 60 years of European integration. I am also addressing this issue because populism is at the very roots of Bolshevism, from the first works of Karl Marx, who started this cruel madness. Catchy and attractive—sounding, populist propaganda promises oversimplified solutions for complex issues. Populists divide our societies into good and bad, us and them. This undermines the democratic and open political debate, while radicalisation and extremism gain ground. Europe has already paid a heavy price for creating such dividing lines in the past. The experience of the two World Wars taught us not to focus on differences but to create a common space to live, study and work. Our nations agreed on common fundamental principles such as democracy, the rule of law and the protection of human rights. Our societies are facing different challenges, related for instance to security, defence, migration and so on. Populist rhetoric has created deep divisions in our societies on those issues instead of allowing us to work together on common solutions in the EU. Populists use information technology to communicate the message even more widely. This has brought along new challenges, such as misinformation on a massive scale, fake news and attempts to influence democratic elections. It is not easy for citizens to discern fake news or to find and access reliable information. These challenges need to be countered on many different levels. I welcome the Commission’s plans – as recently announced by First Vice—President Timmermans at the General Affairs Council – to carry out preparatory work on the topic of fake news. This is a fundamental issue of partly foreign interference threatening to seriously undermine our democracies. We must not forget the important role of education and youth work either. The first Leaders’ meeting under President Tusk’s Leaders’ Agenda on Friday in Gothenburg focuses precisely on education and culture. We need to develop democratic resilience, media literacy, tolerance, critical thinking and conflict resolution skills. In particular, media literacy has become key to fighting off populist propaganda and manipulation through fake news. In October, the Estonian Presidency organised the third annual Rule of Law Dialogue in the General Affairs Council on the topic of media pluralism and the rule of law in the digital age. It was underlined that increased levels of disinformation are another core challenge, including for democracy and the rule of law. This challenge can be counterbalanced by increased levels of media literacy. We need to put more energy and means into strategic communication and make the best use of the methods and tools which have proved efficient both in the EU and within our neighbourhood. For instance, the valuable work and output by the East Strategic Communication Task Force in the European External Action Service shows us how we can improve and magnify our narrative in the eastern neighbourhood. I would like to conclude by stressing how important it is to prevent our citizens from being misled by populists. History shows the impact that propaganda and manipulation can have on our societies. Thus it is our common responsibility to preserve the vital values of tolerance, protection, human rights and the rule of law. I hope that today’s discussion on this sad anniversary of the Bolshevik revolution will further contribute to keeping and respecting these common values in the future, too.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 175, "date": "2017-11-15.json", "name": "Pavel TELIČKA", "mepid": "124706", "text": "  Minister, thank you, and I must say that when you referred to the quote by Ambassador Vladimir Chizhov, having been for years his Czech counterpart both in Prague and in Brussels, I could supplement that with some other freezing quotes.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 176, "date": "2017-11-15.json", "name": "Frans TIMMERMANS", "mepid": "129141", "text": "   First Vice-President of the Commission. – Mr President, I could never speak as eloquently about this issue as Sandra Kalniete and Matti Maasikas have just done, for the simple reason that I had the good fortune to be born on the right side of the Iron Curtain, and therefore never had the personal experience of what it means to live in a dictatorship or in a totalitarian state. This does not mean that I do not feel a collective historic responsibility, for all Europeans, to make sure that this memory is never lost, that it is part of our educational system in a way, and that our children don’t forget, so that they do not repeat the mistakes of the past.  I am certainly not claiming this as a Commission responsibility or a European responsibility, but I do call on national authorities to make sure that the totalitarian past, which is an integral part of all our histories, is never forgotten so that the experience should never be repeated. The 1917 revolutions in Russia were a turning point of twentieth century history and politics. It was the beginning of a wave of totalitarian regimes, in which the ideology dictated that the individual was not relevant; that the only thing that mattered was the ideology and the goals that the state dictated through people who thought that individual rights and democracy had no part in their society. As this regime, the Bolshevik regime, took over in the October Revolution, it sought legitimisation through the hunting down of enemies. There were incredible numbers of individual victims of the political terror, especially in the elite of the country, whose experience looms large in our history writing. But terror, to be effective, needs to be indiscriminate. Terror only works if innocent people are victims of it, because it makes everybody scared, and in absolute numbers it was the ordinary people who suffered most. I think because it was not mentioned before today, I want to mention that we should maintain a special place in our collective memory for the many millions who perished in the Holodomor in Ukraine. The people of the Soviet Union made sacrifices on a scale which numbs the mind in helping to defeat the Nazi regime, but the end of the Second World War did not alter the baleful nature of the Stalinist dictatorship. Furthermore, the Soviet occupation of the Baltic States and the puppet regimes put in place in Central Europe left our continent divided, leaving people to the East with effectively closed borders yearning for political and personal freedoms and missing out on the prosperity that took off in our part of Europe. The events of 1989 – to which I am proud to say I have been witness to throughout my career – were for most people a matter of joy, as country after country was able to throw off the totalitarian regimes imposed upon them, and then, in the EU enlargements in 2004 and since, to mend the terrible fracture in our continent. There is no more important event in 70 years of European integration than that wonderful event in 2004 when Europe became whole again. ‘Now grows together what belongs together’ should be a leading motto in our European Union. While the wounds are deep and countries are still coming to terms with their history, the transformational power of the people to turn their countries into social market democracies where freedom reigns is a miracle. Those of us who witnessed the states of Central and Eastern Europe at the end of the 1980s and who go back now see a miracle; with all the shortcomings we still have, it is a miracle. That is why I agree so wholeheartedly with President Juncker when he said, in the State of the Union address, that Europe must breathe with both its lungs, East and West. That is why I never hesitate to repeat the wonderful words expressed by Václav Havel at a conference I attended in Prague, when he said: ‘Our goal is to make sure that East and West regain just geographical meaning, not moral meaning, not economic meaning, only geographical meaning’. That should always be our goal, especially to honour the memory of people like Václav Havel. Our Union is based on the tripod of democracy, human rights and the rule of law. Through European history, we know that if we abandon one of the legs of the tripod, the whole tripod will topple and we will not be able to maintain these rights. It is also important that Europe marks the 23 August, the anniversary of Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union signing the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, to remember all the victims of the totalitarian authoritarian regimes that have scarred Europe during the 20th century. Yes, they went at each other at some point, but Stalin would have preferred to maintain a strategic alliance with this other mass murderer called Adolf Hitler. The Europe-wide Day of Remembrance for the victims of all totalitarian and authoritarian regimes keeps alive the memory of the victims and pays tribute to them. Commemoration also helps us to recall lessons learnt from this dark chapter in European history. The Spanish writer Jorge Semprún said that European integration was born in Buchenwald. The EU is based on the idea that you link your destiny to your neighbours’ destiny. That is a clean break with a totalitarian vision of exactly 100 years ago in the Bolshevik revolution. The concept fostered in the Bolshevik revolution, in the Fascist regime in Italy, in the Nazi regime in Germany, and in the subsequent Fascist regimes in other European countries, was always that the individual does not count – it is only our goals that count, and if individuals die because of that, tough luck. This is something we as Europeans of today can never, ever accept. We should never take our freedoms for granted. Nothing is irreversible, as the volatile politics of our continent show. Democracy and freedom need maintenance. Ideology that allows you to murder your neighbour is still rampant in Europe. Look at the fundamentalist jihadists who have exactly the same vision of being allowed to kill other human beings because they do not share your ideology: exactly what the Stalinists and the Nazis did. It is perhaps not surprising, but it is dispiriting, that the current government of Russia, which incidentally seems very ambivalent in its own attitude to the Bolshevik revolution, is devoting so much effort and so many resources into misinformation aimed at our societies and other democracies. It is a matter of great concern that apparently it is seeking to divide us and rule us by teaming up with the present forces of illiberalism, nationalism and xenophobia, and inflaming hatred and instilling doubt about our hard-fought democratic values. I would say, let us not fall for the temptation of the strong man. I do not understand why this is again so tempting to many of our co-citizens. Let us never give in to these dark forces. Let us not fall for the demons of extreme nationalism which, like alcoholism, offer short-term exaltation, but long-lasting headaches, deep disruption, poverty and despair. Europe is ultimately an idea and a promise that it is possible to overcome age-old antagonisms and live together, trade together and work together in freedom and peace. Markets and currency are important instruments, but not our end goals. On this, the 100th anniversary of the October Revolution, it is good to recall the lessons of the past. Domination of one another is not the answer. Europe grows out of a free and democratic choice to join a union and pool one sovereignty so that the whole is greater than the sum of all its parts. Looking back on our history, we can only conclude that we are lucky to be alive today, and so we must cherish the open, prosperous, diverse and peaceful societies we have built where individual freedoms are not sacrificed on the altar of so-called collective interests based on a totalitarian ideologies. But we must never take this for granted, nor the fundamental values that our European house is based on. We then must consequently show the same energy, passion and determination to defend what Europe is, to defend who we really are and to understand that collective prosperity is impossible without individual liberty.

This revolt carried with it the hope of a new, more just and united society.

Exploitation has not gone away, and neither has injustice. Many Europeans feel abandoned, ostracized from society. Unemployment, poverty and growing inequalities are rife. Resignation and anger are there. Without a response to the wishes of our peoples that our institutions be attentive, reactive and effective, it is our democracy that will be endangered. Indeed, it is this exasperation and this fear that constitute the breeding ground for extremisms whose target is democracy.

Therefore, it believes it is justifiable to sweep away anyone who opposes it by any means. The essential evil at the heart of Marxism is the idea that the end justifies the means. That idea unites Communism and Nazism. They are two sides of the same totalitarian coin.  Marxism is nonsense. Marxist parties that seize power become dictatorships with only one goal – their own self-preservation. Look at the Chinese Communist Party today for evidence of that. The Nazis pulled the gold teeth out of murdered Jews.

In 1913, Vladimir Lenin wrote that the revolution he was preparing would not take place in his lifetime. However, it happened four years later. In 1917, it was not the Bolsheviks who seized power, but other groups that gave it to them, and nobody – except the Bolsheviks – was ready to take the power that was lying at their feet. The revolution happened because problems accumulating in society had been ignored for a long time. What lessons should the European Union draw from the Russian revolution today? Firstly, it should recognise the problem and not deny it. We still try to deny problems and punish those who warn us about them. Secondly, institutions will not help if there is an ideological emptiness inside them. An absence of common values eventually leads to the collapse of structures. Thirdly, do not solve your problems of today at the expense of a weak group of the population. For example, the problem of social inequality should not be given to capitalists or national linguistic minorities’ problems to nationalists. Fourthly, do not solve internal problems by demonising your neighbours in order to consolidate your own society. Such consolidation works only for a short period, but the problems will return like a boomerang. We need a clear vision. If we are unable to formulate our vision and our aims in a short form which is understandable for every single person, this means that we do not have this vision at all.

The Clean Mobility Package is about Europe’s political leadership in climate action and industrial leadership in clean and smart mobility.  As I have often said in the past, the leading economy of the 21st century will be the one that leads the transition to clean energy. Right now, when it comes to clean mobility, we have to admit we are lagging behind. Only 1% of the new cars sold within the European Union are electric. For comparison, China expects to reach 20% by 2020, and this is the equivalent of 4.5 million electric cars per year.  The car was invented in Europe, so it should be reinvented here as well, and our ambition should be simple: that the best and the cleanest cars are manufactured here, and that they are driven on the most advanced infrastructure. Today’s proposal is an opportunity for Europe’s industry to achieve just that. How? First, we set new emissions standards for cars and vans that are 30% lower in 2030 than in 2021, with an intermediary target in 2025, so that no time is wasted. These targets are highly ambitious, but not disruptive. There is sufficient time for the industry to invest in cleaner technologies and for the employees to transition their skills. We will also ensure implementation through rigorous testing and controls. Second, we increased our support for the roll-out of alternative fuel infrastructure with a EUR 800 million action plan, and the bulk of the money comes from Europe’s carbon market, whose reform has now been adopted. This roll-out must be inclusive across the continent: no region, no consumer should be left behind. And third, we set public procurement rules for new vehicles. Together with these key measures, the Commission proposes improving the organisation of transport systems and to support the roll-out of both alternative fuel infrastructure and clean vehicles. Violeta Bulc will elaborate on this in a moment.  Finally, we gave a strong push for the development of advanced battery technologies here in Europe. The demand for batteries is about to spike all around the world and create a gigantic market worth EUR 250 billion in Europe alone by 2025. So this is our chance to capture this market in a sustainable way. We want to be leaders in green batteries. This means clean production, sustainable and responsible mining of raw materials, recycling and reusing.  Last month I launched the EU Battery Alliance with industry and interested Member States in order to develop strong manufacturing capacity here in Europe and regain competitiveness throughout the value chain. The European Parliament and its Members have an important role to play, so I would like to invite interested MEPs to support this strategic initiative, perhaps by forming the Friends of Battery Group with us. With this package, we are sending a clear signal to the industry and investors, to public authorities and to consumers. It is also sending a message to our global partners about our ambition and continued commitment to lead in the fight against climate change.  Let me conclude by saying that this is a package that has only winners. Drivers will save thousands of euros in fuel and maintenance costs. We will see 70 000 new jobs of the future created in Europe. Investors will benefit from lucrative new opportunities, and EU car companies will be able to retain their global market share and regain consumers’ trust. We will benefit from lower dependency on external energy providers, and we will all start breathing clean air once again, saving thousands of lives which are currently lost to pollution-related diseases. The proposals are now on your table, and we hope that, together with the Member States, you can adopt this swiftly so that we can continue to demonstrate this global leadership. Mr President, if you allow me, I will now give the floor to my colleague Commissioner Bulc.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "S&D", "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 254, "date": "2017-11-15.json", "name": "Bogusław LIBERADZKI", "mepid": "23768", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, transport is crucial for our economy and for our citizens. It employs more than 11 million Europeans and generates five percent of Europe’s GDP. But, as Vice—President Šefčovič has just underlined, transport also has negative impacts on climate and air quality, which require robust reforms. Today transport accounts for a quarter of all European greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, transport contributes to air pollution, which causes the premature death of 400 000 Europeans every year.  That is why we are taking unprecedented actions in response to this ever—growing challenge. We are reconciling the mobility needs of Europeans with the protection of our planet. Today we are addressing all dimensions of the challenge in a comprehensive, coherent and synchronised way. After the first wave of our mobility package, presented in May, we put forward a second set of measures to accelerate the transition to low emission mobility. We are delivering on all three pillars in our low emission mobility strategy: first, improving the organisation of our transport systems; second, promoting cleaner vehicles; and, third, making alternative energy more accessible for transport.  Let me address these three areas in a little more detail. First, a more efficient transport system. We strongly believe that we can significantly decrease transport emissions by further integrating the different modes of transport. For freight, we propose to revise the existing European rules on combined transport to provide further incentives to shift long—distance freight from road to rail, but also to inland waterways and short sea shipping. For passengers, our goal is to support the development of long—distance bus and coach connections throughout Europe. Citizens should have access to more public transport, with more affordable and better quality services. Decarbonising transport implies offering passengers alternative solutions to the use of private cars.  The second area is cleaner vehicles. A key element of the package is the proposal for new CO2 standards for cars and vans post—2020. Vice—President Šefčovič has already presented this but I would like to underline now that, besides the supply/manufacturer side of this problem, in this package we are also addressing the demand side. Public authorities can – and are ready to – make a strong contribution to the market uptake of low and zero-emission vehicles. So we want to make it easier for cities and local authorities to purchase, rent and lease those vehicles for their provision of public transport services or for other public use. To provide more certainty in their visibility to the market, we propose to set minimum public procurement targets at national level, which will also generate predictable demand for European industry.  That brings me to the third area, alternative energy. Consumers must have confidence that they will be able to use alternatively powered vehicles throughout Europe. For most, after a home, their car remains the second biggest item of expenditure so it must work in all conditions and everywhere. Charging an electric car along European motorways has to be as easy as filling up at the petrol station. We are therefore proposing an action plan to speed up deployment of charging points. Investment in clean transport is crucial for this to work. As part of this plan, we are now investing another EUR 800 million from the EU budget to roll out additional alternative fuels infrastructure. In addition, we propose new standards for plug interoperability, the same standard throughout Europe.  There is no single magic solution. This is why in today’s package we are combining different legislative and financial tools to maximise the impact of our measures and deploy cleaner transport sooner rather than later. The range of measures announced today means that transport will continue to play its part in tackling climate change.

You know I think that is too late. We should have had it sooner. But it was a tough delivery and I am glad it is here. We will see what we can do before the elections. In particular, the emissions part of this package has received a lot of attention in the European press and would not be ambitious enough. The criticism from the NGOs is frequent. I notice that the car industry and the Member States are fairly calm. So the question is whether the Commission has struck the right balance. In any case, the European People's Party, to which I belong, stands for the right balance. Emission reduction and electrification are very important, but we would also like to stick to a technology-neutral approach. I dare to say here that the interests of industry, workers and consumers can play a major role. We will have to find that balance in the coming months or the coming year, respectively, with the aim of reducing emissions. Furthermore, the directive on the bus and coach market is of great importance. This has received little attention in the press, but this is a sector with a lot of passengers and a lot of safety issues.

On behalf of the Socialist Group, too, I would like to congratulate you on presenting the mobility package. It is not a contradiction in terms, on the one hand, to become ecological in the transport sector and, on the other hand, not only to maintain the industrial base with millions of jobs within the European Union, but also to expand it. It is also undisputed that the transport sector as a whole needs to become cleaner. For that we definitely need more efficient vehicles. We also have to help ensure that alternative drive technologies such as electromobility, fuel cells and others are expanded. And we mustn't forget that the potential of digitization is being exhausted and used. Networking will also make it possible to save unnecessary traffic. We must also try to make local public transport even more attractive and - not to forget - to support autonomous and networked driving. Now this debate about the internal combustion engine has flared up not only in Germany, but across Europe. I believe that the debate about the combustion engine is just as ineffective as it is to artificially extend its life. In this respect, I still believe that we should invest courageously in the future. And if we look at the European Union and worldwide, we see that we are very dependent on exports. We must not forget that other power centers in the world such as China, such as California - we were there recently - are making great strides when it comes to these bans and internal combustion engines.

A system of incentives for manufacturers of low-emission cars and investments in infrastructure for charging these vehicles are needed. Only then will they not be a curiosity, but a conscious choice. I have the impression that in this proposal the goals are very well defined, but the very calendar of their implementation outlined by the Commission is extremely ambitious and will pose a problem in achieving real progress in the field of ecological mobility in the near future.

I am also glad that the Commissioner is presenting it under the Energy Union umbrella and that there is an integrated approach as concerns both sectors.  But let me go a little bit further. What we really need in the European Union is a change of mind-set. If we manage to change the mind-set, we will be in a better position to tackle what I see as a weakness in the European Union, and that is the complete ecosystem: it is transport, it is energy, it is industry, it is consumption but it is also research, it is a question of where we really focus and we put the utmost effort in the financial means that we can deliver. Already California has been mentioned today, China has been mentioned, and the fact is that we are not necessarily well placed today to be the leaders. We are still well placed to be highly competitive in the future if we get the ecosystem right. We need to do it on the European level, we need to do it on the national level. I would hardly find a single policy on the European or national level which would not be affected if we are to meet the objectives that we are setting in this package. I very much encourage you to pursue that direction.  Having said that, the package is one that we have to appreciate, it is well balanced. There are a number of issues that will require clarification, fine tuning, maybe higher ambition, but I would like to say that if we look at the package purely through the optic of emission targets, then we will be failing. It has to be a very complex policy approach, getting the right balance but also getting the right ambition. And that is my final remark: why are the Americans, at least in Silicon Valley, and the Chinese, successful? Because they do not update or upgrade by 10% or 20%, they want a real change, they want a revolution.

They cannot be said to be impossible, as it has been shown that the technology could have been developed for years, but there have been no real legislative guidelines for it. As Europe's largest export sector, the car industry has always been concerned about ambitious emission reduction targets. The reality, however, is that nothing will happen in climate work with regard to transport unless the targets are strong enough and in place. Unfortunately, the emissions scandal showed us in the area of ​​transport how ruthlessly the loopholes in the legislation have been exploited for decades. I am positively surprised by the fact that the Commission now boldly dare to take the bull by the horns. I think it is a smart solution that the Commission did not set quotas for car manufacturers to make electric cars, but remained in a technology-neutral approach.

But what are we doing concretely to meet the objectives of COP 21 and limit warming to two degrees by the end of the century?

Unfortunately, with your unambitious proposal, they can sleep peacefully. Why settle for setting a target of 30% reduction in CO2 emissions when several European countries are calling for this 40% reduction by 2030? Why just encourage manufacturers to produce 15% of these clean vehicles by 2025, when there should be a mandatory quota, like China, which will produce 10% by 2019? Why offer them the right to pollute more as a reward, if they produce these clean vehicle quotas, and set no penalties, if not, if they do not? Your proposal is not up to the stakes.

First of all, it is very important that the goals set are ambitious, but at the same time we need to stay on the ground of realities. It is not worth formulating objectives that we can assume from the outset that we may not be able to achieve them. In the meantime, we are causing a great deal of confusion in the car industry. Many of the developments that have begun and been supported so far could become futile, threatening thousands of European jobs. There is no denying that current efforts to achieve climate targets are not enough, but if we break the competitiveness and economic performance of the European car industry, losses and damage could divert resources from what is being achieved, and that emissions will be efficient. reduction. Secondly, it is very important that the goals set are achievable in all the Member States of the European Union.

The Emissions Fraud Investigation Commission finished its work in April of this year, and the way is already being paved for further exceedances of emission limits. Moreover, the Commission has still not indicated that the measurement of CO2 emissions will be carried out under real driving conditions, as will be the case for nitrogen oxide emissions. It is very regrettable.

We know that transport is, in fact, the only sector where emissions have only increased. The volume of traffic is constantly increasing, so now really effective measures are needed to stop the growth of emissions. On the one hand, we must strive to have more efficient, low-emission vehicles, we need to find more environmentally friendly fuels and, on the other, we need to design the whole transport system more efficiently, and here digitalisation offers many opportunities. It is good that the Commission has taken a technology-neutral approach in its own proposal. In my view, quite ambitious targets are being set for car manufacturers, but within a timeframe that is achievable. And car manufacturers themselves can apply for the best technology with which that emission reduction can be achieved. This is the right starting point. It is also good that the Commission wants to support research and development into the development of alternative fuels, including battery technology, and to continue to promote the construction of these recharging and refueling points across Europe. At the same time, however, it is important to remember that it will take time for the car fleet to regenerate, and therefore the fastest way to achieve now rapidly reduced emissions is to increase the use of advanced renewable biofuels, as they can be used in an existing car fleet. I am therefore quite disappointed that the Commission, in its own Renewable Energy Directive, set a really low target for renewable biofuels, these transport fuels, and there is now a debate in Parliament that it is precisely that target that should be able to be raised. It is possible to do it in a sustainable way and it is the fastest way to reduce emissions now.

The proposals are ambitious but at the same time realistic and accelerate the transition to zero-emission vehicles. They will stimulate both innovation in new technologies and business models, as well as efficient use of all types of transport of goods and people. I agree with the Commission's thinking, namely that in Europe there must be a clear change of pace and mentality and that the 40% reduction of CO2 by 2030 will also take place mainly thanks to transport. New types of non-fossil fuels and the use of cleanly produced electricity can make a difference.

Automated systems offer amazing procedures in optimizing the management of individual vehicles.

It is certainly very important to support research in this area and in the whole spectrum of transport.

I know that you are personally very much involved in bringing forward the modern logistics sector and the modern transport sector. Mr Šefčovič is fighting for batteries. Our problem is that the Commission as a whole, and especially Mr Juncker and his Head of Cabinet, have produced a very weak paper, a very weak proposal. What is the discussion in Bonn? If we want to be at zero in 2050, we also need to do something in the transport sector. When you look at the emissions in the transport sector, you will see that while in the housing sector and the power sector we have been able to go down, in the transport sector there is nothing! Why? Because the Commission and Member States have established impunity for the car industry not only as regards diesel, but also as regards CO2, for 20 years now. In 1996, Ms Merkel – then Minister for the Environment under Helmut Köhl – prevented Europe from having binding legislation on CO2 and cars. Then we had ten lost years. The last decade they have tricked us, as my colleague before has said, by giving golden cars in the laps and much fewer golden cars on the road. Now let’s look at the proposal from last week. The Commission’s own documents show that if transport is to be on track, cars need to reduce by 60%. That is according to the Commission’s own papers. On the table, only 30%! If we want to be at zero in 2050, given that the car has a 15-20 year lifetime, the Dutch government is right when they say the last moment to allow a fossil car on the road will be in 2030. What has the Commission proposed? The Netherlands has a 100% electro mobility quota for 2030. The Commission has a 30% quota, just to show you the level of ambition. In 2025, it will be 15%. VW is saying that we will have 22% of our sales in 2025. The Commission is less ambitious than VW. Then comes the big trick. Given that the Commission has only made a 15% quota, if 22% of the cars that VW sells in 2025 are electric cars then Volkswagen can take the 7% as a credit to bring more of its gigantic polluting diesel cars onto the road. Understand, we have been fooled by the German car industry and, in part, by the Commission. Therefore, colleagues, it will be our task to negotiate this upwards. I am quite optimistic.

It is unavoidable. And yes, it is also important socially, as an element of quality of life, but also from the point of view of jobs - when changing technology, we do not have to lose jobs. Secondly, you referred to a kind of new situation - the post-petroleum era and post-petroleum.

I would like to express my appreciation for the fact that in most speeches we felt very strong support for our proposals. Together with Ms Bulc and our energy union team, we are very much looking forward to working with you at such a pace that we will not only make this proposal and have a debate on it, but we will definitely adopt the whole package and make it law before the end of our mandate. The word which was probably used most frequently in this debate was ‘more’ and we very much appreciate your support for more ambition, more investment in the infrastructure and more focus on future technologies. I think that if we look at the long—term vision, we would of course like to have mobility with zero emissions, where we would have zero accidents and there would be zero congestion. I think that all this is possible if we kick—start our car and transport industry right now. This is what we are trying to do. Therefore we propose the most realistic path, namely the curve of a 30% reduction in emissions with a benchmarking system and with very harsh penalties if this 30% reduction is not met by 2030. But we also wanted to offer the industry incentives to give them the flexibility to be technologically neutral because we can see how quickly the science and research is evolving. I do not think we can really say today what the winning technology will be. We just know that it will be emission—free technology in the end. I would also like to highlight the fact that we are really working here on this cross-cutting basis because by 2030 we want to have more than 70% of our electricity carbon—free. I want to use this clean energy to power our clean cars and to give them the ability to store that energy in green batteries. That is the paradigm change that we are pushing for and we would very much like to achieve. When it comes to experience from the past, I believe that we can learn from this and therefore we are proposing very rigorous systems of controls, market surveillance, real—driving emission tests and in—service conformity checks, which would really tell us if we are on the right track or if we are deviating from it again. I can assure you that we in the Commission – and I am sure this House as well – will be very vigilant in order to make sure that we achieve the target we have set for ourselves. If you will allow me, I will now pass the floor to Ms Bulc, but I would like to thank you all very much for your supportive spirit and for all the dynamism which I believe we will need to make sure that this package is adopted before the next European Parliament elections.

Let me really quickly summarise the package and I hope you will recognise this in our proposal as well. First, we do address vehicles, infrastructure and necessary changes in the use of fuel or ‘energies’, as we are probably going to call them in the future. We do address demand and also the supply side at the same time. We do address passengers and freight at the same time. We do address CO2 emissions but also noise and other emissions. We do address road transport but also other modes. Why? Because all modes of transport have a role to play in achieving low emission mobility. Public transport must be a real alternative on the European transport market. This is essential for the environment but also for territorial and social cohesion for our entire Union.

"date": "2017-11-15.json", "name": "Marlene MIZZI", "mepid": "118858", "text": "   rapporteur. – Mr President, the importance of the role of the European Ombudsman in protecting citizens’ rights and strengthening citizens’ confidence and public trust in the European institutions cannot be emphasised enough. This is the only mechanism that holds the EU administration to account and investigates cases on behalf of our citizens. The European Ombudsman is the guardian of good administration, ensuring that the EU institutions function properly and do not encroach upon citizens’ rights. In this regard, I would like to congratulate the Ombudsman, Emily O’Reilly, for her excellent work in improving the quality and accessibility of the Ombudsman’s services and for increasing the visibility and impact of the work of the European Ombudsman. Ms O’Reilly, has accomplished a lot since her election by this House as European Ombudsman, back in 2013. The quality of the Ombudsman’s Annual Report has been improved. Now the report is clearer and easy to read. Public administrations need to become more citizen-friendly, and I think that you have achieved this milestone with your Annual Report. You have also improved the role of the Ombudsman’s strategic inquiries and initiatives by pursuing, on your own initiative, important topics in the public interest of the European citizens, such as the transparency of the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) negotiations. New working methods were introduced and case handling procedures were streamlined. This enables greater flexibility and efficiency of the Ombudsman services, aimed at deepening the dialogue between people and institutions. You have also maintained excellent cooperation and a positive engagement with the European Parliament and in particular with the Committee on Petitions. And last, but certainly not least, you have made the Ombudsman services more visible. According to the Flash Eurobarometer survey of March 2016, 9 out of 10 EU citizens are familiar with their status as European citizens and their right to complain to the Ombudsman. I would also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs for their valuable input during all stages of preparing this report: our cooperation was very fruitful and I did my best to accommodate most of their contributions. I think we all share the view that in such turbulent times, when the European Union is facing unprecedented challenges – such as the unemployment crisis, the migration crisis, Brexit – the role of the Ombudsman in bridging the gap between people and the EU institutions is crucial. Unfortunately, transparency, openness, access to information and documents, respect for the rights of citizens, and high ethical standards are still the top citizens’ concerns in the cases investigated by the European Ombudsman. The level of quality of our institutions needs to be reflected in the level of support from European citizens. Trust between citizens and the institutions is of paramount importance. We need to work on that if we are to get a mandate from our citizens to do what needs to be done to protect European citizens and Europe. Achieving the highest possible level of transparency and access to documents must be the rule. Whenever there are any exceptions to this rule, they should always be weighed against the principles of democracy. I would just like to point out that 100% transparency will probably never be possible in the light of certain legal considerations. However, my report strives to have the highest possible level of transparency and access to documents, in particular when it comes to the EU’s economic and financial decision-making process, trade or trilogue negotiations, and even on the ongoing negotiations between the EU and the UK. The report also notes maladministration with regard to the Code of Conduct of Commissioners. When it comes to ‘revolving door’ phenomenon of conflicts of interest, it is clear that the highest moral and ethical standards need to apply to all EU institutions. We need to secure respect, and this can only be done through absolute integrity and full independence from the private sector. We want to see a revision of the Code of Conduct of Commissioners. In view of this, it is also time to comply with the Ombudsman’s suggestions for improving the EU Transparency Register by making it a mandatory central transparency hub for all EU institutions and agencies. In view of the emphasis on good governance, I also want to support the Award for Good Administration, which acknowledges best practices in the EU administration and which brings them to the attention of our citizens. Finally, I would like to say that I am very satisfied with the report of the Ombudsman and I wish her the best in her future work.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 306, "date": "2017-11-15.json", "name": "Marlene MIZZI", "mepid": "118858", "text": "   Ombudsman. – Mr President, I would like to thank Ms Mizzi and all the shadow rapporteurs for their work on this report and to thank them once again for their strong support, which I greatly value. This is my fourth time of addressing the honourable Members in plenary. We draw inspiration, honourable Members, from your work as you reflect the concerns of the citizens that you represent and it is my role also to try to deal with similar concerns of citizens. I also very much welcome the presence again of First Vice—President Timmermans to this debate and I thank him for his support for my work. As you know, a majority of the complaints that we receive are directed at the Commission, given its role and its high level of interaction with citizens. The Commission continues to engage positively with my office and, while no relationship is ever perfect, we both do our best to deal with challenging issues.  This report, however, shows that increasing attention is being paid by my office to the Council. Rising public awareness of its role and greater demands for transparency have prompted this additional scrutiny and perhaps in future years Parliament might consider inviting a Council representative also to attend this very valuable annual hearing. Today’s draft report expresses support for my strategic inquiry into the transparency of the Council’s working parties and Coreper committees and a positive outcome would help, I hope, to dispel the perception that EU institutions are not transparent and therefore not sufficiently accountable. Citizens are not always aware that the Council is not just a so—called ‘Brussels institution’. As the French President Macron said recently, ‘Brussels is us’ and greater Council transparency will, I believe, lessen the temptation to blame Brussels for decisions taken by Member State Ministers and Governments as citizens will see precisely where responsibility lies.  I fully appreciate how hard it can be to get consensus or a majority vote on some matters, but when Parliament and the Commission are clear on where they stand, it can be frustrating to citizens when the failure of the Council to reach a common approach, or even take a vote, means that some proposals remain stalled, sometimes indefinitely. It is, for example, now over a year since the Commission made its proposal for an improved Transparency Register and Parliament agreed its negotiation mandate earlier this year. However, the Council is now delayed in agreeing its mandate to enter talks. I very much welcome the efforts of the Estonian Presidency to unblock the impasse and I very much hope that agreement can be reached before the elections in 2019. Transparency in itself, of course, cannot deal with every Union problem, but it can throw light not just on the respective responsibilities of the EU institutions, but also dispel some of the false facts and fake news that increasingly impact on the way in which the EU is mediated, and I note and welcome First Vice—President Timmermans’ announcement this week of a public consultation on this matter.  Fake news is ultimately about influencing, with a view to undermining, the democratic process. Lobbying transparency can help to reassure citizens that when it comes to the influencing of the EU institutions, measures are in place to help to mitigate its more negative impacts.  Other transparency work by my office in 2016 included an exchange with Eurogroup President Dijsselbloem, encouraging moves to open up the work of that very important group. Obviously, as the Eurogroup is not officially an EU institution, my mandate is limited, but I did welcome the President’s initiative in attempting to further the transparency of its decision-making.  Many citizens were concerned about what they perceived as the lack of accountability of the troika and similar concerns are at times expressed about the Eurogroup and indeed about the Council. Greater accountability through transparency is an obvious way to help to rectify this citizen alienation. I continue to raise awareness among my colleagues in the European Network of Ombudsmen about important EU issues. Last June, I hosted our annual Network Conference in Brussels at which we discussed open government, populism in Europe and, of course, Brexit. I wish to thank First Vice—President Timmermans for his keynote speech. It meant a lot to colleagues from all of your Member States to be able to have that direct engagement and I have rarely heard such lively post—seminar conversation. I would also like to thank Ms Cecilia Wikström and other MEPs for their support for these events and their much appreciated contributions to them. This report today also recognises the work of my office in several other areas. These include the transparency of the Brexit talks, continued work with the ECB and the EIB, an ongoing inquiry vis—à-vis the Commissioners’ Code of Conduct, improvements to which the Commission has already proposed, a new Ombudsman’s guide for EU officials on dealing with lobbyists, our work on the EU whistle—blowing rules to protect EU staff, an inquiry into the Commission EU pilot programme for infringement, the ongoing work with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the European Citizens’ Initiative, which the Commission is now revising.  Let me also briefly mention some routine cases dealt with in 2016. There was a complaint from the Polish Research Institute, which undertook three EU co—financed projects. The Institute turned to us after the Commission decided to recover some costs related to the subcontracting of the work. However, following our inquiry and a document inspection, the Commission agreed to waive the recovery of around EUR 86 000.  A Spanish citizen complained about the lack of translation of Commission public consultations. The Commission agreed that public consultations relating to their work programme priorities will in future be in all EU languages. Another case in 2015 was when the European Chemicals Agency agreed to our proposal to require those seeking to register chemicals to show that they have tried to avoid animal testing. These are just three of the over 1 800 complaints we dealt with in 2016. We have also been revising our internal working procedures and working methods. I wish to thank both the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control for recognition of this work. We will soon be launching a fast-track procedure for dealing with access to document complaints so that we can get answers for citizens within weeks instead of months or even, in some cases unfortunately, years.  Next year we plan to request a moderate budget increase to hire extra multilingual staff. This is due to the fact that we are experiencing a sizable increase in complaints this year. We believe we have implemented large efficiency reforms internally and now need that extra capacity to really improve again our service to citizens. Finally, I wish to note again the high standards of the EU civil service. Indeed to recognise that work and to share best practice across the institutions, we launched in 2016 the Ombudsman Award for Good Administration, receiving over 90 nominations. The award ceremony was particularly memorable and I was struck by the great pride of the officials in their work and their joy in having it recognised at a time when so much of what they do is either unseen or criticised.  Thank you again to the rapporteur Ms Mizzi, the shadow rapporteurs, their staff and the secretariats for all the work on this year’s report, which I and my staff greatly appreciate. Thank you to the Members of Parliament who, through their active engagement with the office, helped make our positive work more effective.

It is indeed a fact that the Commission is one of the main addressees of the Ombudsman’s inquiries and that we comply with her recommendations or suggestions whenever possible. Sometimes we disagree and explain why, but such cases remain limited. The overall compliance rate is very high at 82%.  Both the ombudsman and the report call for greater transparency. I am in full agreement on this. The EU institutions must meet the high transparency standards that citizens rightly expect. We live in a different society. We are no longer in a ‘trust me’ society. We are in a ‘show me’ society, and our citizens ask us to explain what we do in full transparency on a daily basis.  As you know, this Commission decided to apply the highest transparency standards upon itself. A key principle is that lobbyists can only meet Commissioners, their staff and Directors-General if they are in the Transparency Register. No registration means no meeting. But we need to go further. The register must become mandatory for lobbyists. This can only happen if that same principle is applied across the board in all three institutions – the Commission, Parliament and the Council. For example, a lobbyist who is not in the register should not be able to meet a Member of the European Parliament. Only then would registration become truly a sine qua non for lobbying the institutions. So I call on both the Council and this Parliament to commit to the same standards in the forthcoming interinstitutional agreement following the Commission’s proposal of September 2016.  As Ms O’Reilly has explained, we are still waiting for the Council to adopt its mandate, and it really is high time for us to be able to start negotiating about this. It would really be a shame if we did not finish this before the next European elections.  The report also touches upon access to documents and publication of information. Each year we proactively make public tens of thousands of new documents on our web pages, but we plan to go further, for example, by publishing an overview of each Commissioner’s mission expenses every two months.  I also fully agree that transparency in trade negotiations is essential to ensure public trust in the EU’s trade policy. This Commission took major steps right from the very beginning of its mandate. President Juncker announced, in the 2017 State of the Union speech, that the Commission would publish all its recommendations for negotiating directives for trade agreements. He added that the European Parliament, as well as national and regional parliaments, would be kept fully informed from day one of the negotiations.  Finally, let me stress that the Commission is making sure it abides by the highest standards of ethics and integrity, including by updating them when necessary. The draft new code of conduct increases transparency and sets higher standards for Commissioners, including on post-mandate activities. It incorporates several suggestions made by the European Parliament and the European Ombudsman. Without her, we would not have been able to reach where we are now.  Let me conclude by saying very clearly that this work is never finished. We will always have to improve our standards, improve the way we perform and apply the most forward-looking standards in the quality of administration we deliver for our citizens, and an integral part of that is a maximum level of transparency and accountability. I really want to thank Ms O’Reilly for helping us to reach that level.

I would also like to thank the rapporteur for her work: she managed to prepare a very balanced, well-structured report that tackles all the areas of the important work carried out by the European Ombudsman. I have been closely monitoring the activities of the European Ombudsman from the very beginning, and I greatly appreciated Ms O’Reilly’s work last year. I say to her: you managed to make the post more visible, and your communication strategies, your ideas have contributed to making this office more citizen—friendly, and I really thank you for that. You have proved to be a very efficient Ombudsman, which I also appreciate. You undertake many important initiatives which tackle the current policies of the European Union. This annual report on the activities of the European Ombudsman serves not only as a summary and approval of the work of the European Ombudsman in a given year, but it is also a reminder to us and to all the European institutions to be more service-minded, to be more open-minded regarding our citizens. It is very important to encourage the European Commission in its efforts to facilitate access to documents and information, especially with regard to EU pilot procedures. It is very important to provide as much transparency and communication to our citizens as possible, especially because many myths have been created, particularly regarding trade negotiations. However, we have to keep in mind that this transparency should never undermine the negotiating position of the European Union – there is a balance there. Ms O’Reilly, once again, thank you very much for your work, and good luck.

Let me just stick to that topic – transparency – because I think we live at a time when many citizens feel very alienated with regard to institutions, to politics, to governance. I think one of the most important issues here for regaining trust, including in our institutions and our democracy, is actually access to information – transparency, accountability – and therefore the work that the European Ombudsman is doing in this field is so important.  I am looking at the Council side now and I have to say that the Council and many of its working groups are keeping us in the dark. Many of us have had concrete experiences of this, for example the Code of Conduct Group for business taxation. They are supposed to phase out cross—border harmful corporate tax regimes in Europe. They work in secrecy. They work in unanimity; we do not know which countries are blocking or deluding this very important work to ensure fair corporate taxes in Europe. Things like that are alienating citizens and also cause the European Union to be blamed for not acting on very important societal issues.  Therefore I just want to say to the Ombudsman: full support for your work on transparency and we need to stand together to push the Council to open up and become democratically accountable to its citizens.

The role of the European Ombudsman is crucial for the transparency and control of maladministration within the European Union. At this stage, it is crucial to extend this control to other institutions, such as the Eurogroup, the Troika and the ESM. We tabled amendments, which were unfortunately rejected by the other political groups. With regard to the Troika, it should be noted that the European Ombudsman should investigate the conflict of interest in the Commission, between her role in the Troika and the responsibility of the Commission as guardian of the Treaties of the European acquis. The same applies to the conflict of interest between the ECB's current role in the Troika and its mandate to act as an independent monetary authority. In addition, an investigation is needed into the Troika's compliance with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. Accountability and transparency must also be strengthened at European level, in relation to the Eurogroup and the ESM, which make painful decisions and impose austerity and violent fiscal adjustment, as has happened with Greece over the last seven years.

It is not courtesy, it is sincere recognition. There is something that, in any case, worries me, which is the low number of people who turn to the ombudsman to be able to present their complaints, compared to what happens in the Member States, where the number of complaints does not correspond with the institutions in the Member States being worse than those of the European Union but, perhaps, with a greater and easier practice. I think this is an issue that we should examine. There is something that is important, I think it is fundamental: that there is collaboration between the ombudsman of the European Union and those of the different Member States. There are issues in the report that seem extraordinarily relevant to me, for example the issue of transparency. Transparency should be the norm, not the exception, and this is how it stands. But transparency should not be linked with what I would call \"naivety.\" We cannot be so naive that, on issues such as, for example, the Brexit negotiation, we are of such a level of transparency that we are giving all the arguments to our counterpart in the corresponding negotiation. Transparency is one thing, naivety is something else entirely. Let us, therefore, be responsible for our own limits on transparency, which I certainly claim. There is something also important, which is the clear and defined position that exists with respect to lobbies of all kinds, from the tobacco lobby to the medicine lobbies. We all know that the lobbies are there to try to influence the deputies, but there have to be limits, which is the code of conduct, which has to be rigorously implemented. The same applies to the code of conduct of the president of the European Commission when he ceases to be so, or the commissioners themselves or the advisers.The revolving door story has to end, and it has to end for good.And if the code of conduct has to be reformed, reform yourself, because it is an outcry in the face of certain scandals, no matter how legal, however legal.In any case, this is a report that you have made, which is not complacent.It is a sincere report and it is a report that has audacity, and I want, in that sense, to acknowledge your work and your role.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 314, "date": "2017-11-15.json", "name": "Sofia SAKORAFA", "mepid": "125091", "text": "on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group. - Mr President, I would like to congratulate the Ombudswoman on her clear, detailed and user-friendly report for 2016, while noting her constructive co-operation with Parliament's Committee on Petitions.

I think that these reports that we are receiving in Parliament are extremely, extremely important, and that the role of the Ombudsman in this world we live in today is all the more important in the light of all the challenges, all the discrimination that is happening and all the risks. . Above all, in a way, this report also represents a mirror of the functioning of the European institutions. Many European institutions, as well as in some cases countries, can see where the citizens of the European Union see the biggest deficit and thus the gap between the expectations of Europeans and, on the other hand, of course, the European institutions. I would like to point out a few things that I find extremely important. One of the things is transparency and the so-called democratic deficit. It is simply because we cannot have and live a democracy if we do not have adequate transparency, if we do not have adequate transparency, and here the role of the ombudsman is all the more important. Therefore, of course, I very much want greater transparency of governance in trilogues as well, so that documents and positions of individual countries are publicly available when voting on individual pressing issues in the Council, which would help citizens understand the origin and history of certain decisions and thus also to consider how individual countries have actually reacted to important things. Of course, I also call on the Ombudsman to continue his inquiry into the functioning of the European Union agencies, focusing on the Food Safety Agency and the European Chemicals Agency on Monsanto and the possible consequences of sustainability and conflicts of interest. Above all, I think it is important to lobby, the registers must be known here, including whistleblowers, including people with disabilities, and I think that these are many issues that we want to make the functioning of the European Commission and the European structure clearer. But I would like to point out something else, namely in a way, the importance of the European Citizens' Initiative as an essential form of democracy available to citizens.Therefore, I think that it would be necessary to consider how to make this initiative as operational as possible, also so that the Commission does not decide for itself which initiatives it recognizes and which it does not, and I think that there is still much room for improvement in this area.we want to really make the European Union and, of course, the European institutions democratic and closer to the citizens.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sl", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 316, "date": "2017-11-15.json", "name": "Eleonora EVI", "mepid": "124779", "text": "on behalf of the EFDD Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for Italy today is an important day. The law proposed by the 5 Star Movement on whistleblowing has been approved. From today, the fight against corruption will be given new life and whistleblowers and witnesses of crimes in the public and private sectors will be protected. At European level, it is also thanks to the tireless work of the European Ombudsman, Emily O'Reilly, that I want to thank, that this fight is going on. And I also thank the rapporteur Mizzi.

We have an excellent relationship. However, I want to reiterate two concepts that I wanted to express by means of amendments that we will vote on tomorrow. When we talk about access to documents and transparency, we must remember that these are basic principles on which to build the house of institutions, a house of glass. Today, however, this is not the case, as the citizens' complaints and the Ombudsman's inquiries show, today the rule is opacity and transparency is the exception. We must reverse this situation and make full and complete transparency the rule of the functioning of institutions, of decision-making processes in trilogues, of information relating to infringement proceedings, of commercial negotiations and so on, and only sensitive and privacy-protected data must be subject to restriction and protection. Finally, as regards the transparency register to monitor lobbies, the commitment to improve it, required by the report, to make it mandatory and transparent for the EU institutions and bodies, is good, but it is not enough. We need a legislative act, therefore a regulation, so that the register is legally binding not only for the institutions, but also for the stakeholders.This, by the way, is exactly the recommendation of the European Ombudsman.Tomorrow, by voting in favor of our amendments, we can make it fully reflected in the text of the report.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 317, "date": "2017-11-15.json", "name": "Peter JAHR", "mepid": "96772", "text": "- Mr President, ladies and gentlemen! The good cooperation between the rapporteur and the other political groups and our EPP rapporteur Jarosław Wałęsa has produced a good report. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs. Again this year I would like to thank our Ombudsman, Mrs O'Reilly, for the good and trusting cooperation and to congratulate her on her good work. Due to time constraints, I would like to address two things that are important to me. The first: You said that yourself, Ms. O'Reilly: You are working on a fast procedure. If you have a good solution, we are interested in it ourselves. As a member of the Petitions Committee, it sometimes takes too long for our petitioners to get an answer. If you have found the Philosopher's Stone here, please let us know so we can work together there too. The next problem area has already been mentioned several times: transparency. So I turn to my colleagues on the Petitions Committee once again: Here we all have to rework together, as the saying goes: everyone sits down without foaming, without ideological prejudices! Perhaps it would be much, much easier for us here if we first set the limits, and then we could plow the vast field of transparency together. Tomorrow - this is a small flaw - we will also notice the differences in voting behavior in the field of transparency.

Significant numbers such as the topics covered in the strategic initiatives that the Ombudsman has published.

Chairman! Thank you to the Ombudsman for an excellent job. It is really good to hear the great support that we have for what I believe is the key for the European Union to fight the so-called democratic deficit, namely openness in the Council. As it is now, the Council can operate in complete secrecy, and national parliaments have no idea what their governments are doing. Nor can the national press keep up. Therefore, it continues to be perceived as a distant and inaccessible institution, and it affects us all. Therefore, it was very promising to hear from both you, Emily O’Reilly, and from Frans Timmermans that this should now be at the center, and I hope we can keep the Germans a little at a distance. They are quite afraid of openness, I have noticed. It is absolutely crucial! Imagine that we had openness about Paradise Papers so you could hear which countries are actually holding the hand over tax evasion. Then we could have created credibility about this here. That would be a huge win for all of us. I think we need to be very specific so that you can see what the gain will be in the national debates as well. If the closure of the Council very quickly becomes a thing of the past - and I am very optimistic after hearing you today - then it will provide an all-time chance for real democratic participation in the codecision process. Finally, let me just mention two things very briefly: we need to have the statute changed so that the ombudsman has access to investigate the fulfillment of 1049 himself, and then we need to have the whole concept of good governance right into the law and not just as soft wording.

So, without further delay, the UK Government should publish the sector impact statements on Brexit. I also ask the Ombudsman in this coming year to give particular focus to ensuring that the highest levels of transparency are secured throughout the Brexit process in order to give citizens in all our Member States the right to make their own judgments about what is happening.

The Transparency International report ‘Access All Areas’ finds that 15 out of 27 Commissioners who completed their mandates in 2014 entered employment with organisations on the EU lobby register at the end of their 18—month cooling—off period. The bright example is, of course, José Manuel Barroso, who was President of the Commission until 2014 and who became Chairman of Goldman Sachs International for the bank’s UK and European operations. I think the Ombudsman should pay more attention to the revolving door phenomenon in the European Union.

I want to conclude by expressing once again my gratitude to Ms O’Reilly for her constructive approach and the consistently good cooperation between the Commission, the Ombudsman and her office. The Commission has also greatly appreciated the launch in 2016 by the Ombudsman of an award for good administration. This ‘name-and-congratulate’ exercise is very rewarding for all those EU officials who are doing their utmost to serve citizens and the general EU interest.  I reiterate my call for delivering real change on lobbying transparency in all three institutions. Citizens have the right to know who is trying to influence the legislative process. So we need a mandatory transparency register, not just a voluntary one. We should not miss the opportunity to deliver this before the next European elections. Let me be very clear about some apparent misunderstandings. The onus will not be on MEPs. The onus will be on the lobbyists to register, not on the MEPs they see. This will in no way limit the possibilities of MEPs to see their voters. We are talking about people who represent specific interests in lobbying when we are making legislation. This could perhaps take away some of the worries that I have registered, because transparency and trust are essential in public institutions, certainly at the European level where the distance with our citizens is too big. But also, more generally, society needs more transparency and trust in public institutions. Strengthening the protection of whistle-blowers is an essential aspect of this.  Following the public consultation, the Commission continues to assess the scope for further EU action and we will finalise this work in the first part of 2018. Once again, a big thank-you to Ms O’Reilly.

We are a very small office with just 80 people, but we have a big mandate and I rely on Parliament, as a big institution, to support me. It is wonderfully gratifying to get the support from right across the Chamber and I deeply appreciate it. I thank Ms Mizzi again for the report that she has done, which has also received such support among colleagues. A number of very interesting issues have been raised which we will follow up in the days and weeks ahead. Just briefly, as we have gone round Parliament today and over this week, a lot of us have seen some of the big billboards in relation to harassment, reminding people about appropriate workplace behaviour and this is something that I have been discussing with my colleagues. We have obviously taken complaints in the past and can continue to take complaints in relation to this, but we have had very few over the years. I think it needs a deeper conversation in relation to that and I am very happy to be part of that. On Brexit, in relation to transparency, we started working on this particular issue as soon as the referendum was over. Obviously it is not for me or any of us to tell Member States what to do in relation to the release of important documents vis—à-vis citizens, and perhaps particularly those in the UK, but what I have done is to have discussions with the Member State Ombudsmen and Information Commissioners, including the UK Information Commissioner, to remind them that if they cannot get records from their own Member State, there is always the possibility of seeking to get them from an EU institution that may also hold them. There has obviously been a lot of talk about revolving doors. We have been very busy with that over the last number of years. In relation to the Commission and the Code of Conduct, we have conducted an investigation into that and we are expecting a response from the Commission in relation to that, though I do acknowledge the proposals that have already been made by the Commission in relation to that.  A number of people mentioned limits to transparency. Yes, of course, when I talk about transparency, I am not talking about transparency at any cost. We are always talking about the appropriate release of documents in the public interest and that has to be the guiding value.  Somebody said that my office, the office of the European Ombudsman, is a mirror for the functioning of the EU and I think that is a wonderful way of describing it. In fact it describes Parliament as well because what we all do is show back to the institutions the actual impact of the laws and the regulations that are passed here.  So thank you very much indeed for your support and your comments, which I will follow up on and thank you, again, Ms Mizzi.

It is safe to say that we have a very positive attitude for this year’s Report on the Activities of the European Ombudsman and that we all appreciate the important work done by Ms O’Reilly and her team. The PETI Committee supports you and your work, Ms O’Reilly, and I am sure that the European Parliament and the Ombudsman will continue to work very closely towards the successful implementation of the Ombudsman’s recommendations emanating from this year’s annual report. We are on the right path, and that should be the conclusion of this journey. But let’s not fool ourselves. The EU has still to strive to achieve the highest level of accountability and transparency. Maintaining citizens’ trust in the EU institutions, especially at a time of a great scepticism regarding the Union project, must be our ultimate goal. We can start building this trust by guaranteeing citizens the right to the highest standards of public administration. We all have an obligation to represent European citizens in everything we do. We need to commit to improving the way in which the EU administration works, placing citizens at its heart, making sure that we work more transparently, that we are more accountable and that we react immediately when the highest standards are not met. Regulation (EC) No 1049/200 needs to be revised so that we can facilitate the Ombudsman’s work in scrutinising the granting of access to documents by Parliament, the Council and the Commission. We also need to ensure that the European administration follows up on, and implements, the recommendations of the European Ombudsman within a reasonable time frame. I say to Ms O’Reilly that I look forward to working closely with you, and I am sure that you will maintain your strong dedication to improving the quality of the European administration in answering enquiries and complaints from European citizens.

The 28 country reports are accompanied by a summary document listing the common challenges, such as waste management, nature and biodiversity protection, air quality, noise pollution, water quality and management, to identify the root causes of problems, and providing policy proposals and recommendations for improvement.  I would like to stress that the EIR is a soft tool to shed light on implementation gaps, challenges and problems. In this sense it is a key to providing an early warning for the national and sub-national level policymakers which can take corrective actions and address the gaps in time. The EIR also aims to demonstrate success stories that can serve as an example for other Member States. The recently launched peer-to-peer tool facilitates this kind of exchange of knowledge or best practices. The exercise is to be repeated every two years, offering the possibility for iterative changes and improvements.  We, Members of the European Parliament, welcome the EIR and believe that this new review mechanism as a whole has the potential to improve compliance and policy implementation and thus also contribute to greater transparency and the credibility of the EU.  Yet, in order to fully realise this potential, we believe that the process could be further improved, including by broadening the scope of the review, as also expressed in the motion for a resolution adopted in October in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. There is also a need for targeted assistance to the Member States to overcome the barriers of proper, effective implementation, such as ineffective governance, inappropriate institutional framework, lack of capacity and an unclear responsibility of the authorities. My co-sponsors of the motion for a resolution and oral question – Ms Pietikäinen, Ms Bonafè, Mr Demesmaeker, Mr Gerbrandy, Mr Flanagan –and I tabled on behalf of the Environment Committee the following questions, first to the Council, regarding the EIR. Parliament wishes to highlight the need to address the root causes, in particular lack of policy coherence and insufficient financing. The same goes for covering additional issues in the coming review cycles such as climate change, chemicals regulations, industrial emissions and other systemic challenges linked, for example, to energy, transport and regional policies.  In order to demonstrate clear, strong political commitment, the Council could hold regular meetings dedicated to the implementation of EU environmental law which could facilitate monitoring the performance and progress of a Member State and ensure structured implementation dialogues as proposed by the Commission. For the latter, Member States should pay due attention to ensuring transparency and broad stakeholder participation.  In addition, we would see added value in joint Council meetings to address the implementation of cross-cutting issues and also the environmental challenges of a cross-border nature. We would also like to ask the Commission this oral question and we raise some concerns about the exact means of following up on the policy proposals and recommendations for better implementation put forward by the Commission.  There are issues to be solved linked to data availability and comparability, especially in the context of the next review cycles that would hopefully run with a wider scope. We would like to hear the Commission’s views on how the EIR framework could be used as a means of assessing the implementation of the relevant Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the 2030 Agenda and, in general, of shifting from the current sectoral approaches to a coherent, consistent and holistic solution.  We put on the table tools, including a publicly available scoreboard to monitor the performance and progress of each Member State and to improve transparency and raise public awareness and ensure proper public participation in each Member State.  Last but not least, we would like to better understand the linkage between the EIR process and the infringements and, in general, the exact actions taken by the Commission in the event of non-compliance.

I can confirm that this interest is fully shared by the Council. In terms of addressing implementation gaps in EU environmental legislation and policy, this initiative has a high potential. In addition to contributing to the environment ministers’ input into the European Semester, the environmental implementation review process is meant to become a distinct and consistent process. It would involve several important elements: the preparation of environmental implementation review country reports and bilateral discussions with the Member States, as well as the identification of common issues and their discussion in the Environmental Council. On 28 February 2017, the Environment Council held its latest exchange of views on greening the European Semester. The economic system depends largely on the availability and sustainable use of limited natural resources. Keeping this in mind, greening the economy and advancing the transition towards a resource efficient circular economy becomes essential to secure future competitiveness and long-term sustainable and inclusive growth. In this context, Ministers also discussed the Commission’s communication on the EU environmental implementation review. They welcomed this initiative as a useful tool to help improve implementation of EU environmental policy and legislation at national level and contribute to the greening of the European Semester. In doing this, they underlined the need for national findings to be based on sound scientific data. Ministers also welcomed the opportunity for Member States to engage in dialogue and cooperation with the Commission and among themselves, peer to peer, with the aim of reflecting on their respective priorities, addressing common challenges and sharing best practices. As regards the specific questions that you have raised at this early stage of the environmental implementation review process, I would like to limit myself to the following comments. We agree with the identified root causes of the implementation gaps and we are willing to address them further. It is to be expected that the different strands of the implementation process of the environmental implementation review, and in particular the dialogue with the Member States on the basis of the country reports, will allow us to carry out a structured dialogue in Council. Member States are generally responding positively to the environmental implementation review process. Bilateral dialogues have already taken place in five countries since March this year. These countries are Belgium, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Luxembourg and Slovakia. I also encourage other countries to organise action-oriented country dialogues and to hold forward—looking debates on environmental challenges. I trust that these dialogues will be inclusive and that the relevant stakeholders get an opportunity to contribute as appropriate. The current environmental implementation review cycle is already very ambitious and covers a large number of complex and very significant areas. In terms of broadening the scope of the environmental implementation review to other policy areas in the future, we find it essential that environmental challenges are tackled in a comprehensive manner and that all relevant policies are taken into account. The real added value of the environmental implementation review will come from in—depth impartial analysis. However, if broadening the scope is considered, due attention should be given to avoiding a disproportionate administrative burden. As regards the involvement of the Council – although I cannot speak on behalf of future presidencies – currently, the idea is to bring the structural problems and common challenges identified in the course of the two-year period to the attention of the Council. The Council would then discuss environmental implementation review-related issues at regular intervals in line with the cycle, also ensuring complementarity with the discussion on the greening of the European Semester and the relevant post—2020 strategies. Lastly, in many areas environmental policy is interlinked with other domains. In addressing the cross-cutting issues, we should avoid working in silos and ensure that all relevant parties are involved in discussions. The respective dialogues should not be held at Council level only, but start from expert groups and other working formations. Hence the effort of engaging colleagues from other policy areas is welcome at all levels in order to achieve a coordinated and informed outcome. I thank Parliament once again for these questions.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 340, "date": "2017-11-15.json", "name": "Benedek JÁVOR", "mepid": "124721", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, I want to say how glad I am to take this point on behalf of Commissioner Vella. Commissioner Vella wishes to thank the author and all of the people involved in the interest in the environmental implementation review (EIR) and for your support for this important initiative.  The EIR puts implementation in a broader context with a view to finding practical solutions by looking at integration with other sectors and by identifying possible root causes for implementation challenges. This helps to improve the knowledge and sharing of good practice.  The main goal of the EIR was to draw attention to the need for improved implementation in order to attain the European Union’s environmental objectives. The environmental targets and deadlines which need to be achieved by the Member States are included in the legal obligations set out in the environmental aquis and are being monitored per directive and regulation.  The EIR encourages cooperation, dialogue and the search for solutions involving a wide range of stakeholders at national level. It is not feasible, but neither is it the Commission’s intention, to rely on a name-and-shame exercise. This could, at any rate, jeopardise the achievement of goals. The Commission has included in the country reports both good practices and good examples, as well as implementation challenges. The data used in the country reports are comparable.  The Commission’s ongoing initiative in streamlining reporting requirements in EU environmental law is expected to improve the quality and completeness of the data significantly.  The EIR takes a holistic approach, reflecting the spirit of the Sustainable Development Goals. and the Commission is taking steps to ensure that the second review cycle will be even more comprehensive by including chemicals, industrial emissions and the implementation of climate change policies. The nexus with climate change and other policies will also be developed as much as possible.  The Commission encourages Member States to organise national dialogues under the EIR in a cross-sectoral approach. The first five countries’ dialogues succeeded in doing so, and further dialogues are being planned. The Commission has also asked Member States to involve all relevant stakeholders during their country dialogues. We firmly believe that discussions will result in tailored solutions and mount some pressure to fill in the implementation gaps that are identified in the EIR reports.  The EIR inspires learning from good practice. On 7 September 2017, the Commission launched a peer-to-peer tool with the Committee of the Regions. It is intended to support concretely the Member States at all administrative levels to share experience and expertise. This will lead to a database of good practices.  The EIR has not changed the Commission’s policy as regards infringements, and there is no formal relationship between the voluntary approach and the legal procedures. In most cases, the infringement procedures will run in parallel where necessary. However, if the EIR succeeds over time in improving implementation, as is expected, fewer infringement procedures will be needed and, therefore, fewer resources will have to be spent on legal proceedings, and we should have enhanced environmental protection due to upstream and systematic solutions.  I wish to conclude by thanking the author and all of the people that have been involved in drawing up this report.

Our entrepreneurs, farmers, wildlife managers, governments and citizens are held to the strictest requirements. This evaluation shows that implementation by EU Member States, provinces, regions and local authorities varies widely. Unfortunately, one Member State is cheating on environmental legislation and another Member State is unnecessarily strict in certain cases, while the same Member State ignores other environmental legislation. I regret that the water quality and drug residues in the water receive too little attention in this report. I also miss the commitment of land owners and provinces for the improved implementation of Natura 2000. Farmers have to pay off because of nitrogen precipitation in nature reserves, centuries-old family businesses have to be relocated in Twente. But how do we deal with other sectors? How differently do Member States such as the Netherlands deal with the interests of big money, with oil and gas extraction? I want to talk about that. In the Twente region in Overijssel, polluted waste water from oil extraction is discharged under drinking water and Natura 2000 areas. Surely this is the world upside down. Your response to my written questions was clear last year. Pursuant to Article 12 of the Waste Directive, Member States must ensure that such discharges (waste disposal operations) do not endanger human health and are without risk to soil and water. The Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij and the national government have, however, for years refused to have wastewater treated prior to discharges into the subsoil of vulnerable water extraction and nature areas. This while good purification techniques exist for this.

However, we must not only boast of having ambitious regulations, we must also be able to enforce these regulations, which unfortunately does not always happen. This is fundamental not only for the credibility of the Union, but also for the protection of the environment and for the health of our citizens and also for the economic consequences. We see it very well, for example, with the impact assessment on the circular economy which benefits in terms of employment and economic growth can bring an effective and efficient management of waste. Well then, the Commission has done to prepare a tool to assess the performance of Member States in the implementation of environmental legislation. Having a mapping allows us to understand how much reality separates us from the objectives set by law, the sectors in which we are still behind, why we are still behind, and therefore identify the causes, and which tools to concretely put in place to achieve the objectives. You understand that, first of all, it is necessary that the data are more comparable to facilitate the exchange of best practices, as we ask in the resolution. We also need to have as precise a picture as possible, including other elements in the evaluation. We think in the resolution of energy efficiency, of the transport sector, of climate change. I am pleased to hear that there is already an opening, as the Commissioner said, not least because it is unthinkable today not to consider the impact of climate change. And now I turn to the Council.

I have experienced this in practice in my work in the field of biodiversity policy, waste legislation and emission standards. We must therefore focus more on better implementation, otherwise our strict standards will only turn out to be paper tigers in reality. The new EIR instrument launched by the Commission can play an important role in this and deserves all support. Of course, everything can always be improved. We make a number of recommendations for this from the environmental committee. First, the EIR should not be a purely technical instrument. It must also feed the political discussion. For example, a permanent item on the Council's agenda on the implementation of environmental legislation would be a step forward. Second, it is essential that regional and local authorities are fully involved. As a Flemish Member of the European Parliament I cannot emphasize that enough.

On many occasions, the statement is made at home that ‘the EU made us do it’, a similar sort of excuse that Bart Simpson comes up with when he has obviously done something wrong: ‘someone else made them do it’. What chance is there of real committed implementation if the state itself is not really committed? The result in implementation tends to be shabby and imposed on people, rather than carried out through consultation and dialogue. A perfect example of this is the Birds and Habitats Directive. As Commissioner Hogan knows himself, I would not be here if it were not for the mess that was made of that. The directive itself is excellent. However, how it was implemented when it came to turf cutters and farmers has left a bitter taste which will not be removed for a long time. No real consultation took place, and also implementation costs ordinary people money, whether that be septic-tank inspections or training in pesticide spraying.

Some Member States lack money, but at the level of the European Union it is not the lack of funds that is the problem, but their mismanagement. Useful investments have been made for some projects, such as improving drinking water quality, but in many other cases the money has simply been wasted. This is very clear from the Court of Auditors' reports. The Commission must act to ensure a more responsible use of the funds it distributes for environmental projects.

So for us you have to do three things. First of all: introduce sanctions that are truly effective for those Member States which, however, fail to enforce, to impose the \"polluter pays\" principle. Second thing: the infringement procedure mechanism does not work. It cannot be citizens who pay twice: once in terms of health because the environment in which they live is not protected and the second time in economic terms because they receive an infringement procedure. Those responsible have to pay, which are very often the ministries of the environment of the individual Member States, who instead remain there in their seats despite being responsible.

And it is good that colleagues here have raised this issue here today, because I know from my own experience that we often pass legislation that is not always well implemented at that national level and is not always well used.

I welcome here the information from the Commission that evaluation reports on the state of the environmental acquis will be and are being prepared. I want to emphasize and recommend that, in addition to criticizing the shortcomings of individual Member States, positive examples be highlighted, that there should be more dialogue with individual Member States than just criticizing if there are any shortcomings, because then we will have natural resistance to the environmental acquis and probably no one wants that. I am also pleased that the representatives of the Commission have spoken here about the issue of the implementation of these regulations in the future being more debated in the Environment Council.

Yet, in this House, there are many who would clamour for the removal of this product, and indeed the Member States are refusing, or failing, to come forward with a proposal to re-license it.

I will convey these concerns and suggestions back to Commissioner Vella. The Environmental Implementation Review is an example of how the Commission can work with Member States and other institutions to address the weak implementation of environmental rules and policy. As many of you have said, this is necessary in order to increase the European Union’s credibility. Ms Schreijer-Pierik mentioned issues in relation to water quality in the Netherlands. These are very important issues, and I see that, if water quality in a Member State is an issue where the spirit and content of the legislation in relation to our Water Framework Directive is not being implemented, infringement proceedings can be taken if necessary. I would, of course, agree that farmers should be seen as part of the solution rather than part of the problem. I would say to Mr Flanagan that 31 European Court of Justice judgments against Ireland were on the desk of a certain Minister of the Environment in 2011, and that number was reduced in three years to nine because a dedicated unit was set up and human and financial resources were assigned to it. In other words, it was given political priority. This subsequently saved an enormous amount of money for the country. So implementation is a matter for the Member State, and it is in the interest of the Member State, if it wants to eliminate the possibility of expensive legal proceedings and fines, to take action. It is in the interest of our citizens that full implementation is actually achieved as quickly as possible. But I also agree with Mr Pospíšil that, sometimes, the manner of implementation of environmental law in Member States needs a lot of attention and monitoring, and I think Mr Flanagan was right in that regard as well. There can be gold-plating, in certain cases, and we have evidence and some examples of where that has been the case in some Member States. Ms McGuinness, you have certainly come at the glyphosate debate from a different angle and it is an interesting one. Ms Grapini, again, it is a matter for Member States to decide if they want to implement support packages and financial support with assistance from EU programmes, like the LIFE Programme, for example, which can offer financial assistance, if necessary, with the implementation of certain environmental law that has to be transposed and implemented by the Member States on behalf of the European Union. Thank you again to all the contributors.

Fighting inequality is also the best way to ensure stability in our institutions and the best way to combat the monsters that we have seen in the last electoral period in the Western world. The European Union, as we know, and its institutions have been very aware of a long list of crises in recent years - since the financial crisis, the sovereign debt crisis, some internal political crises that we have suffered - but now that growth rears its head, stability rears its head and we can see a future of some stability, the time has come to make it a priority to remake our social pact and also respond to the long list of victims and victims in recent years. A job market that we know has been transformed in recent times and is no longer the source of security and prosperity that it had been until not long ago. Serve a list of 115 million European citizens who today live at risk of poverty or social exclusion. Address the unbearable inequalities that have increased in recent years within countries and, above all, between countries, when until now we had been a convergence machine, as the European Treaties well say. And for this we also make and mark a roadmap. Not only do we call for action, we not only acknowledge the economic impact of inequality, but, as institution, we say that we have to rebalance our economic policy and introduce inequality in its tools - the country-specific recommendations or the European Semester. And, at the same time, we have to build a true European social dimension. And it is no coincidence that we approved this report in the plenary of the European Parliament a few days after approving the European social pillar, a list of rights and social objectives that the citizens of the Union will have. But that list, then, must be able to become instruments, policies, European standards and resources. And we have launched some proposals: from the need to have a table of minimum income at the European level to studying the possibility of having a box that accompanies unemployment benefits, going through fighting against child poverty with a child guarantee system as a proposal ; continue to fight also against youth unemployment, as we have done in recent years; attend to the labor market, to the improvement of wages, with an index of living wages; and also pay attention to the new forms of employment that we have seen - some also derived from digitization - that concern us. All of this must be done while we tell the Union that there are underlying economic trends that concern us, that generate growth but do not distribute well, such as digitization and robotization or international trade; that there are groups that experience vulnerability in an intersecting way: the disabled, the gender gap - which concerns us a lot in this report - or the generation gap. For this, it will also be necessary to pay attention to taxes, the other side of the coin. With this, the Union sets the fight against inequality as a priority and, above all, we say that this form, the social dimension, is the best way to once again legitimize the European institutions vis-à-vis the citizens, recovering growth, stability and dignity for this continent.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 360, "date": "2017-11-15.json", "name": "Javi LÓPEZ", "mepid": "125042", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, I am presenting this point on behalf of Commissioner Thyssen, who, as you know, is on her way to the Social Summit in Gothenburg for the first time in 20 years.  I welcome the fact that your report focuses on inequalities as this is an important topic that deserves our full attention. Inequalities are not only dividing our societies, they are putting a brake on our competitiveness and economic growth. We therefore need economic growth that benefits all citizens while we still need to overcome the damage done by the economic crisis. In the Annual Growth Survey, the Commission asked the Member States to redouble their efforts on investment, structural reforms and responsible fiscal policies, but with an increased focus on inclusive growth and social fairness.  Your report calls on the Commission and the Member States to address issues that generate inequalities – wage settings, social protection systems which includes minimum income, gender equality, enabling social services, childcare, support to children, old age income, health care and access to housing. This is why we presented the European Pillar of Social Rights as a framework to also reduce inequalities and social risks. Parliament has been actively involved in the process that led to the adoption of the pillar and finally, as I said, to its proclamation this Friday by the three institutions at the Social Summit for Fair Jobs and Growth in Gothenburg.  The Commission acknowledges and thanks Parliament for its crucial role throughout the process, but the pillar should not be only words. Together with the pillar, we have already launched two social partner consultations. One is to collect views on the possible direction of an EU action to ensure that people in all forms of employment have adequate access to social protection and employment services. The second is on a possible revision of the Written Statement Directive, which would increase the protection for the most precarious workers, including digital workers. We have also put forward an initiative to support work-life balance for parents and carers.  We are looking forward to your report and we are hoping to get it through the legislative process as quickly as possible. The European Semester will have a key role in implementing the pillar. Combating inequalities has been and remains a priority of the European Semester. Several past country-specific recommendations have been addressed to Member States on issues that are relevant to inequality. We intend to build on this approach in the coming cycle to ensure that progress on implementing the pillar is properly reflected and monitored. Indeed, a new feature will be the use of the pillar’s social scoreboard to monitor developments in Member States, looking across a wide spectrum of policy areas which will include inequality, poverty and social inclusion.  Finally, I particularly welcome the focus of the report on children. Investing in children is key to breaking the cycle of inequality and disadvantage through generations. As regards the implementation of the current preparatory action on a child guarantee, our aim is to investigate the feasibility of such an initiative and its added value compared to ongoing actions at the moment.  So as we speak, the recovery is ongoing, with improvements in the overall situation in the labour market in all Member States. It is essential now to prevent the risk that, as the recovery continues in Europe, some people are left behind. That is why your report and this debate are very timely.

Combating inequalities is one of the obligations of the Member States under the Treaties. It is also an expression of social justice and social and economic development. As the title of the report we are talking about today says, combating inequality can speed up the creation of new jobs. I can bet there are many people in this House who do not agree with this point. It is not obvious to them, because they perceive equality actions as an additional effort and additional cost, the frills of a developed country, and not a lever of development. That is why I am pleased with the amendments that the FEMM Committee has prepared, which clearly show how greater equality between women and men can contribute to building and developing the labor market. Today, gender inequalities are well known to us: women earn less, have lower pensions, are blocked from promotion, and work in lower-paying sectors. This overlaps with the work-house conflict and the disproportionately greater involvement of women in unpaid domestic work.

The draft report itself is fundamentally for noble purposes, to create jobs, increase social security and create common European funds to finance social programs. However, in connection with the latter, the draft report also contains a number of initiatives with a vague financial commitment, which would currently be irresponsible to vote on. I welcome the fact that important elements for the People's Party have also been adopted in the joint work, but not all of them. One such example is our proposal that competitiveness aspects should also be taken into account when measuring inequalities and social problems. All in all, I consider it a great achievement to say that European Union funds should not be taken away from countries with spectacularly improving performance just because they outperform other Member States from domestic sources. In Hungary, for example, youth unemployment has also fallen dramatically, but this should not be a reason to take away funding from the Youth Guarantee prematurely.

Before 2008, the EU made some big leaps forward in terms of economic integration, but the financial crisis after 2008 led to a significant decline in relative income levels in the European periphery, while core Member States were generally more resilient. However, there is a broader backdrop to the whole issue of inequalities: namely, in general, in recent years, billionaires’ fortunes have grown by an average of 7-8% per year, while total wealth has grown at just 3% annually. Globalisation, deregulation and declining taxes have all been factors, but the other important factor has been the rise of a far-flung, global, cross-border wealth-management industry – so-called – dedicated to avoiding taxation of the wealthiest. The richest 1% of the world’s population now owns more than half of global wealth and the top 10% owns about 90%, while data suggest that most of the gains at the top are coming at the expense of the rest of the population. What is more, the wealthy use the power that accompanies their money to exert political influence and reduce taxes and regulation. I would like to highlight three main lines of action among the many that the rapporteur has indicated in his report. First, enhanced social dialogue and collective bargaining for determining wages, recalling the fact that the right of collective bargaining and action is fundamental and that the decline in the bargaining power of workers and trade unions must be reversed. Second, a call to the Commission to put forward initiatives to remove any kind of gender pay gap, setting penalties for workplaces that violate the right to equality by establishing different wages for identical job categories.

Thank you, chairman. Ladies and gentlemen, I fully agree that greater equality and upward convergence should be a priority. Great inequality harms us all. It slows down economic growth and employment. But the way in which this report proposes to tackle inequality is wrong. First, the answer to inequality is not an ever-increasing Europeanization. For example, the rapporteur wants a European minimum income scheme, a European unemployment scheme, a European directive on work-life balance, you name it. For example, this report does not respect the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality. When the member states have to accept social uniformity, they cannot take sufficient account of the needs of their own citizens - certainly given the scarce resources. This has the inevitable consequence of alienating citizens even further from Europe. Do we want that? Second, I regret the repeated condemnation of atypical work. No, we absolutely must not create working poor. But having a job is still the best guarantee against poverty. Atypical employment contracts allow people who would otherwise fall out of the work boat to get to work. Creating flexibility in the labor market creates opportunities and I strongly believe in giving people opportunities, of course in combination with a good social safety net when necessary. Finally, I regret that the Youth Employment Initiative does not succeed in helping young people to find work in a structural way, but actually leads to the opposite. Indeed, it removes the incentives for Member States and regions to seriously reform their labor markets and, moreover, does not address the structural causes of youth unemployment. We just need targeted and fundamental solutions to stimulate job creation and growth. I regret that the report has taken a different path.

We know that inequalities damage our entire social fabric, they are costly to our societies in many ways and the European Union has a limited number of tools at its disposal. Part of the question is whether it is using the tools it has got as effectively as it might. I think all of us welcome the idea of the social pillar, we would just like to see something a bit less flimsy, which will, we hope, be more sustainable.

There is an obvious need, as we all acknowledge, to tackle extreme poverty. I think many of us are still affronted by the fact that the European Union has so many food banks because people cannot afford to feed themselves and their families. We need to look at how we use the European Semester as a way of moving forward on this social inequalities agenda. Many Members have spoken about tax justice and it is true that the tax justice agenda is a crucial part of closing the gap. It provides additional monies for essential social investment, along with better targeting of the EU money we have available. We should be looking at the creation of decent work. It is scandalous that we are seeing a growth in in-work poverty, so issues such as the living wage are becoming essential.

That is, in the hands of eight people, today in the world, there is the same wealth that three and a half billion people have.

Firstly, the EU has clear concepts and, secondly, effective instruments. One of the foundations is our European social model. Economic dynamism of the markets is combined with social equilibrium. It is about equal opportunities, solidarity with the disadvantaged, the creation of quality jobs, the fight against poverty and exclusion. The Europe 2020 strategy aims to significantly increase the employment rate, significantly reduce the number of early school leavers and further reduce the risk of poverty. Implementation also includes fine-tuning the European Semester, Commissioner. In addition to assessing economic growth and structural reforms on the one hand, social components should also be taken into account. And the EFSI? It should certainly help the small and medium-sized enterprises significantly, on the other hand the promotion of education and training. Another ambitious idea is the youth guarantee. Yes, it led to the youth employment initiative. After initial difficulties, the first concrete successes can be seen. I hope that we will succeed in further increasing the funds.

While I do not want to establish a hierarchy in the difficulties that our fellow citizens face, I nevertheless want to stress a new form of inequality: it is digital inequality. So yes, for me, the digitization of the economy and society creates many opportunities for our citizens, but not yet enough and not yet for all. We must therefore make proposals in this direction and, from my point of view, three projects are priorities. First, I believe that we must first and foremost bridge the digital divide. Too many rural areas are still deprived of broadband, which isolates these areas, discourages businesses wishing to settle there and thus penalizes those who live there, those who work there and those who seek employment. Second, digital skills must be developed as part of initial training, but also throughout the professional career, in order to guard against technological unemployment. Third, we must question the question of the law applicable to digital platforms, which risks keeping some employees in a precarious situation. I say yes to the development of these new economic models, but this must be done while respecting social and fiscal rules to ensure fair competition for companies and security and protection for our employees.

Inequality is a very important issue! It is actually a shame that we are discussing this at such a late hour. I hope that at least many people will follow this debate via livestream. A survey has just been published in my home country Germany. There it was said that 77% of people in Germany think that they are afraid of inequality. Many of them are doing just fine. But they still fear inequality. We know that inequality causes economic, social and political damage in our society. What does that mean? Ultimately, this means that people may not be able to fully exploit the opportunities they have, and may not be able to participate in society as they would like. For me, there are three questions about inequality. On the one hand: how do you actually measure it? Second: When has a critical level been reached that no longer encourages the individual to become better, reduces inequality, but rather discourages entire social groups? The third question is: what means can be used to reduce inequality? There are some, including here in the European Parliament, who say we simply have to develop the social systems. I believe that the issue of European unemployment insurance, as the left side here in Parliament would like it to be, is no solution. We should think differently. We should focus on the topic of promoting and challenging. Investing in education is important to give people who are really treated unequally from their point of view, but the chance to independently reduce their inequality.

Over the years, some European countries have countered the crisis with senseless policies of rigor, reducing social protections, reducing the effect and amount of welfare available, in the idea that the economy would restart in this way, making it cost less the cost of labor, while instead the competition that comes from weaker parts of the world's populations has prevailed. On the other hand, ancient, yet already ineffective, redistributive tools have also been broken. The systematic scandals on the tax authorities, which have remained substantially intact as an element of negative pressure on the poorest part of the European population, those who work and have a dependent income, and have allowed companies, instead, to escape from obligations and loyalty towards the States have blown up the elements of cohesion that also guaranteed an adequate competitive capacity to the economic system. When work becomes precarious and unprotected and individual and collective rights are not recognized, productivity inevitably suffers. Therefore, what we are called to do today is to try to put in place fair and just redistributive policies, to protect the weakest and to fight against poverty. For this reason, I believe that the minimum income is the right tool, it is a universal tool that gives everyone the same protections and the same opportunities.

And I give the example of Spain, my country, which is the second country where it has grown the most in recent years. Nor should we forget that when we speak of inequality what some lose is won by others. There are urgent measures outlined in this report, such as the Directive on a minimum income or European unemployment insurance, which seem absolutely necessary to us.

Growing inequality is not only a loss to economic potential, as this report brilliantly demonstrates, it is also at the root of the rising populism and extremism that sows division in our communities and threatens European values.  Years of austerity politics have only made things worse, in particular in my country, as well as in Greece, Portugal, Spain and Ireland. I want to highlight the particular situation of women, who are more impacted by public cuts and are at higher risk of poverty and precariousness. In addition, they face multiple discrimination. However, the economic potential of women can be unlocked across Europe through anti-discrimination measures and ambitious and efficient social policies. I also want to reiterate that the number of children living in, or at risk of, poverty in our societies in 2017 is simply shameful. We need to adopt the EU Child Guarantee now, a guarantee that I have fought for in this House. Fighting inequalities can boost job creation and sustainable growth. We must include, therefore, a proper welcome for newcomers, refugees and asylum seekers, and include them in the labour market as part of the strategy. Combating inequalities must mobilise all EU instruments, including the European Semester, the EU structural and investment funds and the Youth Employment Initiative and Youth Guarantee, and we must also be ready to apply the European Pillar of Social Rights and have recourse to the European Solidarity Corps. We, as decision makers, need to mainstream this shared goal in our work across various policy areas, in a coordinated manner: working in silos is no longer the solution.

This is why it is so important that we deal with all factors determining it, such as the changes in the global economy, regional variations in competitiveness or the lack of structural reforms.

It is a brilliant piece of work. Then I would like to use this little bit of time to pick up on two points in the report.  Point 31 refers, as we have heard from other colleagues, to zero—hours contracts. We have heard how in the United Kingdom there are now more than a million people on zero—hours contracts. My region, the West Midlands, contains proportionally more of those people than any other part of the United Kingdom, and the growth in the number of those people in the most recent year recorded by the UK’s Office for National Statistics was 10%. This is a growing and serious problem and it requires legislative action to deal with it. A zero—hours contract is not work – it is exploitation, and it should not be acceptable in a civilised society in this day and age.  It is linked with the second point in the report that I would like to pick up on, point 42, about the failure to apply the Working Time Directive and the widespread abuse of unpaid overtime. There are five million people in the UK regularly, systematically working overtime for which they are not being paid. GBP 33 billion worth of overtime work that has been done has not been paid for. Why do employers get away with that kind of exploitation, with stealing GBP 33 billion worth of work from their employees? The answer is because at least a million of those employees are on zero—hours contracts or in similarly insecure forms of employment where they will put up with being exploited because they are frightened of losing their jobs. That is not the way it should be in a rich and supposedly civilised continent like ours in this century.

Sovereignty that has been progressively eroded by the dynamics of uncontrolled globalization and financial capitalism. The data clearly show that the crisis of recent years has had a dramatic effect on the growth of inequalities in its most varied forms: income, gender, class, geographic, intergenerational. The divergences have grown more than proportionally for the weaker groups, and it is therefore imperative that the European Union take responsibility for relaunching a social agenda capable of reversing this trend. In a few days, in Gothenburg, the heads of state and government will meet to conclude the agreement on the European pillar of social rights. We must be able to transform this solemn event into a real movement, capable of finally equipping the Union with a social strategy suited to the challenges of modernity.

A Parliament that, in my opinion, should put the fundamental rights of European citizens and the fight against poverty at the top of its initiative. Unfortunately, we are faced with an unprecedented growth in economic, social and cultural inequalities and this situation is at the root of the enormous difficulties and social malaise that European citizens find themselves experiencing. Suffice it to say that since 2005, income poverty has been steadily increasing and that, according to a report by Oxfam, in 2015 there were 342 billionaires in euros and 123 million people, almost a quarter of the European population. at risk of poverty or social exclusion. The regressive labor market reforms in various Member States, alas also in my own country, have weakened the representation and bargaining power of workers, resulting in increasingly precarious working conditions and lower wages. Social mobility has practically disappeared. To counter this situation it is not enough to resort to redistributive policies, which are however very important, but it is essential to act through a vast set of policies ranging from macroeconomic to education. For this reason, I believe it is imperative to intervene on social spending, tackling the problem of poverty through support for families, guaranteeing free universal access to the health service and introducing a decent minimum income for all.

Rising inequalities undermine social cohesion, economic growth and the very stability of our political institutions, as many of you said. As the report rightly points out, automation and digitalisation add to the existing challenges as they rapidly transform the world of work. So, along with the undeniable opportunities that are offered for social participation and for innovation and job creation, they also carry with them the risk of widening inequalities. This debate is timely in the context of the social summit in Sweden, and I can assure the House that President Jean-Claude Juncker and Commissioner Thyssen and the Commission generally are committed to the implementation of the proposed actions that have been outlined by Commissioner Thyssen. The only appropriate response to the challenges that have been presented here this evening is to invest more and better in the people of Europe, and this means starting early on and continuing right throughout their lives. This is the essence of what is contained in the European pillar of social rights. And following the pillar’s proclamation, the Commission, for its part, is committed to following up with concrete actions.

The report seeks to raise the issue of inequality as a top priority at European level and proposes to reduce it by combating poverty and social exclusion, but also by improving living and working conditions and active labor market policies or strengthening trade union and workers' rights. Given that one of the main reasons for the widening income gap is the rise in unemployment, the report proposes strengthening key employment policies, focusing on two particularly vulnerable groups: young people and the long-term unemployed. Strengthening and modernizing the welfare state and the social protection we want to provide to our citizens is crucial to tackling inequality. The fight against poverty, especially among young people and children, explains one of the biggest concerns when we face the consequences of inequality, not only from a social point of view, but also in terms of future potential. Addressing gender inequalities so that everyone in the labor market operates on an equal footing will reduce inequalities and have a positive impact on sustainable growth.

Hence our next steps - a question put to the Commission under Rule 128 of Parliament's Rules of Procedure on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture, which prepared this question at the request of the coordinators. The Russian import ban has deprived European fruit and vegetable producers of an important export market, and the extension of the embargo until December 31, 2018 will undoubtedly cause further serious consequences for this sector in the EU. This ban for the third year in a row causes significant losses for producers in the EU, regardless of the conflict in Ukraine - European farmers have nothing to do with the Ukraine-Russia conflict. Given the persistent volatility of agricultural markets, the Russian ban has further worsened the situation of EU agricultural producers. Given that it is not feasible to open up new alternative markets for the EU fruit and vegetable sector, markets in line with the Russian market in the short and medium term - especially due to non-tariff trade barriers - it is imperative to find a sustainable solution to this situation right up to the end the validity of the Russian embargo. In the light of the above comments, a question arises for the Commission. Does the Commission intend to take further action to support European fruit and vegetable producers and exporters? If so, what specific and sustainable actions is it considering? Secondly, European fruit and vegetable producers cannot be left alone. What measures will the Commission and the Council take to ensure the future of European fruit and vegetable producers and exporters? Third, what action will the Commission take to help farmers compensate for the losses caused by the Russian ban? Will the Commission publish a study on the effectiveness of diversion and shaping? EU agricultural production as well as distribution and demand since the introduction of the Russian embargo, with particular emphasis on the situation of small producers and the consequences they bear? So much for the questions. As for the comment, we should thank both farmers and traders that they worked very intensively in the search for new markets with visible results. Also, the European Commission tried to give support as much as possible, and the funds and resources that helped farmers to survive this difficult situation were saved. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Commissioner Hogan, who has acted very decisively in this regard. However, one would like to express a slightly broader opinion that the sanctions adopted by the European Union against Russia are not very effective. President Putin, one could say, is laughing, but in retaliation he introduces significant restrictions on EU farmers who have nothing to do with the cause of the sanctions, that is, Russia's attacks on Ukraine, but bear the costs of this situation, as I have already mentioned. If the EU wanted to introduce serious, effective sanctions against Russia, it had many other options, but it did not take advantage of them, but pursues various interests that are very beneficial to some, but not to farmers.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 411, "date": "2017-11-15.json", "name": "Czesław Adam SIEKIERSKI", "mepid": "23787", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, let me start by underlining the strong support that the European Union has provided to producers of fruit and vegetables since the beginning of the Russian embargo. Through our exceptional measures we have already provided a total amount of aid of EUR 490 million, which corresponds to a withdrawal of 1.7 million tonnes of fruit and vegetables. These exceptional measures continue to operate and they sustain the market. The EU support allows producers to adapt to the new market situation and, in parallel, we are working to ensure a gradual opening of new markets for European Union apples by lifting sanitary and phytosanitary barriers, particularly in Asia, in countries like China, India and Vietnam, and in the American countries, particularly the United States and Canada. I am disappointed, however, that the United States has not fulfilled its promise to open the market for fruit to Poland and Belgium in particular, as it promised to do some time ago. So this diversification of trade that we are seeking to open up is developing much more slowly for fruit and vegetables than originally expected.  However, I want to recall that the overall EU export figures for agrifood products are increasing. They total EUR 137 billion for the 12-month period from September 2016 to August 2017. This is well above the export figures of July 2014 when the Russian embargo was imposed.  These figures are no consolation to our farmers who are involved in the fruit and vegetable sector, who still need our support and who are continuing to suffer market losses and income losses. In view of the persisting market difficulties, the temporary exceptional measures in relation to fruit and vegetables have been prolonged after 1 July 2017 for one more additional year, and the matter can be reviewed again at that stage.  The support which we have focused in particular on certain fruit tree crops is important in terms of alleviating market disturbance. Last summer, the budget devoted to the scheme was increased following the peaches and nectarines crisis, as additional quantities for withdrawal were allocated to Greece, Italy and Spain.  In addition, many of you asked, in the context of the withdrawal of the product from the market, to increase significantly the support in terms of the withdrawal scheme and the amount of product for fruit and vegetables. This was done in a Delegated Act recently for producer organisations, and it is applicable since June of this year. This provides considerable additional support to the market. I have promotion support as well for the marketplace, where Member States can allocate up to 70% assistance from the European Union to promote the possibilities for fruit and vegetables right around the world and diversify into other markets. By mentioning these particular issues I am saying that we are doing everything we possibly can, by all the means at my disposal, to help farmers in the fruit and vegetable area to overcome the market difficulties in the food and vegetable sector arising from the Russian embargo, and that farmers are not being left totally on their own.  I would also like to underline that in some Member States, and for certain products, such as peaches in Spain, or apples in Poland, there are structural problems of over-production in those countries, and we have to look at these issues and monitor them. These temporary exceptional measures cannot be considered as the appropriate way to remedy these types of situations and we will continue to look at those markets and those particular products with Member States in order to see what we have to do to address this problem of over-production in an appropriate way.  I would say to Mr Siekierski that the political decision regarding sanctions in respect of the Russian embargo, and their effectiveness or otherwise, is not a matter for the Commissioner for Agriculture, but a matter for political decisions that have been made elsewhere.

Almost 30,000 in my country, Spain, but also in Greece, Italy or Portugal. I know that withdrawing them is possible thanks to the more than 70 million allocated to the products affected by the Russian veto until next summer. But that is certainly until next summer. That is why I bring this matter to the Plenary, due to the permanent uncertainty to which farmers are subjected. Every year, for three, the Commission announces the extension of aid, and every year, for three, our farmers have waited with their hearts in a fist to know if the quotas and withdrawal prices will cover their needs or not. It is an untenable situation, Commissioner, and I know that you are sensitive to it. We cannot allow our producers to be hostage to Russian tactism. It is a fact that the embargo is hurting us. Also that it has generated a boom in Russian production. One example: while the Union's imports have fallen by 40% since 2013, its largest agricultural company - Rusagro - increased its sales by 16% in 2016. So let's be realistic. The Kremlin is in no rush to lift the veto. Therefore, we must think about the best way to deal with it in the medium term. I have proposed converting emergency measures into structural measures, because if we know that the Russian veto is going to last, why not better protect ourselves against it? I think that a more stable aid framework helps to reduce uncertainty. I also ask you to continue working on opening new markets and I acknowledge your successes, such as the signing of the treaty with Canada. That is a good way to go.

Maybe not quite what its initiators had hoped for. Europe, not even the countries that have exported the most to Russia, has not experienced a crisis, but the incomes of farmers and processors have fallen sharply. This Russian embargo was not news for Lithuania. We have also received various export bans from Russia against him. And it has always been related to a certain political context. Thus, although profitable for producers, the Russian market was never forecast. However, it was this fourteenth global embargo that fundamentally changed the map of the structure of Lithuanian agriculture. Due to the huge losses suffered in individual sectors and the uncertainty about the future, farmers are withdrawing en masse from production and are mostly switching to crop production, mainly cereals. The figures are telling: in the dairy sector alone, dairy farmers have fallen by 34% since the embargo changed. Most of them switched to cereals. This is wrong, it is not only less profitable for the farm itself, but also detrimental to the economy because grain is exported en masse. And the export of raw materials never creates such added value as, for example, the production or processing of milk. Such changes are undoubtedly unfavorable for the climate as well, as imbalances arise between the crop and livestock sectors. Speaking specifically about fruits and vegetables, Lithuanian farmers, who lost their largest export market due to the embargo, gradually reoriented, when some people started processing and we could start to be glad that we learned to survive without the Russian market. If not Lithuania was devastated by floods this year! I took the initiative to collect video material from Lithuanian farmers and show you the lakes that have been turned into Lithuanian fields due to the unprecedented rainfall in summer and autumn.

That is why I think it is good and right that our committee chairman put the question to the Commission, because unfortunately we have to assume a long-term process.

So the European farmers have come into the clamps of the superpowers who, if you will, are making big politics at the expense of third parties, namely medium-sized companies, our farmers. So, please, Commissioner, do not let up in your Commission to ensure that we, as the European Union, normally finally rebuild the bridge between America and Russia that we should be. And, if you will, there is also a lack of common European foreign policy.

Meanwhile, the Russian market is occupied by new producers, mostly domestic, but also producers from third countries. The Russian government used the imposed embargo as a measure to protect its farmers who supported cheap loan programs for novice farmers. The number of such new loans in 2016 alone rose to over 9,200, which led to an increase in agricultural production in Russia. Our fruit and vegetable producers, as well as milk producers, urgently need the help of the European Union and the measures we have now are good, but they are not enough. Therefore, I am in favor of establishing a crisis fund outside the budget for agriculture to help farmers in such situations of market instability, but also because of climate change that is taking an increasing toll. Due to the mentioned circumstances, Croatian producers of mandarins, apples, but also milk, have suffered significant losses in recent years, while their Russian partners have found new suppliers. After the introduction of the Russian embargo, the prices of fruits and vegetables in Croatia have dropped significantly, and producers who have invested in production for the Russian market are in big trouble because they have to repay loans and have no one to sell their products to. European farmers need to be supported in order to find new markets for their products and survive until they eventually return to the Russian market, and for that they need financial support from the European Union.

The fruit and vegetable sector has suffered the most from the embargo on Russia. Its extension is likely to continue to cause major imbalances, including in Member States that have not had direct trade relations with Russia. In these states, as well as Romania, the markets were invaded by vegetables and fruits from states that traditionally exported to Russia causing a significant drop in prices, which brought local farmers to the brink of bankruptcy. I therefore believe that the Commission needs a concrete action plan that takes into account all the Member States of the European Union, and not just those that have had direct exports to Russia. Finding new markets remains a challenge for the European Commission. We appreciate the trade agreements that have been reached in this regard, but, Commissioner, please note one thing from the European Parliament: we cannot agree with other quality standards for agricultural products that are imported into the European Union from third countries. Whether we are talking about the livestock or plant sector, consumers in the European Union must guarantee that the products consumed have the same quality standards regardless of where they come from. I would also like to draw attention to the problems that farmers in the Member States face today in their dealings with retailers. Despite the existence of firm contracts between the parties, with payment up to seven days after the sale, these conditions are still violated by supermarkets, and the cancellation of the order from one day to another is now a common practice, which creates major difficulties for farmers. .

The European intervention aid was welcome, but often insufficient to cover the costs of high-quality production, such as the Conference pear. Producing a Porsche simply costs more than - with all due respect - a Lada. Second, you cannot simply replace a market of 130 million consumers. Pigs grow, dairy cows continue to produce milk and you can't just stop the growth of lettuce, potatoes or apples. The result: oversupply in the markets and plummeting prices. For pears, for example, this amounts to 25 percent. Whether it concerns Ukraine, Russia or Brexit, the farmer is always presented with the bill. Fortunately, our farmers are creative. Some have invested in other varieties. They have responded to a growing middle class in Asia and South America and the increasing demand for fruit and vegetables there. With result. This year for the first time more than 10 million kilos of Belgian apples ended up on the Indian market. However, it is of the utmost importance that we also learn from our mistakes. If 40 percent of your exports go to one country, such as Russia, then you know you are taking a risk. However, not all sectors learn equally quickly. The share of pork that went to Russia goes to China today. In this way we once again give one country the power to plunge our pig sector into crisis again with the snap of a finger. My suggestions to you, Commissioner Hogan, are therefore clear. Please continue your structural policy, because yes, Mrs Vautmans, structural policy is indeed being pursued. Continue to support exports, but keep in mind the needs per sector. Evaluate trade per sector and then open new markets per sector.

However, it happened similarly to what happens in chess, they were the first victims on the chessboard and the consequences are still being felt today. Measures were taken, some were also taken. In the dairy sector, the situation is much better today than it was then. The biggest problems are dealt with by those sectors, especially in fruit growing, where these are permanent crops that you do not plant every year, but grow for 20 years and you simply cannot cut a 10-year-old apple or pear. However, market prices were quite low because of this case. We are aware that this three-year period is a period that cannot be extinguished only with current and extinguishing measures, but it is necessary to continue with some structural measures. I therefore welcome what my colleagues have already said is that part of the solution lies in restructuring the markets, and we have been somewhat successful in this. However, I think we still have a lot to do within the EU, especially as we have said today in fair trade practices, because in crisis situations the shortest end is always pulled by farmers, those who are second in the chain know how to cut their piece of bread, but they leave to the farmers what is left in the end. The measure of accelerating consumption, ie the consumption of fruit and vegetables, is also very important, so measures such as milk and fruit in the school diet are one of the appropriate measures.

My country, Latvia, is one of the countries hardest hit by the Russian embargo. However, the negative effects of this ban on the economy have largely been overcome. Latvian farmers have been able to find new markets not only for the export of fruits and vegetables, but also for other food products. Latvian farmers have conquered reliable markets. The main vegetable export market is the Baltic States - we sell almost two thirds of all vegetables and four fifths of fruits and berries. Vegetable export volumes to Germany, Norway and Poland have increased. Latvia's economic performance is favorable. The rapid economic growth in recent years also indicates our country's excellent ability to adapt to the consequences of the Russian embargo. Rain and floods are a big problem, and here we expect European solidarity. Russia has not complied with the terms of the Minsk agreement. It has repeatedly proved that it is not a reliable partner. Sanctions must therefore remain in force. For our part, we must look for new opportunities for food exports by continuing to support our local farmers, rather than creaking and complaining as if the Russian market is the only place where we can export our products. Here, too, the Commission has a job to do in helping to find new export markets. I believe that Europe must continue to provide humanitarian and development aid and, within that framework, we must export food to countries where hunger is a daily problem for people. During an election observation mission to the Gambia, I saw that, due to the peculiarities of the climate, fruit had hardly been available there for several months. Climate change is causing hunger on a significant part of the African continent. And we need to be far-sighted, given that the greatest population growth in the future will be in Africa.

The producers in my region, the Azores, are also affected by these indirect effects of the embargo and these too have to be compensated.

In relation to the Russian embargo, you can hear from the members of the Committee on Foreign Affairs here this evening – for which we are grateful that they attended, including the Chair, Mr McAllister, and the rapporteur, Mr Preda – that there is a difficulty in relation to lifting the embargo and the Russian sanctions are going to remain in place. This is going to have a knock-on effect of retaliatory measures on the Russian part in respect of farming and agricultural products. I do not see any political sign that this policy on Russia that we have in the European Union at the moment is going to change politically. If it changes, it changes everything, but we have to be realistic that politically it is not likely to change in the short term. Mr Valcárcel Siso was not reflecting on what I said in my contribution when I outlined all of the measures that are being taken within the budgetary framework available. EUR 490 million has been allocated in the last three years. I have extended the measures until the end of June 2018 and we will review the situation again then. We have increased the rate of aid for the withdrawal of products from the marketplace since last July under the Delegated Acts. These are the issues that we have been improving.  On Ms Petir’s notion that we need to have a crisis fund outside of the budgetary position, we have had a crisis fund of EUR 1.5 billion mobilised for all sectors outside of the existing CAP budget. I am sure you noticed this in relation to all of your sectors in terms of your farmers. This was a significant amount of additional money that Ms Georgieva – the Vice-President of the Commission at the time – and I were able to mobilise for the farming community, and Member States were able to do more on top of that. I take note of the fact that we have not sufficiently replaced the markets that were available in Russia from the fruit and vegetable sector. We have not been able to achieve the type of market options around the world to replace that particular market for fruit and vegetables. Therefore, there are no initiatives on promotion to target the food and vegetable sector which I am prepared to look at. I do not want to give anybody the impression that I have not been doing anything in relation to the marketplace. I have been to China twice on trade missions, Japan twice, Canada, Mexico, Colombia, Saudi Arabia and Iran last week, Vietnam and Indonesia, and I have been promoting all European products, including fruit and vegetable products, on trade missions and to companies throughout that time. I am probably the first Commissioner to get outside the office and into the marketplace to try and replace some of the markets that were lost at the time of the Russian embargo, and I am very happy to be able to do so. In relation specifically to structural solutions, I certainly hear what Ms Vautmans has said in relation to the Belgian situation – that structural solutions are required. But in addition to the measures that I have already outlined and that we are implementing, I will certainly be prepared to consider what the Belgian Government is prepared to do in terms of state aids, in terms of modifying the rural development programme, for example, if it wants to look at structural solutions. In response to other Members here that have mentioned that, certainly if there are structural proposals that we can look at, we will look at them in the context of modification of our rural development programmes. That is an option that is open to them. It is an option to look at state aid provisions within the ceilings of EUR 15 000 per farmer as well. We are allocating and promoting fruit and vegetables in various ways, not just through our promotion programmes, but through our school schemes as well. An extra EUR 50 million in addition to the original CAP budget was mobilised last year, arising from the decision that was made here to promote our school schemes, which include fruit and vegetables. I had the pleasure of visiting PC Fruit with Ivo Belet MEP and Tom Vandenkendelaere MEP. I was looking at the excellent work that PC Fruit is doing there, looking at options and varieties and new consumer tastes and patterns in order to find new markets. Some of the markets that we have had in the past, the products perhaps may not be suitable anymore in relation to these particular consumer markets, and we have to look at options and consider helping in the research area with companies like PC Fruit in order to develop alternatives in terms of consumer tastes and to promote those types of new products. I agree that we have not solved the problem in relation to fruit and vegetables arising from the Russian embargo. I respect the sentiments that have been expressed in relation to that here tonight, but I am also being open about the fact that solutions are not going to be easy, particularly the ones that involve removing the sanctions, which had the consequence of stopping the export of our products to the Russian market. But I do not accept, Mr Marias, that I did nothing. You know I did a lot for your country as well over a period of time. Maybe I will give you the full details in relation to what I did for Greek agriculture in the last three years, including in the fruit and vegetable area, and you might be surprised.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 437, "date": "2017-11-15.json", "name": "Mairead McGUINNESS", "mepid": "28115", "text": "  The debate is closed.
