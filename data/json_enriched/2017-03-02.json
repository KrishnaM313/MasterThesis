This is the first time that we have made an implementation report of a multiannual program as Parliament. \"Creative Europe\" is the only direct program of the European Union for the creative, cultural and audiovisual sector, which today involves 39 countries, with a budget of one and a half billion for the period 2014-2020. A budget that has registered, in these seven years, an increase of 9%, but represents just 0.15% of the European budget. Yet there is some evidence. The European crisis reveals the need for a strong investment in culture and intercultural dialogue and culture-related research. Activities related to cultural heritage are a growing resource for new employment, innovation, skills, social inclusion and cultural tourism. Furthermore, the audiovisual cultural and creative sector now accounts for over 5% of European GDP, which becomes 12% if we include fashion and advertising. The large quantity and quality of the projects presented at \"Creative Europe\" demonstrates a great vitality of the sector, which however is mainly made up of non-profit entities, small and medium-sized enterprises, cultural institutions and associations, which must be supported and accompanied in the digital challenge in training new skills and fostering cooperation, the mobility of professional artists and cultural products, supporting co-productions, European networks of professionals, strengthening the industrial capacity of the European audiovisual sector and its access to the market, including foreign internationalization of careers. These are the most strategic objectives of \"Creative Europe\": having brought together the previous \"Culture\" and \"Media\" programs under a single program, while keeping them separate, with the addition of a transversal sector has proved useful to give strength and greater visibility to the program and to coordinate governance, but it has not yet produced the results of integration between the different sectors and projects that we expected. Unfortunately, \"Creative Europe\" suffers from its own success: the ratio of applications submitted and accepted is extremely limited, with a success rate of only 16% for projects in the \"Culture\" sub-program, and 32% for the \"Culture\" sub-program. Average\". With this implementation report we strongly ask the European Commission and the Member States for a robust integration of funds, in line with the ambitions of the program, but we ask that culture finally becomes the eleventh priority at least in the Commission's program; the word does not appear. The text we are about to vote on asks for: improvements to the management of the program, improvements in the evaluation and evaluation criteria of projects, to make it more accessible, simple, transparent, capable of supporting each sector and therefore being more balanced between sectors, subjects large and small and also naturally the balance between small and large Member States (the participants), giving space to the European ambition to count on the world cultural scene and at the same time to support the creativity of young people, organizations and institutions historical in which we recognize our roots, as well as we appreciated the calls finally addressed also to social inclusion and also to immigrants and refugees. It will be necessary to reorient the program on the quality and artistic value of cultural proposals - and not just economic, as it sometimes seems to prevail - by supporting integration with other programs and opening up to partnerships with non-European countries, especially those bordering the area. Mediterranean and in view of the new strategy for cultural diplomacy and for the European Year of Cultural Heritage, strongly supported by Parliament for 2018. We ask that the current automatisms to safeguard the diversity of European audiovisual production, but enhancing the real production capacity and circulation of audiovisual products as well as greater support for European positions and co-productions in the field, including television, with independent producers, and more access by cinemas film and online distribution. More needs to be done to strengthen the synergies between the \"Creative Europe\" program and the different multiannual programs, in particular Erasmus + and Horizon 2020. The link between research, innovation and culture is absolutely - and I am happy that Commissioner Moedas is here, because I know it is very sensitive to this issue - but also to innovation in small and medium-sized cultural enterprises. I go to the conclusion. Finally, we are waiting to know the results of the new financial guarantee instrument that we strongly wanted, dedicated to this sector, since the first two European financial institutions have just been selected, and we hope that others can also be selected for cover the European territory in a balanced way, but we ask that the proposal to integrate them with the EFSI be followed up, also using them as front-loading to strengthen the economic and entrepreneurial dimension of the sector.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 2, "date": "2017-03-02.json", "name": "Silvia COSTA", "mepid": "96917", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, next year we will be celebrating, as you know, the European Year of Cultural Heritage. This is a perfect opportunity to bring Europe’s cultural richness into the spotlight and to recall the shared values that connect us and make us stronger. So let me thank this House for its strong commitment to the Year of Cultural Heritage.  The European Year will also be an opportunity to take stock of what the Creative Europe programme is doing for the heritage sector in terms of cross-border cooperation, capacity building and awareness—raising, and more generally the European Year can showcase the positive impact of the programme on Europe’s cultural and creative operators.  Your report comes at a very good moment, at a crucial moment – halfway through the programme’s lifespan when we need to reflect on what we have achieved so far and start work to prepare the future. It is in our common interest to keep a critical eye on how the programme is implemented. I would like to thank Ms Sylvia Costa, as rapporteur, and the shadow rapporteurs for their positive and constructive recommendations. They will all be carefully taken into account in the ongoing mid-term evaluation of the programme.  Let me just make a couple of comments. First, the policy objectives of Creative Europe are to safeguard diversity – and here, as Commissioner for Research, I feel that this is the biggest asset we have in terms of innovation and science and technology, this diversity that your programme safeguards – and make the European cultural and creative sectors more competitive. While these aims remain valid, we are faced with new political and societal challenges such as migration and the rising of populism. Promoting cultural diversity goes hand in hand with opening up cultural participation to more citizens and showcasing our common values with and beyond Europe’s societies.  I am very happy that Creative Europe has proven to be flexible enough to respond to these new challenges. To give you an example, in 2016, following the refugee crisis, we issued a specific call to support cultural projects working to help integrate refugees. At the same time, the number of countries in the EU neighbourhood participating in a programme is growing; negotiations with Israel and Tunisia are underway. This shows the potential of cultural cooperation as a public diplomacy tool in line with the recently adopted strategy of international cultural relations.  Your report calls for strengthening the cross-cultural and the cross-sectoral strength. I could not agree more. Key challenges such as globalisation, the digital transformation, skills development and access to financing are common to all cultural and creative players without undermining the specificities of each sector. We need to find ways to address these challenges in the framework of an integrated programme and reinforce the cross-sectional dimension further. Why? Because today, most innovations are at these cross-sections. We have discovered everything we could at the core of the disciplines. The new things are really at this border and that is one of the fantastic things about your programme.  We are already working on these and let me give you some examples. First, through dialogue with the stakeholders involved. We have been trying to keep abreast of the changing needs of the audiovisual and cultural sectors. Second, our cross-sectoral projects, such as creative hubs, are testing how best to promote innovation and ensure a structuring effect to support industry adaptations to an evolving ecosystem.  Finally, the Guarantee Facility – and you talk about it in your report – that Guarantee Facility is now in operation. It has been very well received with three agreements already signed with financial institutions in France, Spain and Romania, and there are more coming up.  Let me now come to the question of funding. I am fully aware that many high-quality projects cannot be funded due to the programme’s small budget and Ms Costa just mentioned to me before we came in how small the budget is. I am equally aware of the frustration that this creates amongst applicants and potential applicants. As you rightly point out, this is especially relevant for cooperation projects under the cultural sub-programme.  We are trying to address this issue within our room for manoeuver. First, the annual budgets are scheduled to increase until 2020. Secondly, we are thinking about creating a dedicated envelope for smaller cooperation projects – and you talked about it – that would allow us to reach out to new cultural organisations with little experience of working at European level and to involve more grass-roots organisations. Finally, we will continue to make the programme more easily accessible to smaller cultural operators and we are doing so by simplifying our application procedures. Simplifying is essential and is speeding up selection of the decisions by cutting the red tape where possible.  There is only so much we can do, as Ms Costa told me before we came in, with 0.15%, 0.14% of the multiannual financial framework (MFF) currently dedicated to Creative Europe. I am convinced that we can and should do better than that.  Let us be more ambitious for the future. I know I can count on your continued support in this respect, so let us make sure that Creative Europe can truly support and reinforce one of Europe’s greatest assets: its culture.

When we look at the possibilities that the digital world of the 21st century will provide for skilled employment, the cultural sector is often rightly cited as the source of jobs long into the future. The new financial instrument aimed at SMEs only deepens the importance of this programme in supporting the growth of this sector.  Beyond the imperatives of growth, there is the separate work of bringing people together. In particular, this programme has now taken on the responsibility of supporting social inclusion for refugees.

I would like to start by thanking Mrs Costa for her very good report on the implementation of the Creative Europe program and for her exemplary cooperation in the negotiations. We evaluate the first stage of the program implementation as positive. Creative Europe is a relatively small program with broad scope and high ambitions. It confirmed its remarkable success, because as many as 15,000 zlotys were received from the entire EU with a request for funding from European funds. projects. It is therefore very important to increase, as has already been said here, the budget for this program, and this is what we are calling on the Commission and the Member States to do. I also believe that the MEDIA sub-program must focus more on the digitization of film heritage, on partnerships between film schools and on support for professional networks, involving all players in the sector, including authors and writers. Rules for participation in the program should be clearer and more transparent to increase the participation of projects in the Creative Europe program. I believe that it is also important to open a dialogue with the music sector and to give a specific weight to this sector in the Creative Europe program. I also welcome the launch in the second semester of 2016 of the financial instrument and bank guarantees for the creative sector.

It aims to safeguard and promote cultural and linguistic diversity and cultivate and support the competitiveness of the cultural and creative sectors. A relatively small program, divided, as already mentioned, into two sub-programs \"Culture\" and \"Media\", but absolutely strategic, in particular since, I believe also thanks to the stubborn tenacity of the culture committee of the European Parliament, in 2016 it was equipped with a new cross-sectoral financial instrument. An important guarantee instrument, albeit with an objectively contained budget, equal to 121 million euros, and a multiplication factor estimated at 5.7 which, as the Commissioner recalled, has already led to some concrete results. In the first months of this year, agreements were signed to support small and medium-sized industries in the sector in Spain, France and Romania. Unfortunately, the relationship between applications presented and accepted remains the fundamental problem, because it is too limited. The solution passes from a necessary administrative simplification already agreed, but above all from a more adequate increase in the financial endowment, and the reference to EFSI seems obligatory.

People write stories on their blog, they upload songs, they create short videos, and with innovation in robotics and artificial intelligence we will need more and more creative people.  Creativity should not only be supported by the Creative Europe programme, it should be part of every policy, as innovation should be. What is key to creativity, however, is diversity, and Europe has diversity: diversity of languages, of cultures and of history. Therefore, I believe that the Creative Europe programme should also nurture this diversity.  However, when we look at the share of financing that each Member State gets from this programme, most of the funding seems to go to the big five countries with high production capacity and, as I understand it, the same countries want an even larger share of the funding. Therefore I would stress the importance of the Creative Europe programme being open and fair to all creators and all projects, and not just the ones who might, on paper, get the bigger audience and be the most profitable, because this is not what the programme should be about. I also believe that we should stress another point: although Europe is very diverse, consumers’ wishes and behaviour are very similar everywhere. Technology has brought them choice – choice to access content from anywhere, at any time and on any device. No consumer wants to wait for six months or a year to see a movie on TV, and I do not think any creator wishes to limit the amount of people who will see their work. But, by staying stuck in our current models of movie distribution, of financing based on territoriality, and by lacking creativity ourselves in this respect, we are not helping either consumers or creators – maybe only the middlemen in between. The Creative Europe programme should not forget its own name: ‘Creative Europe’. It should support works that will be made widely available and accessible to all European citizens, not only in movie theatres but also online. It should promote innovative financing and distribution models that are not based on territoriality but on EU-wide access, and it should help to create an environment for European online platforms to start up and scale up, because if the idea of our current model is the best one for European creativity, why then do so many movies not even make it into cinemas? This is wrong, as is the idea that only our current model, largely based on territorial exclusivity, is the best one, when online platforms such as Netflix and Amazon have started to finance their own – very diverse and high-quality – content.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 8, "date": "2017-03-02.json", "name": "Martina MICHELS", "mepid": "120478", "text": "on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen!

The first thing I would like to emphasize is that European cultural policy is based on a democratic concept of culture. It is not about a nationalistic concept of culture or an ethnic or even a racist one, but European cultural policy is deeply shaped by being egalitarian. It's about diversity and also about dealing with cultural minorities. Mr Henkel, you are completely on the wrong track if you claim that this is a matter of homogenization or a false restriction, that it is only about European culture. The interesting thing is that it is about the recognition of diversity. It is about promoting this and, of course, enabling artists and citizens to get to know the diversity of European cultures, to benefit from them, to appreciate them, to really know what cultural treasures of diversity there is in the European Union. To say anything else is almost malicious, because the point is to make people understand what opportunities they have with the cultural diversity in the European Union. In particular, I want to recognize that the European creative industry is an essential contribution to this diversity - also to European investment and economic policy. That is why the creative industry must also be an essential part of European economic policy, and this cultural program must above all achieve recognition of the intrinsic value of culture. In the cultural sector in particular, we have many projects that are nonprofit, that do not handle large sums of money, but are able to really radiate into society. Projects that appeal to people on a level that other policies cannot. And this part is so crucial in this European cultural program “Creative Europe”, and that is why it must we strengthen it and not badmouth it or make it small. It is an essential part of a really well-understood European policy that reaches people, in their hearts and in their diversity in everyday life. That is why it is so important to me that the application process is simplified, especially for small projects, because many feel disappointed that they have little opportunity to simply submit these program applications when small sums are involved - a lot can be done there be improved. I would also like to emphasize again - like several colleagues before me - that the cultural budget, as it is now in the European Union, is far too small. With 0.15% of the MFF it does not reflect the real social significance of the diversity of the culture of the European Union. That is why this should urgently be changed when it comes to the next financial perspective. Fortunately, the Commission has started a new project for integration with cultural work for the refugees. We started with a total of 1.6 million. This is better than nothing, but in view of the task that we have here it makes it clear that it is far too small.

The report we are voting on today is a good compromise. In fact, I am convinced that the Creative Europe program, although presenting some critical issues, as a whole must be considered and judged positively. This is especially true with regard to the opportunities it generates for micro, small and medium-sized enterprises and I agree with the request to increase funds for the program. Instead, precisely for this reason, I do not positively judge the transfer of funds, of 3 million euros, which will be carried out for the financing of the European Year of Cultural Heritage in 2018. In fact, I do not believe that this type of operation can be endorsed. and we cannot divert funds from a program that is already largely underfunded. Further points that seem to me worthy of note are, on the one hand, the need to streamline and simplify the bureaucratic procedures for participating in tenders - as many colleagues have already said. In this regard, the request to encourage the use of digital tools is correct. On the other hand, the recognition that the system of performance indicators of the program takes into consideration the creative and artistic aspects, and not just the purely economic ones. We should all consider this recognition to be of crucial importance if we believe in creativity. The creative aspect, to be fully developed and generate quality works, cannot always be subjugated to economic performance. The frantic pursuit of profit at all costs kills creativity.

Dear Colleagues! The “Creative Europe” program with its main sub-areas MEDIA and culture promotes cultural diversity and innovations in cultural and creative projects in Europe and above all cultural exchange between the individual regions. And Mr. Henkel, cultural exchange is what has brought culture in Europe, in every region, forward again and again. Imagine Cologne Cathedral without the development of Gothic in France! I think that perhaps the cultural approach that you have put forward here in a very nationalistic way should be reconsidered. With this program too - just like the next item on the agenda, which we will discuss afterwards - we are confronted with massive underfunding. This also means that the participation of smaller projects in the program areas is insufficient. Here we have to achieve better funding and, above all, to improve and simplify the application process so that small cultural initiatives and projects also have better opportunities to participate in the sub-programs. I also believe it is necessary to ensure greater transparency when a project application is rejected, and for this it is important that a precise and clear justification for the rejection of a project application is given and explained to the applicants. Because that helps reduce the great potential for frustration in the event of a rejection. Furthermore, the cultural and creative industries must be better integrated into other EU funding programs such as B. Horizon 2020, COSME, the European Structural Funds and the EFSI. The first steps to use synergies here have already been taken, but are far from being sufficient, as these funds are not and are not geared towards the specific needs and various structures in the cultural and creative sector adequately address the needs.With the cross-sector action area, in addition to the sub-programs MEDIA and culture, a further funding pillar was created that can be an opportunity for SMEs and micro-enterprises in particular, if the full potential of this action area is actually used and expanded.The cultural and creative sector contributes 4.4% of the EU's GDP and creates jobs for 3.8% of the workforce in the EU.With appropriate funding, the full potential of this industry as a source of growth and employment and as a driving force for cultural diversity and cross-border cooperation could be exploited in the long term.We should all work towards this together!(The speaker agreed to answer a question about the blue card procedure under Rule 162 (8) of the Rules of Procedure.)", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 14, "date": "2017-03-02.json", "name": "Hans-Olaf HENKEL", "mepid": "124823", "text": "Ask about the “blue card” procedure.- Ms. Verheyen, every Sunday morning I host a jazz program on Radio Jazz Berlin from eleven to twelve - you can listen to that.Jazz also emerged from cultural exchanges between different countries, but there was no Brussels there to make this happen.Do you really think that we need Brussels in order to have cultural exchange?Would you give the same speech in Germany, where we don't even have a minister of culture and also no cultural budget at the federal level?", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "ECR", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 15, "date": "2017-03-02.json", "name": "Sabine VERHEYEN", "mepid": "96756", "text": "Answer to a question about the “blue card” procedure. - Perhaps you should first find out a little more clearly.

Within the European Union, this is the only direct program that can benefit the arts, culture and audiovisual sectors. As the rapporteur, Sylvia Costa, rightly pointed out, the program suffers from its own success. The bureaucratic obstacles to applying, together with the low percentage of approved projects due to the lack of financial resources, demotivate cultural figures to apply for funding under the program. If we have to be more specific, the approved projects in the field of Media are equal to 32% of those submitted, and in the field of Culture they are only about 15%. In addition, many proposals are excluded due to the high funding threshold, which is prohibitive for small-scale cultural associations. Europe is known all over the world for its cultural heritage, and the funds set aside for culture amount to only 0.14% of the European Union budget, which is ridiculous to say the least. Speaking of culture and how important it is for the spiritual health and mutual understanding of European citizens, I would like to pay special attention to the mechanism for financing literary translations. Although one of the priorities of the Culture sub-program is the promotion of literary exchange on the territory of the Union, Bulgarian writers dare to say that they are openly discriminated against. In Bulgarian bookstores you can find translations by French or English authors, but at the same time, for example in Belgium, you cannot find a book translated by a Bulgarian author. It is normal for larger and richer countries to have the opportunity to generously support the translation of their writers into other European languages, but this is not the case with us.

Truro, a city in my own region in the South-West has announced a bid to be the City of Culture in 2023. I understand that the UK Government has been positive about cities making their bids and I understand also that, at this moment, the Commission is sticking to its announcement that there will be two capitals in 2023, one from Hungary and one from the UK. That may change – who knows? – and it may well all become a sidebar in the big negotiation, but the advice for now is to carry on bidding. The UK is still a full and active member of the EU. Having visited other European capitals of culture, most recently San Sebastián in Spain, I have seen at first hand the benefits such a successful bid can bring.

Only thanks to them do we have a heritage here that we can look at and listen to hundreds of years after their deaths. Of course, the promotion of culture is primarily the task of nation states. But the role of the European Union is to make better use of the common European space for artists and citizens alike. It is a great motivation and mutual inspiration that we must not waste.

Culture knows no barriers, it breaks down walls, supports the dialogue between differences, enhances them by intertwining positive feelings, becomes an opportunity to promote economy and quality work. So not just more resources, but a new connection between programs and tools, but also simplification, greater accessibility and a decisive change from overly rigid and formal evaluation criteria, which end up penalizing the most innovative and quality ideas. Innovative ideas which, proposed by an extraordinary network of associations of small and very small enterprises, are very often penalized in the face of the proposals of the obviously better organized and structured industrial system. Culture is an extraordinary opportunity for emancipation, if it orients its languages ​​within a new framework of solidarity, of cohesion between peoples, through the revaluation of the most ancient humanistic traditions of this continent.

Culture occupies a very prominent place in Europe and can play a relevant role in the process of European construction, helping citizens to get closer to this process. Now, when there is a certain lack of interest or even distrust of the European process on the part of citizens, we need to do everything possible so that citizens know it better and feel it as their own and as useful. Today's European Union rests on very solid historical and cultural foundations, shared by the European peoples. The European Union is not an artificial construction, nor does it respond only to a movement that emerged after the Second World War, but has very deep roots, and this must be known to European citizens. In this sense, I think it necessary to highlight the importance of the European cultural routes program, launched by the Council of Europe 30 years ago with the proclamation of the Caminos de Santiago as the first European cultural route. Commissioner, we must cooperate closely with this Council of Europe program and help these routes, which seem to me to be a model of cultural cross-border cooperation. These routes have tourist relevance and thus contribute to the development of areas often far from the crowded sun and beach circuit. These routes also serve to preserve the European historical and cultural heritage, so rich and diverse, and to which the very declaration - important declaration - of Bratislava of a few months ago refers. These routes are also very useful to teach Europeans and young people the important historical, cultural, artistic, I would say even spiritual, links that unite us Europeans, thus highlighting the depth and solidity of the foundations of the construction of the city.

The Creative Europe program financially supports artists and cultural professionals, as well as book translations, the film industry, creates favorable conditions for the mobility of artists and works of art, and raises cultural awareness.

I would like to highlight two aspects of this, let me allow it. In the minority working group I co-chaired, we have already dealt with projects under this program on several occasions, as well as with the European Capitals of Culture. The experience is that these projects can play an important role in the life of traditional national and linguistic minority communities, in preserving their identity and promoting the coexistence of the majority minority. We must continue to support these projects in this regard. The other element that I would highlight, emphasizing the importance of European cultural and creative networks, is the issue of nurturing European talent. Building on the Hungarian example, there is now a very strong European talent support network in the EU. It helps you discover talents as well as develop and nurture them.

First, it should outline the intersectoral chapter: the Commission must verify its usefulness and operation, since the sectors complain of lack of access to credit. The audiovisual sectors operate in very competitive environments and we must give our creators the necessary tools to continue producing quality pieces. Furthermore, the Commission should coordinate and strengthen the Creative Europe offices in participating countries to facilitate access for creators, create synergies and thus improve the use of resources. And thirdly, and despite the 9% increase, the budget allocated to this program must be increased to allow the further development of a plural and diverse culture within the European Union and neighboring countries. Furthermore, the countries of the southern neighborhood, which are not part of the program, should be urged to join this space of cultural diversity and opportunities.

I can tell you, as somebody who worked in the arts before politics, that the Creative Europe programme, including in its previous incarnation, has been and still is of great interest to British artists and arts organisations, and that the tragedy of Brexit was not the choice of the people of Liverpool nor the wish of the wider arts and media community or their audiences across the whole of the UK, who voted overwhelmingly to stay in the EU and work together with their neighbours.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 33, "date": "2017-03-02.json", "name": "Nicola CAPUTO", "mepid": "124851", "text": "- (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all congratulations to Mr Costa on his excellent report.

Of course, a clear message must be sent to Turkey as well.

I think everyone talked about diversity. Everyone used that word as something that we should really cherish and I think that, more than ever, we need in Europe a creative and cultural programme.  As Commissioner for Innovation and as someone who lived abroad for a long time, firstly I believe deeply that we have a European culture and those of you who, like me, have lived abroad felt that every day when you lived outside of Europe. You feel that you have a culture that is different to others because it is a culture of diversity, because you think differently, you feel differently, because you are more intolerant of inequality, because you feel yourself, when you are abroad, that you are closer to your European friends.  I lived for years outside of Europe and most of my friends were always Europeans because we speak that language of diversity, of understanding others. I think that it is very important to realise that, even with that diversity of languages, we are so close, much closer than you might think, and especially when you live abroad, as I have lived.  The second point that came from the discussion that is essential is that innovation comes from these intersections – these intersections of disciplines, these intersections of science and art and music – and so many of you here referred to that. In 2015 I was at the Nobel Prize Award Ceremony and the person who won the Nobel Prize for Medicine was a woman called Tu Youyou. This woman is not a medical doctor; it is a very interesting fact that most of the Nobel Prizewinners are not specialists in their own field. They come from other fields. They come from those intersections.  Tu Youyou saved millions of people because she discovered a cure for malaria. She discovered that cure for malaria because she was reading a poem in a book that was more than 1 700 years old. By reading that poem she found a plant called Artemisia and then she found through that poetry how she could extract that plant, Artemisia, in a way that would save people. She found this cure that has saved millions of people and I think that that is the future – the future is this cross between culture and science and art. If we want to be at the edge, if we want to be at the best that technology does, that science does, we have to be at these borders of culture and arts and science.  Thank you so much for the very interesting debate. It was a great place to be this morning, listening to all of you, believers in Europe and believers in this programme, as I am.

I fully agree with this emphasis that you have made: innovation is now increasingly placed in the ability to integrate between the various sectors, between the various languages ​​and also between the different disciplines. I think this is the challenge for the second part of the seven years for \"Creative Europe\" which on this front must do much more, but I believe it is an internal problem, but also an external one. If we talked about it before, we absolutely must achieve - as we have requested - greater transversal attention, also of the different DGs and of the different competences so that, with Erasmus +, with Horizon 2020, with the structural funds, more integrations are initiated and we naturally ask for a serious and important of the budget. You have heard that all colleagues were talking about the frustration of so many cultural workers who will eventually tire of proposing - this is terrible, at a time like this, of the crisis we are experiencing in Europe, which is a cultural crisis; it would be strange if culture was finally not put at the top of the Juncker program. The second evaluation - I cannot answer all of them, but I collect some of the most important and common questions - there has been a dilemma between diversity and unity and has accompanied Europe since its birth, it is clear that cultural policy is not a community policy but cultural policy is based on the treaty in two respects: enhancing and supporting cultural and linguistic diversity and, on the other, enhancing and protecting the common European cultural heritage. Therefore, diversity in unity is the figure of Europe and even when we talk about European cultural diplomacy, on which we are committed, we speak always also to make known how it was possible to live in a dimension of peace in this continent, precisely because diversity and dialogue have led to the possibility of peaceful coexistence, innovation and inclusion. This is the challenge of culture under all skies. So there is no contradiction. Then I would like to say that the roots of Europe are in music, philosophy, thinkers, spirituality, creativity, theater, literature and all the greatest have been in all countries those who have not closed themselves in small homelands. , but who have dialogued with the world, who have tried to understand, everything has intertwined in the history of European culture, it would be truly shortsighted not to recognize this. We therefore want with this program, we demand what? In the meantime, greater attention is paid to this integration of sectors; second: to have a greater attention to the evaluation criteria - everyone came and I agree - that of having criteria that evaluate more the artistic merit and also the intrinsic cultural merit of the projects. I think it is right now to claim that these new loans that are given through loans, as a financial instrument, should not be reserved for those accredited financial situations, only for the countries where they reside but are made to support European projects - it must be very clear this - otherwise it would be an imbalance. And last thing - time is a tyrant - cultural networks, it is very true, we want to support more the European cultural networks that are those that cross Europe, the cultural itineraries and the European capitals of culture that have celebrated their 30th anniversary their establishment. We asked to evaluate them as extraordinary results, because in many cities, which were also in industrial crises - as we said before, Liverpool has been relaunched thanks to being the capital of culture and this has led to a rethinking of the city, more focused on culture.I close on the Brexit issue, I just say a word, I cannot fail to mention it: I believe that - of course, the English colleague said - England has had more than it has given in culture also because it has a lot of cultural wealth.However, I must say that the preconditions for continuing to participate in \"Creative Europe\" are clear, they are to accept at least the four fundamental freedoms of movement of people, of capital, and so on.So, this is going to be the battle for the British citizens, not us.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 38, "date": "2017-03-02.json", "name": "David Maria SASSOLI", "mepid": "96864", "text": "Thank you, Mr Costa, congratulations on your work and congratulations also on the work of the rapporteurs of all the parliamentary groups.The discussion is closed.The vote will take place on Thursday 2 March 2017.

I would urge you to look not only at the strict formal requirements when assessing applications, but also at the content of the projects submitted. It is important to ensure clearly regulated, transparent project delivery and funding. There is a need to increase funding for this cultural program, as interest and expectations from developers far exceed the program budget. The development of application and project implementation skills of cultural operators should also be borne in mind. Culture is a sensitive part of the lives of the people of the European Union. It is important both for the cultural expression and individuality of national identity and for openness to other cultures and their diversity. European identity is not just a synthesis of national cultures, the ultimate goal of which is the common denominator of European identity.

The Europe for Citizens program is the only one of the European Commission that aims to encourage the direct participation of citizens in the Union and promote dialogue between institutions, civil society organizations and local administrations. For this reason, we have asked the Culture Commission for an increase in the budget of the program so that the objectives set can be achieved. First of all, it should be remembered that the budget agreed for this program for the 2014-2020 period was significantly reduced, 14% compared to the previous period. In Parliament and in the Committee on Culture and Education we have been requesting an increase in the budget, with the figure of 500 million euros to be able to adequately satisfy the project proposals that reach the evaluation agencies. Furthermore, if we compare it with the budget of the Erasmus and Creative Europe programs, which we have discussed now, it is clear that it is necessary to provide this program with a greater financial effort. Secondly, we have asked the Commission to develop a more innovative communication strategy. It is essential that this program can become better known in Europe. Unlike others, Europe for Citizens is not as popular and participation is very low among non-governmental organizations, foundations dealing with matters related to European citizenship, city councils and networks of regions and cities that are their recipients. We need to have a more efficient and accessible platform, which allows knowledge depth of available funds and a strengthening of relations with the contact points of the Member States. We hope that all organizations and local administrations know in detail the possibilities offered by this program and that participating countries that have not yet done so designate a national point of contact. Thirdly, we believe that the European memory area of ​​the Europe for Citizens program should take into account not only Europe's past and memory, but also its future. We intend to convey a historical account that is not obsessed with differences, but rather tries to overcome them in a spirit of integration. We believe that this project will contribute to forming a more optimistic and integrated vision of Europe, with a view to forging a common future. Last but not least, the report unambiguously states that the next generation of the program should be adopted under the ordinary legislative procedure, putting Parliament on an equal footing with the Council. I wish to underline that, as the only Union institution directly elected by the citizens, the European Parliament must play its role as the Union's co-legislator when it comes to adopting a program specifically created with the aim of encouraging citizen participation. Therefore, in my report, I urge the Commission to find a suitable legal basis for the next generation of the program, allowing the European Parliament to truly participate in the process of adopting and implementing this program. For this reason, dear colleagues, I ask you to support the report, as approved by the committee.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 46, "date": "2017-03-02.json", "name": "María Teresa GIMÉNEZ BARBAT", "mepid": "135491", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr. President, my colleague Commissioner Avramopoulos sends his regrets but has asked me to say a few words on his behalf. Honourable Members, the Europe for Citizens programme offers a unique platform to reach out to citizens and to engage them in a debate about the future of Europe. In the year of its tenth anniversary as a fully-fledged programme with its own identity, the Europe for Citizens programme is well established. Stakeholders and beneficiaries appreciate it as one of the most relevant means to involve citizens in shaping their – that is, our – European Union. Projects funded by the programme will now also offer placements for the European Solidarity Corps. This will allow young Europeans to put their civic engagement into practice fully in line with the objectives of the programme.  This is why I am glad that the European Parliament has prepared this implementation report on the programme, which looks back at the first three years. I would like to thank Parliament, and in particular the rapporteur Ms Giménez Barbat, for the commitment and the effort that you have put into preparing this report, which not only gives an overview of the programme’s implementation, but will also be an important starting point for the mid-term evaluation that we are currently preparing. It will provide some first orientations for a new citizenship programme beyond 2020.  Let me stress the elements of your report, which we shall have the chance to reflect on jointly in the near future. First, as you mentioned, the budget. Under the current Multiannual Financial Framework this has been a major challenge for the Europe for Citizens programme. Participation in the programme has become very competitive and success rates have decreased to very low levels in some measures, and we need to look at that. Second, the streamlined structure of the current programme, with the two strands focusing on European remembrance and on democratic engagement and civic participation, works well. It is positive, allowing for a more focused approach and increasing the programme’s impact. Last, but by no means least, the issue of the legal base which you raise that could enable the European Parliament to get involved in the adoption of a new programme as co-legislator. In view of the mid-term evaluation, let me assure you that the Commission seeks the strongest possible cooperation with this House on both the political direction and the implementation of the Europe for Citizens programme over the four remaining years and of course looking ahead beyond 2020.  In conclusion, can I just acknowledge the European Parliament’s important role in both preparing and assessing the current Europe for Citizens programme. We are only at the beginning of our cooperation to give new momentum to this programme.

At the same time, however, it is a program whose 185 million budget cannot meet the needs and requirements of society today.

Secondly, the openness of the program itself to citizens, that is, greater participation of states and local authorities in defining priorities, bringing the national contact points closer to make the program more known, removing language barriers in the project submission process. The third issue is opening the program to countries outside the European Union, EFTA countries, EEA countries and candidate countries to the European Union. We believe that the program should be open and build real ties with neighboring countries. We also join this proposal, which assumes a stronger role for the European Parliament, a clear legal basis and the participation of the European Parliament in defining the program priorities.

In the current situation in the Union - as we well debated yesterday - of rampant nationalisms, populisms and euroscepticisms, we cannot sit idly by: we have a responsibility to combat them. The best way to do this is by involving citizens, bringing them closer to the Union. To this end, it is essential to help improve understanding of the Union, its history and its diversity. The evaluation report of the Europe for Citizens program demonstrates the success of these programs in the medium and long term in combating these phenomena. This initiative is still young and little known, but the number of applicants for funds reflects the interest that citizens have in getting involved with the European project: the quality of the projects presented is a good sign of this. Sadly, many of those projects have gone empty-handed. This is due to insufficient funding. In the last financial framework - the rapporteur has said it - funding was reduced by 14%. It is not that the projects were not worth it, but that there were not enough funds for so many projects. We must be more ambitious when it comes to contributing to a better understanding of the European Union, its history and its diversity by citizens. I ask the Commission to increase the budget to a minimum of EUR 500 million, which is necessary to ensure the success of the program.

In an area like this, cooperation with political groups and listening are essential to produce an ambitious report and to give new impetus to the \"Europe for Citizens\" program. This is a fundamental process, as Europe is attacked by nationalism and Euroscepticism and experiences a sharp rise in intolerance, which challenges the sense of belonging to a common space. What are our priorities? They were recalled by my colleagues. In my opinion, there are four of them. First, the question of the budget. I believe that we have to send a very clear message: we want a substantial increase in the means made available to this program, which very directly concerns European citizens. This program is still based on too limited an envelope. It is not normal, in particular, to have such a low rate of acceptance of files. Not changing would mean discrediting this program among the most committed citizens, and that is why we have asked to increase this budget to 500 million euros, or ultimately one euro per citizen. Then on the legal basis. We want to be clear: the European Parliament as an institution representing European citizens cannot be absent from the legislative process, so a legal solution must be found, it is non-negotiable, I believe. The third priority is the need for more active communication. In the digital and social media age, it is important that the program can be more visible on the web and be represented in a non-bureaucratic and above all more educational discourse. This program must also reach new audiences, young people in particular, whose civic engagement is well known, in particular at the time of the European elections. We must therefore go beyond the somewhat rigid or a little too traditional formats of public meetings by developing more dynamic projects, which make it possible to share experiences. Finally, to be accessible, the procedures of this program must be simplified. Efforts must focus on small project leaders and involve more, in the definition of priorities, civil society, which is certainly well placed to reflect the concerns of citizens. This program should support the participation of a wider range of audiences, including vulnerable people, who should receive additional assistance. In addition, we must continue to encourage initiatives recognized for their success, such as town twinning. In the hostile climate that Europe is going through, this program must serve as a point of support to relaunch the European project among citizens committed to a strong Europe and in a reaffirmed spirit of solidarity.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 51, "date": "2017-03-02.json", "name": "Ruža TOMAŠIĆ", "mepid": "119431", "text": "on behalf of the ECR Club. - Mr. President, the European Union is really in a crisis that we will find very difficult to overcome if we do not put this community in a realistic framework in which it will solve only those problems for which it has the capacity and respect the principle of subsidiarity. Such programs do just the opposite - they raise the European Union to the level of an omnipotent creation that re-educates citizens, instills new identities in them and interferes in all spheres of society and life. The report recommends that the European Memory sub-program develop a European identity that should be plural, transcultural and open to migratory flows and influences from the rest of the world. Apart from the fact that I do not see any need to create artificial identities, I must admit that it is not clear to me what kind of identity it would be if it was based only on the political ambitions of European elites and the needs of one political moment. Those citizens who primarily feel European, feel that way because, despite our heterogeneity, there is a lot that unites us, and that is primarily Judeo-Christian values. They are not mentioned here, although Europe as it is today would not exist without them. It is interesting that such a recommendation is to be realized within the sub-program \"European Memory\".

It is enough to remember that, in some of its most important sections, such as historical memory, it only finances 6% of applications, not due to a lack of quality in citizen proposals, but exclusively due to lack of money. I also share, and have tried, that the contact points of each State help to better understand the program to its potential beneficiaries. And I say this because amnesia is playing a very trick on us. The same populist and ultra-nationalist ideas that signed the greatest catastrophes in our history are now presented as false solutions to our great problems. For this reason, we should devote more imagination, interest and resources to remembering what results these recipes reaped, to put before the mirror of our history some regrettable speeches that are in tune with the harangues that justified and fostered our past tragedies, and to underline that the European Union was the effective and useful response to that language of selfishness, lack of solidarity, war, violence and poverty. That is why I am asking for more funds and, therefore, I am happy that, after a series of initiatives led by several Members, all European totalitarian regimes are joining Nazism or Stalinism, the first objective of this program to be able to recover our memory. That is why I am glad that the 80th anniversary of the Spanish Civil War is included among the eligible activities to fund activities in favor of truth, justice and reparation. Because, eighty years after the bombing of Gernika, one of the two states involved in that massacre, a member of the European Union, still does not recognize its responsibility and ask for forgiveness for those events.

This program has two main focuses. The first point is culture of remembrance. As we know from current disputes, this is a point that is extremely important in the European Union in particular, it is about coming to terms with the history of Stalinism, National Socialism and Fascism and thereby really contributing to a democratic society that is One is able to deal with difference and minorities in a positive way and not have to exclude these people. The second point is democratic citizen participation. This, too, is an area that is about the quality of democratic life in the European Union, where citizens have the opportunity to participate in town twinning or if they have special ideas - some examples have already been mentioned - to receive targeted funding in order to implement joint projects in the European Union. The problem is, however, that this budget is so small that it cannot live up to the claim that is being announced. It's even worse: the budget has even been slashed with the last multiannual financial framework now running.

Beyond the good numbers and good results that have taken place over the years, in the part relating to the priority of the program and among the compromise amendments that have been voted on, we read in fact: understanding and debating euroscepticism. Well, at least, there is a need to accept the Eurosceptic phenomenon as a fact of the reality in which we live. An example above all, of course, is what is happening today with Brexit, which calls into question the existence of a European project. However, I strongly doubt that the Eurosceptic phenomenon can be debated in this way. To make myself better understood, I give the example of the political reality of my country. Italians have always been counted among the Euro-enthusiasts, but in recent years they too have progressively distanced themselves and have begun to look at Europe with a disenchantment that is increasingly growing. This happened for various economic, identity, political reasons and for lack of democratic participation. What is at stake today is the very ability of public institutions to respond to the legitimate questions that citizens ask political authorities and institutions themselves.

I would point out that the field of culture, the one that must develop the unity in diversity of the Union's motto, is perhaps the most difficult, if we consider the financing and, implicitly, the importance given to it. The report on the implementation of the Europe for Citizens program is relevant and in line with reality. Perhaps the only observation is that the report is too uncritical. The problems mentioned are acute: regionalization of projects, isolation of eccentric countries, unfavorable lump sums in many cases, canceled priorities of no interest to some countries, low pre-financing in general, and lack of pre-financing for twinning. In Romania, in 2014 and 2015 the number of applications increased a lot, reaching about 3,000 projects submitted by each deadline. Unfortunately, due to underfunding, less than 10% is funded from them, which obviously leads to a growing lack of interest in the program. The lack of interest of the operators increases even more due to the reduced financing on the project. Thus, the maximum funding is EUR 150 000 thousand per project for two of the funding lines, much less for the others. From the information I have, the national contact points want to extend their responsibilities after the submission of projects because they are asked for information after this time and, in addition, relationships are created with applicants and we do not want to disappoint them. The national contact points also want to know the selection procedure, how the evaluators work, how the scores are awarded and, in general, they want more transparency and cooperation. In addition, the Romanian National Contact Point wants a different relationship with the Commission European and the Education, Audiovisual and Culture Executive Agency on a partnership basis, the current relationship is almost humiliating because these contact points are the link between the European institutions and applicants and thanks to them the program is promoted.The European Union spends a lot of resources not only money but also time or human resources in areas that favor globalism, uniformity and multinational companies.By contrast, culture, education and, above all, projects for citizens are a kind of cinderella.", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 57, "date": "2017-03-02.json", "name": "Eleftherios SYNADINOS", "mepid": "125072", "text": "NI). - Mr President, it is questionable how a report on the Europe for Citizens program has a prominent place and constantly mentions Euroscepticism and immigration.

There is talk of mutual tolerance, public participation and respect, when promoting a Union in which everyone must agree to wrong policies and where any objections are condemned or eliminated, without the possibility of developing their arguments.

Today more than ever, we need a Europe that brings people together, not one that is built only from stones and legal books. The program already received a great positive response in the previous funding period, but has always been underfunded as the number of project applications is significantly higher than the number of approved projects. This situation has become even more precarious as a result of the drastic budget cuts by the member states in the current funding period, and many good projects that fully comply with the program guidelines have to be rejected year after year, which of course increases the frustration of the applicants significantly, because many are making a lot of effort to get good projects off the ground, and then in the end we cannot count on support.

It is this program that promotes European citizenship, it is this program that promotes civic activity and, finally, it is this program that allows us to build a European identity, but in order for it to be able to meet the challenges facing us and the Union, it must be much more effective and equipped with more innovative methods.

However, experience to date has shown that the European Union is afraid of referendums, since with them the people condemn its neoliberal policies, they condemn the European Union of bureaucracy and banking. The European Union has also shown that it does not want to facilitate the exercise of legislative initiative by citizens, as seen with \"Save the Water\". The alienation of citizens from the European Union is increasing because the Union's economic policy is based on the austerity and violent fiscal adjustment that have filled the Union with armies of the unemployed, the poor.

Clearly, if your project for European integration is to recover – mercifully, without the United Kingdom – it will require an enhanced level of social solidarity between the peoples of Europe. So it is not surprising that integrationists should set such store by top—down projects designed to tell the citizens of Europe’s nation states that their prime collective identity should be a continental one rather than a national one. When, for example, German citizens are next told that Greek citizens need another euro bailout, federalists will wish their first reaction to be, ‘Yes, we Europeans must stand together’ and not ‘Why should more German money go to Greece?’ But I am afraid that you might as well push water uphill as try to indoctrinate people about the collective loyalties that they feel. In no other continent on earth are so many distinct cultures, countries and languages held in such close proximity. That is what makes Europe the most interesting continent. People like Mr Verhofstadt think Europe is a continent of dwarves that cannot compete in the modern world and that we need to bring every aspect of public policy under the EU umbrella. But there is a better way forward and that is to be less doctrinaire and less rigid, to get behind NATO as our key defensive alliance, to allow nation states to return to national currencies that reflect their economic conditions, to trust that the peoples of a democratic Europe will be too sensible to return to the days of ultra-nationalism that caused the shedding of so much blood. But to try and force a European identity through top—down programmes such as Europe for Citizens is self—defeating. You are wasting your time and you are also wasting our money.

In the current political season, with elections to be held in various EU countries, the growing Eurosceptic sentiments are creating deep divisions and social polarisation, threatening the very foundations and the very existence of the European project. The European Union needs to reconnect with its citizens, putting them back at the heart of its agenda. Encouraging civic participation and enhancing people’s understanding of the history and diversity of the Union has never been as important for the future of Europe as it is today. This is the litmus test that Europe cannot fail. That is why I support this report and its very symbolic – and the first of its kind – programme, Europe for Citizens, which aims to bring the European Union closer to its citizens. The programme has reached more than seven million citizens in thousands of towns and cities around Europe, helping them to better understand the European Union, promoting the Union’s ideals and values, and improving the conditions for direct civic and democratic participation and active dialogue between the EU and its citizens. The programme provides a unique opportunity to strengthen a sense of European citizenship and belonging, and enhances solidarity and mutual understanding. Active citizenship, education and intercultural dialogue are paramount to the building of an open and inclusive society. This programme is one of the key instruments to achieve this. Despite its success, we need constantly to reinforce the programme and increase its budget, projects and goals. Member States also need to get actively involved and support the programme, further raising its profile by making people more aware of it. It is important that the programme focuses not only on the past, but also on the future and on current challenges such as migration, radicalisation and social inclusion, among others. I hope that the Commission and the Member States will implement the recommendations of this report, which will help to reinforce the programme.

This presents a serious threat to our environment and may have a permanent consequence on our biodiversity. We must also concern ourselves with the impact illegal wildlife trade has on the global economy, good governance and the wider connections with other criminal activities. It was with these considerations in mind that I proposed to the Committee on International Trade (INTA) to draft an own-initiative report on the EU common commercial policy in the context of wildlife sustainability, because trade policy can, and should, address wildlife conservation, support sustainable development and environmental protection. My report looks at the challenges we face and gives practical solutions on effective use of the resources available, with better implementation of our current policies giving tangible and comprehensive recommendations to the Commission on how trade and environmental policies can work together to tackle illegal wildlife trade inside the EU and globally. However, the report strongly recommends that we do not overburden the existing framework with the creation of new rules and mechanisms. Instead, the priority should be the implementation of the present framework in the context of the global trade and environmental regimes, such as the WTO, CITES, the WCO, the UNDP and the OECD. We must also seek further and deeper cooperation with the private sector and non-governmental organisations, ensuring that all stakeholders involved have a say and contribute to the fight against illegal wildlife trade. Initiatives such as the United for Wildlife Transport Taskforce should be widely promoted, as they draw upon the linkages between e-commerce, transportation and distribution to establish well-rounded and integrated approaches addressing both supply and demand, as well as focusing on breaking chains to tackle illegal trade in wildlife and wildlife products. Sharing data and knowledge is imperative and this report stresses that there is still work to do at this level, both within the EU and with partner countries. Customs procedures must be assessed, and emphasis and resources should be put on strengthening compliance and law enforcement at national and regional levels. The EU must step up its efforts in the provision of training, information and capacity building, full customs in developing countries, and promote transparency and good governance. To tackle illegal wildlife crime we must also tackle its enablers. Corruption is one of the main facilitators of this activity. This report strongly encourages the EU and Member States to increase their vigilance, to reinforce cross-border measures to identify and prevent money-laundering associated with wildlife trafficking. My report supports the inclusion of anti-corruption provisions in future trade agreements. And as part of the EU’s ongoing commitment to sustainable development, our trade policy must strive for solid and detailed sustainable development chapters in its future trade agreements, similar to the one included in the EU-Vietnam FTA. It is imperative that we lead on the negotiation and implementation of higher standards covering trade in wildlife in the EU and globally.

In particular, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Emma McClarkin, for her excellent report. As has been pointed out, the scale of illegal wildlife trade and the impact on populations of vulnerable plant and animal species are extremely serious. Concerted international action is needed to prevent the loss of such species due to greed and ill-informed behaviour.  We are focusing today on trade-related aspects of this fight. At the same time, we should recall the importance of EU action in other policy areas as well, such as the provision of support to developing countries through our cooperation work. The report refers to the Trade for All communication, which underlines the importance of a values-based trade policy. I welcome the high degree of consensus that I understand exists between the political groups on the need for action to tackle this appalling phenomenon of illegal wildlife trade, an area of economic activity that is clearly contrary to our values.  The key multilateral instrument to address wildlife trade is, as we all know, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). CITES decisions apply to all CITES parties and, furthermore, it has the ability to take action if a party fails to follow the rules. Support for the effective implementation of CITES is a key feature of our trade policy. It is one of the international conventions that must be implemented effectively by beneficiaries of trade preferences under the EU’s GSP+ scheme. Commitments on effective implementation of CITES are included in the trade and sustainable development chapters of EU free trade agreements and the Commission does not hesitate to raise CITES issues directly in our dialogues with trade partners as necessary.  Today’s report also correctly identifies an important role for the private sector in tackling wildlife trafficking, including businesses in the aviation and shipping sectors. The concept of responsible business conduct is one that is strongly supported by the EU and is increasingly reflected in our various trade agreements. A high—value illegal trade such as that of illegal wildlife creates the conditions for corruption, as has been noted. As announced in the Trade for All communication and referred to in today’s report, the Commission intends to include provisions to address corruption linked to international trade in future trade agreements. The EU also successfully proposed, at the last Conference of the Parties to CITES, a resolution which explicitly calls for dedicated action against corruption linked to wildlife trafficking. I can assure you that the report will be considered very carefully by the Commission, including in the ongoing work on the implementation of the EU Action Plan against Wildlife Trafficking, and today’s timely debate has again highlighted this critical issue at the intersection of environmental and trade policy. As many of you have said, it is imperative that we take action to tackle the scourge of this trade. So thank you to the rapporteur and thank you to those who participated in this morning’s discussion.

As a consequence, in the event of a negative assessment, it was difficult or even impossible to withdraw or change them, as potentially such actions could cause political and economic crises between the EU Member State and the third country.

Therefore, the joint exercise of sovereign powers by the Member States takes place only when explicitly provided for in the Treaties and can not be done through secondary Union law, as this upsets the institutional balance and distribution of powers between the Member States of the Union.

The importance of the program has increased, especially with the enlargement of the EU to the east. I come from an eastern Member State and I know for sure that 40 years of communism have not passed without a trace in our societies, we cannot pretend that we no longer feel the effects of this period. Western Europe has had just as much time to overcome historical grievances as we have, and the clear intention of the founding Member States has strengthened this process.
