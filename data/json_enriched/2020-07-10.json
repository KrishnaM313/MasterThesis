In July 1995, over 8 372 Muslim men and boys were deliberately and systematically killed by the Bosnian Serb forces in the UN safe area of Srebrenica, a town that they thought to be safe in the war that was ravaging Bosnia and Herzegovina. Their bodies were thrown in mass graves, facing the ground, with their hands tied. As the last victims of Srebrenica are buried in dignity, our hearts and thoughts are once again with them and with the survivors, the families and friends. We remember and honour the victims, and we extend our sympathy to all those who are grieving. May they find healing for their enduring pain.  Europe has not forgotten what happened in Srebrenica or our own responsibility for not being able to prevent and stop the genocide. In Srebrenica, Europe failed, and we are faced with our shame. Indeed, the Srebrenica genocide remains an open wound at the heart of Europe. It continues to haunt us. It continues to remind us of our shared responsibility to prevent genocide from ever happening again. It is therefore our duty to remember Srebrenica forever.  It is also our duty to ensure accountability. Justice must be served, and all those responsible for the massacre must face the consequences of their actions. Twenty-five years on, it is more urgent than ever to end impunity for the perpetrators of war crimes. The massacre in Srebrenica was recognised as an act of genocide by two different international courts: the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in 2004, and the International Court of Justice in 2006.  These established facts about what happened in Srebrenica need to be acknowledged. Any attempt at denial and revisionism are unacceptable. Political leaders have a great responsibility in that regard. They need to choose the truth, justice and cooperation over fear and hate to overcome the tragic legacies of the past and build a brighter and prosperous future for the next generations. The leaders of the region must take full ownership and lead by example. There is no place in the EU for inflammatory rhetoric, let alone for the glorification of war criminals from any side. Political leaders must be dedicated to bring their citizens, especially young people, together around a common vision of the future, built on trust, mutual understanding and respect for one another.  Civil society’s contribution to such a future is fundamental. It plays a vital role in nurturing a democratic culture of remembrance in the Western Balkans and throughout Europe, especially for the benefit of the young generation. It is up to all of us in Europe to learn the lessons of Srebrenica. The values so brutally violated 25 years ago – the respect for human life and the respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy and equality – are now at the core of our engagement with Bosnia and Herzegovina and its citizens.  The Commission continues to uphold these values in its relations with all of the Western Balkan countries. Implementing the rulings and decisions of international tribunals and promoting an environment conducive to reconciliation in order to overcome the legacies of the war are key elements for all countries in the region to progress towards EU accession.  This is essentially actively promoting reconciliation at all levels to secure, for the long term, the daily life of each citizen. It also entails providing redress to victims of war crime, rape and torture, supporting the return of refugees and displaced persons, and allowing the families of missing persons to achieve closure to their grief. The European Union will continue to support Bosnia and Herzegovina to advance on its European path, establishing a society where pluralism, justice and human dignity prevail. Through the accession process, the EU will continue to accompany the Western Balkans towards reconciliation and regional cooperation to build a peaceful and prosperous future for all the people of the region.  Acknowledging our past will help us to move forward. Indeed, without reconciliation there will be no long-term peace, stability and prosperity in the Western Balkans. This is why I call on the Western Balkans to work in this direction, to heal the wounds of the past and deliver a common Europe.

Never again! Never again! Never again! I would like to dedicate this cry, this shout, this desperate message to all Bosnian citizens – with no exception of ethnicity, religion or belief – and to all European citizens that in the past have experienced the horror and the hell of genocide. To put it better: to all humanity.  The sacrifice of Srebrenica is not only the tragedy of Bosnia and Herzegovina; it is the denial of humanity. Whenever and wherever there is a genocide, a massacre, a massive and systematic killing of innocent people, there is the denial of humanity, the refusal of human dignity – there is Srebrenica. All genocides, but especially the one of Srebrenica, demand truth and justice, which are the essence of human respect. Truth is not compatible with denial. Justice is not reconcilable with impunity.  On behalf of the European citizens, who we represent, I want to show our deepest sorrow and our most profound shame to all the victims of the Srebrenica genocide, to all the survivors and families, to all Bosnians – I dare say, to all humanity. There were those directly responsible for this massacre, but the failure of the international community and of the European Union is unforgivable.

Club – Dear Chairman, with deep sadness and a special rooster towards the victims, today we are talking about the greatest tragedy on the European continent since World War II - the genocide in Srebrenica.   It's been a full 25 years, but memories of the horrific scenes still live strongly within us. Five years ago, the European Parliament adopted a special Resolution on genocide in Srebrenica.   There is no consolation for those who have lost loved ones even after all these years. But just as it is important to identify the remains of victims of crime, it is equally important for their families to clearly identify the crime and the criminals. Courts in The Hague, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and Croatia have sentenced 47 defendants to more than 700 years in prison for participating in the Srebrenica genocide.    Yes, the crime in Srebrenica is genocide and should be called that. We have rulings from the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and the International Court of Justice.   But the passage of time will only strengthen our obligation to protect victims and their families from programmed oblivion directed by political engineering. And there are such attempts and there will be more; from the awarding of the Nobel Prize to those who deny genocide to disinformation campaigns sponsored by various authoritarian regimes. We must not allow the crime to triumph afterwards. We owe this to the victims of Srebrenica, but also to the victims from Ovcara and other mass scaffolding in areas where the Greater Serbian project was leaving its criminal trail. Just defending the truth about the past opens up a better future for generations to come.    The wealth of Bosnia and Herzegovina is its multi-ethnic society. Unfortunately, the political structures created in times of war often slow down the true progress of that state. Its particularities, different nationalities, cultures and religions deserve full respect, and their equality is the best pledge for the European future in Bosnia and Herzegovina.   We owe a clear perspective of Bosnia and Herzegovina's membership in the European Union to the victims of Srebrenica, but also to young people who, I believe, will live in peace and prosperity united in diversity as citizens of the European Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 4, "date": "2020-07-10.json", "name": "Valter FLEGO", "mepid": "197419", "text": "  on behalf of the Renew Club. – Dear Chairman, Respected Commissioner, 25 years have passed the most horrific war crime on European soil since the end of World War II, since the srebrenica genocide.

And that is why today I sincerely regret that there was no political will and courage to re-enact the resolution on Srebrenica on the eve of the 25th anniversary of this great tragedy. This non-judgment of a war crime is the great civilizational defeat of this european parliament and the least we owe to the victims and their families is a guarantee that we will do absolutely everything in our power to make sure that such horrific crimes are never repeated again.  All of us are obliged to insist on justice and reject any policy that divides, condemns, excludes. With people's lives, pain and suffering, there is no compromise and no speculation.

On the criminal front, the penalties were heavy. At the international level, the overall responsibilities do not appear to be sufficiently clear. Finally, politically, it is notable that Serbia, which is not legally involved in this tragedy, nevertheless expressed a public apology in 2010. Similarly, the President of the Bosnian Serb Republic deplored one of the darkest pages in the history of his people in 2004. In a sign of the tensions still high, it was unfortunately by stone-throwing that Aleksandar Vusei, then Prime Minister of Serbia, was welcomed at the commemorations of July 2015.  While it will take many more years to reach a soothed memory, we must, on our side, guard ed from any risky political interpretation. Indeed, the atrocities of the war cannot justify the ostracism suffered today by the Bosnian Serb Republic, or the violations of its rights guaranteed by the Dayton Agreement. Nor do they justify a principled bias in the way of the Serbian people, whose immense toll we pay during the two world conflicts.  In particular, as we celebrate the 75th anniversary of the end of the Second World War, let us also pay tribute to the 1.7 million Yugoslavs who have fallen at the cost of europe's most spectacular resistance movements. Nor do we forget that, from the town of Glina to the Jasenovac camp, this heroic people learned, before so many others, the meaning of the word genocide. The memory of Srebrenica must today be that of the thousands of victims and their families who still live today filled with memories of a loved one, a husband, a brother or a father whom, for some, they will never have known.

This genocide, this genocide in the heart of Europe, took place under the eyes of world public opinion, and we must keep asking ourselves the question: how could this be possible? This failure weighs on the European Union as the greatest political failure after the Second World War. We therefore take the anniversary as an opportunity to commemorate the victims of this crime with shame and sorrow. However, in order to ensure that events in Srebrenica never happen again, we must remain vigilant, because 25 years after the Dayton peace agreement, hatred and nationalism are still dangerous incendiary accelerators that contribute to the division of society and the destabilisation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, but also of many other countries in Europe. Any political aspirations for supposedly ethnically pure areas must be unequivocally denied by the EU. The driving force behind this detailed planned crime was pure racism. This is not a Serbian or Bosnian invention. In order to deal with the past, war crimes against men, women and children must not be suppressed or denied, because they have left deep traumas. A rigorous prosecution of crimes, the consistent action of genocide denial and against the glorification of war criminals are as essential as the development of a common culture of remembrance. Different narratives and stereotypes still shape the picture of history. Education is important for sharing the knowledge, memory, and legacy of conflict with the next generation.

The Netherlands sent Dutchbat to protect the enclave, but the peacekeeping mission was a mission impossible from the start. The UN mandate was unworkable, armaments too light and promises on air support were broken. Srebrenica was not the failure of Dutchbat, but of the international community and Dutch politics. At the time of the decision-making, I was a political journalist in the Netherlands. Many felt that we should do something in the former Yugoslavia. The government wanted it, parliament wanted it, the press supported it. However, good intentions resulted in a political wish that was militarily unfeasible: Dutchbat was also taken hostage. However, the Dutch government remained in place and did not resign until seven years later after a critical report.  Srebrenica has led to reflection and many lessons in peacekeeping missions.

Muslims who, as a result of their continued failure to re-sign and suppress their political subjectivity, have remained an anomaly in the processes of emancipation of European (Christian) nations or nations as a result of the continued failure to re-sign and suppress their political subjectivity. After the break-up of Yugoslavia, the political elites tackled the Bosnian issue literally by destroying part of the population of Bosnia and Herzegovina. They justified the legitimacy of their politics on the ideology of nationalism and the distorted historical constructs that favored the superiority of one ethnic and religious group to the other. The brutal destruction of more than 8372 men, boys and children has led to a clear effort to end the country's social and political pluralism. Although the Dayton Agreement prevented this to some extent, it has in no way been able to set sufficiently solid frameworks for its further development. This is precisely why (above all) the EU and European leaders are expected to unequivocally condemn genocide in the light of the achievement of inter-ethnic reconciliation and justice for the families of the victims of genocide, and in particular take a firm stance against the tendency to deny the latter. Aware of how fragile peace and stability can be, the EU must simply not allow ourselves to turn its back on a constructive debate about genocide.

More than eight thousand people were killed in a planned, systematic, bestial way.  Why? Because from the point of view of their tormentors they did not meet ethnic criteria. They were ethnically, culturally, linguistically alien. Nationalism, paying homage to the idea of an elected nation, better than others.

Culture is part of Europe’s DNA. Our rich and vibrant cultural and creative scene is one of the greatest gifts Europe has to offer and it must be preserved at all costs. We all know how much the sector has suffered. The cultural and creative sectors have been hit by the pandemic in an unprecedented way. 95% of the sector are small businesses, small enterprises, independent artists and freelancers who are highly vulnerable and often work under very precarious conditions. The Commission has had a regular exchange with Member States, the European Parliament and the sector itself over these past months to come up with solutions. Let me first start by what we could call the emergency solutions. One of the first actions we have adopted was to mobilise Cohesion Policy funds to respond to the rapidly emerging needs through the Corona Response Investment Initiative. These packages provided Member States with liquidity and exceptional flexibility to reallocate financial resources in the areas of greatest need, which of course also includes cultural and creative industries. Second, another vital emergency initiative was the new instrument for temporary Support to mitigate Unemployment Risks in an Emergency, also known as the SURE programme, worth up to EUR 100 billion. This is a scheme designed to protect jobs and workers affected by the pandemic and, here again, it is for Member States to make the best possible use of this instrument and money and bring the much needed relief to creators, artists and writers. Third, we have, as you know, enacted the Temporary Framework for State aid measures to support the economy in the pandemic, and culture was specifically included as one of the sectors particularly hit by the crisis together with transport, tourism, hospitality and retail. Many Member States, if not all of them, have already used this instrument for the creative and cultural sectors. But, beyond the emergency measures we have also taken many specific actions. Some cultural actors have indeed developed their own promising initiatives to overcome the crisis and through this dialogue and synergies between Member States, the sector, the Commission, Parliament and others, we want to bring about specific initiatives. One of the best examples was the European Cultural Foundation that set up a new Culture of Solidarity Fund. Another platform for and by the sector was the so—called Creatives Unite initiative set up through the pilot project Finance, Learning, Innovation and Patenting for Cultural and Creative Industries (FLIP). This is an initiative that offers a common space for all cultural and creative sectors in Europe and beyond, giving access to a multitude of existing resources and relevant networks to work on. A few weeks ago, a conference with representatives from the Commission, the Parliament, the Council President and the sector was precisely organised through this platform of Creatives Unite. Let me now come, of course, to our flagship programme Creative Europe. There again we applied maximum flexibility within the existing regulatory context for ongoing and planned actions. We extended a number of deadlines to facilitate the finalisation of obligations under these difficult circumstances and we also planned specific measures for cinemas, for instance, with a EUR 5 million supplementary allocation of funds in the form of vouchers for cinemas most severely affected by the lockdown. And we redirected the work of the Support scheme for the cross—border dimension of performing arts works towards digital culture and virtual mobility. And beyond the Creative Europe programme we will very soon launch a targeted support to the disproportionately hit music sector through the Music Moves Europe initiative and there we plan to shift about EUR 2.5 million in this year to help the sector become more sustainable after the crisis. We are also exploring how to adapt and reinforce the cultural and creative sectors through the Guarantee Facility that would be used in a specific situation to allow for even more flexibility, credit holidays or guarantee cover to individual loss. Let me now quickly come to the recovery and the Next Generation EU chapter. As you know, next week we’re having a landmark meeting of our heads of state and government in what I want to believe would be a path towards an agreement on the much needed recovery and Next Generation EU package as proposed by the Commission. For culture and creative sectors, support will be available, not only through the Creative Europe programme, but also through other programmes, such as REACT—EU, the new Cohesion Policy, InvestEU, Digital Europe Programme, just to name a few. So, I think it should be wrong to see Creative Europe as the only pathway, the only avenue for recovery in the years to come. We have a multitude of instruments in the new package and we can use it effectively. But beyond the recovery package – and that’s how I wanted to conclude this initial presentation – one should not forget that we also have possibilities coming from different avenues, like, for example, Horizon Europe, where we have a Cluster 2: Culture, Creativity and Inclusive Society programme, which has fantastic opportunities for the sectors. And we should also keep in mind the so—called Knowledge and Innovation Communities (KICs), which for the first time will be dedicated to cultural and creative industries through our European Institute for Technology, based in Budapest, Madam President, if I may remind. So, all these tools will converge into having a strong new start after the difficult pandemic sectors without forgetting tourists. You remember that a few weeks ago, last month actually, we presented a comprehensive tourism and travel package and cultural tourism accounts for 40% of all European tourists, so we have to make sure that at the beginning of this summer tourist season, Europe will not lose its focus on its cultural tourism privilege. Honourable Members, Madam President, in these difficult times culture is not a luxury, it is becoming a necessity. Culture is part of our heritage. Culture is our European way of life. To preserve it, defend it and promote it, we must unite and work together to make this new future as bright as possible. I count on your support so that we keep supporting, helping, assisting our dynamic communities of artists and creators.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE-DE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 3, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 16, "date": "2020-07-10.json", "name": "Michaela ŠOJDROVÁ", "mepid": "124710", "text": "  for the PPE Group. – Madam President, Mr Vice-President, thank you for fighting together for culture, for the cultural sector. It turns out it makes sense. I would like to thank the Vice-President for listing a number of activities that complement those we already know, particularly Creative Europe. I will also recall the economic importance here. The cultural sector generates between 3% and 4% of GDP in the European Union. And that doesn't count what it brings to tourism. You, Mr Vice-President, remembered it at the end, but all cultural activities, cultural monuments, concerts, festivals, all this is the goal of tourism. Without these cultural activities, there will be no tourism, which is the driver of the economy in many European countries. That is why we are working so hard to make both Creative Europe and the new Recovery Fund open to these activities.  The Recovery Fund will be a huge investment programme and it is up to the Member States to really use this programme to restore and actively exploit cultural monuments, to support the cultural sector, including independent media, the film industry, so that the real impact of the COVID-19 crisis is somehow replaced because it is destructive. And we know it. If the Creative Europe programme does not increase significantly – and we want you to support this again at European Commission level– the Recovery Fund here must be prepared to provide support in these investment activities. I would like to remind you that 2018 was a successful year for The European Cultural Heritage, which we want to see repeated. Finally, let me make one big appeal.

The reason for this orientation of the Night of Light, however, was less beautiful. Within a very short time, the Corona crisis has pushed the entire cultural and event industry to the abyss. It would therefore have been necessary to put the Berlaymont building on red alert. The Commission still does not seem to be fully aware of the gravity of the situation, and what you have just presented to us, Commissioner, is essentially a few drops in the ocean. Neither the Building Fund nor the EU's next multiannual financial framework really take account of the cultural and creative sectors. Apart from warm words, there is not much here. The cultural support programme is to be cut even further compared to the Commission's original proposal.  I therefore call very clearly for at least 2% of the building fund to be made available as a European bailout for culture and to commit it accordingly and not to put it in the care of the Member States.

Madam President, Commissioner, during the confinement, the authors and artists were there for us, to bring us dreams, escapes and smiles sometimes, even when the heart was not there. And all for free. They've been there for us, so will we be there for them? Indeed, for culture, there is urgency, it is a fragile sector, which stopped overnight. Cinemas, festivals, museums, concert halls, theatres, monuments: the first to close, they will be the last to reopen after months of losses and uncertainties. Uncertainties that the European Union has not lifted, and certainly not by announcing the paltry amounts that are allocated to the new Creative Europe programme: only 8%, while the European Parliament was calling for a doubling. It should be remembered that Europe spends only 0.14% of its budget on culture. This is a bad signal because it is obvious that cultural recovery must pass through Europe. What I am asking you to do today is for all European emergency mechanisms to be mobilised for culture: the SURE programme for partial unemployment, the next generation EU's major recovery plan to support its industries and sectors of various sizes, made up of SMEs and self-employed people and which together account for 4% of our GDP. After the emergency phase, Europe will also have to be more ambitious to show that culture is irreplaceable, to illustrate our diversity, our commitment to freedom of expression and creation. There are many avenues for cultural heritage to open up opportunities for our creators in the digital age, to launch major European co-productions, to include our cultural industries in the European Green Pact. Finally, Commissioner, let us have this ambition: to strengthen Europe, to set a course for our European values, we must ensure that culture is integrated into the dialogue with citizens in the framework of the Conference for the Future of Europe.

I myself, on 26 October 2019, sent a letter to President Sassoli asking to resume the process of constituting the European Constitution. The reply I received from the President confirmed the need and the will to continue in this direction, underlining the centrality of European culture. The European Union must reform itself, or rather it must be reborn; it must not be a Europe of nations but a Europe of peoples. We remember the great Venetian people, or the Friulian, Bavarian, Catalan, Basque, Breton people and so on. We should not talk about a European culture, but about a set of cultures and peoples that make it up. The attempt to stifle and eliminate the different specificities can only lead to the inevitable failure of the European project, a failure that we do not want. Only full respect for the culture and history of individual countries will lead to a genuine European Union. A European culture can only be created by going beyond its national interests, and individual identities are in fact the added value and make Europe great and unique, with almost 500 million inhabitants.

Madam President, Commissioner, if I had to do it again, I would start with culture. This apocryphal phrase attributed to Jean Monnet takes on its importance at a time when we are questioning our ways of life, our modern societies, the very existence of our European Union. During the COVID crisis, culture was present in all households. During the confinement, the culture brought comfort and hope. Culture is a vital element of a society, culture expresses, represents, transcends, it is the bridge between generations, between people, between languages. She entertains, she celebrates, she imagines. From museums to theatres, from dance halls to libraries, culture brings us together. Culture is a privileged tool for mutual understanding and to overcome discrimination but also for strengthening human dignity, democracy, equality and solidarity: the founding values of Europe.  Right here, before your eyes, it is a true declaration of love that I make to culture and to those who make it live. The crisis, in the absence of a proportionate and ambitious response from our policies, has hit hard all those people who have made culture their profession: artists, authors, technicians, creators, intermittents.  For all of them, the recovery must be the T-moment when culture ceases to be a corollary to the other priorities and sectors of activity of the European Union. Culture deserves to become a priority in its own right, from a political and budgetary point of view. To not place culture at the heart of our European project of the world that we wish for our children is for sure to leave them a world of crises, conflicts and wars.

That is why I would like to see, at a time like this, a serious conversation about what the European Commission should encourage. Should it continue on this dangerous and slippery path of promoting supranational cultural projects that go left and go towards cultural Marxism? Cultural projects that try to portray the European person as a person without roots, without clear national self-determination, without clear national self-consciousness, without a clear gender identity and without any cultural supports. Because, Madam President and Commissioner, I deeply believe that we Europeans owe who we are to our european origins; of our religion – most of us are Christians, whether they are Orthodox, Catholic, Protestant, but most of us are Christians; and our self-consciousness and self-determination. And when we talk about our roots, what makes us who we are, we cannot avoid, Commissioner, I am talking about Hagia Sophia. \"Hagia Sophia\" is unsurprisingly referred to as the mother of all churches.

I have also noted your concerns about the budget and the programme. You know that when it comes to discussions on the budget, these discussions are always, always complicated and complex. What I want to assure you is that what is on the table is the best possible option that we could propose under the current circumstances, and allow me to share with you my optimism that next week we will have a major historic agreement on the Recovery Package. That would be the best way to symbolise Europe’s return to kick-starting the real economy and growth and jobs.  I have also noted the traditional debate on what European culture represents today in Europe. At my hearing I also had the occasion to say that I see the richness of our culture, not the existence of a Homo Europaeus who thinks the same, does the same and imposes his or her values on everybody else. I see our European culture as a mirror, a mirror of diversity, a mirror of the richness of what Europe represents in terms of language, history, tradition, culture, literature and the arts, and this is what makes Europe unique in today’s ever uncertain, and if I may say, darker world.  I also wanted to say something about Hagia Sophia. I have noted your interest, which I share. Hagia Sophia is a symbol of inter-faith and inter-cultural dialogue. It is part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site – it’s a museum, it’s a symbol. It’s also a symbol of a city, which is in itself a symbol of what we would like to see as values prevailing in today’s world. Turkey is a founding member of the UN initiative for the Alliance of Civilizations and has already taken on important obligations in this context. So, given the global monument that it is, it is essential that Hagia Sofia maintains its current status, recognised both internationally and publicly. Otherwise that would undermine the tolerance and openness of Turkey. Let me remind you that, back in 2010, the city that hosts Hagia Sophia was a European Capital of Culture, and as the Prime Minister of Turkey at the time, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, said: ‘this is a European city with its heart, its culture and civilisation, its people, its past, its future. It has always looked towards Europe. Istanbul has shaped European culture and has been shaped by it’ – Prime Minister Erdoğan, 2010. This is the spirit that we want to hear.

Artists and employees of cultural institutions were also in a difficult situation. Today, therefore, we are discussing the cultural rebirth of Europe.  This is a good time to answer the questions: what is the European Union today? What are the values? How much respects the catalogue of principles created by the founding fathers: Konrad Adenauer, Alcide De Gasperi, Robert Schuman? These principles are: respect for the cultural and religious identity of nation states and respect for the principles of solidarity and subsidiarity. What is the answer? Such that Europe really needs a cultural revival. Indeed, we see that in the implementation of the great project of multi-culturalism, Europeans are expected to dissuade themselves, to support the decline of European culture, traditions and religions.

Mr President, Commissioner, dear Élisa Ferreira, ladies and gentlemen, the face of Europe is being disfigured by the COVID-19 crisis. All regions of Europe are heavily affected, unemployment has risen again, bankruptcies are multiplying, the real economy has been hit hard, no sector is spared, no region is spared and economic forecasts are rather catastrophic. This crisis is a harsh indicator of our fragilities. Europe is in this important moment when recovery is not an option, it is an imperative and, more than ever, European institutions and policies must stay the course, must keep principles and must keep the course of cohesion. In the midst of a health disaster, we must remember that the only European policy that has been able to help all Member States is cohesion policy. This was able to help to set up partial unemployment schemes for employees, to buy equipment for hospitals, to help SMEs. Both our Committee on Regional Development and the European Parliament have played their part and have lived up to their responsibilities in urgently adopting the regulations, and we have started legislative work on REACT-EU.  Here, in the plenary on Wednesday, Chancellor Angela Merkel and The President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, and all the presidents of the political groups called for a cohesion-based revival. And we are now waiting for these words to translate into action and into concrete reality. And we expect the European Council to live up to the promises and expectations at the next summit. The proposed funding, Commissioner, in the new Next Generation EU instrument is a step in the right direction, even though our Parliament was waiting for more funds. However, cohesion policy remains severely affected by the new MFF proposal and is down 12% from 2014-2020 programming. We must remember that cohesion policy plays a central role in all regions of Europe. It is a policy on the ground with a foothold in the real economy and, therefore, adequate support is absolutely necessary so as not to jeopardize its long-term objectives. Greater flexibility is expected and greater simplification, and on both of these objectives you will find us at your side to facilitate them. If, between the day of the tabling of our oral question and today, answers, it must be admitted, have been made, many questions remain topical. We will be very vigilant that the management of the 350 billion stimulus fund, through, we hope, mainly subsidies, is well aimed at the objectives of cohesion. That is why we ask you, Commissioner, what place the Commission intends to give cohesion in recovery. And, in this respect, how will the European Semester direct these funds to respect the principles of cohesion, i.e. that priority is given to regions as much less developed as to regions that have been heavily impacted by the crisis?  How, too, will the European Semester target, as part of the recovery plan, the regions, groups and sectors that need it most to ensure that the island and outermost regions are not left behind? Finally, at a time when all States are going into debt for recovery, how does the Commission envisage excluding cohesion policy spending from the Stability and Growth Pact for the period 2021-2027? And in conclusion, I will tell you, Commissioner, that we all hope for a good agreement in the Council. If this agreement were to be an agreement that satisfies Parliament, then our Committee on Regional Development and all the rapporteurs will take responsibility for a year-end negotiation, which will ensure that the year 2021 is not lost.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "GUE/NGL", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 41, "date": "2020-07-10.json", "name": "Elisa FERREIRA", "mepid": "28308", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, thank you for your invitation today. You gave me a vote of confidence in the past to work for stronger economic, social and territorial cohesion in our Union, and to support the regions in facing the challenges of today and tomorrow.  Today, these challenges are even greater. In this week’s economic forecast presented by the Commission, it is yet again clear that the economic impact of this crisis will be bigger than expected. The recovery next year will be weaker than initially foreseen. The downside risks are considerable. Divergence, asymmetry and fragmentation still hang over our Union.  It is a critical moment, then. Will we, collectively, find the political will and demonstrate the leadership to put an ambitious European recovery plan into action? Half of the work is done. The European Commission has put an unprecedented ambitious recovery package on the table. Most importantly, it has put cohesion and solidarity at the heart of its package. This House was crucial in reaching this point. Thank you to all of you.  The two resolutions, supported by a large majority of the political forces, have called for a bold proposal. There may still be issues to fine-tune, but this is part of the democratic process. The crucial thing is that institutional negotiations cannot linger. We must strike an agreement on both recovery instruments powered by the Next Generation EU under the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) 2021-2027 in full respect of the Community method.  We must understand that every day lost without action is a life, a job, a business lost without concrete support. As you correctly mentioned – et merci de l’avoir fait – cohesion is essential to counter the emerging disparities across and within Member States, to guarantee the level playing field essential for the internal market to function, and to provide the investments needed for the green and digital recovery.  We were quick to act. We acted with the support of Parliament and of the Committee on Regional Development (REGI) and the Committee on Budgets (BUDG). The two Coronavirus Response Investment Initiatives enabled mobilisation of some EUR 50 billion of cohesion funds. This has allowed us to buy masks and ventilators, to keep people in jobs, to give cash-starved businesses a lifeline, and to give liquidity support to squeezed public budgets.  This was an emergency. However, more is now needed. Overall, the recovery package brings EUR 100 billion in addition to the cohesion funds. Half of this will come from REACT-EU: a EUR 55 billion instrument to provide immediate and flexible support in 2020, 2021 and 2022 for health, small and medium-sized enterprises, workers, and green and digital projects. It comes on top of the current and the next MFF and acts as a bridge between the two periods.  The other instrument, the Just Transition Fund, on which Parliament was also very active and vocal will now deliver some EUR 40 billion for those people and regions that will suffer the most from the transition to a carbon neutral economy. We also proposed a EUR 10 billion mid-term top-up in 2024 to capture the long-term effects of the crisis at regional level. In 2021-2027, cohesion policy should continue to deliver on its Treaty objectives to promote convergence and support the least-developed parts of the Union, and it will have the task of putting the European priorities in action on the ground in every region, ensuring a green and digital transition that leaves no one behind. However, it can only do that with a stable financial framework in place. Therefore, we need a decision at the European Council in the next few days and an agreement with Parliament right after. I will do my utmost to work with you, with the Member States, with regions, with civil society, to get an agreement on the several cohesion proposals on the table. We have to make sure that cohesion policy continues to deliver – now, tomorrow and in the long-term. For the sake of a resilient and fair recovery and for the sake of a stronger Union. Thank you.

Are these measures that we have taken actually using them, helping them?  My second question: when we want to achieve something for the future we need to take a strategic approach, and therefore I want to ask you, how can we define a strategic approach and how can we ensure it then in REACT-EU, to actually have the strategic approach where I think less flexibility and more – sorry I’m missing the words here – but you know what I mean, that this is needed, very much.

First of all, I would like to start by quoting what Mr Heide mentioned, that the Cohesion Policy is the beating heart of Europe. I think it is, and I think it was beating when Europe was in trouble, when Europe was suffering. Et je vous remercie, Monsieur Omarjee, de votre référence au travail qu’on a fait ensemble pour avoir une réponse immédiate au problème du coronavirus. I would like also to say that, in fact, this opportunity, for all those that mentioned that there was really the need to go to specific situations, to the people, that in fact these flexibilities that became available in the context of the response by the Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative (CRII) and CRII+ have already been used by almost all EU Member States. For the time being, all Member States, with the exception of Austria and Denmark, have been using these transfers, this possibility to use the available funds – a maximum of over EUR 50 billion – in order to pay what has been paid: the masks, the ventilators, the support jobs and to support small and medium enterprises and to give an immediate answer. So, for all those that used to say that the Cohesion Policy is an old policy, I think we have proven that it is quite alive and quite capable of delivering emergency aid when it is needed. Actually, with State aid it was almost the only financing policy. I mean it’s not the only one, but it is the biggest one, and the most visible one. My second point is on the quality of what we have proposed. Yes, we had to propose a long—term kind of action that combines a short—term instrument, REACT—EU, with all the flexibilities and keeping the possibility of a co—financing of up to 100% if Member States so decide. Of course, for practical reasons REACT—EU cannot be distributed immediately by the Commission at the level of each region because we are distributing the envelope on the basis of actual data, and by the end of the summer we will not have the data at the regional level. But it is up to the Member States to transfer the same criteria that for the Commission is the drop in GDP, drop in growth, the increase in unemployment, including youth unemployment, and the relative prosperity of the country in order to have a follow—up, a bridge to the next Multiannual Financial Framework that really can help the regions to bridge these differences. But we hope and we are very attentive to the quality and the criterion that Member States will be using in this distribution. (I am also trying to answer your question, Mr Omarjee.) Having said this, I would just like to add that, yes it is important that we now take the Commission’s proposal as the real basis. I think we should stop saying that there is not enough money, I think there is a lot of money and here I quote Mr  Nienaß and others: we have got to see what we want to do with this money and the quality of what we’ll be doing, because the quality of what we’ll be doing determines our future. Sendo assim, e em particular para o Sr. Ferreira que referiu a potencial quebra de fundos, não há quebra de fundos.  Os fundos do MFF têm, neste momento, de ser contabilizados com os outros instrumentos adicionais que estão a ser propostos pela Comissão e eles são, de facto, 55 mil milhões de euros para o REACT-EU, um extra de 32,5 mil milhões de euros para o fundo de transição justa e um valor de 10 mil milhões de euros que virão no ano de 2020 a ser distribuídos de acordo com os dados efetivos de quebra de rendimento e aumento de desemprego das regiões da Europa. Portanto, são mais 100 mil milhões de euros.  Penso que, neste momento, o que importa é que, rapidamente, nós tenhamos uma clara ideia e uma clara capacidade de organizar o que queremos fazer, de fazer e organizar o modo como se pode fazer a implementação na prática e no bom sentido das oportunidades que estão a ser criadas.   I’m very proud that the Commission was so blunt and so strong in this proposal. This could only be done because you were here and you were putting on pressure. This could only be done because also, at the level of certain governments, there was this impulse for us to act.  So, let’s work together and let’s very quickly decide the approval, with fine—tuning, with better quality here and there, but that quickly, we move forward so that the money is, as all of you were saying, available – with continuity, not stopping – and directed to a green, to a digital, to a modern recovery, that is shared by all the regions and all citizens in Europe.  So, this is what we have at this moment on the table. Let’s work together as institutions to deliver what the citizens are expecting us to deliver in such a critical and difficult moment in the history of Europe. Thank you very much. Let’s go on working together and yes, of course, we are always attentive to the regions that are most in difficulty. We have proven it, so let’s work together and let’s help citizens wherever they are because they all need to be part of our common future.

It was thanks to cohesion policy that hospitals received urgent assistance at that time.

However, I call on the European Commission and the Member States not to forget the overarching role of cohesion policy, the role of the European Union's most important investment policy, and the levelling of development of European regions in thinking about the future of cohesion policy.

It is also worth highlighting the critical decrease in appropriations for the achievement of the Treaty objectives under cohesion policy. According to the latest EC proposal of May 2018 (currently being negotiated), the PS budget under the MFF is down by 2.3% compared to the EC proposals of May 2018 (including the ERDF by 2%, ESF+ by 3% and THE FS by 1.7%).  The need for immediate implementation of the proposed actions. Therefore, key legislative initiatives: the Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative (CRII) and CRII+ should be adopted as soon as possible. It should be stressed that the willingness to cooperate constructively in the Council must be confirmed by each Member State. This will enable the rapid implementation of legislative proposals related to the economic recovery of EU countries after the COVID-19 pandemic. We should therefore mobilise efforts to achieve this objective.  I also support the increase in the possibility of transfers between cohesion policy funds (ERDF, ESF+ and SF), as well as the establishment of a set of interim measures in the implementation of cohesion policy, the extension of the existing scope of ERDF support and the extension of the ERDF specific objectives.

Cohesion policy is a very effective and proven tool for reducing socio-economic inequalities in the EU, which have intensified again in times of crisis. I am therefore convinced that it is cohesion policy that should play a key role here in europe's recovery plan. Due to the complications caused by the pandemic and the extraordinary remedial measures taken in this regard, it seems impossible to adopt all the new ESIF regulations in a timely way. I therefore call on the European Commission to introduce the required transitional provisions in order to avoid complications and further administrative burdens for Member States and their operators. I also consider it appropriate to introduce even greater simplification and procedural flexibility at least until the end of the Union's exit from the economic crisis. It should also be ensured that the measures programmed under traditional cohesion policy are not permanently redirected directly to combating the effects of the pandemic.
