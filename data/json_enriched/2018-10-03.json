To begin with, I would like to underline the importance of common values, such as democracy, the rule of law and human rights, as cornerstones of the European Union. It is crucial that every Member State respects, protects and promotes them. Values like the rule of law and the separation of powers are not negotiable and have to be at the heart of our attention. It is of great importance to stay in constant dialogue and to cooperate in order to ensure the best standards and conditions for all citizens. The Council addressed the situation in Romania in its conclusions on the Cooperation and Verification Mechanism adopted on 12 December 2017. The Council reiterated the importance for Romania of focusing on further consolidation and fully addressing the concerns in the recommendations set out by the Commission in its report on progress achieved in Romania under the Cooperation and Verification Mechanism. Of great value, too, are the widely acknowledged opinions of the Venice Commission. The Presidency is aware that the Romanian authorities are in constant contact with both the Venice Commission and the European Commission to find solutions to the issues raised. I trust that all sides are taking the issues raised in this dialogue seriously, as they go to the heart of our commitment to this Union. In this sense we hope that the ongoing exchange between the Romanian authorities and the Commission will continue to prove efficient in addressing these issues in a manner that leaves no doubt about our core values.

I’ll try to be as concise as I can.  We are all aware that the initiatives taken by the Romanian authorities since 2017 concerning the reform of the justice laws, the criminal procedure and criminal codes and the processes regarding the judiciary have led to concerns from a wide range of stakeholders, both inside and outside Romania and the EU. Many Romanians are worried that the proposed changes to these laws may undermine the longstanding efforts in the fight against corruption and the independence of the judiciary. These are concerns that the Commission very much shares. As Guardian of the Treaties, when it comes to the application of EU law and respect for the EU’s fundamental values, the Commission intervenes on the basis of accurate and thorough legal analysis. It focuses on concrete national measures and engages in a dialogue with the authorities. In these matters, the Commission is politically colour-blind and clinical in our approach. That is the case for Romania just as much as for any other Member State. With your permission, I will set out the main developments in Romania. First, regarding the justice laws: the three justice laws, dating back to 2004, define the status of magistrates and organise the judicial system and the Superior Council of Magistracy. At the end of last year, the laws were amended by the Romanian Parliament. These amendments have been challenged several times before the Constitutional Court. These laws have attracted criticism from institutions inside Romania and from outside. The Council of Europe anti—corruption watchdog, GRECO, adopted a very critical report in March. The Venice Commission’s preliminary opinion, issued in July, was equally critical, raising serious concerns about the independence of the judiciary, its efficiency and its quality. It made a series of recommendations. The final opinion is expected to be adopted later this month. I know this House will pay as close attention to that opinion as we will at the Commission, but unfortunately the fact is that the Romanian Parliament has so far not shown signs of responding to the opinions and recommendations.  Secondly, as concerns the overhaul of the criminal codes and the code of criminal procedures, in May the Romanian Parliament launched a procedure to amend the criminal code and the code of criminal procedures. They were passed in the months of June and July. The Romanian law enforcement authorities, as well as other Member States, expressed their concerns. The amendments have been challenged before the Constitutional Court, and judgments are expected in mid-October. The Venice Commission is preparing another opinion on these amended codes, which is also expected to be adopted later in October. These laws are crucial for the capacity of prosecutors to investigate, and judges to sentence, high-level corruption, as well as for the ability of the judicial system to pursue crime effectively. The climate needed for reform has deteriorated due to the secret protocols between the prosecution and the intelligence services. I call on the Romanian authorities to conduct full and impartial investigations into this issue. Romanians deserve a law enforcement order with all authorities properly supervised and full judicial independence. The reforms of the judicial laws and of the criminal codes are interlinked, and they must be prevented from having a negative impact on the independence of the judiciary and its effectiveness in combating corruption. That is why the Commission has discussed this issue regularly with the Romanian Government at the highest level and has made its concerns public. We have examined the texts passed by the Romanian Parliament to fully assess their impact. We are seeking further clarification on how specific elements of these laws should be interpreted.  Thirdly, as concerns a procedure to dismiss the chief anti-corruption prosecutor and the evaluation of the general prosecutor, I would like to recall that the track record of the anti-corruption prosecution, the so-called DNA, was a central reason for the more positive assessment of Romania that the Commission made back in our Cooperation and Verification Mechanism (CVM) report in January 2017.  (Applause) Moreover, robust and independent procedures for the dismissal and appointment of top prosecutors have always been a key element in our recommendations. The Commission has also recommended that the Romanian authorities seek the help of the Venice Commission in this matter. This remains one of the outstanding recommendations under the Cooperation and Verification Mechanism.   We are following the latest developments in Romania with concern. The independence of Romania’s judicial system and its capacity to fight corruption effectively are essential cornerstones of a strong Romania in the European Union. We have seen substantial progress in the past, but things are now moving backwards in a way that would be damaging for the place that Romania has built as an EU Member State in recent years. The Commission has repeatedly called on the Romanian authorities to rethink their course of action, and to build a broad consensus on the way forward, and I want to reiterate that call today. I would stress once again that the Commission is always ready to cooperate with and support the Romanian authorities in this process. I trust this dialogue will continue, and we will be meticulous and precise in all the elements of the proposals that we would like to discuss with the Romanian authorities. The latest developments are a source of growing concern for the Commission. If adopted without changes, the combined effect of the amended justice laws and the criminal codes would affect the capacity of the justice system, including the prosecution service, to effectively fight against corruption and other crimes. This means backtracking from the situation that led the Commission to make a positive assessment in our report of January 2017. We will report on the situation in our next CVM report next month. You can see what our CVM progress report stated in January 2017 and what it did in the last report in November 2017. The situation has deteriorated. Rest assured that all developments will be thoroughly assessed and reflected in our upcoming report. President Juncker and I issued a joint statement in January this year, setting out our concerns on the direction of travel. We stated clearly at that point that the irreversibility of the progress achieved so far under the CVM is an essential precondition to phase out the mechanism. Without that, we cannot phase out the mechanism. So, while we will continue pursuing our objective of a sustainably positive situation in a dialogue with the Romanian authorities, I wish also to be clear today that the Commission will draw the appropriate conclusions if the amendments to the justice law, criminal codes and laws on conflict of interest and corruption are promulgated without taking account of the concerns. Concretely, this means following up our recommendations from the January 2017 CVM report, and the recommendations expressed by the Venice Commission and GRECO. As the Guardian of the Treaties, we will not hesitate to take action, where necessary, to ensure compatibility with the Treaties. Indeed, the Commission will use all the means at its disposal, be it under CVM or otherwise. The Commission urges Romania to put the reform process back on track immediately. This means going forwards, not backwards, and abstaining from any steps which reverse the progress accomplished over the past years. I honestly think there is still an opportunity to turn things around. The laws are not yet promulgated, and therefore it is not yet too late for the Romanian institutions to act to turn the situation around. As always, we stand ready to help, but the responsibility and the power to deliver change lie firmly with the Romanian institutions. I call again on them to take the right steps now.

I'm saying from the beginning that I'm not here to answer. I came because I cherish and respect you. I ask, however, for the same value and respect for the Romanian people, whom I represent. I begin with an essential question: for whom do we want to build a viable justice system in Romania? For THE CVM? For institutions? For the magistrates? For politicians? Obviously not. We need to do fair justice for the citizens, they are the beneficiaries of measures in the European Parliament or in the national parliaments. Every discussion must begin from the citizens. Justice must be the guarantee that citizens' laws and rights are respected and whoever violates them will be punished.  It is legitimate to ask: how did the CVM protect Romanian citizens from serious lymitating their rights? There has been a lot of talk in the CVM reports about institutions, about appointments of magistrates, about the fight against corruption. That is very good, but we have not seen anything about human rights violations, about the secret protocols between the intelligence services and the institutions of the judiciary. Under these protocols, millions of Romanians were under the monitoring of the secret services in the name of the fight against corruption. There are court decisions showing how evidence was falsified, how transcripts of intercepts were altered to create guilt, or how witnesses were blackmailed into making false testimony. Nothing about these things in the CVM reports. That does not mean - or does that mean, more to the point, that this mechanism has failed the purpose for which it was created, and I am formally asking to be told who drafted the CVM reports, who provided the data and omitted, negligently or out of bad faith, these unthinkable realities in the European Union. If we are honest, we must start from these serious abuses, because they are taking place within the European Union.  The Venice Commission said that in the Soviet system, the Public Prosecutor's Office was a powerful means of controlling the judiciary. Over the past four years, more than three thousand magistrates have been investigated by DNA. Basically, half of the romanian magistrates had for years cases in which they were probably influenced to give solutions established outside the courtroom. I'm not just saying it. I say this with great concern the associations of magistrates in Romania. Through such forged cases, a judge of the Constitutional Court, a vice-president of the Superior Council of Magistracy, four judges of the High Court, several judges of higher courts, a prosecutor general, a head of the Superior Prosecutor's Office were removed from office. In the end, all were acquitted or files were closed, but they were removed.  The new laws of justice restore independence to judges. No political decision-makers no longer intervene in the appointment and revocation of judges. Independence is total, in no way restricted, and I assure you that we have good faith and will take into account the recommendations of the Venice Commission. There is, however, also a good part of this meeting. Today I informed you all, officially, about the abuses in Romania. From now on, these things cannot be ignored, justice in Romania can no longer be talked about without talking about these abuses, unless a political game is made with no connection to justice. Ask yourself why these things have been hidden from you. Why didn't they tell you anything if everything was legitimate and legal? Ask yourself these questions before you raise the stone against Romania. About the August 10th rally, I'll just say a few words. I see that the Romanian Gendarmerie is accused of intervening at an unauthorized rally against violent demonstrators who tried to occupy the Government building. We have not seen the same position in relation to last week's event in Brussels or with other rallies in France, Spain, Germany, the United Kingdom, when law enforcement intervened with exactly the same means and procedures as those used in Romania. I cannot accept in any way that the Romanian Gendarmerie should be accused of actions and procedures carried out all over Europe. Finally, I ask you this: do not prohibit Romania from what is allowed in other Eu states and do not allow unacceptable things to happen in Romania in other Member States. We want to be your partners, but we want to be your equal partners. No one will ever be able to return Romania from its European journey.

We are not here to be a court, that is not the role of Parliament, and it never should be. We are here to discuss issues that affect all of us, no matter where we come from – and the independence of the judicial power and the rule of law are indeed European issues of that kind. When Romania joined the Union in 2007 Romanian judges became European judges. This means that they have to defend not only Romanian law but also European law, and that we have to defend them. Europe is not a single market only. We are also a community of shared values and, when our countries signed the Treaties, we signed up to those values too – to all of them. So this is not an east-west issue, this is a European issue. I am telling you this as a representative for Spain, a southern country that has had its own democratic transition. We know how difficult the shift is from dictatorship to democracy. It takes time, it requires sacrifices, it causes pain, it is a difficult journey. That is why we cannot understand the changes proposed by your Government, which are putting in danger the balance of powers and the independence of justice in Romania. That is why we cannot understand the extreme reaction of your Government on that tragic day of 10 August, when thousands of Romanians from the diaspora were trying simply to be heard. And it is why we cannot understand the silence and the complicity of those who are concerned about the rule of law in some countries but not in others. Of course, you can ignore our criticism, but you should never ignore the voice of your own people. Romanians fought for their liberties against communism. They tore down a tyranny and built up a democracy. They are a brave and a decent people, Prime Minister, and you are ignoring them. Tell me, why don’t you want to listen to your people? Tell me, what interests are hidden behind the actions of your Government? Tell me, what are you afraid of? That’s what this Parliament wants and needs to know. Listen to the people’s voice, Prime Minister. They just want integrity, transparency and justice. They just want to have a better future in their own country – not outside it. Nothing more, but nothing less. Prime Minister, you have two options: you can listen to this Parliament, you can listen to the Commission, you can listen to the Romanian Parliament, you can listen to your people; or you can ignore all the democratic controls. But, with all due respect, this Parliament will remain and it will wait by the side of the noble and proud people of Romania. There is not another option for us. You should understand that.

The nub of my message today is that both problems need to be tackled, and that Romania has to end the bad tradition of what was the Securitate, a Secret Service instrumentalised by one side of the political establishment to hit the other side. This has to stop, Prime Minister. Also, a totally inappropriate reaction – weakening the fight against high-level corruption, undermining even the prosecution of it – is the way that Orbán and Kaczyński lead their countries. That is not the way that we liberals should govern. Not in our name and certainly not with our name! So, may I give you one piece of advice, Prime Minister? Don’t follow the bad Hungarian and Polish examples.

The efforts to move towards democracy and civil liberties cannot be overestimated. It’s harsh but Romania did it. Democratic institutions have been developed and Romania has joined the European Union. It is therefore even more worrying, Prime Minister, to see that there is a real backlash. With the reforms of the Romanian Criminal Code, your government is making it legal for officials to abuse their power. Your government will allow convicted criminals to get away with their stolen money and not have it confiscated. You are de facto legalising corruption with that reform.  Corruption makes people lose trust in the state and in democracy. Money is being diverted from the benefit of the many to the pockets of the few. Romanian citizens now lose five times more money to corruption than the state spends on hospitals and healthcare. Romanians do care. They took to the streets to ask for democracy, for good governance from you, Prime Minister, as is their right, as is the right of any European citizen. But, instead of listening to them, you actually sent the police in to attack them, tear-gassing an entire public square.  Even further, your government is now planning to reduce the freedom of assembly, making it obligatory to have an authorisation. Romania would be the first European Union Member State to require an authorisation. Do you really want to go that low? Colleagues, Commissioner, Romanian citizens are asking for freedom, nothing else. Freedom from corruption, freedom of assembly, freedom from discrimination. Europe is built on that freedom. As someone who grew up in the Eastern bloc, I can testify to how important that freedom is. That freedom, democracy and civil liberties are being called into question in more and more Member States. As European institutions, as European deputies, we have to defend the rights of Romanian citizens as well as the rights of every European citizen, be it in Hungary, be it in Poland, be it in Austria, be it anywhere. There is no second—class citizenship. Let’s not wait until it’s too late. Let’s not wait until we have to start yet another Article 7 procedure. Now is the time to change. Now is the time to act.

In view of the time I have, I shall concentrate on a few points. Firstly, the fight against corruption and independent justice is crucial to the Rule of Law, but we should remember that the protest is extremely fragmented. For some, corruption leads to inequality, for others, hampers the neoliberal agenda and justifies more powers than services. The result is a false unity, it is the strength but also the weakness of the movement. Second, in the movement there are dark sides. PSD supporters are disdained as old, stupid, rural. In fact, opposition to this government fails to convince the poorest and most marginalised electorate living in the countryside. Let us not forget the marginalised in the single market. Thirdly, the movement not only fights corruption, it also includes battles against the constitutionalisation of the family as an exclusive union between men and women. Our Charter of Rights neither prohibits nor imposes the granting of marital status to same-sex unions.  Fourthly, the defence of the Rule of Law is only right, but I would ask you, Vice-President, to use it also for countries that regularly save money. I have listened to you in recent days about the August demonstrations in Bucharest. He rightly spoke of shock images, of peaceful protesters being beaten by the police, of inquiries to be opened immediately. There were no such strong words when the peaceful pro-independence voters in Catalonia were beaten and their leaders imprisoned.

We are concerned about what we read about what is happening in Romania. I fear that the reforms of the Criminal Code carried out by the current government may not only undermine the independence of the judiciary in the country and encourage corruption, but also weaken judicial cooperation in criminal matters with other EU countries, potentially making Romania a safe haven to continue its illicit affairs with impunity. I am referring to the law that shortens the statute of limitations to one year, effectively leaving the perpetrators of serious crimes, such as corruption and money laundering, unpunished, but also the measures repealing and criminalising abuse of office, up to the removal of the ban on holding public office for those convicted of corruption or abuse of office and the decriminalisation of the crime of corruption.  We, in Italy, for example, want to do exactly the opposite. We cannot allow those who commit such serious crimes to go unpunished. We want a reform of the statute of limitations by suspending at the first instance or by referring them to court in order to prevent criminals from benefiting from the length of trials in order to guarantee impunity. The fight against corruption in public administration is also a priority of our government. We want to establish the 'daspo' for the corrupt, which means that a person definitively convicted of corruption will no longer be able to deal with the public administration. In the anti-money laundering directive for which I was rapporteur, we succeeded in introducing the penalty ancillary to the ban on taking up public office and running for election for those who have been definitively convicted of money laundering offences. That is our objective: to keep criminals out of the public administration. That must be the objective, Prime Minister, of Romania and of the whole of the European Union. The Commission must ensure that the Rule of Law Treaties are respected and that the Member States ensure the correct transposition of these important legislative instruments at European Union level, such as the directive on combating money laundering through criminal law, which I have mentioned, the fifth anti-money laundering directive, which contains important provisions on politically exposed persons, which I understand have been skilfully omitted by the Romanian Government. , which will be the commission's responsibility to assess its lawfulness.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 12, "date": "2018-10-03.json", "name": "Nicolas BAY", "mepid": "124760", "text": "  on behalf of the ENF group.

In fact, what the Commission does not support is that people make democratic decisions and are consulted on issues that it would like to decide for them. Commissioner Timmermans acknowledged on Monday night that family policies are the responsibility of the Member States, for this ardent support of the LGBTI lobby, etc., we do not have the right to be against marriage for same-sex couples.

Romania does not accept to be a currency under any conditions and with any other country. We understand that there have been concerns about certain Member States, but we are asking - and this has also been underlined by the First Vice-President of the European Commission - that each country be judged on its own merits. We in Romania are trying at this moment that all things that have held a dark past, a perverted judicial system, former ministers of justice who have turned prosecutors into their own servants, those who have thus succeeded in turning a respectable institution of the judge into timorous persons, into prosecutors who have been forced to make files on command , become an independent system, controlled only by the Superior Council of Magistracy and in which no one, ever, is blackmailed.

Everyone needs to know that the times that have been can no longer return, with all the desperate efforts that these real Romanians in the room, such as Preda and Macovei, are making, and who have managed to turn justice Romanian into a disgrace.

I've seen things I've considered, constructive things. I wanted a constructive dialogue, but I realized that there is a lot of misinformation and I am not accusing those who have said these things, but those who are behind this misinformation. Mr Pons - yes, we must defend the citizens. That's what I'm asking for, and I'm not going to ignore the voice of the people, and witness is the broad popular support that we have in Romania. I listen to everyone in good faith and I want a constructive dialogue, but a dialogue that is right for Romania and for the European Union. Mrs. Macovei, I know about your misinformation. This government that you criticize so often has brought economic growth of 7%, has increased the standard of living of Romanians and, therefore, Romanians love it. It does not honor you to bring the internal political struggle into the European Parliament, it is a lack of respect for the Romanian people. I'm not going to be able to answer everyone, it would be a long time, but I want to give some more answers. Yes, Romania is divided, and I want Romania to be united, but we have to take care of one thing - and a pro-European country tells you: do we also want a divided Europe? Yes, we have dialogue, but let us not try, regardless of the political group, to challenge each other. Together we must draw, shape the future of the European Union, starting next year. Let us see the things that unite us and put aside the things that divide us. What we have to do, we will straighten out, we will have dialogue, I am willing to dialogue. Mr Corrao, justice reform, justice laws are initiated in Parliament. It is Parliament who is democratically elected, it is the expression of the will of the people. Do you see that there is misinformation here, too? Because they pointed the finger at the government. No - these laws were initiated in Parliament.  Mr Rebega, do not bring the political struggle into the European Parliament. It is not fair to Romanians, perhaps you should think that you have run on the lists of the Social Democratic Party, but I do not judge you, because I do not have the right, will judge those who supported you and whom you have now disappointed.  Ma'am, in't Veld, thank you so much for your suggestions, I'll take into account your suggestions. The European Parliament is not my enemy, I have been an MEP for nine years and I will never deviate from European values. Maybe not all things are right, maybe not all things are as they should be, but I am convinced that a constructive dialogue and the fact that you can listen to all parties and we will take less account of those who do not want to be understanding and dialogue in the European Parliament, those who come with misinformation, those who have always misinformed, not only now - I think things can get better. First Vice-President Timmermans, we will certainly take into account the recommendations of the Venice Commission. Today, the Minister of Justice, present with me, will go to the Venice Commission. Romania is a pro-European country and certainly will not deviate from the pro-European road - and tells you a former colleague of yours.

It was not just corrupt because of the corruption, it was morally corrupt. The nation had been under the direction of a morally deeply corrupt dictator and his system. If you take that, 30 years ago, into account and then see where Romania is today, huge progress has clearly been made, apart from the party-political composition of the government. Over those decades, huge progress was made. So why am I so worried today? Because, in the final stretch of this long and painful marathon, we now risk not reaching the finishing line to ensure that the fight against corruption cannot be reversed and that the rule of law is irreversible. To go in the other direction would be to undo some of the most important achievements by the Romanian people in ridding themselves of this horrible past. Someone who comes from a country like mine cannot even begin to imagine how difficult this must have been for the Romanian people. So, if we now speak out and speak up, it is because we are doing it for the Romanian people, who want to fulfil their European destiny by being sure that the system they live in – the country they live in – is a democracy based on the rule of law, with full respect for human rights, and where corruption is combated effectively and rooted out of society. I want to remind the Members of this House who have not made reference to the Cooperation and Verification Mechanism (CVM) report that, yes indeed, the recommendations of the Venice Commission are important and we will work on them, but please also look at the recommendations made in the Commission’s CVM report of last year and the recommendations we will be making in the CVM report next month. I think they constitute a good road map for ensuring that reform is irreversible. I will continue the dialogue with the Romanian Government. Because of time, I could not be precise on every question and critique we have on the proposed and already promulgated laws, but I will be very meticulous and precise in putting my questions to the Romanian Government, and in inviting them to answer those questions and to continue the dialogue so that we can resolve these issues. Let me be very clear: what is at stake is of huge importance for the future of our European Union, but what is at stake is of even greater importance for the future of the Romanian people. So, if the Commission needs to be brutal in our assessment we will be brutal. If we need to use other instruments at our disposal, we will use them. This is not a threat. This is just the Commission setting out what our role is and pointing out that we are the guardian of the Treaty and we need to take this role very seriously indeed. If I may make a political remark: sometimes I have the impression – to put it in the words of the immortal Yogi Berra – that it’s ‘déjà vu all over again’. In response to criticism, two things always emerge: firstly the cry of ‘Double standards’, which is a sort of knee jerk reaction; and secondly the assertion that ‘It’s not an attack on the government, it’s an attack on the nation (or on the people).’ I hope I have made clear today that we have made a clinical assessment of the situation: that we have analysed precisely the proposed changes in the legislation, that we are doing this on behalf of the Romanian people, not against the Romanian people, and that we look at each and every Member State in exactly the same way. (Applause) We look at the facts, while also recognising that every situation is different. We are not putting Member States all in one batch, we are looking at every Member State on the basis of the specific issues in that Member State, and I really want us to be successful here. I urge the Romanian Government, once again: keep the dialogue open and listen to our recommendations – they have been put down on paper in a spirit of cooperation, and of keeping Romania on the right European track.

I am honoured to be back in this great House. I would like to thank President Tajani for organising the debates on the future of Europe and for giving me the opportunity to participate. Today, we can all together congratulate our German friends, and all Europeans on the occasion of German Unity Day. For my generation, this day symbolises not only the end of the division of Germany, but it also heralded the liberation of Eastern Europe and the start of the eastward enlargement of the European Union. It made possible the starting of accession talks 20 years ago. It has been an amazing journey for our country, for Estonia. The role of the European Parliament in it has been remarkable. I would like to thank you, honourable Members of the European Parliament, for your support.  This year, Estonia celebrates the hundredth anniversary of our statehood. Like Germans in the east of the country, we had to wait and dream for 50 years about freedom, rule of law and justice. I very clearly remember watching Finnish TV, as this was our only connection to the free world. This is why I, from the bottom of my heart, dislike borders in Europe: those still existing for Member States who have fulfilled all criteria to join Schengen; those that have been partly reintroduced following the migration crisis – although I understand the concerns back then – and those that still may be erected, should we collectively fail in Brexit negotiations, which I refuse to accept. Against this background, it is not hard to understand why Estonians have such a special emotional connection to Europe.  I can only agree with the Irish singer Bono that Europe is not only an idea, but also a feeling and a destiny, because, and I quote, our ‘values and aspirations make Europe so much more than just a geography. They go to the core of who we are as human beings, and who we want to be’.  Compared to its share of territory and population in the world, Europe is small and diverse. But by sharing our sovereignty and pooling our strength, by having common policies, we have been able to make a difference in the world. I believe that we all have shared interests in rules-based and effective multilateral order, built on liberal values and democratic principles.  We also have common interests in open, free and fair global markets. It is what the world expects from us and it is what our citizens want. It is Europe that protects our values and freedoms from the turbulence of today’s world. Europe’s geographical ties and our global interdependence as the world’s largest trader dictate that it is vital to have a world that functions. We Europeans are all stronger together, and I hope that we will spare no effort in securing our collective interests and the values in the world.  Europe’s core strength is its diversity. Being European adds a rich layer to one’s identity. Nothing represents this better than the fate of small nations in the European family. I would like to paraphrase former Estonian President Lennart Meri, who once said that small nations in Europe are the glue, the oil and the cement in the European construction. Therefore, allow me to express here modest enthusiasm when it comes to grand institutional designs in Europe, which could lead to a lesser role for smaller nations in our common institutions. Less diversity will also result in less Europe. Today, in this limited timeframe, please allow me to focus on only some of the areas essential for Europe according to Estonia. Firstly, preserving unity within the EU. The key for our common future is our ability to keep the EU united and move forward with the EU’s positive agenda. There is a saying that the best way to predict the future is to create it. Future is not something abstract or another Treaty-change. We are building our future every day. We are doing this by providing answers to the concrete concerns of our citizens, and, where possible, building connections that bring Europeans closer together – human, physical and professional connections.  Europeans also expect us to tackle transformational challenges that are too big for a single Member State, such as European defence, climate change and digital transformation. We will also have to find answers to global population growth and migration, triggered by these changes. I therefore hope for an ambitious Multiannual Financial Framework that reflects these challenges. A new Multiannual Financial Framework is actually the best indicator of how we will see our common future.  I agree with President Macron that the European Union depends on the feeling of unity. But as we know, unity does not have to mean uniformity. Sometimes we should simply recognise our different views, without compromising on the same values. I find different levels of direct taxes in Member States to be perfectly normal. I also feel that, with a European budget of the size of only 1% of GNI, fundamental decisions of a redistributive nature can be made at national or even local level through social dialogue.  At the same time, we must have a credible framework that is vital for our common future, like the spending of 2% of our GDP to keep Europe safe or aiming at an expenditure level of 3% of GDP on research and innovation. Also, we expect Europe to be big in big things, but at the same time it has to be excellent in details. Without standards and fine details, the Single Market or Capital Markets Union would simply not function.  We are now trying to find consensus when deciding on the core elements on how to manage migration. It is difficult, but we all realise that short-term measures will only bring short-term solutions. All of us need to show solidarity in the way that suits best our common purpose and each Member State’s particularities. The key in decreasing irregular migration is to work with third countries. We must use all the instruments that our trade, visa and development policies offer.  The new Africa-EU alliance proposed by President Juncker to support jobs, skills and private investments in Africa definitely serves long-term effects. Estonia pulls its weight here. Last November I signed an e-government cooperation agreement between Estonia and the African Union. Estonia is geographically distant from Africa, but the digital world does not recognise distance.  Secondly, it is important to maintain and strengthen the EU’s influence in the global economy. I cannot imagine a better example than the Single Market to prove that we are bigger and stronger together. But it still remains unfinished. Take, for example, the field of services: while the sector continues to grow unlike anything else, especially in the digital domain, we are far from using its full cross-border potential. For example, public services remain essentially national.  My good colleague, Mark Rutte, called the services market the ‘elephant in the room’ when standing in front of you here in June. I understand him well, and I always worry: when did talking about the completion of the Single Market, our economic engine, become a taboo? It is high time that we set ourselves new goals in building the Single Market. ‘Success in creating effective artificial intelligence could be the biggest event in the history of our civilisation. Or the worst. We just don’t know’ – a famous quote by Stephen Hawking. In the field of artificial intelligence, the race is definitely on. Everybody is keen on exploring and developing strategies and reaping the benefits while we are still struggling to make it work. As it moves from the age of invention into the age of implementation of AI, Europe has to reinforce our values and lead technological change in the public and private sectors. We need progress in the areas of the free movement of data, the data economy and artificial intelligence.  In the world of hybrid warfare, cybercrime and fake news, security in cyberspace should come by design and go hand in hand with emerging technologies. We need to build data integrity into systems, to be able to guarantee that the sensors, inputs and computing of the robotic systems are not compromised. We need to develop strong digital identities, in order to be able to distinguish real persons from fake unfriendly bots. We need to establish practice with a strong professional spirit on keeping AI open and transparent.  I am very pleased with the Commission proposals resulting from the Tallinn Digital Summit last year, especially our commitment to invest in technological and social readiness throughout the new budget. It is time to adopt proposals to complete the Digital Single Market and enable digital transformation. The world will not wait.  Thirdly, it is important to maintain and enhance internal and external security. All Eurobarometer surveys have shown that our people are most concerned about security. Our long-term focus should be on prevention of crime and illegal activities at our borders. A high level of border and customs surveillance ensures security throughout Europe. Common standards and investments into both technical and operational features in border surveillance are required. Only then can we realistically assess what to expect from the 10 000 European border guards that President Juncker has proposed.  Also, effective control of people and goods at our external borders demands reliable databases that can communicate with each other. We do not need to collect the same data in different information systems, we just have to make them able to share the information. Interoperability of EU-wide databases by 2020 is the only way forward. We must also explore how to develop better synergies between the internal security, border control and customs information systems. Similarly, Romania and Bulgaria would also benefit from membership in the Schengen area. The call for European nations to show that they take their security seriously has been around for a long time, and clearly it will not go away. This is not merely a question about maintaining or increasing our military capabilities. This is ultimately a question about how serious Europe is about its role in its immediate neighbourhood and in the world in general. How serious are we about our transatlantic partnership with the United States? A Europe that protects has to maintain a strong relationship with our global partners. In addition to the European defence cooperation, it is vital that we preserve transatlantic unity. Europe cannot deal with global security risks alone.  For the European Union, this means going beyond its current role as a regulatory superpower and starting to support the development and deployment of more traditional instruments of foreign and security policy. Therefore, increased defence cooperation among the EU Member States is very welcome. This will lead to increased defence spending and to a larger number of commonly usable capabilities. At the same time, NATO will remain the bedrock of collective defence in Europe. Our aim should be a mutually reinforcing relationship between the EU and NATO. The final point I would like to make is that we need to strengthen the European feeling and fight populism. We are working hard in the EU to make our citizens feel well. However, in a recent youth forum in Estonia, students said that even their teachers were not able to explain the European Union. Upcoming European Parliament elections give us politicians a perfect opportunity to explain our decisions. The European Union has brought so many opportunities that people nowadays seem to take for granted. We have to speak about the benefits of the Single Market and single currency to our businesses, of free movement to our people, and of ERASMUS to our students. I very much appreciate the structured dialogues on the future of Europe, initiated by the French President, Emmanuel Macron; the President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker; and the President of this great House, Antonio Tajani. Working for a better Europe that benefits citizens is daily work. This also includes taking responsibility for the decisions and compromises made in the EU, and showing very clearly that we own these decisions.  The action taken after the Bratislava and Rome Summits already seems to have had positive results and to enjoy the support of the people. More than two—thirds of EU citizens feel that EU membership has been beneficial to their country – the best results since 1983.  To summarise, external pressure and crises have always pushed the EU forward and motivated Member States and institutions to cooperate. Our common response to the Russian aggression against Ukraine, to the Bataclan terrorist attack, or, if we will, to the eurozone crisis, is an example of solidarity and an example of common values.  The European Union as a community of values – and, of course, shared interests – has to have the means to stand up for the respect of individual freedoms and fundamental rights, for a multilateral and rules-based order and to tackle the challenges to our security, peace and wellbeing. I believe that our citizens understand this, as we engage in the negotiations over the next Multiannual Financial Framework. The fundamentals of the European Union are constantly being disputed by the people, by the Member States, and by third states. Our Union is therefore politically fragile. This means that we need a self-confident, reassuring Union that protects its citizens and its members.  We also need citizens and Member States that are passionate about the Union and everything it stands for as a family of peoples and states. There must be more of us. I really hope that 10 years from now, I can listen to a colleague from any of the current candidate countries in the same capacity as I am standing here today. I would now like to conclude in my mother tongue, Estonian. Kallid parlamendiliikmed! Ma tahan teid tänada selle eest, et Euroopa olevik ja Euroopa tulevik ei jäta teid kedagi ükskõikseks.

Mr President, speaking on behalf of President Juncker, let me start by thanking the Prime Minister for taking part in this debate and for his vision on the future of our Union.  As you know, this is a special year for Estonia. In February, we marked 100 years since independence. Today, Estonia is a modern country, flourishing at the heart of Europe. It may be one of the smaller Member States, but it is an example for others to follow. Estonia always fights to take its rightful place at the heart of our European Union, whether Schengen, the euro or on defence. It always seeks compromise and works for a unity. We saw this repeatedly during the first—ever Estonian EU Presidency last year. All of this shows that Estonia will continue to be a leader in the European Union in the future.  Nowhere is this more important than when it comes to making our people safe. Defence and security are not abstract terms for Estonians. They are daily and visible preoccupations. This is why we have invested so much in the EU’s partnership with NATO, which remains the cornerstone of our defence. Estonia knows first—hand the true value of this partnership. As I speak, Estonian troops are in Afghanistan, Mali, Kosovo, Lebanon and other countries, while the presence of NATO forces in Estonia continues to give us peace of my mind.  Estonia is also leading the way through its participation in permanent structured cooperation. Its planned project with Finland, Latvia and others to develop unmanned land systems is a perfect example of how we can achieve more by working together and how we can bring digital solutions to the battlefield to save lives. We need to back this up with the resources to match.  As part of our proposals for a new long—term European budget, we have designated EUR 13 billion for the European Defence Fund. I know we can rely on Estonia’s full support for these proposals.  All of our proposals for the Multiannual Financial Framework focus on areas where we can achieve more together to build a stronger Europe. We have seen the potential of targeted investments. Rail Baltica is a good example. This project connects Europeans and creates new opportunities for people and businesses from Helsinki to Tallinn, through Riga and Vilnius, and eventually to Warsaw. This is the largest infrastructure project in the Baltics – EUR 5 billion invested in the region.  These projects cannot happen overnight or within one financial period. In that spirit, we have proposed to increase the funding for the Connecting Europe facility by 24%, to focus on transport, digital and energy infrastructure. This will allow major projects to become a reality, such as the synchronisation of the Baltic countries’ electricity systems and the Baltic connector gas pipeline between Finland and Estonia.  The same applies to digital, which is in the DNA of Estonia. It now needs to become part of Europe’s too, in digital infrastructure, e-government and digital skills. This is what the EU leaders endorsed at the Tallinn Digital Summit. This is why we are fully focused on building a true digital single market. I rely on the support of this House, as well as the Council, to agree on the remaining proposals as quickly as possible. We need them urgently to build Europe’s digital future.  The European Commission has proposed a new digital Europe programme worth EUR 9 billion to support Europe’s digital transformation. This will be especially important when it comes to implementing the Tallinn Declaration on e—government. All of this shows the importance of agreeing on the new long—term budget as quickly as possible. As President Juncker said in this very room only a few weeks ago, there would be no better message, no greater symbol to show Europeans that their Union will invest in the future and take its destiny into its own hands.  Honourable Members, Prime Minister, only a strong and united Europe can protect our citizens, make the most of the new digital world and create new opportunities for its people and businesses alike. But to do so, we will have to work together and work for a compromise. We will probably have to do less, be more focussed on the things that matter, and do things more efficiently. As ever, Estonia is showing the way. The motto for its Presidency ‘unity through balance’ shows us the way forward for our European Union. It is time to take it.

Prime Minister, it is good to have you here because we can be inspired by the history of Estonia and by the strength of its people. In the PPE Group, we are lucky to have one of your compatriots within our family. He is only one but he counts for ten. I want to thank our friend Tunne Kelam, who is with us. He fought the Soviet occupation at first hand and was not afraid to stand up against injustice despite the great risks. Together, he and all the people of Estonia achieved a lot: a Europe that fights back for what is right, a Europe that is strongly together against all the odds and a Europe that sticks to its values. Europe can learn a lot from the Estonians’ spirit. Estonia is a small, innovative and courageous country. If there is no Europe which cares about the small Member States, there is no Europe at all. You said it, Prime Minister: diversity is what Europe is all about. Estonia was reborn from the ashes. It was one of several victims of nationalism and brutalism. The Hitler—Stalin Pact meant oppression for more than 50 years. For Estonia, a united Europe means, first of all, freedom and security. Today, with Vladimir Putin on one side, Estonia needs a strong Europe; and with Donald Trump on the other side, Estonia also needs a self-confident Europe, which cares about security. In the same way that Europe is sticking to NATO, we also have to strengthen our defence union. You mentioned this in your speech, Prime Minister. In the future it could probably be a fascinating idea to guarantee the future security of the Baltic states with European troops present there. Sadly, Estonia was also one of the first countries to know a brand new type of warfare. Back in 2007 it withstood one of the first cyberattacks. Today Estonia is a leading nation in cybersecurity at European level and also globally. Its experience could also be a starting point from which to create in the future a cyber-rearguard, defending the whole European Union in response to these modern challenges. Today I want to focus on the question of the digital revolution. The new technologies are improving dramatically and we can all see this. Estonia has done a great job: 99% of all public services are already e—services; and, when you bear in mind that it is a country with six times more start-ups per citizen than the EU average, we can only congratulate Estonia on what it has done in this regard.  (Applause) Estonia’s ambitions are a role model for Europe. Innovation is key and it is part of the European DNA. We now need to give a proper answer as to what our share is in this digitalisation, because it’s obvious that the USA is more of a frontrunner than we are, as Europeans, in the digital revolution. That is why we need to consider and discuss how we can now organise and use the opportunity of the next wave in the digital transformation which is ahead of us. Let me underline one important point for us. We don’t think that creating legislation on copyright or data protection means creating a burden for the innovative sector. For us it’s clear that this is about creating a level playing field for a modern innovation policy. A second important point is that we have to take people’s concerns people seriously. When a waiter feels that an iPad is taking over his job or a truck driver fears the self-driving vehicles which will be on our streets in the future, then we have to give an answer in terms of a digital social market economy. How we organise this is one of the big challenges ahead of us. The third thing I want to underline is the gap between advanced regions and those which are still catching up. Improving the digital infrastructure in the European Union is a key issue for keeping Europe together. That’s why I think we must invest a lot in the next EU Multiannual Financial Framework and especially in the idea of broadband for everyone. Because technology does not shape the people – it is the people who shape technology – our European way of life has all the ingredients for us to succeed: firm values, a fair social market economy, creative capacities, lively regions and stable democracies. That is why we need to start now to build up this digital revolution with the European spirit. The future of Europe will not be written only through interinstitutional reforms. Investing in innovation and digital infrastructure to ultimately improve European citizens’ quality of life is what matters most. The PPE Group is ready to stand with all those who want to go into the future.

Let me say, Prime Minister, that it was a pleasure to listen to you. You gave us the impression that Estonia seems to be a great place to live. We can also congratulate you on the Presidency and the great results that you delivered for Europe. Together with your coalition partners, especially with our sister party, the Social Democrats, you achieved a lot in your country. You have already made Estonia a fairer society and a better place for its citizens, and we would like to congratulate you on that. We share the same idea that Europe and our countries have to be locations for the best of the many and not only for the few. We are dreaming and we are working for a Europe that is sustainable: sustainable in its economy, in its environment and its social structures, where everybody – every woman and every man – regardless of their income can count on the support of their public institutions and where everybody can breathe fresh and clean air. You showed in a small country what can be done for instance in public transport. Public transport is free everywhere there, and I am dreaming of that in my home country and everywhere in the European Union. Let us build on your experience and let us try to make that the common experience. You invested in children, you invested in teachers; This is the leading issue for what we have to follow in the European Union, and if you look at how much you spent on the well—being of families, many other countries could copy that.  Let me say something thoughtful today, on the day we celebrate the Day of German Unity in Germany. We in Germany are celebrating the fall of the Wall, we in Europe are celebrating the fall of the Iron Curtain. We have in our minds and hearts how much joy people have been with these events and the hope for freedom and democracy associated with them. Today, however, we must be concerned. We must be concerned about new walls, about new border fences in reality, in our hearts and in our heads. Borders between those who think they can achieve anything and those who feel forgotten and believe that they will not be taken away, who have no chance; Borders between those who make a truly decent effort every day to contribute to the common good and those who shamelessly exploit it; Borders between those who rush and intrigue nationalistally and those who, as refugees, are victims of war and as refugees of violence. Let me remind you of a great Frenchman, Mr Mitterrand, who said in this Parliament in 1995 that nationalism will become war if we do not oppose it. That is the message for Europe that we must follow. And that is the mandate for today's discussion. I have hope. This is your experience, that is what you bring with you when they speak from the heart of your people. I hope that you will help us to defend a Europe without walls, a Europe without new border fences, a Europe of social cohesion. Only if our societies are socially together will there be the freedoms that we want and a Europe that is right-wing radicalism, fascism, which rejects new borders and protects democracy, including in your next elections, including in the next European elections.

Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating Mr Welcome here, Prime Minister Ratas. It's nice that you're taking the time to visit us. We have heard many positive voices about EU membership. In this house, we believe in diversity. Therefore, I will deliver a partly different picture of membership.  I am Swedish and come from Sweden. In 1994, we had our referendum on membership when we were actually awash with the 'yes' side's campaign because they had the financial muscle to run a real campaign. The no-side was more of a nonprofit. We were inundated with everything that would be great about the EU. There wasn't a voice talking about what was supposed to be the back of a membership. We joined, and in 1995 we joined the EU. In fact, I voted in favour myself at the time. I saw clear advantages in being able to trade with the whole of Europe. What I never saw and could not foresee was surely the development that this house itself would take, where one more and more eats up national self-determination. We have concerns today. We have a transport industry threatened by cheating companies operating under eu rules. We cannot control this ourselves in Sweden because eu rules automatically exceed our own rules. At the moment have at a border control. Otherwise, we have no border controls. We no longer have control over what people are in our country. We have very much uncontrolled immigration. Thank God we never joined the euro project! All the experts explained that if Sweden did not join the euro, a disaster was expected. I think that we, the Swedish people, are happy today that we never listened to the experts, because it has been good for Sweden in many places to stand outside. For Estonia, membership has had a completely different effect. For you, it has been very positive. Estonia is a very beautiful country that I have visited several times, and which is very much reminiscent of Sweden. I am glad that you have so many positive experiences with membership. However, as things stand today for my country, Sweden, in this cooperation, I would like to renegotiate our agreement. I would like to renegotiate it just as I and all other Swedes and Europeans are renegotiating their agreements, for example with the electricity supplier, with the bank, where they have their mortgages, or with all the institutions or associations that it has joined but is no longer fully satisfied with membership. However, it is very difficult to bring about such a renegotiation. Sweden is a small country – we have only 20 members in this House and 14 votes out of 340 in the Council of Ministers. However, I would like such a renegotiation to be achieved because I do not like the idea of all the Member States being messed up in exactly the same form within Europe. I want cooperation with our friends and neighbours, and I want it to be under the maintenance of national sovereignty.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sv", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 71, "date": "2018-10-03.json", "name": "Guy VERHOFSTADT", "mepid": "97058", "text": "  on behalf of the ALDE Group. – Mr President, I would ask the Prime Minister just to look at the approval. Jüri, everybody praises you and finds Estonia fantastic, a magnificent country. I always say yes, that’s normal, it’s because the Liberals are always in power – naturally – in Estonia! You, with the Centre Party, you are even leading the opposition with the Reform Party. So I think the fact that everything is so good in Estonia has something to do with the strong position of our two liberal parties. But I don’t have to say that as you are better aware of it than me.  I want to come to another point – and it is the last time that I will come back to this – which is what Mr Hunt said about the comparison between the European Union and the Soviet Union. You have to know that the two first reactions didn’t come from us. The two first reactions game from the Lithuanian Commissioner, and came from the Latvian Ambassador, by the way, in the UK. I think that is not by accident. They explained how the Soviets killed, deported, exiled, imprisoned hundreds of thousands of Baltic citizens, especially also Estonian citizens. They both explained how, in contrast, the European Union brought their countries prosperity, equality, growth, respect. I think that both of them gave Mr Jeremy Hunt a stark lesson in history in 200 characters, so to speak.  That is exactly, also, what you said in your intervention, Jüri, here in Parliament: the Baltic States, more than anyone else, I should say, in the European Union, needs a united Europe, a strong Europe, more united than today and stronger than today. A Europe that is also capable – let’s be very clear about this – to stand up against Vladimir Putin, because if you look a little bit at the last decade in the European Union, we have seen a decade of Russian aggression. The list is long – the partial occupation of Georgia, the annexation of Crimea, the war in eastern Ukraine, the shooting down of MH 17, the cyberattacks against our institutions, against the German Bundestag even, the money laundering through our banks, the chemical attacks in Salisbury. It’s a long list in one decade. So what is next? Next may be to corrupt our ballot boxes in the elections in 2019.  That is the most important point that you have made, Jüri, in your intervention, for the moment, our only response is in fact sanctions, and then there are the counter measures by Putin, and everything goes on and on and on. I think that will be not enough in the future and certainly not enough also to defend the sovereignty of all our European countries.  I think that we need something more powerful, which is credibility in foreign policy and credibility in our defence policy, in our defence capabilities. A little bit in the words of Theodore Roosevelt who said ‘speak softly but carry a big stick’. That was his opinion. We in Europe for the moment are doing exactly the opposite. We preach loudly on human rights, on democracy, but we carry no stick at all, in Europe, not even a small twig I should say. So, my appeal to you – and in your intervention you have mentioned this – is that the first thing we do when we talk about the future of Europe, is to stop and abandon naivety and our self—imposed weakness and to show you have to build up a position of power. That means a lot of things. First of all to abolish the unanimity rule in the Council. Certainly in the field of foreign policy. You cannot have a foreign policy if you continue with the unanimity rule. Defence capabilities. Let’s build a European defence community, with intelligence services that are capable and have the instruments and giving also, for example, to Europol a real mandate and not what it is today – a post box between Member States, but to make it a real federal police force that can conduct investigations on the whole European territory.  That’s my conclusion. Peace through strength, you know this word. Peace through strength – that is how the West brought down the Soviet Union in 1991. Well peace through strength is what our Union needs again today. Thank you, Jüri, because in your interventions and proposals you have led the way.

Mr President, I would say to the Prime Minister that it is always a pleasure for us to engage in dialogue with representatives of the Baltic States. Estonia was the last of the three to complete its first Presidency of the Council.  Prime Minister, your work, like that of your predecessors, demonstrated not only your strong commitment to our common goals, but also that leadership qualities do not depend on the size of the Member State. Nowadays, it has become too commonplace to hear a parallel being drawn between the European Union and the defunct Soviet Union. Even though I was lucky enough not to have been born under Soviet rule, these comments are really outrageous to me. But not nearly as much though, as to those who had to endure occupation by the Red Army. I am thankful to all those that Guy mentioned in Central and Eastern Europe who are fiercely standing up against this malignant propaganda. No European Member State is immune against the rise of the logic of ‘us against them’ and the drift away from pluralist democracy and the rule of law. Estonia is no exception, but we are with you in fighting against a polarisation of society and in defending the principles of equality and social inclusion. Before being economic and monetary, our Union is one of values and giving up on them means giving up on the European dream. In that respect, the Council cannot ignore the European Parliament’s call to launch Article 7 proceedings not against Hungary, but against measures taken by the current Hungarian Government. Beyond our shared fundamental values, the very idea of the European Union is to build the world’s first transnational democracy, one in which we resolve all differences and find common ground through negotiation and compromise, rather than through conflict. And yes, Prime Minister, we have differences with you. We are disappointed that Estonia is still amongst the OECD’s most carbon—intensive economies as it still produces the vast majority of its energy from shale oil, with disastrous results in terms of emissions and toxic waste. At the same time, a significant share of your country’s forest resources have already been irresponsibly and unsustainably depleted, most often to get some quick cash. Sadly, we see similar developments elsewhere in Europe, like in Białowieża in Poland and Hambach in Germany.  You also like to highlight the potential of the digital revolution, or transformation as you call it, for future welfare, and I will agree with you that we should not shy away from innovation. However, we should keep in mind the significant risks this revolution carries in terms of civil liberties or, again, ecological impact. Indeed, far from being dematerialised, the digital universe is hungry for scarce resources whose extraction proves very damaging for the environment.  In our view, it is absolutely vital for the European Union to become a world leader in the ecologically and socially just transition of our economies. Of course, the fight against climate change demands it, but our jobs, our balance of payment, our strategic independence and our competitiveness depend on it. Giving up on this objective also means giving up on the European dream.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "Verts/ALE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Greens and regionalists"}, {"id": 73, "date": "2018-10-03.json", "name": "Neoklis SYLIKIOTIS", "mepid": "124689", "text": "  on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. Mr President, Prime Minister, I too would like to welcome you on behalf of the Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left. We are once again discussing the future of Europe, but unfortunately the assessment remains the same. The situation in the Union is constantly increasing and the economic, political and institutional crisis is deepening every day. The Union's democratic deficit is also increasing dramatically and you do not need to beautify this situation.  The neoliberal austerity policies implemented, although they have failed, continue to be promoted and institutionalised, leading people to unemployment and poverty. This is the reality today for Estonia, which, despite successes in the digital economy, has recorded alarming rates of high unemployment and poverty.  The social state is falling apart, industrial relations are being deregulated and economic, social and regional disparities in the Union are constantly widening. Market promiscuity now prevails and, in order to serve the interests of multinationals and monopolies, the altar of profit irreparably destroys the environment and intensifies climate change.  Then the refugee crisis becomes increasingly acute, as the Union refuses to adopt a strategy based on solidarity and humanism. The recent decision of the leaders in Salzburg unfortunately foreshadows that the same repression measures, increased controls at external but unfortunately also internal borders and the strengthening of the logic of fortress Europe will continue.  It is these neoliberal policies that are smoothing the way for the rise of the far right and the adoption of racist and xenophobic rhetoric and politics by several member state governments. If the Union continues to promote the same policies, the far-right forces will be further strengthened and there are very great risks to the peoples of Europe. The rise of the far right is attempting to bring the Union back to obscurity and threatens basic freedoms, rights and conquests of the peoples, and I regret to say that it is an oxymoron today with the rise of fascism and the far right talking about the Soviet Union. The violent attacks even against MEPs in Bari, Italy, Kemnitz, Germany, and other states demonstrate that the far right is being crushed and the immediate cooperation and alliance of progressive forces is needed to stop it. There is an absolute need to rally broader democratic and progressive forces and together to oppose the far right, fascism, racism and xenophobia.  The situation is not made any more dangerous by the Union's new shift towards militarisation, investment in defence with the new European fund and the strengthening of the military industry, in coordination with NATO's aggression. This shift of the Union to wars will be a disaster for the future of the Union.  Dear Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen, the danger to Europe is not refugees and migrants; it is the wars and imperialist interventions that the European Union and its Member States are actively supporting; it is the growing economic and social inequalities; it is racism and xenophobia. In order to hope for the future of the peoples of the Union, these neoliberal austerity policies must be overturned.

One of them was often repeated before – the Baltic Tiger. Tiger wisdom, ingenuity and determination are more necessary than ever for the entire European Union today. The ability to boil between the common interests of the European Union and individual national states, the ingenuity of talking to the world's major powers, the determination to adopt a Europe of the peoples of states whose politicians and citizens are in favour of sovereignty, rather than the position of international cultural parity, as an expression of direct democracy. Especially since many of these countries in Eastern Europe and Vyšegrad have experienced soviet federalism and are fully aware of what the globalist aspiration to federalise Europe can become. Dialogue, not confrontation. Union of nations, not federalisation. Economic growth, reducing social exclusion, not increasing spending on the military industry. Harmony, search for an agreement, but not confrontation or confrontation. These are things that must become the cornerstones of the foundations of the new European Union. Do you think it should be different, Prime Minister? Let us then hold referendums in the Countries of the Community on the future direction of the European Union. Do people want to strengthen the autonomy and independence of states? Do you want a new European federation without autonomous states? I am convinced that the result of the referendum would be very embarrassing for the architects of today's European Union policy, who see its future as a unified federation of European states. I also believe that we will see a new future for the European Union much faster than the speeches made by the last President or Prime Minister of the State of the European Union on this subject. That future will begin after Britain's withdrawal in March next year. And it is not so very important whether they agree sides on the conditions in which they stand out or not.

Mr President, I warmly welcome the Prime Minister of Estonia, Mr Ratas, to this Parliament to debate the future of Europe. Estonia has a history of almost exclusive domination, first by Germany, then by Sweden and then by Russia. After a short period of independence, Estonia was subsequently annexed to the Soviet Union. Estonia knows what it is to be dominated. After the end of the Soviet Union, it joined NATO and the EU out of fear of its Russian neighbour. In 2004, the EU seemed like a friendly, friendly alliance. But in the meantime, the people of Estonia must have fallen in love with the people of Estonia. In recent years, the EU has introduced proposals for an EU army, an EU police force and a European public prosecutor, as well as proposals for internet censorship and restrictions on freedom of expression. We have just heard Mr Verhofstadt, who has since left the premises, calling for an EU KGB. More and more smaller Member States are being persecuted because of their EU-critical policies. Countries that want to protect their populations from the devastating effects of open borders policy. Mr. Ratas, don't you recognize the contours of a new Soviet Union? What do you think an EU army is really needed for? Not for protecting the external borders, because that is what NATO is for. The Liberals in this House are the great champions of an EU army and it was the liberals who welcomed the armed pro-EU coup in Ukraine. Soon it will be the Liberals who will let the tanks enter Hungary again. You thought all countries in the EU had veto power? What a mistake. It is the originally East German communist Angela Merkel who dictates, and the EU follows. Estonia surrendered its sovereignty in 2004 by signing at the cross. And you thought the threat was coming from the east? No, the threat comes from the west. The EU's aggressive Ost policy is a return to an old German objective. You should recognize that, right? That is why I would advise Mr Ratas to join the Visegrád 4, with the Hungary of Viktor Orbán, which, like Estonia, has suffered from communist rule, with Matteo Salvini's Italy and Heinz-Christian Strache's Austria, because that is where the shins have fallen from their eyes. You may think that a liberal democracy stands for a democracy in which the freedoms that were once so aptly expressed in the Déclaration des droits de l'homme et du citoyen apply. No, Mr. Ratas, liberal is just another word for communist. When we talk about liberal democracy in this House, we mean the socialist state of salvation, what we mean is a new Soviet empire.

A nation particularly intelligent and wise. I can join in this eulogy in relation to the Prime Minister's speech, primarily because this speech expresses themes that are important for the future of Europe. I believe that the Prime Minister has presented pro-European pragmatism. Pro-European pragmatism, not pro-European centralism, because pro-European pragmatism is perhaps the most appropriate response to the contemporary challenges facing our countries and the European Union as a whole. This is the stakes on security, on the security of Europeans, that is at stake in enhanced cooperation on defence policy, but at the same time cooperation with the North Atlantic Pact. I can sign off very unequivocally on these views. At the same time, the Prime Minister has expressed scepticism about what Mr Verhofstadt often expresses in this Chamber, his scepticism about EU centralism, in the face of reforms that will put smaller countries at a disadvantage. The basis of European solidarity is partnership, respect for all, and therefore the smaller countries of the European Union. I absolutely share the fear of formal reforms, of a new form of revision of the Treaties that could result in this danger: the danger of a reduction in European partnership, of European solidarity, of the reduction of the position of smaller countries. Finally, there is another very important element: the rate for a competitive market, for an open competitive market, for the liberalisation of services. And it must be said that it is not only populism that the Prime Minister has spoken about that is a force restricting economic competition in Europe. Protectionism is something much broader, and it is also present in the policies of mainstream EU parties.

First of all, I would like to thank you for your kind comments on Estonia and also on our Members of the European Parliament. It is important that we have diverse views, even if I cannot agree with some of them. Just as diversity of views is important, so is our ability to provide answers and solutions and, most importantly, to make compromises. I would like to react to some of your comments and your views. First of all, Commission Vice-President Ansip, thank you for the kind references to our country – and our best wishes to you and also to Commission President Juncker! It is true that it is very important to have good connections with the centre of Europe. Connectivity is one of our priorities, and, if I am talking on a somewhat broader scale, I include here the Baltic countries and the Nordic ones. It is true that one of our targets will be the synchronisation of our energy market with the centre of Europe and, of course, digitalisation, which was a cornerstone during our Presidency, is still one of our most important themes in relation to unity and good cooperation between the Member States. Our slogan during our Presidency was ‘Unity through Balance’, and I think it is so important today to achieve better cooperation, for example in the digital sphere. In terms of cooperation across borders, and in terms of concrete benefits for our citizens and for our businesses in doing business with different Member States, we must go forward and find a solution. One very concrete wish is for free movement of data. I agree with those leaders who have mentioned artificial intelligence and self-driving cars, and, yes, it is true that in Estonia we have a lot of different e-services, more than 2 500. But our goal must also be to be very good and very active in talking to the private sector: this means the fourth industrial revolution. During our Presidency we were really happy that today we have much closer cooperation in terms of defence and security, with Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO), for example. In relation to the digital world, or digital society, the first step must always be cybersecurity. It is true that more than ten years ago we had some very serious cyberattacks but now we have more skills and much better cooperation. Some words about what Mr Bullmann said: I agree 100% about sustainable development. It is so important here to strike the balance between the environment, the economy and the social sphere. Thank you too, Mr Verhofstadt, for your kind words about Estonia and the Baltic states. I agree with you that this united Europe is, for us, 100% important. Now, some more about our environment. Estonia has more than half of its territory covered by forest and we take sustainable forest management very seriously. Estonia is meeting all the European climate goals: that was a priority during the Presidency, and my Government has a 50% renewable energy target. I also would like to say that Estonia is a nature-loving society. We care deeply about the environment today and about what we leave for our children. We are on track with climate policy and energy efficiency goals and Estonia has already reached the renewable energy goals for 2030. As regards the Soviet Union and the EU, I think they are at 180 degrees in terms of difference: having lived under the brutal Soviet regime, I strongly reject any comparison with today’s or, for that matter, tomorrow’s European Union. Once more, I agree with Mr Weber on the importance of a level playing field and of creating the biggest digital market. It is also important that digital Europe works for the many and not the few – well said, Mr Bullmann! As a member of the Liberal family, I can only agree again with Mr Verhofstadt and I can only say thank you to Sweden and the Swedish people for supporting Estonia and our fellow Estonians, for example during the 1940s and 1950s, and today as well.

Prime Minister, suur tänu, you have brought the feeling of Europe from Estonia to Strasbourg and this unites us all. But, actually we are not debating Estonia today, but the future of Europe.  In 1992, just after Maastricht, which turned an economic community into a political union, the then President of the Commission, Jacques Delors, a great socialist, voiced his vision of the European future. He said that each of the 12 Member States now faced a challenge to make the biggest polity leap in post—war history to make this political union successful. Delors said that, if we did not succeed in giving Europe a soul, spirituality and inner meaning in the next ten years, this battle would be lost.  Today, 26 years have passed since then and I wonder if many of our problems today have emerged from this void which is still haunting us. In other words, man does not live by bread alone. Member States do not live only by feeding their national interests and we need to agree on what really keeps us together. It’s not only economic, social and security interests.  What is our European identity? It is not subsidies, consumption or social media, but a spirit of togetherness, rediscovering and revaluing our roots, and our spiritual and cultural continuity.

The development of the internal market for services and many other things is important, but one of europe's biggest concerns is, in fact, the poor demographic situation in many countries where more people die than they are born. The population is ageing and shrinking. In this situation, it is also increasingly difficult to ensure economic growth and the increase in people's living standards. Therefore, we, too, in the European Union, must look very carefully at the policies that can improve this situation, because without the demographic situation improving, there is not much sense in many other nice things.  At the same time, I must say that the most important thing about improving this situation is, of course, people's own behaviour and personal contribution.

Article 17 of Regulation No 1260/1999 shall apply to the following: 3 it is said that members of the Commission are selected on the basis of the demands of Europeanism, that is, there can never be fair competition between political parties in the European Union. This means that in the European Union there will always be discrimination against an opposition that thinks only a little bit differently than the mainstream. And I want to ask you: this example, which I have quoted here, is one of the many dozens of examples of the democratic deficit in the European Union. A terrible democratic deficit.

We were very afraid of being contaminated, that we would contaminate ourselves, and in the years now that we did not reach an agreement, the Astravo nuclear power plant emerged.

I will try to focus and give as many concrete answers as I can. Tunne, I really appreciate what you said about Estonia, our country. I would like to thank you especially for your personal commitment and support.  Regarding the social pillar, I am proud that we agreed the proclamation of the European Pillar of Social Rights during the Estonian Presidency. We did so in Gothenburg in Sweden. It was a very important achievement and now is the time to move on with the implementation of the pillar principles.  Regarding the question about the Baltic States and our energy market, it is so important today that we have good connections between Finland and Estonia – I mean two Estlinks. It is very good that we will have the Balticconnector and of course we need good cooperation if we are adopting the LNG. As I said before, for all three Baltic States it is very important to synchronise our energy market with the rest of Europe and with the middle of Europe.  As regards defence, both quality and quantity are important. Efficiency is important, but we also must spend to percentages. Regarding EU defence cooperation, we have taken big steps forward with European defence initiatives and I am proud that during the Estonian Presidency we achieved a lot in this area. Now is the time to implement the decisions taken, for example, the PESCO projects. In this way, we can deliver more security for our citizens. In addition, I cannot stress enough the importance of preserving transatlantic unity and the need to advance EU and NATO cooperation. As for foreign policy, the proposal on the table is worth exploring, but we remain cautious. Regarding different speeds, when it comes to the question about one, two or three speeds, we always answer with a sense of unity and the same direction. I do not like a divided Europe and more divisions. Regarding taxation, I can only repeat that it is a national matter, but in digital tax, I think that we really need global solutions. Regarding energy security, our views on Nord Stream 2 are well known. In our opinion, the interconnections between the Union and third countries must be subject to the rules covering the Energy Union. The interconnectors with third countries should seek to diversify the Union’s energy sources and increase the Union’s security of supply. Nord Stream 2 does not meet those criteria. It is a political project of the Russian Federation. This opinion is shared by a number of EU Member States. As I said, the Energy Union is the key to Estonia’s connections. The Nordic energy market has brought down energy prices and provided more services and opportunities. I would like to thank Mr Hökmark for his support. I am one hundred percent in agreement with you. We believe in digital solutions in health issues as well. We introduced our ideas during our Presidency and stand ready to discuss them. We are not in denial regarding the debate over taxes. It is important that we fight tax evasion, cooperate closely and have similar tax bases. I know that your next discussion here in Parliament, in the afternoon session, will be about the risks of money laundering. If I may, I would like to share my views about money laundering. There was a question about this as well. Estonia has zero tolerance for money laundering. Combating these kinds of crimes is a clear priority for us and it is important that the Estonian financial supervision authority discovered suspicious transactions in the Estonian branch, for example, of Danske Bank. As a result, in 2015 the branch had to close its high-risk non—resident portfolio. However, since Danske Bank is a Danish credit institution, its banking supervision is primarily carried out by the Danish authorities. In recent years, we have significantly broadened the fight against money laundering in Estonia. However, this is a continuous process and a major challenge for the European Union as well. Currently, the Estonian authorities are working with Denmark and other countries to investigate whether the requirements for combating money laundering in 2009 to 2014 were fulfilled or were not met at the Estonian branch of Danske Bank. The prosecutor’s office has commenced criminal proceedings. In conclusion, as I said at the beginning of my speech, we are building a future every day. What unites us in the EU is much more that than what divides us. By having common policies, we have been able to make a difference. We Europeans are stronger together and I hope we will spare no efforts in securing our collective interests and values in the world. I am very appreciative of all the Members of the European Parliament and the President of Parliament, Mr Antonio Tajani.

Millions of citizens have been able to learn and train abroad through Erasmus, as well as work on joint international and cross-sectoral projects for new, innovative solutions in the field of education and training.  This programme makes a significant contribution to personal development and to the knowledge and skills of its participants and is therefore an important tool in the fight against youth unemployment. Through the exchange of good practices and the improvement of education and youth workers, Erasmus is also a driving force for improving the quality of education in the Member States.  Prime Minister, i would like to thank you for your excellent work. Education and training is the best investment in the future of the European Union.

However, even though many of us from the PPE voted against the amendment, parliament finally approved a commitment to a 40% reduction in emissions, and this is already an unacceptable ambition for me, counterproductive, because the European car industry will be less competitive, we will clear the way for Chinese competition.

Madam President, Commissioner Thyssen, ladies and gentlemen, we are very pleased that we in this Parliament are debating at our request for citizenship income. A few months ago, thanks to our work, this House adopted our own text on minimum income as a measure to reduce poverty.  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a very expensive subject for us for two reasons. One, we are Italian and in Italy there is no income of citizenship. It is present in 26 out of 28 European countries but not in ours. Two, we are an expression of a political force, the 5 Star Movement, which is now in government of the country, a young force founded only on 4 October 2009. Citizenship income has been in our DNA since October 4, 2009. It was immediately the dream of Beppe Grillo and Gian Roberto Casaleggio. He's been there all these years, he's been on our program, we've taken him to all the squares. We have made the journey from Perugia to Assisi several times on foot, and we have made it a theme at the center of the political debate. I still remember those early years, it was a simple idea, but it is also true that simple things are the most extraordinary. Nor did it seem to us to be anything new, taking millions of poor people out of despair and poverty. All these years we have experienced it as a moral obligation, and I will tell you more, it seemed to us a battle of civilization in which political affiliaties had to disappear. We thought that those who oppose the income of citizens are opposed to Italians, not to the 5 Star Movement, and instead in Italy a stupid, devastating ideological war has been waged against our proposal. They thought they were hitting us, but they didn't realize they were hurting the millions of poor people that their social policies kept increasing. In those years, we kept saying \"rest assured, when we go to government we will make the income of citizenship\", I want to say this to all citizens living in absolute poverty, like Anna who a few years ago wrote to me to tell me her story. His is a story like so many, wife and husband with a failed job because of the crisis, the search for a job that is not found, the despair, the endless drama of not knowing how to get to the end of the day and the cowardice of a state that did not give answers, that turned its head the other way, because to some politicians the tables and numbers warm the heart more than the suffering of a person. Your story, Anna, I took you with me to the European Parliament, your life experience was my work agenda. I promised you, in fact I swore it to you, to you and to all the people who can't find a job. To all anna daughters and victims of a devastating economic crisis. In these years I have wanted this moment to come like nothing in the world to embrace you and to be able to say \"we have not left you alone, we have kept our promise\". With the government of change, in Italy there will be the income of citizenship for more than six million citizens. It is an epochal measure, we are erasing poverty in Italy, reviving consumption and relaunching the economy. You can't win with those who never give up, gian Roberto Casaleggio said, we never gave up, and the dream that nine years ago was few, today is everyone's dream.

Our joint commitments to the European people are to protect those most vulnerable, to create adequate jobs and to lift up those who have fallen behind. Less than a year ago, we reaffirmed the basic principles – the European Pillar of Social Rights, Principle 14 states that everyone lacking sufficient resources has the right to adequate minimum income benefits, ensuring a life with dignity at all stages of life. In 2008, the banking crisis and the ensuing sovereign debt crisis tested our economies, shocked our labour markets and put a strain on our social protection system. Unemployment rates and at-risk-of-poverty rates soared throughout the EU. In the past decade, we have had to tackle manifold emergency situations. However, with determination and hard work and by taking difficult decisions, we have managed to restore our economies. In 2017, the EU average unemployment rate stood at 7.3% and employment exceeded its pre-crisis peak. Albeit with some delay, youth unemployment and long-term unemployment also continue to decline. Today, thanks to our combined efforts, the Europe 2020 strategy target of 75% employment rate for men and women seems again to be within reach. While the picture looks positive from certain angles, there is no place for complacency. The total number of people at risk of poverty or social exclusion remains very high. In 2016, 118 million European citizens, 23.5% of the total population, were at risk of poverty, even after social transfers. It is clear we still have a long way to go before we reach the Europe 2020 target of lifting at least 20 million people out of poverty. Ladies and gentlemen, we are all increasingly aware that economic growth must be to the benefit of all and must be socially sustainable. This is clearly demonstrated by the fact that almost all Member States have made a real effort and have established schemes for minimum income or benefit in one form or another. Furthermore, Member States are making good use of the open method of coordination (OMC), to cooperate and to exchange best practices. The European Semester equally has provided an excellent platform for cooperation in this area. However, minimum income schemes do not exist in a vacuum. The real challenge is to establish inclusive labour markets to make sure that people don’t fall through the social net and, at the same time, to ensure that national social security systems remain sustainable. Balancing these elements is not an easy task, especially if we look at the wider context of an ageing population and increased digitalisation and robotisation.

As President Juncker said in his State of the Union address, Europe has largely turned a page on the economic and financial crisis, and this is well reflected in the employment and social situation in Europe.  Employment has indeed been growing for more than five years in a row and there are now 239 million people at work in the European Union. This is more than ever before. The unemployment rate has dropped to 6.8%. These are the figures from Eurostat for August 2018. In 2016, there were 5.6 million fewer people at risk of poverty or social exclusion than at the peak of 2012, and there are clear signs that the situation has further improved since. For instance, severe material deprivation declined in almost all Member States, falling to an all—time low of 33.4 million in 2017. This is a reduction of 16 million people since 2012. Having said this, we should not be complacent. Thirty—three million materially deprived people is still too many, and we know that income inequality has stabilised in the last few years, but at higher levels in the European Union than before the crisis. Moreover, the overall number of people at risk of poverty or social exclusion, albeit reduced relative to 2012, is still higher now in 2018. This is, as we all know, far from the Europe 2020 target of taking 20 million people out of risk of poverty and social exclusion, and that is why the Commission has proposed to act.  A year ago we all proclaimed the European Pillar of Social Rights, which recognises that everyone lacking sufficient resources has the right to adequate minimum income benefits ensuring a life in dignity at all stages of life, and effective access to enabling goods and services. For those who can work, minimum income benefits should be combined with incentives to integrate or reintegrate into the labour market. That is what the Pillar says. In other words, the provision of adequate minimum income schemes is non—discriminatory and should go hand—in—hand with access to services, with employment in line with the active inclusion approach.  However, I would like to recall that the setting—up of minimum income benefits is the responsibility of Member States. Since the introduction of minimum income schemes in Greece and Italy in the last two years, now all Member States have some form of minimum income scheme. However, their design and implementation vary greatly.  For this reason, the Commission and Member States have decided to deepen the analysis. A benchmarking framework has been agreed with Member States for minimum income schemes supporting a thorough across—country comparison of national practices. It looks in particular at adequacy, coverage and activation and it will feed into the country—specific analysis in the 2019 European Semester. The European Semester has proved to be an effective framework to monitor and provide guidance to Member States. It is now the main instrument for monitoring the implementation of the Pillar. In 2018, some Member States received country—specific recommendations addressing minimum income. And, of course, the European Semester framework allows us to have a comprehensive view, including the availability of fiscal space to expand social provision.  In addition, the Commission has already put forward proposals and initiatives that want to make sure no one is left behind. To ensure the rights for the most vulnerable workers we presented the proposal for a directive on transparent and predictable working conditions to tackle women’s under—representation in employment and to create a more balanced distribution of caring responsibilities between women and men we put forward the work—life balance for parents and carers initiative. So this is just to mention a few of our initiatives on the table. They now need to be adopted and implemented and, honourable Members, I count on your support to make sure that they will be adopted within the current mandate of this Parliament.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 151, "date": "2018-10-03.json", "name": "Sofia RIBEIRO", "mepid": "124733", "text": "  on behalf of the Ppe Group. – Madam President, Commissioner, this is indeed an issue that must involve the whole Of the European Union. We are talking about 120 million European citizens who are at risk of poverty and social exclusion. We are talking about 25% of European citizens in this situation, which is unacceptable and urgently needs to be corrected immediately.  If we want to pursue the European social model, this dream that there may be social progression, we must indeed address this issue, which is absolutely emerging. It is, yes, that there are substantial differences between the various Member States, but we have to ensure, we must guide public policies throughout the Union so that social support, minimum income can actually be an income, a support, which is properly appropriate to the social situations of the various Member States. In my case, in particular, in the Azores, the situation is dramatic, we talk about about 25 % of working-age beneficiaries being dependent on social income from insertion, which is what they are called in my country. But in the last year, pasmemo—we are no longer in economic and social crisis, and the numbers of beneficiaries of social income from the azores and Portugal have been increasing dramatically and therefore something is not going well when we address the issues of public support and here we must work in various dimensions, we must work in a dimension of prevention that obviously it has to be provided with the proper support at the level of the labour market so that these people can be properly placed and obviously have the necessary training and education to not be in these dependency schemes and it is necessary, of course, that minimum income is essentially an insertion policy and not a policy of subsidy and this is where we have to improve the public responses that we give with multidisciplinary teams so that we have to improve the public responses that we give with multidisciplinary teams so that we have to improve the public responses that we give with multidisciplinary teams so that we have to improve the public responses that we give with multidisciplinary teams so that we have to improve the public responses that we give with multidisciplinary teams so that we have to improve the public responses that we give with multidisciplinary teams so that we have to improve the public responses that we give with multidisciplinary teams so that we have to improve the public responses that we give with multidisciplinary teams so that we have to improve the public responses that we give with multidisciplinary teams so that we have to improve the public responses that we give with multidisciplinary teams so that we have to improve the public responses that we give with multidisciplinary teams so that we have to improve the public responses that we give with multidisciplinary teams so that we have to improve the public responses that we give with multidisciplinary teams so that we have to improve the , in fact, we are not only giving social support to our societies but in ensuring such social progression, this European dream that we all want and which can effectively succeed, ensuring that these people actually go through a better situation.

We have supported, in particular, proposals for the weakest, such as the Youth Guarantee for our young people, the Child Guarantee for our children, and we have promoted concrete aid to families, especially single parents with a woman in charge who are those who have almost 50% risk of falling into poverty.  We believe, however, that a person's first right is that of a job, decent, secure, stable and protected work, a job that allows everyone to be an active part of society and contribute to its growth. We believe that the work should be paid for and paid for the right. That is why our group was the first to launch the proposal for a guaranteed minimum wage at European level.

We believe that a minimum wage for all workers allows us to lead a peaceful life with real work for all, and that is our main objective.

Madam President, I would like to thank the president for her Ladies and gentlemen! This debate we are having here is yet another example of how the Commission and the Council are misleading citizens with definitions. Because we are suddenly talking about a minimum income. But that is wrong, ladies and gentlemen. Mrs Bresso has just pointed this out. We are not talking about an income, we are talking about minimum social assistance. An income is something associated with gainful employment. An income is something that is associated with effort and also with fulfillment, because you can work and because you are allowed to work. Anyone who has spoken here about a minimum income – the representative of the Commission, the representative of the Council, the representatives of certain political parties – has misled the citizens, because they give the impression that a problem is being solved, which is actually being resolved by paying a minimum social support and thus trying to keep people in the joblessness. Or at least there is a risk that they will remain in unemployment precisely because they receive this kind of support. It goes without saying that we provide a minimum level of social support for those who are unemployed. Clearly, no one disputes that. I actually find it downright ridiculous that we need to talk about it again today. The real problem, however, is: how do we get the people who get social support because they have no work into work? In other words, we still need to talk about what incentives we give people to move to work when they receive social support. There is, for example, this idea of an unconditional basic income, which is quite an interesting idea, but which must of course always answer the question of how great the temptations are to somehow rest on this basic income and not to switch into employment, and which must also answer the question of who should actually finance this and when the tax liability begins.

The minimum income or minimum income of insertion, or some model of minimum income, which there are many, is already recognized in the pillar of social rights and a year ago, almost every day, Parliament said that it is a fundamental instrument for combating poverty. So, there's little to talk about there. What you have to do is get down to business. Of course, the Commission has done things, but per maybe, within all that needs to be developed from the social pillar, it must intensify its efforts, and it must intensify them because what makes the minimum income is to tackle a very hard problem, which is poverty. It is inadmissible that rich areas of the world will still be able to maintain pockets of poverty. And we have to attack this. It is shown, from the studies, that minimum income systems are effective in that. Having said that, and that the ALDE Group fully supports that right and the intelligent implementation of that right, we do need to talk precisely that this is in the hands of the countries and what the Commission can do, and I would say that urgently. In this area, it is clear that minimum income is just one more measure to help people include. Why? Because the second point I say is obvious to the ALDE Group: we do not believe in assisted societies. They're unworthy. We don't believe in assisted people. It has to be transient and everything has to go get them out of there. Second point. Of course, minimum incomes have to be at the service of the cohesion of nations and Europe because other words, economically it is a disaster. You have done very well to point out in the European Semester for Spain how regionalisation, for example, of minimum income is a factor of exclusion and brutal inequality. And that has to be subject to the Commission's supervision. And finally, the funding.

The minimum income scheme that we’ve been talking about in Parliament is about the last resort income so that people are not left destitute. We should also be aware in this that we’re not talking here about unemployment benefit, because not everybody is in a position to be able to work.  This is, as people have said, an ongoing problem for the European Union. It’s really disturbing to hear the Commissioner remind us about the stabilising of income inequality. Even in my own region, London, which is just about the richest region in the European Union, we have over one—in—three children who are living below the poverty line. So when we’re looking at questions about minimum income, adequacy is a key point. Many of our Member States’ systems don’t ensure adequacy; they don’t keep up with the rising cost of living; they cap systems; they have harsh criteria in many cases, and they certainly have an increasingly harsh public perception of people who are on these schemes.  When we’re looking at what else the European Union can do, we should come back to an idea that was floated some time ago by the Anti—Poverty Network, which is about putting in place a directive setting out the principles upon which minimum income schemes should be based within our Member States.

The idea of a minimum income is, of course, not new. It has already been successfully implemented in many countries, and I am defending it myself, but let me say immediately that I am not talking about a universal basic income or a minimum wage, because these concepts are too often mixed. And we need to make this clear so that we don't have any misconceptions, because even today there was quite a bit of confusion in this Chamber. I am talking about the need for all citizens to get help, which can also be said to be a minimum income or a social transfer, when they need it. However, when we are talking about this at European level, we must, of course, pay attention to subsidiarity, take into account the different economic development between countries and cannot exercise coercion, but we can encourage Member States to set an appropriate minimum income in their national legislation. However, a minimum income must not be just a right that is taken for granted. This right must also be linked to obligations and responsibility, and we often also adopt regulations here in Parliament, where we forget this reciprocity. In Europe, we want to maintain the social standard that we are used to, and our standard is the highest in the world. That's good. At the same time, however, we must be careful not to devalue the importance of work and decent pay for work, the ratio between the minimum wage for work and the minimum income, which, as we can also understand from this debate, is, as we can also understand from this debate, social assistance.  This relationship is completely inappropriate in some countries, including my own country, and this does not, of course, encourage people to actively seek work, but encourages them into passivity.

In other words, it is the completely wrong way to achieve anything sensible and sustainable here. Because in the case of an unconditional basic income, one will always have to answer the question of how much it should be paid. Should everyone, including a millionaire, actually get it? Or do I have to introduce bureaucracy for this? These are all unanswered questions, but they have to be answered beforehand. But it is also crucial: this question does not have to be answered in the European Parliament, because this is a question that the states of the EU must define for themselves in a sovereign decision. And in doing so, they have to decide what they can and want to afford in terms of social benefits. This is something that each country can decide for itself. However, we must not turn a blind eye to the fact that the countries of the euro area in particular have very special obligations here. Those who participate in a common currency must also adhere to the common rules, e.B. debt limits. If we now take Italy, for example, because the justification for this request comes from a representative of Italy, we have 134% of the debt ratio in relation to gross domestic product. So if Italy wants to afford something like this, then it is wonderful. But the question must then be asked in Italy: can this be afforded?

There, I have to say the basic income guarantee undermines the incentive to participate in society.  The help and minimum income connected to it should be designed to help overcome unemployment and find work for those able to work. Help can never be an unconditional free ride for healthy adult people to live off other people’s incomes. On the contrary, if you design it that way, you are likely to lead to high rates of inequality and poverty. Reallocating welfare payments from targeted transfers, those for unemployment, housing disability, etc. to a generalised transfer for everyone, means that the amount that goes to the most deserving will be lower. Do we really want less for everybody? Do we really want less for those who need more?  Therefore, I urge you, we have to have a minimum income in a certain way, designed to help overcoming the troubles and the poverty that exist, but if you design it as an income guarantee you will end up stripping people of the incentive to participate in society and make it worse for the needy.

For example, it is 2,000 euros in Luxembourg, while it is only 260 euros in Bulgaria. Such differences are an ideal breeding ground for the proponents of withdrawal, the followers of Europhobia, because the economic and social consequences of such wage gaps can be disastrous for factories, which are increasingly closing, as for workers who unfortunately suffer unfair competition from seconded workers. And it is indeed the least advantaged who pay the price for the dysfunctions of the internal market. Millions of them believe that Europe is not only responsible for certain bankruptcies of our industrial fabrics, but also responsible for unemployment and precariousness. A first step has thus been taken thanks to the decisive contribution of our EPP colleague, Elisabeth Morin-Chartier, who, in revising the directive on seconded workers, imposed this fundamental principle: 'equal work, equal pay'. But I propose that we go further, and with regard to the minimum wage gap, I would like to propose something very concrete today. Just as we are considering conditioning the allocation of structural funds on respect for the rule of law, I propose to condition the allocation of these same funds on compliance with certain wage criteria, such as the introduction of a minimum wage high enough to give dignity and to combat unfair competition and social dumping.

And that means developing the social pillar, combating the risk of exclusion and poverty and maintaining social cohesion. In short, values that are from the beginning in the European project. Principles that the party to which I belong sponsored as a hallmark of this project, as certified by our contributions in the Hague Congress and in the New International Teams. They were defended by a politician, lehendakari Aguirre, retaliated against by Francoism, who preached social policy by example. He made a reference for advanced social management in the 1930s and his own company, Chocolates Bilbaínos. Today, if we want to be true to that hallmark of the European project, we must bet on insertion income. They are programs that help rescue people with the same determination that banks have been rescued with. This was described by the current lehendakari of the Basque Country. The Basque Country, true to this social vocation, invests almost 40% of the total amount spent in the Spanish State annually on such programmes when we account for only 4% of the total population. The experience of more than twenty-five years of operation of our income guarantee income shows that offering this support to people without any recourse to workers with precarious jobs or low-income pensioners minimizes exclusion, marginalization and the risk of poverty. It encourages access or insertion into the labor market and mitigates social bankruptcy and protects integration.

The minimum guaranteed income is therefore such a social and political concept to combat poverty, and de facto in various forms in most countries of the European Union such minimum social security is ensured. It is not universal – usually various social benefits, social housing, benefits require certain conditions. The system is often complicated, but it is, and the question arises whether it is therefore necessary to move towards a guaranteed income.  I see, of course, the positive, pragmatic features of this solution, the simplicity of this concept. However, this solution, which meets the demands of social justice and the European social pillar, has its drawbacks.

Many have said so here, too.  I am not going to talk about a guaranteed minimum income, that is, the flat dose that some of them may have also talked about. The European Union is based on the concept of a social market economy. This concept provides for social support as an expression of solidarity for those who cannot work or have lost their jobs. For those who are sick or care for a person close to them.  Social support must be derived from the cost of living and must be conditional on activity, because the aim is a decent life and it provides for work. That is why social policy must be in solidarity, but also motivational, of course, and I think the Commissioner has spoken very strongly about this here. What is decisive, of course, is the action of the Member States, which decide on the level of solidarity, on the level of social support, on the minimum wage, which should not have been discussed here today.

It could be a wage supplemented by state support; state—provided targeted benefits, such as those for persons with disabilities; unemployment support in housing, or indeed schooling and education; or it could be for carers. Child poverty is one of the real targets in this area to address to ensure that we bring all children out of that. In my own country, it is still the case that child poverty levels are quite high, and they are not keeping pace with the growth in the economy and growth in employment. Nevertheless, the way to address child poverty is to help parents, through employment and through support that can ensure adequate living standards. Today, we had a report published in my country on the minimum wage. Whilst I know that’s not a solution to everything, the study said today that of those on minimum wages one-in-three would move on to a higher wage in a matter of nine months. It acts as a stepping stone to jobs with better pay. However, those on minimum wage are most likely to lose their jobs; they are more likely to have poor education, be part-time employees and be on temporary contracts. That all ties in with the Commission’s pillar of social rights and, indeed, transparent and predictable working conditions, which I fully support. I hope we see progress through this Parliament.

One of the arguments in favour of this solution boils down to the belief that robotics and automation of the economy will lead to a situation where there will be no jobs for everyone. While the idea seems lofty and motivated by concern for citizens, the experience so far with a guaranteed minimum income is not optimistic. In Finland, an experiment was conducted in recent years on a group of unemployed people living in selected areas of the country. The project unexpectedly ended this year. Although there are no official results yet, the first information indicates that it was a failure. First of all, it has not translated into an increase in the labour force of the unemployed. It is unfortunate, because it thus confirmed the argument that a guaranteed minimum income would lead to a permanent withdrawal from the labour market rather than an increase in proactive attitudes. We have had similar experiences in France and Switzerland.  I therefore recommend that you be careful and careful when discussing this issue. A minimum guaranteed income will not eliminate corruption, precariat, illegal employment or poverty-contributing unemployment. We should focus our energy on measures that activate and include the unemployed, measures to ensure decent working conditions for everyone, actions that support women in particular, so that they can successfully reconcile family responsibilities with work.

The child guarantee advocated by my group would be a step towards everyone's Europe, and I hope that this initiative will be supported in the negotiations on the financial framework. Those at risk should be supported in matters related to housing, health care and education – poverty is hereitable, whether we like it or not.

The current system has been well able to take into account different countries, the Nordic model and the minimum wage countries. It should be remembered, however, that a sustainable system requires the maintenance of the state's finances. An economic collapse or a banking crisis has not helped any poor people.

The principles enshrined in the Pillar underline the importance to invest in people and to support them through changes stemming from new and emerging challenges. As President Juncker said, Europe’s social dimension should be given the Cinderella treatment no more but should instead be geared towards the future.  Poverty and inequality are not only detrimental to social cohesion, but also to sustainable economic growth. This is why we believe that fit—for—purpose social protection systems can contribute both to the smooth functioning of the labour market and to inclusive growth. This includes, indeed, that minimum income provision has to be accompanied by activation measures and enabling services. An adequate income will always be important for maintaining human dignity and full participation in society and economy. It is important, however, to note that minimum income provisions are only one element in the whole policy mix that is needed to guarantee a decent life for the most vulnerable people in society.  Now on Italy. Italy was one of the few countries not to have a minimum income provision for a long time. We recommended its introduction in country—specific recommendations for many years, and finally the previous government introduced it in 2017. We understand that the current government would like to modify the measure, including by extending its coverage. We will judge it, within the framework of the European Semester and the analysis of the draft budgetary plan, according to the well—established procedures you all know.  Last but not least, Madam President, about the requests for new legislation, for instance on a minimum income directive or the other suggestions made during the debate, I can tell you that right now our focus is on the important legislative initiatives already proposed to implement the Social Pillar. Our goal is to see this completed within this mandate of the current Parliament. In parallel, there are important initiatives underway to ensuring upwards convergence in these areas, and here I am referring in particular to the recently agreed framework for minimum income benchmarking which includes indicators for defining adequacy of benefits. This will for sure be of great help to developing adequate minimum income schemes in all our Member States.  Thank you very much for this debate.

Madam President, I would like to thank the president for her Commissioner, I would like to thank the Commissioner for her Mr President- -- I would like to begin by thanking the president-in-office of the Council for his excellent work on Since the founding of Eurojust on 6 May, Eurojust has been  On 1 March 2002, we are supporting Eurojust and the Member States in the judicial coordination of their national authorities. The aim is clear: to combat terrorism and serious organised crime more effectively within the European Union. The first half of 2018 alone underlined the positive impact of Eurojust. In April, a ring of people smugglers was unearthed by arrests in Austria and Romania, in May the cooperation between Belgium, Spain and Germany led to arrests in cases of organised systematic VAT fraud, and in June a german-Danish group was finally convicted of selling residence permits to migrants as part of sham marriages. However, due to this new threat situation, but also to technical progress and institutional changes since 2002, the regulations from the founding act were no longer adequate and should and should be renewed. The Commission therefore published a draft regulation in July 2013. We in the European Parliament have, of course, placed this draft in the ordinary legislative procedure, and we have only been able to assess it in its entirety. And that, in turn, was a little lengthy, because we had, of course, to wait for the draft report on the European Public Prosecutor's Office until the Council debate, so that we could not actually present the draft in Parliament until 2017 and then in October we also got parliament's mandate to enter the trialogue negotiations. I would like to commend the cooperation with the Estonian and Bulgarian Presidencies, but also with the Commission and with the shadow rapporteurs. All the actors here were very committed, very professional, which is why the trialogue on the 19th.  June of this year was successfully completed – with a satisfactory result for all sides, I would say. We have therefore also created an Executive Board to relieve the College of Discharge, which will take on administrative tasks. The college will then focus on purely operational business. We have established clear responsibilities and procedural procedures, and the Commission is also involved in the work of this agency through a representative in the college and executive board, as well as Parliament at the hearing of the President of Eurojust or the national parliaments at interparliamentary meetings. The tasks and responsibilities of Eurojust are clearly regulated in relation to the European Public Prosecutor's Office (EEA), thus avoiding gaps and overlaps. In addition, the principle of proportionality and the principle of subsidiarity are also taken into account. It also ensures that prosecutions must continue at national level. A bigger problem was the creation of the data protection directives. We have now integrated the so-called operational data into the founding act of Eurojust, while all other data protection issues in Regulation 45 (EC) No 2001 have been included by Mrs Ernst. This means that Member States can also be sure that their data will not be shared with Eurojust without their consent.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 207, "date": "2018-10-03.json", "name": "Axel VOSS", "mepid": "96761", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, Eurojust makes an essential contribution to judicial cooperation in the European Union. It helps Member States to combat serious cross-border crime and to protect our citizens. In recent years, Eurojust has further increased its role in the fight against cybercrime, terrorism and trafficking in human beings. Last year alone, Eurojust supported Member States in more than 2 500 criminal cases and organised 200 joint investigative teams. Eurojust also supports the execution of European arrest warrants as well as judicial cooperation with third countries. Given this changing and ever more challenging operational environment, the reform of Eurojust was necessary. We had to make sure Eurojust stays fit for purpose in the future. The revision you are about to adopt will, among other things, ensure that the national members of Eurojust can focus more on operational work. It will also allow the European Parliament and national parliaments to be more involved in assessing Eurojust activities. We also needed to clarify Eurojust’s future relationship with the European Public Prosecutor’s Office, the so-called EPPO. The EPPO will be a specialised body with investigatory powers dedicated to the fight against crimes against the EU’s financial interests. It will need to cooperate closely with Eurojust. Moreover, Eurojust will continue to be responsible for judicial cooperation in relation to crimes against EU financial interests in respect of those Member States that do not yet participate in the EPPO. The EPPO will be operational by the end of 2020 and I am pleased that it will have a stronger Eurojust as its partner. In this context, let me also highlight the importance of sufficient resources for Eurojust to do its important work in the forthcoming financial period. In the meantime, I would like to thank the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs for the excellent cooperation on this proposal. I would like to highlight three points on which Parliament’s support was decisive in the negotiations. First, Parliament obtained agreement that the regulation on access to documents should be applicable to all Eurojust documents, including those related to operational matters. This will ensure more transparency for citizens. Secondly, Parliament ensured that the harmonised data protection laws for EU institutions and bodies would also apply to Eurojust. Thirdly, Parliament allowed the Commission to have a representative on the management board of Eurojust. I am convinced that, with this revision, Eurojust will be even more efficient in making the EU a safer place. The Commission regrets, however, that on several points the co-legislators have decided to deviate from the approach agreed in the joint statement on decentralised agencies. A written statement on this issue has been provided for inclusion in the record of this session. Honourable Members, thank you once again for your work. I look forward to the vote tomorrow.  Commission statement (in writing) \"The Commission regrets that on several points, the co-legislators have decided to deviate from the approach agreed in the Joint Statement of the European Parliament, the Council of the EU and the European Commission on decentralised agencies of 19 July 2012, without providing the necessary justification. This relates in particular to the number of Commission representatives in the College/Management Board and the procedure for appointing and dismissing the Administrative Director of Eurojust. The Commission will assess the impact of those deviations on the functioning of the Agency at the appropriate opportunity. They should not be considered as a precedent for other agencies.\"", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "PPE", "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 208, "date": "2018-10-03.json", "name": "Ingeborg GRÄSSLE", "mepid": "28220", "text": "  Rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Budgetary Control.

For example, I find it completely incomprehensible why the EPPO's access to Eurojust's case management system has been deleted in Article 23 and why only indirect access is provided for. The automatic cross-checking mechanism has also been deleted. I think we will still be sorry for that here in this House.

It's a bit like human cholesterol: there is a good justice that respects, values and prestigious the rule of law, but there is another justice that does just the opposite.

Eurojust is essential to respond effectively to the challenge of cross-border organised crime, terrorism, migrant smuggling or cybercrime. Thanks to this reform, Eurojust will gain efficiency and strengthen cooperation between Member States on criminal justice.  Eurojust has facilitated coordination and cooperation between national tax and investigative authorities in managing cases affecting several Member States. It has also helped build mutual trust and connect the full range of existing legal instruments in the European Union.  Eurojust's adaptation to the creation of the new Public Prosecutor's Office, as well as to the new data protection regulations for institutions should be full. The SOCTA 2017 organized crime report identified five thousand organised crime groups acting and under investigation in the European Union, an increase of one thousand and four hundred more groups compared to 2013.  This indicates that a coordinated response must be improved and given to the Union, both at the police and judicial level, in order to deal with the terrorist threat, drug trafficking, cybercrime, migrant trafficking or child pornography.  Eurojust is a fundamental tool for cooperation and enhanced coordination between the judicial authorities of the Member States, the new Public Prosecutor's Office and also with other agencies, such as Europol, as well as with third countries. It is important that working agreements are made between Europol and Eurojust so that both agencies can share information and data, especially now that we will enter the interoperability stage and the European search portal.

Madam President, Commissioner Jourova, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the commissioner for her excellent work and for the work she has done. Cross-border crime cannot only be combated nationally. No, we must address it with cross-border cooperation between the Member States and their judicial authorities. Since we do not really have European criminal law, we need a bridge between the authorities of the Member States in order to be able to successfully put offenders on trial. This bridge is Eurojust. The Agency started its work in 2002 and the increasing number of cases involving national authorities in Eurojust is a testament to the need and importance of the European Agency for Judicial Cooperation. The range of cases in which Eurojust provides assistance is diverse – be it the detection of fraud against bank customers with fake e-mails in Romania and Italy, whether it is the detection of raids on freight transporters in France and Poland or, for example, the detection of drug smuggling between the Netherlands and Finland, to name but a few examples from recent months. All these cases have one thing in common: cross-border crime has been combated with cross-border cooperation. In order for Eurojust to be able to carry out its tasks even more efficiently in the future, it is good that, with our vote tomorrow, we are launched the new Eurojust regulation in accordance with the Lisbon Treaty. What are the main innovations at stake? Firstly, the structure of Eurojust is being modernised, and this now allows the national members of Eurojust to focus more on operational tasks. An executive committee will take the lead in the administrative work. Secondly, as you know, from 2020, the European Public Prosecutor's Office will be able to investigate and prosecute crimes against the EU budget. Here it was important to avoid any form of skills gaps or even duplication of work. In order for the Public Prosecutor's Office to cooperate effectively with Eurojust, the guidelines for the division of powers are clearly defined. Thirdly, there is, of course, much to be done to improve judicial cooperation between the Member States. In order to support this process, Eurojust will be able to draw up written opinions in the future to alert the authorities of a Member State to existing problems. Fourthly, we are strengthening transparency and accountability. Parliamentary control of Eurojust is strengthened by the cooperation of the relevant committees of the European Parliament and also of the national parliaments. Fifthly, as the rapporteur has pointed out, data protection will be adapted to the new rules at European level, and this is extremely important for sensitive data relating to law enforcement. All in all, this reform will make Eurojust more capable of action, and Eurojust will have the opportunity to work more efficiently in the future.

With this reform, we are making a definite step towards a genuine European agency for judicial cooperation, a modernised agency, thanks to this revision, to be more effective in combating these multiple and different types of cross-border crime. Discussions on the reform of Eurojust have long been dependent on, and then linked to, the agreement on the creation of the European Public Prosecutor's Office, a creation which is a real step forward for our Union. Therefore, it is, of course, following closely the developments relating to the establishment of the European Public Prosecutor's Office that we have been working on. As rapporteur for my group, ALDE, we have put particular emphasis on the relationship between Eurojust and the Public Prosecutor's Office, because this future cooperation is essential for strengthening rights. The final agreement on our text clarifies and improves links with the Public Prosecutor's Office in the administrative, institutional and above all operational framework. This is all the more important since many of us called for the strengthening of the role of the European Public Prosecutor's Office by extending its competence to cross-border crime and terrorism, which was echoed by President Juncker in his State of the Union address a few weeks ago. With regard to the reform of Eurojust in particular, I would like to commend the fluid work of our fellow rapporteur, Axel Voss, who was patient during the negotiations, particularly on the issue of the data protection regime.

Eurojust has a presence in every Member State, with an unprecedented concentration of judicial and police powers and with no separation of powers between judges, prosecutors and police. It has enormous power and enormous potential for the abuse of power. Eurojust is just one element of the EU’s own evolving system of criminal law, which is superseding the legal systems of Member States.  This legislation will enhance its powers to incorporate cooperation with the European Public Prosecutor’s Office. It will permit Eurojust to exercise its powers not only at the request of the so—called ‘competent authorities’, but on its own initiative and at the request of the Prosecutor’s Office. This legislation is a step on the way to absorbing Eurojust into the European Public Prosecutor’s office. The UK is a participant in Eurojust but has supposedly opted out of the jurisdiction of the Prosecutor’s Office. However, this opt—out is illusory. The European Public Prosecutor can easily circumvent that opt—out in the UK by using the other legal institutions and instruments to achieve its objectives. The evolving EU system of criminal law may not be alien to some Member States, but it is completely alien to the English legal system. Our freedoms and liberties under our constitution, the common law and statute law, have evolved over centuries. They are being swept away by measures such as these.

The Eurojust legislation on which we are now voting is therefore a very, very important step in the right direction.  Another important step forward we have achieved is the European Public Prosecutor's Office. In this context, I regret that Member States, including Poland, Hungary and Sweden, have chosen to remain outside this cooperation against crime and corruption. We can still join, and that would be important. What we are voting on tomorrow, however, is a major step forward in improving and improving the efficiency of law enforcement, so let us look positively at the possibility that freedom of movement will also work in the area of law enforcement and prosecution.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sv", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Liberals and centrists"}, {"id": 219, "date": "2018-10-03.json", "name": "Caterina CHINNICI", "mepid": "124861", "text": "   – Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, the updating of the Eurojust Agency regulation modernises its organisational structure, which is now essential in order to cope with the worrying evolution of cross-border organised crime, but it is also functional to the new institutional framework that is emerging with the imminent establishment of the European Public Prosecutor's Office, which is responsible for crimes against the financial interests of the Union. I would say that the heart of the reform is precisely the provisions necessary to regulate relations between Eurojust and the new European Public Prosecutor' s Office. The competences of each institution must be clearly defined, in order to ensure legal certainty, to avoid possible gaps in the application of criminal law and duplication of procedures. I firmly believe that the establishment of the European Public Prosecutor's Office will not disre end with Eurojust but, on the contrary, precisely because the European Public Prosecutor's Office is based on the principle of enhanced cooperation, the Eurojust agency will play a leading role both in coordination with member states that have not yet acceded and in all those crimes that are not provided for in the PIF Directive, and I am thinking of terrorism. , drug trafficking, cybercrime or child pornography, all of which are cross-border offences.

I would like to respond on several of the comments made. It is true that criminals have no borders. Also, criminal creativity has no limits, and criminals are using and abusing several new factors. Firstly, they abuse the loopholes which we leave in the system. They are abusing new technological tools and possibilities because – while a number of speakers mentioned the Schengen area, which enables free movement – the digital sphere, in fact, has no borders, and we have the statistics from the national police and prosecutors’ offices which show that criminality is shifting to the digital sphere and cybercrime is on the rise. Sadly, another aspect widely abused by international organised criminal networks is the fact that national police and prosecutors have limited powers in relation to cases with cross-border scope. These are the cases which we need to address. We need to reorganise powers and redistribute tasks and competences among the institutions which the EU has established, in order to prosecute these big cross-border cases. In relation to Europol, and now the reform of Eurojust and the new EPPO, of course I have to mention OLAF, which also needs reconstruction – and all these institutions will need to work without overlap.

Britain has not sunk yet because they have been in the works since 2002, and they will continue to do so in the future.

Effectively combating organised crime and supporting the Member States is one of the essential things we have here – even though Mrs Grässle now very much regrets that one or two opportunities may have been missed. But I wouldn't see it as negatively as she sees it. We have created very explicit cooperation here in Articles 3, 13 and 50, on OLAF in Article 75. We have also done this there with regard to the exchange of data. Of course, we are also subject to certain data protection regulations, which we have now discussed in general terms. Both OLAF and the EEA can conclude internal agreements with Eurojust in order to make the work more effective. That is why I do not see it as so negative.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased to present to you this evening, finally, our final agreement, after the negotiations on the regulation on mutual recognition of decisions to freeze and confiscate.  It is true that the Union already had minimum rules and rules of mutual recognition, but they were far exceeded. In particular, they made it very easy for criminals and terrorists to use loopholes. That is why it was important to go back to the legislation and work fast enough. Freezing and confiscating the property and assets of criminals is also a tool in the fight against crime and terrorism, particularly because depriving terrorists of the proceeds of their illegal activities prevents them from organizing attacks. However, in this area, our margin of progress is very wide since, since we are currently working on this very important file, 98.9% of the estimated criminal profits are not confiscated and remain in the hands of criminals. In other words, only 1% of the profits of criminal origin are confiscated. This is not acceptable and we cannot continue in this way. On the other hand, let us not forget that the confiscation of the property of crime is also a very important instrument when it comes to compensating victims.  Our tools must therefore be thought of at European level and for Europeans. I was happy when the Commission immediately proposed to work on a regulation, not a directive. Even if a few Member States, in this respect, were dragging their feet a little, it is finally this legal tool that has been accepted and on which we will vote tomorrow.  Parliament, of course, adopted an ambitious position in January by a very large majority that simplifies and normalises procedures, and improves the speed and effectiveness of freeze and confiscation decisions by tightening deadlines. Of course, this is a position which gives a major place to the victims and which has been defended tooth and nail in the inter-institutional negotiations with the support of the shadow rapporteurs, whom I particularly thank for their confidence and for the good working atmosphere that has been ours. Faced with the importance of this tool, our institutional partners responded and worked quickly and painstakingly. At the end of the negotiations, we obtained a balanced tool, respectful of fundamental and operational rights. The final agreement is based on better procedural safeguards with a definition of \"person concerned.\" This was a very important point because it could not be ignored that innocent people are sometimes affected by freezing and forfeiture decisions. Then we also had a consensus in the negotiations - it is important to say, when it exists, even with the Council - on the place given to victims and, in particular, to the compensation of the victims, since they must be at the heart of our justice system. We fought and got the social reuse of confiscated property and, finally, in one of the key objectives, Parliament was particularly united on the objective of creating a tool that is quick to be effective. Member States have been difficult to convince, but a 45-day deadline has been introduced for the recognition and enforcement of confiscation decisions.  Finally, we have fought hard to strengthen and take fundamental rights into account even better. In addition to the obligation to respect the key principles of necessity and proportionality, we have successfully fought to insert a fundamental rights-based non-recognition clause for freezing and forfeiture decisions. After weeks of deadlock, we reached an agreement and obtained such a clause for freezing decisions as well as for confiscation, which was more difficult, with a crucial mention made to the European Charter of Human Rights.

The Commission attaches high importance to the adoption of this regulation as it is part of the action plan to strengthen the fight against terrorism and contributes to completing the Security Union.  First, I would like to congratulate and thank the rapporteur, Ms Nathalie  Griesbeck, for her excellent work and strong dedication on this file. For instance, her determination to maintain this piece of legislation as a regulation was very impressive. Thank you for this. We all understand that it has to be a coherent, reliable and swiftly functioning instrument and with the directive maybe this coherence would not have been as perfect as we need for the practical use of this tool.  With this regulation, we take a big step in the EU criminal justice system. It is the first regulation in the area of judicial cooperation in criminal matters. The rules will apply directly in all Member States. Secondly, the instrument will be an important step to facilitate cross—border recovery of criminal assets and lead to more efficient freezing and confiscation of funds from illicit origin in the EU.  As we already heard, at this moment, quite shockingly, 99% of criminal proceeds remain in the hands of criminals and terrorists. This is clearly not acceptable. The regulation will contribute to ensure that criminals and terrorists cannot use loopholes to fund further operations. National authorities will cooperate better and faster, with clear deadlines and standard documents. In cross—border cases, the victims’ rights to restitution and compensation will have priority over the state’s claims. That is also why I like this proposal – because it contains elementary fairness for the victims of crime.  The text includes safeguards ensuring that the mutual recognition of freezing or confiscation orders is, in line with fundamental rights, protected by the EU Charter. It finds the right balance between the need to ensure mutual recognition and the respect of fundamental rights at the same time.

To date, The Member States have implemented the minimum measures in force in the Member States in a deficient or rarely. On 21 December 2016, the Commission adopted a proposal for a regulation regulating the mutual recognition by Member States of confiscation and freezing of assets from criminal activities. From now on, an order issued by the authority of one Member State can be recognised and implemented quickly in all other Member States. The scope of this regulation extends to new types of confiscation, in line with Directive 2014/42/EU, but going beyond it, especially where it provides for less limited forms of non-conviction-based confiscation. The implementation of this regulation makes it possible to use resources to compensate the families of the victims, to combat organised crime and to take initiatives for social purposes, providing for the establishment of competent offices for each individual Member State. The Council and Parliament have established a text providing for 45 days for the execution of confiscation orders and 96 hours for the implementation of freezing orders.

Ms Griesbeck, you were tough and you were efficient when it came to defending Parliament’s position, especially when we fought together to protect human rights. I thank you especially for that because, as you know, it was my number one priority. This regulation is one of the three measures intended to strengthen the EU’s capacity to fight organised crime and terrorism and to cut off the sources of financing for criminals and terrorists across the Union. It is important that this is a regulation and not a directive. We must deprive criminals of the proceeds of their crime. Moreover, confiscation allows victims to be compensated and provides additional funds to invest in law enforcement activities or other crime prevention initiatives.  In June, the Council, following a provisional agreement with Parliament, agreed on new rules. The general principle of recognition means that all judicial decisions in criminal matters taken in one Member State shall be – and normally will be – directly recognised and enforced by another Member State. The regulation sets out a number of grounds for non—recognition and non—execution based on fundamental rights, which we fought for together and we were successful. I would also like to thank the shadows. In the final text, thanks to our work, many safeguards have been added and fundamental rights will be fully protected. We asked, and achieved, standards, certificates and procedures to allow speedy and efficient freezing and confiscation actions – a deadline of 45 days for the recognition of a confiscation order and, in urgent cases, a deadline of 44 hours for the recognition, and 44 hours for the execution, of freezing orders. Those limits can be postponed only under the strict conditions detailed in this regulation. Finally, yet importantly, there are provisions to ensure that victims’ rights to compensation and restitution are respected in cross—border cases.  This legislative instrument is the first regulation based on the principle of mutual recognition concerning criminal law proceedings. I encourage you to support it and to vote in favour tomorrow.

The confiscation of property as a product of criminal activities is an effective instrument for combating crime and terrorism; but nothing is confiscate, almost nothing. It is therefore essential to ensure the effectiveness, throughout the Union, of the seizure and confiscation of property of criminal origin, and to prevent criminals from being able to take advantage of existing gaps in the Union in order to transfer their assets and thus circumvent orders in this regard.  The seizure and confiscation of the assets of crime are among the most effective means of combating organized crime. However, further coordination between Member States needs to be deepened. It is essential to block flows of money from and from criminal organizations quickly, as well as to improve the speed and effectiveness of procedures for recognizing seizure and confiscation resolutions.  Therefore, the strengthening of principles proposed in this Regulation, such as the recognition and enforcement of judgments in criminal matters, are essential to undermine the scourge of any form of organised crime.  What I have just said is the cornerstone of judicial criminal cooperation.  It is also important to mention the possibility of pre-emptive confiscation when you are sure that there is a link to a criminal activity; and, moreover, the notion of necessity and proportionality must be a constant, as included in the text, in the resolutions we are discussing today.

The Union legal framework in this area was quite lagging behind and did not reflect the modern development of European and national laws. Currently, 99% of possible profits from criminal activity are not confiscated and remain available to criminals. The modernisation of the legal framework for the confiscation of criminal assets is therefore a much needed and effective tool to combat crime and terrorism at eu level. The new provisions will facilitate mutual recognition, which means that all judgments in criminal matters given in one Member State of the European Union will in principle be directly recognised and implemented in another Member State. Countries of the European Union, at the request of another Member State, will now be able to confiscate assets that are not direct proceeds of crime, as well as assets belonging to a third party. I believe that confiscation of property in other Member States will now be faster and more efficient. In addition, property will be able to be confiscated, even if there is not yet a conviction, for example, if the suspect has fled. The introduction of standard certificates and procedures, as well as European Union-wide deadlines such as a deadline of 45 days for recognition of a confiscation order, and in urgent cases a deadline of 48 hours for recognition and 48 hours for the execution of freezing orders, will allow for a rapid response by the competent authorities. I believe that this European cooperation instrument will ensure precisely the effective freezing and confiscation of criminal assets throughout the European Union.

Debating this topic, I am aware that it has a much wider context. I am sure that you also hear from EU citizens that there is decreasing trust among the people in the EU institutions. One of the sources of this distrust is that the people do not see justice delivering enough justice – the justice system delivering fairness. This is something we have to stop, and we have to be much better, and in the EU being better means co-operating better. This is what we are discussing about today.  We spoke before about Eurojust, now we are speaking about freezing and confiscation orders. Later today we will speak about the fight against money laundering. In all these cases we speak about combating organised crime, which has a cross-border scope and which requires perfect and well-orchestrated cooperation at EU level. Of course, as many of you mentioned here, a very efficient way to stop the criminals is to cut them off from the money. That this is exactly what we are trying to do in this proposal. Back to cooperation, I would have wished to have a good debate. For instance with Mr Batten, who spoke here about the issue of sovereignty. I don’t share this opinion. I think that cooperation is not contradicting national sovereignty. It’s a big misunderstanding, and I am sure that everything that we do in criminal justice cooperation is to create proposals and plans which fully respect the sovereignty of Member States, which fully respect fundamental rights and individual freedoms of people, and which respond to security threats to the extent which is necessary and proportionate from the side of law enforcement authorities.  Also, this proposal which we are debating today is, as I said before, well balanced, balancing the need to deliver more security and, at the same time, more justice and full respect for fundamental rights.  This is my comment on what we heard from the British Member. On this topic, I would like to mention that we have very good cooperation with the British authorities. We speak about future cooperation in the fields of security and justice, because this is of vital importance, both for the EU and the United Kingdom. I would wish for very intensive cooperation in the future, not only within the EU itself and among the Member States, but also between the EU and the United Kingdom.

Mr President, I will be very brief and just mention a few points. The first is to say how much I share the analysis that the vera Jourova has just made in relation to the quality of this afternoon's debate. We have heard positions that, for some, were very different or even opposed, including one of the positions opposed to the regulation, which is to mix - perhaps cynically or perhaps candidly - the idea of cooperation to combat cross-border organised crime and the possession of state sovereignty. During the debate this afternoon, there were the proponents of this position, including our British friends and colleagues, and others, those who want to do everything possible to ensure that cooperation allows us to track down and shake up, while complicating the task, cross-border criminal organisations and in particular terrorists. Compared to colleagues who regretted that it did not come early enough, I will respond with the adage \"better late than never\". It is true that this may have come sooner, but this view may also be difficult to reach an agreement with 27 Member States, and therefore with colleagues whose positions are distinct. Last or penultimate point, I think that many of us tomorrow, for the vote, will find ourselves united on this issue and this regulation, this legal tool that will allow us to be effective and fast.  In conclusion, I am on time, I would like to thank the Commissioner, her teams and the Council, and to thank warmly also and above all the rapporteurs, the co-reporters, with whom we have spent busy hours and sometimes had bitter discussions: I really thank them from the bottom of my heart and tell you tomorrow for the vote.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Liberals and centrists"}, {"id": 257, "date": "2018-10-03.json", "name": "Bogusław LIBERADZKI", "mepid": "23768", "text": "  I close the debate.

Practice shows that hard-line crime is the most effective way to combat crime, including organised crime. According to Europol's assessment, various illegal markets operating in the European Union generate around €110 billion a year, or 1% of the Union's GDP. Police practice indicates that only a fraction of a percent is recovered from this pot, and the vast majority of profits remain at the disposal of criminals. Of course, this must be combated. It is important that these methods of combat are included in the regulation, which, as the eu's most powerful legal act, will have to be directly applied by all EU countries.

Movement of data will grow in volume and importance, and my vision is for an open, safe and global internet for all. With this regulation we will remove barriers, borders and burdens impeding the free flow of non-personal data. We have, de facto, established the fifth freedom in the internal market – data – next to freedom of movement of people, goods, services and capital. It is a game changer for the digital economy. The Free Flow of Data (FFoD) Regulation is a regulation to deregulate. We are removing national data localisation requirements and facilitating portability of cloud service providers. Step by step, we are creating a legal framework for the future digital economy. We are creating a level playing field for companies to compete globally. With the USA and China moving fast – as you always point out, Vice-President Ansip – and with much more data available than in Europe, access to data for companies and especially for SMEs is crucial. FFoD has the potential to create efficiency throughout the value chain, to enable economies of scale and to boost innovation, paving the way for artificial intelligence, cloud computing and big data analysis. It is a good example of better regulation, with the clear added value of a Europe that delivers concrete results. The estimated associated GDP growth is EUR 8 billion per year – equal to the two free-trade agreements between the European Union and South Korea and Canada. So what have we achieved? With the new rules, any data that is non-personal can be stored and processed anywhere in the EU – sales data, revenues, profits, stock prices, balance sheets, product design, price lists – to name but a few. We have succeeded in keeping just one exception: in the case of a threat to public security, the Member States may still allow restriction of data localisation. Companies and public administration will have the possibility to outsource data processes anywhere in the EU, but it is not an obligation. We have clarified that this applies at all levels of government – national, regional and local. Also, public administrations which run in-house cloud service systems, like the Bundescloud in Germany, will be able to use them, and we have succeeded in ensuring that the public procurement of cloud services by Member States will be open to operators from throughout the European Union. We have also facilitated portability of cloud service providers. It has to be as simple for companies, especially for SMEs, to move, for example, from iCloud to Tieto as it is to change telephone operators from Vodafone to Telia. The market players, which are the ones best suited, will have 18 months to develop and implement codes of conduct to ensure easy switching between cloud service providers. The new law will not affect citizens’ privacy. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will remain untouched. In cases where personal and non-personal data are inextricably linked in a mixed data set, FFoD will not prejudge GDPR. We have clarified the concept and added safeguards to ensure that the rules afford legal certainty and are up to date and fit for purpose, including in the future. We have asked the Commission to present guidelines on how the regulation will apply to mixed data sets, before its entry into force, and we have shortened the review time to four years. Lastly, competent authorities with a legitimate reason can access company data stored in another Member State via a simplified procedure and a point of single contact. I am proud that we can deliver rules that are simple, net neutral and easy to apply in real life. The time has come to stand up against the data protectionism that is threatening our digital economy and society. And in this case, if I may dare to say so: mission accomplished!

If Europe is to get the best from the opportunities offered by digital progress, data has to flow freely with no obstacles and no constraints. Data feeds into innovation. In turn that makes the kind of technologies possible which bring new jobs and improve our environment and daily lives: the ‘internet of things’, artificial intelligence, fintech, ‘smart cities’ and electronic health systems, to mention just a few. The new regulation complements the principle of free movement of personal data that is enshrined in the General Data Protection Regulation. It guarantees the free movement of all data and does so by leaving the General Data Protection Regulation completely untouched. This regulation does not cover personal data, but it does for non—personal data what the General Data Protection Regulation has already done for personal data, namely free movement across the European Union. It has three important elements. Firstly, it prohibits unjustified requirements about where data should be localised. These restrictions are only allowed in exceptional circumstances where this is justified by public security. Secondly, there will be a mechanism to make sure that regulatory authorities still have access to data stored in another Member State. They may also impose penalties on users that do not provide access to data, but they may not deviate from the free flow principle by relocalising the data for a long period without the Commission first giving its permission. Thirdly, the regulation will make the EU market for cloud services more fluid. It allows the industry to develop self—regulatory codes of conduct so that users will be able to move data more easily between IT systems and switch between cloud service providers.

Such practices undermine the full potential of the data economy and are thus a factor holding back the European Union's economic growth.

A really big thank you to her and all the shadow rapporteurs for that. It is true – and Vice-President Ansip pointed out – that we in the European Union still have the problem that data localisation rules make it difficult to harness the real full force of the internal market for digital providers. With this proposal, we are able to take a major step forward in the Digital Single Market. We have adopted a whole series of other directives in recent weeks and months. I believe that, with this proposal, we are making it clear that the Digital Single Market offers all well-meaning, all serious providers a chance to work even more efficiently. The General Data Protection Regulation, the basic principles of data protection, are not weakened by this directive, but strengthened. They remain untouched. At the same time, however, we are promoting the free movement of data in Europe in a way that allows the Member States to decide for themselves which supranational services they want to use. But the principle is that, in principle, the market is queried throughout Europe. And that's very, very good news. Secondly, I think it is important that we supplement these proposals. European citizens are, of course, increasingly concerned that much of the data they post in public directories cannot be used anywhere as is desirable. That is why it is important that we also finalise the proposal on platform regulation in the coming months, so that the picture as a whole is comprehensible to the citizens of Europe.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 268, "date": "2018-10-03.json", "name": "Christel SCHALDEMOSE", "mepid": "37312", "text": "  for the S&amp;D Group. Mr President! Commissioner, Mrs Corazza Bildt, colleagues. It is indeed a great thing that we are standing here today and are going to be discussing this legislation on the free flow of non-personal data around the European Union. It is a major step forward that we should establish this in the EUROPEAN Internal Market. This is part of the effort to ensure that we also have a digital single market. That is why I am pleased that we managed to find some good solutions that have the broad support of the political groups. This will provide good opportunities for many companies, and in the end it will also mean that the consumer will have much better choices.  I can mention that in my own country, Apple, Google and Facebook build data centers for the very big gold medal. A great many are being built, and it is great that we are now also creating legislation that makes it possible to attract data to countries that want it - and not least to countries that produce green energy. So I'm happy. However, I would also like to say that it is important that, in the work on the free flow of non-personal data, we pay close attention to complying with the rules we have agreed upon. It is important that we make sure that where there is any personal data involved at all, gdpr applies. We also need to be aware - but we have also written into the legislation - that there is an increasing possibility of technology converting non-personal data into personal data, and here we also need to make sure that gdpr is the law that applies. But once we get it secured, I'm very happy.  I am sure that we will have a better functioning internal market, we will get the cloud services off and we can be sure that consumers will end up getting better deals, better products, because with this competition they can also get cheaper offers.

This was critical in ensuring that we reached a swift agreement.  Ensuring the free flow of data is vital to create a competitive data economy. Without genuine competition in the data processing market, we will all continue to pay more than we should do for slower quality services. A healthy data market is the first requirement for a successful digital single market. At the moment, the free flow of data is hindered by a series of obstacles. Many public authorities and branches of government have unjustifiable data localisation requirements. Their data sets were huge parts of the market and we need them to lead by example.  There’s also a lot of legal uncertainty about what laws apply in storing data across borders. We know that many customers have difficulties in switching providers for cloud storage and that there are some questionable practices in that market. Underpinning all of these obstacles to free flow of data is a lack of trust, a fear that if you store your data across borders you may have difficulties getting it when you need it.  This regulation should be a game changer for the economy. It creates a clear and unambiguous legal regime for the storage of data across borders. It prohibits data localisation except in specific justified cases of a risk to national security, and it gives legal certainty that data can be accessed across borders. It also fosters a cloud market where switching is easy, encouraging competitiveness of cloud service providers.  Let’s make no mistake, this is the biggest success in the digital single market so far and I very much hope that we can use this as a benchmark also for agreements on the free flow of data in future with third countries.

It is a regulation that I personally fought for, sending a letter with my colleagues to the President of the Commission asking the Commission to act and make a proposal.  I am happy today to see the result that we can confirm the new fifth freedom in the European Union: the free movement of data. The free flow of data is vital to the digital economy and the single market as a whole. The free flow of data is what makes cloud computing services work. Everything from email to accountancy software needs the free flow of data to work. Everything from traffic to weather information needs the free flow of data to work. It was clear that at the European level, we needed to prevent actions which would have put our digital future at risk, including ill—advised national measures restricting this free flow. This regulation is an example of what the European Union is all about. It is about removing barriers and preventing new ones from arising. It is about making the single market work for everyone – businesses and citizens alike. It is about agreeing common European rules and then treating every Member State equally – rules that allow data to be stored anywhere in Europe without discrimination. It is about adopting simple rules and simple legislation that solve real life problems so consumers and taxpayers can get the best value for their money while facing less red tape and pointless barriers in their daily lives.

Following the regulation on the protection of personal data, the regulation on the free flow of non-personal data is another important step towards the completion of a European data market, data that is increasingly transparent, accessible and at the same time more protected. Today, businesses cannot choose the least expensive places to store or process their data. The many administrative obstacles present make it difficult to change service providers or transfer data back to their IT systems. Thanks to this legislation, companies will be able to avoid duplication of data in several places, will be able to enter new markets and strengthen their activities. The data will circulate freely throughout the European Union and barriers to storage services will be broken down, those services that are the starting point for the development of an increasingly open and digital public administration, where services and documents are available to citizens with a single click. To grasp the importance of the phenomenon, just remember that in ten years the scope of the data economy will grow almost twentyfold and therefore after people, goods, services and capital, the doors are opened to the fifth freedom in the digital single market, that of data, which will favor sectors such as the Internet of Things, blockchain, health care, remote surgery and intelligent mobility solutions , such as self-driving cars.  All this will happen, however, without weakening the control of the national authorities that will be able to exercise the right of access to data throughout Europe.

I would also like to thank the rapporteur for the great work that you are doing. In fact, you have driven it through like a Ferrari, to quote you. I have heard that language being used before. So we are all European here today, and we’ve got the fifth freedom in the EU. I am hoping that this will really allow free movement of non-personal data, which is a cornerstone of the digital single market that the Vice—President of the Commission is pushing so well. This regulation gives a chance to European businesses to actually experience the opportunities and advantages of the digital economy in Europe. A Lithuanian start—up working with data analytics now has the same opportunities to scale up and reach bigger markets, like Germany or France, as a German start—up, for example. We have got some fairness. It has been calculated – we’ve heard EUR 8 billion and I’m hoping it’s more, but we’ll take EUR 8 billion – and it brings an enormous boost to European businesses, especially the ones that are working in an artificial intelligence space. AI is a field where this regulation can really push Europe forward. In the artificial intelligence race with the US, and especially with China, we should really take note and action. We all agree that AI is the future and can create a lot of good, well—paid jobs in Europe. However, we need to invest in research, education and development, and give funding to European companies working in the AI area. These are the key drivers, and it’s crucial for European SMEs and start—ups, which don’t have access to huge streams of data, like big tech companies do – Google or Facebook for example. The free flow of non-personal data regulation gives this opportunity. It unlocks a huge amount of non—personal data, especially from mixed data sets, which have been like a grey zone. It brings legal certainty, which is a business need. AI technology is already here, and it won’t go away. The regulation of the free flow of non-personal data is a great example of such an approach.

It will lead us closer to a European common data space, in which data is shared, reused and flows freely. However, we still need to update the rules on public-sector information and encourage businesses to share private-sector data. All these elements are necessary to build a strong European data economy. As we all know, the data economy – including artificial intelligence, which was mentioned many times here today – is nonsense without data. We have to look at the bigger picture. China and global service providers were also mentioned many times today. In China they have huge data sets, they have 1.3 billion images and, of course, it’s much easier for them to create face recognition systems based on artificial intelligence. In the United States they have global service providers. They have Google, Amazon and Facebook. They have huge data sets and they can teach computers. Even when looking at cloud service providers here in Europe, we have to remember that 50% of those services are provided by Amazon, Microsoft and IBM. They have access to this data and they can teach their computers. Even when thinking about our hospitals or local municipalities, too often global service providers are able to provide services with higher quality at lower prices. The question is about what happens when data is cut off. If they do not get access to a certain data set, that is just another data set for them. The question is how our start—ups and small and medium—sized enterprises will get access to data. In the European Union we already have 56 different rules on data localisation in 21 EU Member States. Free flow of data is about our jobs. This is about the salaries of our people. It’s a very practical issue. We have to provide access to data, including to our start—ups and our small and medium—sized businesses. I would like to thank Parliament and the Council for their constructive comments and contributions during the negotiation phase of this regulation.

Let me tell you, Vice-President Ansip, how much I truly appreciate your commitment and cooperation, together with Commissioner Gabriel and Director-General Viola. I noticed, Mr President, that only the extreme right populists have been against. They want the next generation to live in the past, instead of the future. They have not given us the answer on how France, for example, under the Front National, would compete alone by closing digital borders with China or the US. As usual, they are attacking without giving any answers. Let me tell you instead that I am proud that we have managed to keep the national exceptions restricted to just one. I am proud that we have succeeded in overcoming the Member States’ concerns that data process outside of the territory would be less safe and accessible. Tell us please, dear colleagues from the extreme right: how would data be safer in a box in a cellar within a national border instead of in the cloud with the most efficient and safe cloud service providers? If they are not efficient, they are out of a job. And let me tell you that we have seen attacks, Mr President, against central government systems, and it is actually decentralisation more than centralisation of data storage and processing that can provide more security at a time when hackers are proliferating. Wake up to the digital realities. Many sectors directly benefit from the free data flows. Some colleagues mentioned e—health. The transport sector is a good example. The truck industry, from Scania to Volvo, are depending on the free flow of data to deliver environmentally friendly and innovative solutions and to speed up maintenance at a distance. Mr President, we are only at the beginning of seeing the advantages for public authorities and companies. There is already more efficiency, fewer cars and more climate-friendliness in the use of a cloud provider located in another Member State. Let me finish by telling you how much I have appreciated the cooperation with the Estonian Presidency, which managed to find a common solution quickly in the Council and the precedent set by Bulgaria for good cooperation in quickly finding a final agreement. A warm thank you to all the shadows: Christian, Daniel, Dita, Julie and Marco, the Commission, Mark from the ENCA secretariat, Silva from the EPP, the legal and policy department and stakeholders for their invaluable contribution.

The Presidency and the Council as a whole fully share the sense of urgency and the commitment of Parliament and the Commission to addressing this issue. Our three institutions have worked together closely in recent years in a common endeavour to establish an effective regime to counter money laundering and the financing of terrorism. The amendment adopted earlier this year to the Anti-Money Laundering Directive is just the latest example of our good cooperation. Turning to the issue at hand, the recent cases involving money laundering in some EU banks have shown that, unfortunately, anti-money laundering rules are not always supervised and enforced effectively across the European Union. This is a great cause of concern, and I can therefore only support the Commissionʼs push towards ensuring that anti-money laundering rules are effectively supervised and that authorities cooperate closely with each other. Ministers at yesterday’s meeting of the Ecofin Council heard a presentation by the Commission on its proposal of 12 September, an important contribution that the Council is ready to consider very thoughtfully. Beyond that proposal, we also need to consider a longer term solution and improvements to the current system. With this in mind, the Council will be considering setting out comprehensive and long—term measures in this area by December. This is something that the Council’s Financial Services Committee is discussing today.  The Presidency is, of course, fully committed to maintaining and promoting the existing cooperation between the institutions. I am therefore naturally very interested in Parliament’s views on the content of this latest proposal, as well as in the legislative approach that Parliament will take. I look forward to hearing your views.

These scandals endanger the reputation and integrity of Europe’s financial system. While Europe has the strongest anti-money laundering rules in the world, they need to be better enforced. The Commission firmly believes that we need to enhance supervision in the EU. We are using existing powers and have asked the European Banking Authority to immediately investigate whether other supervisors in the Member States concerned have breached EU law. Some investigations have already been concluded, while others are still ongoing. At the same time, we cannot wait for further scandals to emerge. We must ensure the integrity of the EU’s financial system and we need to do so urgently. That is why, on 12 September, the Commission tabled a legislative proposal to strengthen the powers of the EU supervisory authorities in anti—money laundering issues. As President Juncker made clear in his State of the Union address on the same day, we need to strengthen the enforcement of our anti—money laundering rules. Our legislative proposal is part of a broader strategy to strengthen the EU’s framework for prudential and anti-money laundering supervision for financial institutions. Through our amendments to our European supervisory authorities review proposal, which Parliament is currently considering, we are proposing to concentrate tasks and resources within the European Banking Authority for anti-money laundering purposes,  reinforce the tools for carrying out anti—money laundering tasks and strengthen the coordinating role of the European Banking Authority in international anti—money laundering issues.  Our accompanying policy communication also sets out improvements in the way that prudential supervisors reflect anti—money laundering considerations in their work and includes recommendations to the European Central Bank. We are also advocating further enhancement of the prudential framework for banks by improving information exchange and reinforcing the duty of cooperation between prudential and anti-money laundering authorities and bodies. The Capital Requirements Directive is currently under negotiation between the Council and Parliament, and Parliament has tabled useful amendments to that end. Finally, the communication touches on longer term considerations as to whether a greater degree of harmonisation of anti—money laundering rules will be needed and whether we need a centralised anti—money laundering authority at EU level. Alternatives could also be considered in order to ensure seamless information exchange and optimal cooperation between all relevant authorities in the EU, including those in the field of taxation. But, for now, I would again like to stress the need to move rapidly and decisively. In particular we need to quickly agree on the legislative proposal so that it can be adopted before the end of this term and the European Banking Authority (EBA) can quickly assume its new tasks, which means that we have no time to lose.  Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to commend Parliament for its persistent efforts, especially the work of the PANA and TAXE committees, to highlight the critical importance of the fight against financial crime, including tax evasion and money laundering, and to call to account all actors from both the private and the public sector. It is clear that collectively more can – and must – be done to address these failings and repair the damage that has been done to the EU’s international reputation.

These are just a few names of banks that showed serious weaknesses in the area of money laundering, and some of them collapsed and some of them suffered significant losses and have had to pay significant fines.

Money laundering is a very serious issue that is closely related to the crime, corruption, tax evasion and other acts that are seriously damaging our society – and we have to act. So far, it doesn’t seem that we are doing so sufficiently. Take the example of insufficient regulation of crypto-asset exchanges, or the fact that the US authorities have to help us to find certain weaknesses in our financial sector. The protection of our financial sector against money laundering is clearly only as strong as the weakest point, and the weakest point seems to be very weak. In terms of improvement, I guess the focus should not be on approving new legislation, as it often has been. Also, I am not sure that we should establish a powerful new institution. We should focus instead on enforcement and on strengthening the weakest spots in our system.

Scandal after scandal has been uncovered, each one bigger than the last. In the Danske Bank case alone, upwards of EUR 200 billion has been laundered through a single branch, in Estonia, and at least some of these funds have been actively used to bribe European politicians to corrupt our institution and to whitewash authoritarian regimes. EUR 200 billion: that is about ten times the size of Estonia’s GDP. We have long known that these banks have grown ‘too big to fail’, but now, apparently, what has happened in these banks is that the people supposedly responsible have become too rich to jail – or at least impunity is more the rule than the exception. Take the case of Danske Bank: not one member of the board has been kicked out. Not a single executive has been fired, not even the CEO who was responsible for the Estonian branch. No, they have been stepping down of their own accord, with full pay and a golden parachute. So, I ask you colleagues, Commission and Council: how is this justice, in the eyes of the people? What message does it send to would-be whistle-blowers who have inside information on illegal activities in European banks but fear to come forward? In the Danske Bank scandal, the whistleblower wasn’t even contacted by the Danish financial supervisory authority, despite the fact they had his contact information. So, supervision of European banks seem to rely on a trust and honour system, and this clearly isn’t working. Too many banks have abused our trust. Therefore, we need a dedicated EU authority to supervise and assist national supervisory authorities in these complex money-laundering cases. We need drastically to improve protection of whistle-blowers in Europe and we need to force national authorities to cooperate loyally, effectively and systematically because they are simply not doing that today and they are not implementing the anti-money-laundering legislation. Bank fines in money laundering cases must no longer be counted in millions, but in billions.

Therefore I welcome the Commission proposal to reinforce the role of the European Banking Authority (EBA) in anti-money laundering supervision of the financial sector. Parliament has called a number of times for a more centralised anti-money laundering supervisory architecture. We can see that Parliament is always a step ahead. However, we must get it right.

Finally, with this proposal, the EU is obviously putting a lot of effort into fighting money laundering in the banking sector, but we must not forget that money laundering also affects other sectors, for example real estate and gambling services.

The extent of money laundering in the financial sector is a security risk. It is also a threat to fair competition in the European Union, and it damages the reputation of our common currency. It is therefore high time that we showed a different rigour here. Thank you for your suggestions regarding the European Banking Authority. I would also like to thank you for the concrete measures that you have now instructed towards Malta, as the Financial Times has said. That makes sense, that is right. We now need the co-legislators to act quickly in the implementation of your decisions. I would therefore like to know from the Council: how do you intend to ensure that this decision actually happens to the institution in an urgent procedure, which is appropriate for the matter? Conversely, we have a responsibility to reach a decision in a rapid procedure. However, we also know that, apart from Malta, we also have serious deficits, at least in Latvia, Estonia and Cyprus. I wonder: when, Commissioner, will you initiate infringement proceedings? The information on this can be found almost every day in the financial press. Moreover, money laundering does not only take place in the financial sector. We know that, for example, in the real estate market, black money systematically drives up prices to a large extent. The suspicious reports made by obliged entities such as real estate agents or lawyers, notaries and so on are completely subject to the legal requirements. That is why I ask you, Commissioner: when will you ensure that European law on black money is enforced throughout Europe? It is clear that you cannot do all this at once with so few staff.

Mr President! First of all, thank you for taking this debate. There are a lot of problems. Several large banks have been responsible for a great deal of misery over the last several years. First, they plunge us into a financial crisis that is costing hundreds of thousands of jobs, sending people into poverty and, on the whole, costing our society dearly. In addition, several of them have actively helped sinister individuals and companies to launder money and cheat in tax. In other words, the banks have defrauded and deceived us all, all the while they have paid out staggering amounts to one director after another. To make matters worse, we as a society have poured billions of dollars into the pockets of these very banks. Why? Yes, because we are afraid that our society will not survive if the banks go down.  But it is indeed shameful - shameful for the banks, shameful for us, and not least for the system that allows it. A system that turns a blind eye and ignores tax evasion, and even the fact that some countries' authorities have helped to circumvent the rules. Now we are again faced with yet another example of a great bank which, once again in every way, has deceived us all. And the answer? The answer is some vague wording about tightening up supervision and intelligence. But honestly, if we are to be able to look ourselves in the eye, then we need to do more than that. We need to get to where it hurts.  And the solution? The solution, funnily enough, this time too, is not that we just need more Europe. The 'no' solution, on the other hand, is to give the Member States more rights, the right to divide the biggest banks, so that we no longer have to accept 'too big to fail' banks, and we must allow countries to set up sensible state banks so that ordinary citizens can choose a bank that does not speculate on profit. In particular, I would like to allow countries to restrict the unregulated movement of banks across borders. It is the greats who gain from the unbridled free movement of capital.

But these are the actions of a regulated bank.

Did you notice that, anyone? I don’t suppose you did. It’s in Articles 105 and 119. Imagine unregulated European bankers let loose in London. Your worst nightmare, I should think! Of course, this is what the Commission wants. That’s why they snuck it into the Withdrawal Agreement. They want a lawless European Investment Bank in order to pursue and finance their foreign policy, in particular busting American sanctions against the totalitarian, theocratic regime in Tehran. The Commission wants to use the City of London as its own personal Wild West financial centre. Is that what you want, especially you, Mr Giegold: is that what you want? I should think not. The Withdrawal Agreement is being used to avoid democratic accountability – not just the European Investment Bank’s accountability to UK law, but also its accountability to the European Parliament.

Quite extraordinary! I have a number of points. We have existing law: let’s implement it. I commend the fact that the Commission is taking action against some Member States – little known action that I think will make a difference. We have a huge difference when it comes to the reporting of information by banks to Member States, and on to Europe-wide authorities. We need to improve data exchange. We need to recognise that we have a policing regime which, in some Member States, is not fit for purpose when it comes to investigating and resolving all these issues. And chiefly, we give policing authorities first responsibility here. So there are weaknesses that we have to resolve. Can they be resolved by a new super-agency? My view is no. If anything, we need to increase the powers of the European Banking Authority and certainly to increase its resources. This is an organisation of fewer than 200 people: if they are really going to tackle this, they need to be brought up to a standard and a number and a level of resources that will have application. The essential point is that, if we don’t tackle this, it is another potential undermining of financial stability in the European Union. We’ve got to move quickly. We’ve done that with anti-money laundering legislation, in terms of many of the directives there – I think we are up to five at the moment, and I also believe we need a consistency of approach right across the European Union.

Billions of euros are laundered in Europe every year, which undermines the integrity and stability of the financial system. In recent months, our news has been overdetermined by cases of money laundering involving European banks. The actions of ABLV in Latvia, Versobank in Estonia, Danske Bank and ING in the Netherlands have been revealed, while Pilatus Bank in Malta has only just lost its banking licence. This reveals serious unacceptable shortcomings in the European Union's anti-money laundering regulations.  First, some states and their banking and financial regulators clearly do not have the resources to investigate and punish fraudulent practices, as has been seen in Latvia. Other competent authorities in Member States are failing to cooperate with each other effectively and quickly enough, as has been seen in the case of the Netherlands and Latvia with regard to Danske Bank.  We the results are in need of stronger supervision from the European authorities. The European Parliament, in its ECON committee, with the work around Danièle Nouy, but also in its TAXE committee, with the hearings on the fight against money laundering in the banking sector, has demonstrated its commitment to foster a more appropriate European supervision architecture in order to achieve better application of the legal framework in the fight against money laundering. But that is not enough. Further efforts are still needed in this area and the Regulatory Capital Directive, currently under negotiation, is to complement this arsenal.  We also need a general reform that will tackle the root of the problem by proposing a harmonised and effective European framework, in which a European authority would have real powers to fight money laundering. You have proposed that the European Banking Authority should become the mainstay of supervision and the fight against money laundering.

However, not everyone has yet implemented the Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive. In total, eight Member States of the European Union have implemented the fourth only partially or insufficiently or not at all. The recent cases of money laundering in some EU banks – examples have been mentioned by colleagues – have, of course, raised concerns that EU anti-money laundering rules are not being effectively monitored and enforced. A failure that has fatal consequences for the integrity and reputation of the European financial sector and also for the financial stability of certain banks. Criticism also comes from the supervisors. The chairwoman of the SSM, Ms Nouy, says that the current supervisory instruments are not sufficient to adequately supply money laundering practices. President Draghi, who has now said at an ECON meeting in September that he, too, is committed to a central supervisory authority, is heading in the same direction. The Commission is taking a different path. It says that the EBA, the European Banking Authority, should be strengthened, cooperation with national supervisory authorities must be strengthened and the convergence of supervisory standards must be ensured. EBA currently has two employees who deal with AML. I think that will certainly not be enough. The quality of supervision will be improved through common standards, regular reviews of national supervisory authorities and risk assessments, including the exchange of information between supervisors and the exchange of information with non-EU countries.

The cases of recent months have also proved that the fight against money laundering is not fought solely in and out of the private sector. Continuous coordinated efforts by Member States' supervisory authorities as well as continuous and unhindered exchange of information between competent authorities are also needed so that the fight against this type of crime is more effective. Given the way banks in the European Union operate through their passporting rights for different Member States, it makes sense to think about stronger European controls.

The huge amount of dirty money flowing into Europe is a scandal and has to be urgently tackled. What we can see in recent money laundering cases around Europe is that often, even if the legislation is in place, the rules are not properly supervised and implemented. Enforcement is carried out by different national authorities that often have different standards and sometimes do not cooperate enough. Thus the Commission must ensure that anti—money laundering rules are timely and consistently transposed, implemented and enforced in the EU Member States.

The warning low cross-border cooperation of national supervisory authorities is also evidenced by the revelations in connection with the Panama Papers case that 21 billion capital of illegal origin has flows into various banks in the EU from Russia.

There are at least two serious reasons. Many of you mentioned here that we have to stop the reputational risk to the European banking and financial sector. The second thing has been mentioned many times here, the illicit money – the money which comes to Europe to be laundered – serves in many cases to finance organised crime, trafficking in human beings, drugs trafficking and terrorism. So this is indeed connected with the previous discussions we had here today which concerned the need to be better in ensuring security in Europe. I would like to answer the direct question of Mr Giegold, there were two questions: when will I guarantee that there will be no money laundering in Europe and the second was about when the Commission will do something. Maybe it’s not exact but you asked about the activities and actions of the Commission, the current ones and what are the plans. The second question was on the capacities, so let me briefly answer. While the role of the Commission is clear, we have in fact four roles here: set the rules, enforce the rules in the Member States, monitor the application of the rules, and then the forth role, which I call a fireman role, to act in case there is an incident, which are the cases we are talking about today here. First on the rules, as I said before, I think that the EU has the best system compared with the global systems, or the systems which work outside Europe. They cover prevention, which cover very thorough due diligence, checking of further suspicious transactions, detection, investigation, penalisation.  In our European rules, the roles and obligations of different players and different institutions and also concrete people are very precisely described.  There are roles for the European Union, Commission, Member States, institutions at the level of the Member States, be it supervisory body, be it law enforcement level, be it financial intelligence unit and, of course, the banking sector and other sectors which are concerned.  There is also a role for individuals, and it will be very interesting after the investigation in Denmark and Estonia is be finalised – which I hope will be next year, because the investigations already started – to understand better who failed, what failed. Were there rules which allowed these failures, by leaving some gaps and loopholes, or was it the failure at the level of the institutions? Was it the supervisor or were there concrete people working in the banks who committed some wrongdoing by negligence or intentional wrongdoing? We will know more, hopefully, as I said, next year. On enforcement, you know that we do a lot to enforce and to guarantee the proper implementation of the 4th Anti—Money Laundering Directive (AML) and also that we are helping the Member States to prepare for the 5th Anti—Money Laundering Directive. Both pieces of legislation are dramatically increasing transparency; they are covering other sectors than the banking sector. You asked about the real estate sector; it is being covered now. We are covering cryptocurrencies, which pose a new kind of risk, also for our financial sector. We have issued new standards for financial intelligence units, where we see the gaps in cooperation.  Coming back to the enforcement of the implementation of the 4th AML, we have launched infringements in the case of 16 Member States, we have referred two Member States for the lack of notification to the Court. So we are pushing very intensively, and I must say that the Member States take it seriously and we are in constant dialogue. Now a little bit on the monitoring role. We are of course monitoring the situation in all the Member States, but the enhanced monitoring, of course, is in the States where we see problems. You know that I am working very intensively on the Maltese situation. Very probably we will issue an opinion – following the European Banking Authority’s (EBA) findings – on the Maltese case in the middle of November. We are monitoring the situation in Latvia, and of course now in Denmark, Estonia, in Cyprus and in Germany. The detection of problematic places is quite precise thanks to the continuous risk analysis we are doing, and we are monitoring very precisely. The last thing which I wanted to mention is the role of the fireman. The Commission acts when something wrong is happening. I think that it shouldn’t be the role of the Commission, because we have quite limited competences here. You know that in the case of Malta, in the case now of Denmark, I asked the European Banking Authority to go to the country and to run the investigation. This is the core principle which we introduce in the new legislation, that the European Banking Authority should be equipped with the competences to collect the data, to coordinate and to act in case of first alert that there is something wrong happening. I am sure that if the EBA had had the competence before the Danske Bank problem, there would have been some action between 2007 and 2015 when money laundering in the scope of EUR 200 billion was up and running. It would have been a solution. I believe that we are proposing something which will be very practical for these emergency situations. Why have such a competence on a European level? Well, because if one Member State fails, it is a problem for the whole of Europe. We have to improve shared management and by taking part of the power we are also taking part of the responsibility, speaking about the European Banking Authority. I want to urge you to support these proposals because this is based on bad lessons and on our very strong effort and will to improve the situation and not to let these situations and scandals happen again. A last comment on the capacities. For the European Banking Authority it is foreseen that by 2020 they should have 12 people, but in case of need I am sure that the capacities will be enlarged. What if not this? This is a cardinal and key issue and problem we face in Europe, as I said at the beginning, connected with endangering our security. I’m sure that the capacities will be deployed on the necessary level and the same applies for the Commission. You know that Mr Juncker promised to enlarge the capacities in my DG. We have now a very well—working unit dealing with the matters connected with financial crime. We will increase the capacities. The experts who are in my team are now intensively working on the European list of high—risk third countries. Everything we promised the Committee of Inquiry into Money laundering, tax avoidance and tax evasion (PANA) and the Special Committee on Financial Crimes, Tax Evasion and Tax Avoidance (TAX3) would happen, we are now doing, because this is a very serious situation and this is a very big task ahead of us.

Indeed, many actors at local level have made great efforts to welcome and ensure access to services such as housing, healthcare and education and enabling long—term integration of migrants and refugees.  As I already mentioned yesterday morning, during more than two years the Commission proposal on the Dublin reform has been on the table. Many options have been considered by the Council. However, none of the solutions proposed by successive presidencies have gained the required support. Based on the work of the Bulgarian Presidency and previous presidencies, the Austrian Presidency has continued to work with you to find a consensus to reform it, based on a balance of responsibility and solidarity.  Mandatory allocation, which is at the heart of Parliament’s mandate, continues to be the main stumbling block in the negotiations in the Council, and this divides not only the Member States, but also the populations of the Member States. We conducted bilateral talks with all Member States in August, in order to find possible middle ground. This issue was also discussed at the informal summit in Salzburg, and we will have a discussion at the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 12 October. The aim is to present the outcome to Heads of State and Government at the European Council on 18 October. We are also working on the other files to find a solution to the whole package.  This morning we were reminded of the tragedy of Lampedusa. I want to underline that we have to ensure that no more lives are lost at sea. The objective remains to remove the incentive to undertake risky journeys by sea. I would also like to mention that in December 2016 the Council adopted conclusions on the integration of third country nationals. On this occasion, Member States recognised the important role of regional and local authorities, civil society and social partners, as well as local partners and communities in the integration process. Member States were notably invited to focus their efforts on early integration measures in order to enable early access to education, vocational training and to the labour market. We all know that local and regional authorities play a key part in ensuring the reception of asylum seekers’ access to services and long—term integration into host communities. On the question of direct funding for cities and regions and granting them direct access to relevant funding, I can say the following. The Multiannual Financial Framework provides long—term predictability for all policy areas covered by the Union, including integration measures. The integration of third country nationals is explicitly mentioned in the AMIF Regulation. Local and regional authorities are eligible entities, the funds being channelled through the respective administrations of Member States. In order to achieve the greatest added value, AMIF pursues strategies designed to promote the integration of third country nationals at national, local and/or regional level, where appropriate.  In view of the next programing period 2021—2027, the long—term integration measures are proposed by the Commission to be included in the European Social Fund+. This Fund should focus on integration in the labour market, leaving early integration measures to the new Asylum and Migration Fund (AMF). The Asylum and Migration Fund, which is part of the MFF post-2020 package, should facilitate even more access to Union funding. It should, as proposed by the Commission, take into consideration the crucial role played by local and regional authorities and civil society organisations in the field of integration.  In general, the AMF should promote early integration measures for the social and economic inclusion of third country nationals preparing their active participation in, and their acceptance by, the receiving society, in particular with the involvement of local or regional authorities and civil society organisations. These actions should benefit from a higher cofinancing rate. Long—term integration measures should be covered by the European Social Fund+ in the MFF post 2020.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Minister for the Presidents of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. On behalf of my colleague Mr Avramopoulos, who is due to represent the Commission today at the EU-Western Balkans Conference in Tirana, I would like to respond to your questions as follows, on the basis that we, as the Commission, are trying to formulate a balanced migration policy, while achieving solidarity, sustainability and wise solutions, especially at local and regional level. Local authorities and regions are crucial partners on the ground for many issues of migration and the refugee task. That is why it is very important to us to support our communities. I am grateful to Parliament for the interest, your advice and also for your support on the road to reformof the common European asylum law. We should do everything we can to make not only progress but also decisions before the European elections. Of the Commission's seven legislative proposals, five are actually expected to reach an agreement, and the agreement now being reached and adopted seems to be a common objective of the Council presidents and all those involved. The reform of the Dublin system. Let us not deceive ourselves: this was a system which, with 30 000, 40 000 refugees per year, was a reasonable task for the countries most affected, Bulgaria, Greece, Italy, Spain, Malta and Cyprus. For a larger number, it was an overburden. That is why my first question to all of us – contrary to my text, incidentally – is not every refugee reaching Europe a task for the whole of Europe, for the common Union? In the summer, the Commission dealt with a number of individual cases – ships in the Mediterranean, Valencia, Barcelona, Napoli, Valetta – in order to ensure that the refugees on these boats reached safe European ground. That is why we were grateful that there were Member States that offered to do the same. Consider: what if a boat went down on the high seas in the next few weeks, a disaster would come? We would all be rightly embarrassed. And I believe – and I want to make this very clear here as an experienced Commissioner – that the European Union should be prepared to comply with all obligations under international law, the law of the sea, the Geneva Convention on Refugees, the Convention on Human Rights and the rule of law, at any European level. Europe must not be confronted with the question: is international law, is the Refugee Convention, is the law of the sea only of limited importance to you? It must remain our legal basis. We should find a sustainable solution and not just for each individual case, for each individual ship. As the Commission, we are counting on the European Council not only to advise on this, but also to come up with wise, solidarity-based solutions. The protection of external borders plays a role in this, and return agreements in third countries play a role in this. But it is also about smart solidarity within the Member States of the European Union. Achieving agreement on the Dublin Regulation would be an ambitious goal that should be achieved before the end of the year or at the latest before the European elections. The Commission is ready to provide any assistance. When regions and municipalities ask what the European Union and Europe's budget can do: the new Asylum and Migration Fund for the next Multiannual Financial Framework, which we presented in June, provides far more resources, better access and unbureaucratic provisions for local and regional authorities. The sooner we adopt the next budgetary framework, the sooner municipalities will have early clarity on Europe's financial partnership with the tasks of integration, accommodation and implementation of procedures, which exist at local and regional level. It is also about more incentives for Member States, for example a higher EU contribution to the financing of integration measures. We are talking about a programming authority that has been operating for seven years. We also want to be particularly affected in municipalities – Let me give an example: Samos, we have a so-called hotspot there – improving infrastructure – water, sewage, infrastructure in general – and we can offer European funds here so that municipalities and cities that do more, which should also do more geographically, are relieved of what they are coming to, in order to relieve people arriving in Europe. to organize a decent life. We support the development of appropriate contingency plans and have also earmarked funds for this in the European budget. The European Support Agency that we are now developing has a guidelines on emergency planning in the reception system and offer assistance to all regional partners. We are making conferences best practice, academies between practitioners and local politics, and we want to help as much as we as the Commission can. I would like to mention the European Migration Forum – a platform for civil society and local authorities – where we discuss migration management issues on the ground and try to find solutions. In the context of the network of Member State authorities working in the field of immigration, we have provided for measures to strengthen cooperation between all levels and we also have funding for this in the 2018, 2019 and 2020 budgets that we can offer. Study visits for professionals we organise: we call on the local authorities to come to the Commission so that we can offer our network, our advice, our experience and also some modest financial resources. And it is clear that it is also a question of legal immigration to Europe, to the labour market. It is about reducing irregular migration through orderly gates. We have proposed a reform of the EU blue card to make the way to us more attractive for skilled migrants and also to allow unbureaucratic, flexible and easier access to European labour markets. To this end, we need the social partners – employers, trade unions – and we are therefore organising joint platforms between the actors in the labour market and the European Union. In summary, of course, the European Union plays a crucial role, but integration and legal scrutiny take place on the ground. That is why the work of mayors and municipal social workers, experts in integration, cannot be overestimated. We are committed to supporting them financially, building a network and making their work easier. We can already do a lot in the current budgetary framework and, with an early budgetary framework, we could and can make this work even more flexible than it has been in the past and also make it possible financially.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 335, "date": "2018-10-03.json", "name": "Elissavet VOZEMBERG-VRIONIDI", "mepid": "125065", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the issue we are discussing today has a special weight for my country, Greece. Large regions of the island and mainland have been home to a disproportionately large number of migrants and refugees in recent years.  Commissioner, you referred to Samos. It is also Lesvos and Chios and other parts of my country. Especially in the islands of the north-eastern Aegean there is a humanitarian crisis due to the over-cumulation in the identification centres of foreigners. The problem is taking on uncontrollable dimensions and the local authorities are essentially, with their hands tied, fighting unequally to manage the problem, without the necessary means.  Regions often issue a distress signal and urgently call for them to be able to act autonomously in the reception and care of refugees by designing relevant policies at regional level. Let us not forget that they are at the forefront of helping refugees. In many cases there are bureaucratic delays which make it dramatically difficult to manage the problem.  We must therefore consider the possibility for municipalities and regions to have access to part of the European funds, always in line with the member states' national planning for migration. Changing the legal framework by providing institutional competences at regional level could be combined in this context. Similarly, local communities which place a disproportionate burden on the management of refugees must also be supported.  The European Union's cooperation with local authorities will also make a decisive contribution to the fight against the exploitation and smuggling of migrants, which has unfortunately been on the increase in recent years in the Mediterranean. Above all, in each Member State, effective involvement of regional authorities in the central planning and implementation of migration policy is required. This is the only way to effectively manage all aspects of the humanitarian crisis.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 336, "date": "2018-10-03.json", "name": "Claude MORAES", "mepid": "4519", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group. – Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for the introduction. Like the previous speaker, I want to concentrate, on behalf of my Group, immediately on the point raised by the oral question, which is the heart of the matter: the matter of how local and regional authorities are dealing with the crisis.  I make no apology for looking at the issue of Greece. I know many other regions will be spoken about by other Members too, because this is about the immediate problems. For example, many of us have been to those regions: Moria, for example, is now dangerously overcrowded. Its current population reaches more than 9 000, while it has the capacity for so much more. There are significant gaps in the provision of basic needs and urgent health care. Approximately 4 000 people are living in tents or shelters made from plastic sheeting. We know, colleagues, what this means, not only for those people, but for the European Union. We know the risks that refugees and migrants, vulnerable to ruthless exploitation and to economic and social subjugation by criminal organisations, will submit to.  We know what the problems are, so here we must concentrate very much on what you were saying in your introduction, Commissioner, and I have some questions about this. How are we to deal with the issue? You spoke about more money, better practice and better access. The role of local authorities in the management of these integration policies must be strengthened.  I want your view on the call made in our Committee by the Mayor of Athens – and which many other local authority leaders have also made – for direct access to the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF) and technical assistance. What do you think of that? In the negotiations for the next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF), will we keep the long-term perspective of integration and the key issue of direct funding in mind and push for effective and sustainable solutions?  We have a crisis. We have the ability to solve that crisis. It’s particularly good that you are here today to go more in depth on what you talked about in your introduction and tell us what the solutions really are.

Are we closing our eyes to the fact that war refugees – including countless women, children, the elderly and the wounded – are left behind and have to beg on the streets of Beirut or prostitute themselves in Jordan? And what do you do? You make every effort to facilitate the uncontrolled and continuous influx of mainly unskilled economic migrants. It is incomprehensible that NGO boats continue to pick up migrants until just off the coast of North Africa and then sail towards Europe instead of a safe haven in the region. In this way, people will continue to take risks, resulting in tragic drownings. We must stop uncontrolled economic migration to Europe. We have to base ourselves on the Australian model. I hope that the European Council will speed up the idea of disembarkation platforms outside the Union, because a bailout that no longer automatically results in an asylum application in Europe will be very dissuasive.

That is not because of the massive influx, because there are not millions of people arriving, it is because national governments have completely failed time and time again to take decisions, to adopt a proper asylum and migration policy.  Local and regional authorities unlike the Council, cannot afford the luxury to fail, to dither, hesitate, postpone, turn a blind eye, play to the gallery, play into the long grass, so local and regional authorities do what government leaders fail to do, they act. Local and regional authorities, but also NGOs and churches, are taking their responsibility. National governments, instead of thanking those people, are criminalising them and punishing them for doing what any decent human being would do.  Courageous local and regional politicians get punished, like a mayor in Italy who has been put under house arrest for helping refugees. But that is the world on its head. You know what I think colleagues? I think it is the 28 government leaders who should be under house arrest. Maybe we should criminalise them for a criminal failure to act at great human cost.  I don’t need to speak about all the shameful and despicable situations that we are facing, not just on EU territory but also outside the EU’s borders. I think it is deeply, deeply shameful. We are the richest continent in the world and we pretend that we are not able to welcome these people; refugees but also labour migrants.  Parliament has done its homework, and what we have done is we have bridged the political differences across the political groups, which is the responsibility of politicians. The Commission has done its homework. Now I expect the Council next week at the JHA Council to show the same responsibility and finally agree on the asylum package, because that is what it has to do.

He comes from a place that is rewritten for how he has managed to receive many migrants. He has integrated them, and he has also managed to create jobs. This win-win model of coexistence between the inhabitants and the refugees built up has been positive for the economy of society as a whole.  I really also wanted to talk about Aquarius and about Proactiva Open Arms and about the criminalisation that is taking place today also for those who save lives, but it is short on time. Unfortunately, since the large influx of refugees into the EU in 2015, we have seen an increasing trend across Europe that Member States are trying in various ways to criminalise aid to refugees and that aid is equated with people smuggling. Then, in 2015, some Member States showed a complete lack of solidarity, both with the refugees and with the other Member States. However, where the States were unable to assume their responsibilities, local and regional authorities took over, and together with civil society organisations, they jointly managed to provide shelter, food, health care and school to the new arrivals – often without any financial support from the national authorities and sometimes the exact opposite.  We Greens therefore believe that it is necessary for municipalities, regions and organisations, which take their humanitarian responsibility for the migrants who come, to be given both legal support and the resources to do so. There are so many good examples to be had from different municipalities in Europe where integration between the original population and the new arrivals works extremely well. Not least in towns with declining populations, the population contribution may be what means that the resort gets the economic boost that it so well needs. For us Greens, it is also completely out of the question that humanitarian aid for refugees should be criminalised. On 5 April this year, Parliament adopted a resolution with guidelines to avoid the very situations that we have seen in Italy today and which several others may wish to follow.

That is why I demand greater coordination and distribution of European funds, so that they can help local and regional authorities, who receive and serve immigrants.

We cannot leave mayors and local administrators alone, who do what they can, with the few resources they have at their disposal, but their work must be included in more decisive action both at national level and supported by the European Union. That is why I am not opposed to the idea of granting more to local authorities, within the framework of European funding under the Asylum Fund and within the multiannual financial framework. I believe it is necessary to help the efforts of the Member States, following a shared approach and avoiding supporting different criteria within the different territorial communities. The growth of migratory flows to Europe could last for decades due to the various geopolitical dynamics in the Middle East, North Africa, the Horn of Africa and the continuing situation of poverty in some sub-Saharan regions. In the light of this, and I will end here, I am convinced that the European Parliament's work must be aimed primarily at promoting better management of migratory flows, which is based on solidarity reception, the strengthening of services, but also respect for the law and the maintenance of socio-economic balance within local communities, which are called upon to support the effort of reception and integration.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 357, "date": "2018-10-03.json", "name": "Sylvie GUILLAUME", "mepid": "96952", "text": "   Mr President, Commissioner, all the figures are there to attest to this: arrivals via the Mediterranean are falling.

The challenge for many local and regional authorities is partly so great, because in recent years many people have come to Europe who are not actually eligible for asylum. These migrants have not fled war or persecution, but are looking for a better future. The energy and resources needed at local and regional level to provide for these people are ultimately at the expense of the much-needed energy and resources we need to find protection for genuine refugees.

Today we are discussing the same issue again, but I think we have done little to address it. We are simply giving huge sums of money to Turkey. Solidarity between the Member States of the European Union has not been shown to the southern states that are receiving the greatest burden.  I will refer to the case of the Republic of Cyprus, which I am well aware of, but it seems that its problem is little known in the rest of Europe. Cyprus is a small and remote part of the European Union, semi-resident, with thousands of Cypriots displaced living in refugee settlements. It is outside the limits of the Schengen Treaty. This may have protected it for some time, since Turkey's priority was to cause problems for Greece.  Turkey has not signed the readmission agreement with the Republic of Cyprus, since it does not recognise it, and there has been no reaction on the part of the European Union. That is why I do not believe that everyone who comes to Cyprus is a real refugee. They have no reason to come. However, in the last two years almost daily ships with \"refugees\" arrive in northwestern Cyprus, on the free track, with the help of traffickers, or normally arrive through the occupied ports and airports and are channeled through the perforated and unattended line of fire in the free areas. An unknown number of refugees drowned on the occupied coast, but we don't have exact figures for them.  I remind you of the immediate threats made by dictator Erdogan, who every now and then declares that he will equate the Muslim population of Cyprus with the Christian one. This poses a huge risk to the Cypriot people. Cyprus cannot be transformed into a new Moria, both because of size and circumstances, nor can it be Islamized.  Therefore, under no circumstances is juncker's proposal to give funds to Cyprus in exchange for the permanent residence of unknown migrants. Cypriots have no proof that they are not racist or xenophobic. We are a peaceful people who respect and help the stranger, the fugitive, the hunted.

Mr President, I would like to thank the Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she I have listened very carefully to your speeches with great respect and I note a very broad and diverse position here in the House. Firstly, we are trying to help with the budgetary framework that we have, with our limited resources – we only have 1% of the European national product in the European budget, 49% are in the Member States, regions and municipalities. We are responsible for one-fiftieth of the time. Let us try to help where new tasks arise, within the framework of limited flexibility. For the past three years, we have tried to free up funds for municipalities, regions and Member States that are particularly affected by the migration task. We don't do anything that can. Our resources are limited. Secondly, our first partner is the Member State, not the municipality. That is a principle of Europe. We work with the 28 Member States, they work with the municipalities. In terms of ESF and cohesion, we work with the regions, and they work with local authorities. We trust the Member States. We can use OLAF if we have reasonable grounds for suspicion of abuse, misuse or corruption. But our principle must be: basic confidence in the proper use of funds by the governments and administrations of our Member States. The municipalities know them even better than we do. Brussels cannot know the commune better in southern Spain, in Italy, than the governments in Madrid or Rome. Nevertheless, we are grateful for all the hints. But what is clear is that debates that have to be conducted in national politics, or missteps in national politics, are not our saied. We are not the headteachers for national elections and developments thereafter. I do not want to go into which Member States I mean. This is about rule of law, we intervene when we can. And if there was a relatively broad Italian debate in the House this evening, it must first and foremost be held in Rome. As a Member of the European People's Party ( CHRISTIAN Democrats), I wonder whether Berlusconi has failed? And I ask the Social Democrats whether the Social Democrats in Italy have not done enough too, and that is why the development has come as it has come? We are making an effort, our resources are limited. In the next budgetary framework, if this is adopted in the House, we will have more resources. We want to significantly increase funding for migration and we want to look after refugees by 2025, because they are all born. For me, the debate is far too much directed into the present and the past. Over the next decade, we will have refugees who are now 8, 10, 12, 14 years old, living in Mali, Congo, Niger, Nigeria. We must give them a perspective in the interests of a fair partnership. And it cannot just consist – and I quote – of a 'fortress of steel and ships' in the Mediterranean. I would like to make an explicit commitment to this: Europe must comply at all levels with the obligations of international law, the law of the sea, international law, the Geneva Convention on Refugees, the Convention on Human Rights, which we have signed, not only in Sunday speeches, but also every day in operational practice. Or– let us discuss it: if someone in European politics wants to cancel these international obligations, he should say it here and not break the rules in daily practice, as is increasingly being tried in the grey area or at least publicly announced. I believe that an ethos, a code, is crucial here. Do we stick to the commitments we have signed, yes or no? Platforms outside the EU: It was the European Council in June. Egypt, Morocco: You don't want to. Our diplomats are everywhere. So far, there is no state, no government, neither in the Maghreb nor in the Sahel, nor in the sub-Saharan region, which are willing or even interested in setting up centres for people in need. We are doing everything we can to further question this, but so far it has been an illusion rather than a practical solution. We may put pressure on Turkey. Greetings God, I just need that! Sorry, Erdogan is not a guy who responds constructively to pressure. Where we have refugee camps, give us money, the second tranche is being negotiated in the Council and Parliament these days to finance 1.2 million people a decent life, shelter, cold, heat, electricity, clothing, food, and for 300 000 children 8000 teachers for basic education. This could be expanded in Jordan, Lebanon and Morocco. Are we prepared to invest significantly more billions in addition to the six billion now? This could only be done either by the Member States giving us more money or by agricultural or cohesion funds. I am open to it. Are we prepared to spend money on human dignity instead of the bypass and direct aid per hectare for more people in neighbouring Africa? The second tranche of three billion is already very, very difficult for all of us – the Member States and the EU. Will we still learn the art of sharing? Do we want it? This will have to be discussed as an example for the next budgetary framework. OLAF, I offer this, is an independent authority within the European Commission. I am not authorized to issue instructions. However, if you have any indications of misuse of funds and OLAF, or if I learn and continue: assume that OLAF will then investigate every case and investigate misuse of European funds accordingly and also achieve a consistent and fair result. We should promote local authorities and not give frontex money: not either-or, as well. We need support for the external border protection of the countries most affected, Bulgaria, Malta, Cyprus, Greece, Italy and Spain through Frontex, and yet the financial strength to give enough money to the main local authorities through their Member States and their governments. I can assure you that the Commission will do everything possible to support this, within the limits of our legal and budgetary capabilities, where new tasks arise – for integration, for legal review, and also for repatriation.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 377, "date": "2018-10-03.json", "name": "Julie WARD", "mepid": "124963", "text": "   President—in—Office of the Council. – Mr President, in June the European Council underlined, and confirmed at its meeting in Salzburg, that, in addition to a strong internal dimension of migration policy, a reinforced focus on effective external border protection, the elimination of smugglers’ business models and stronger cooperation with third countries is greatly needed.

I would like to draw the attention of left-wing and liberal Members to the fact that the municipalities of more than 2 000 Hungarian municipalities have taken a decision against forced resettlement in Hungary only. Furthermore, I would remind my fellow Members that the solution is not to increase the funding of municipalities for migrant resettlement, because illegal migration must not be 'managed', but stopped. No mandatory resettlement quota of any kind would be able to alleviate or resolve the migration crisis, but on the contrary, in the hope of distribution, more and more migrants would make their way to Europe. A similar pull factor is represented by NGO vessels \"rescue\" migrants in the Mediterranean and then transported to Europe, which only strengthen the business model of people smugglers and must be put to an end.

Such misinformation is, for example, that people in those regions where the refugees first enter European soil would be hostile and dismissive.

It is therefore essential to strengthen local and regional authorities and civil society structures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity. I have often got the impression that European funds are more likely to be stuck in the capitals. Improving aid on the ground would also help to ensure more efficient management of further operations.

It is extremely important to prevent further deaths in the Mediterranean, but that does not mean that those in need must be brought to Europe. The best support the EU can provide to authorities affected so far by illegal migration is to ensure that the flow of migrants is regulated from outside the EU. We know that the majority of migrants crossing the Mediterranean are economic migrants, not refugees or those in need of protection. When looking for work and income, it is very good to apply for a work permit through a country's mission, i.e. in the applicant's home country. The hard part seems to be for many politicians to realise that this is what legal migration is and the way that our voters and citizens once instructed us to manage. The smaller part that really needs protection should of course get it, but for them it is secondary where this protection is provided. We should – in cooperation with the UN and unhcr – look more closely at Australia's model of preventing deaths and illegal migration in the Mediterranean.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Minister for the Presidents of the Council, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteurs for her excellent work and for the work she has done. I am grateful that Parliament is emphasising this issue this evening, thereby supporting the work of the Commission and OLAF and other Commission services. We take the fight against fraud seriously, we take the protection of the European budget seriously. This applies to the expenditure side, but it also applies to the revenue side. On both sides we have a lot to defend, lose and protect. According to settled case-law, Member States must compensate for the financial losses if they make mistakes in the collection of own resources. This also applies to interest on late payments, if they are incurred. And if the Member States do not fulfil their obligations, we are obliged to take legal action against the Member States. OLAF has repeatedly referred to the United Kingdom in recent years, warning it that no effective measures were taken until October last year to stop customs fraud – the import ation of textiles and footwear from the People's Republic of China, which have been undervalued, which have not been sufficiently represented in their material value. The failure has resulted in losses in own funds of around EUR 2.7 billion. Under current budgetary law, the UK would be entitled to 20% of this for administrative expenditure and surveys, but 80% would be the European budget. After our discussions and admonitions did not initially lead to any change, we launched infringement proceedings against the United Kingdom in March 2018. To put it bluntly, this has nothing to do with Brexit. It is our duty, and we are doing the same with other Member States. We must attach great importance to the Member States setting the correct value for imports and imposing the appropriate customs duties on them. Where this does not happen, no matter which of the 28 Member States, we take action, we must take action and we must also bring this to appropriate procedures. The United Kingdom has denied being responsible and has refused to pay the corresponding sums – I mentioned the EUR 2.7 billion. That is why, on 24 September this year, the Commission decided to take the procedure to the next level and to adopt and send a reasoned opinion. We exercise a supervisory role in the management of own resources in accordance with the relevant provisions of the EU's own resources system as the Commission. To this end, we also carry out regular checks in the Member States. This year alone, we are carrying out 16 checks related to undervaluations of imports. We regularly base OLAF reports on taking appropriate follow-ups and measures. We also coordinate with OLAF on a regular basis in this regard. As the Commission, we are determined to ensure the correct implementation of the EU Customs Code regulations and rules of the package, in close cooperation with the Member States and industry. We are currently working with the Member States on a strategy on how best to monitor, assess and verify the effectiveness of coherence and in which areas of the Union Customs Code a first round of evaluation measures should be carried out. With regard to Parliament's request that the Commission submit its proposals for a definitive VAT system in order to avoid losses in tax revenues in the EU and the Member States, we would point out that the Commission has now taken up your demands and adopted all the relevant proposals. We have also taken a number of initiatives to combat VAT fraud. In July, the Commission adopted a proposal for a directive on the fight against fraud against the EU's financial interests. This is a serious VAT fraud, which also falls within the mandate of the future European Public Prosecutor's Office. In November last year, the Commission proposed an automatic exchange of information between importing Member States and the member states of destination of the goods purchased for imports under customs procedure 42. I am grateful that the proposal was adopted yesterday and that the Council has thus created this basis. The new legal text explicitly addresses important aspects of cross-border fraud in the internal market, such as missing trader VAT fraud. As far as the Commission and our European information systems are concerned, we are participating through our funding programmes for the common and also the national components, because it remains a national main competence. All these measures and others will significantly strengthen the capacity of the Commission and also the national authorities to fight fraud and thus to protect the European budget. These acts are in line with your expectations and those of the European Court of Auditors. In this context, we are grateful that the number of Member States participating in the European Public Prosecutor's Office has risen to a high level, and we appeal to those who are not yet involved to join in. Finally, the fight against customs fraud, and thus the protection of the European budget and its revenue side, is of the utmost importance to us. Inefficient or incorrect enforcement of customs legislation and a lack of customs controls, there is a risk that the competitiveness of the European Union, and hence the foundations of our European programmes, could be damaged. If, as is happening here now, we take action against a Member State, it is intended to protect the financial interests of all Member States and, therefore, of our taxpayers. This is to prevent other Member States and their taxpayers from having to pay for the failures of a Member State. It is about fairness between the Member States and therefore the European citizens in all the Member States. The recent undervaluation case in the United Kingdom has shown that fraudsters without effective customs controls can bring the European budget by considerable sums, but we urgently need them for our tasks on a daily basis. That is why we have acted consistently, thoroughly and decisively and reacted, and we will bring the case to court as soon as possible, if necessary, so that we can implement the corresponding amounts. I am grateful to you. With your debate and your catalogue of demands, you are supporting the work of the Commission.

Commissioner, thank you for your statement. I hear the words well, but I lack faith. I do not believe because the other side of this House, the Council – the Member States – to which this message is actually addressed, is not present. Member States have exclusive competence to implement EU competences in this area. That is why it is extremely regrettable that the Member States did not consider it necessary to take part in this debate. 14% of the EU budget is financed by customs duties. In other words, it is not a trivial matter. And that is why it would be necessary for us to sit down and think about how to make things better. We hear that the case of the United Kingdom is not an isolated case, that we see what we see in the United Kingdom in many Member States. If that were the case, it would be extremely regrettable. There are no uniform customs controls. This gives fraudsters the opportunity to choose the weakest link in the chain when importing goods into the EU. A popular occasion for risk analysis. This is, of course, how OLAF catches the problematic cases. We believe that there are major shortcomings in the customs regulatory framework – we are in good company with the European Court of Auditors here – and that there are insufficient financial incentives for Member States to carry out customs checks. Here, too, it would be good if we could resolve this issue. That is why the demands we are making are clear, and they are also included in our resolution, namely the harmonisation and standardisation of customs controls in the Member States, uniform sanctions in all Member States in the event of customs fraud. We want a single VAT system; that would be a colossal relief.

The European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) has calculated a loss to the EU own resources budget of EUR 2 billion in terms of lost customs duties between 2013 and 2016.  The UK’s wilfully ignorant response to the EU’s request to intervene in this tax fraud has meant the loss of this vast sum, I regret to say, and it’s an indication of poor cooperation by the UK government as is the UK’s refusal to support the creation of a European public prosecutor.  At a time when the UK is suggesting that, after Brexit, we should collect customs due for the whole of the EU, this sets a worrying precedent. It clearly undermines trust in the strength of the UK customs system and suggests that rather than maximum facilitation and trusted traders, we need to get the basics of customs control right. I’m sure that British tax customs officials at Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) are as professional as ever, but I fear that, in spite of what the Commissioner said, there may be a Brexit connection here, in that there is a suggestion that the political masters of the tax policy in the UK may be using negotiation over this fraud as a bargaining chip in the it negotiations.  The UK government announced last week that it expects to have respect in the EU. Perhaps that government should respect our neighbours by supporting the process of reclaiming money through lost customs fraud and make the necessary changes to stop organised criminals from cheating the system.

The system not being harmonised leaves a variety of tempting options for criminals. They get to choose the weakest link. We indeed need a more harmonised administrative procedure and sanctions to the whole of the Union. Treatment should be the same throughout the EU. As long as we don’t have a harmonised system, the crooks continue to exploit the weaknesses.

And the fact that this is the last point of the negotiations, we have become accustomed to such important points. But I would like to say that it is indeed a great reality that customs fraud is happening, it is not only about the UNITED Kingdom, but unfortunately also about Greece, and there are undoubtedly probably more of these cases.  OLAF has calculated that the loss incurred by the total Union budget in 2013-2016 as a result of duties for loss on textile products and footwear imported from China through the United Kingdom exceeds EUR 2 billion. This is indeed a huge amount, considering that in 2016 OLAF, following almost 300 investigations carried out, recommended the recovery of a total amount of EUR 631 million, so that the EUR 2 billion is indeed a very significant amount.  Moreover, another investigation revealed significant VAT evasion in relation to imports through the UNITED Kingdom, where vat exemptions were used excessively, and only these two cases from the UK caused an estimated loss of EUR 3 billion to the EU budget. Currently, OLAF is also investigating a new understatement case concerning the port of Piraeus in Greece and representing a serious loss of EU funds. It is estimated that it cost Italy several tens of millions of euros in unpaid VAT.  We should therefore really consider how to deal effectively with customs fraud cases. First and foremost, national authorities need to take consistent action against those involved in fraudulent customs evasion and those who have been knowingly involved in laundering the proceeds of this crime.

One of them, as has been said, is the United Kingdom, but unfortunately these are cases which are not confined to certain countries, but are illegal practices that are widespread in most Member States. These are frauds which unduly take resources out of the Eu ropean Union budget, which disrupt regular competition between companies and which in some cases even fuel the activities of organised crime.  They must therefore be combated, and in order to combat them, we need standardised and harmonised customs control procedures between The Member States, so that the Member State which carries out less stringent surveillance is not chosen to make fraudulent imports. In this respect, the Commission must ensure that the authorities of the Member States fully implement the provisions of the Union Customs Code.

We are discussing a case where national competences, namely fiscal sovereignty and customs supervision, bite each other with EU claims, namely the european Union's revenue and the protection of the common market, where they collide. We keep saying, ladies and gentlemen, that Member States are not very careful about fulfilling their obligations to the European Union, and that they prefer to endure breaches of the law rather than hand over competences. I would like to mention the MFF briefly in this context, because we need additional resources in the EU for the increased EU expenditure. However, not all Member States see this as a way of mobilising additional resources. At the same time, however, we are also seeing that the Member States are doing too little to recover the EU's own resources and to protect the EU's financial interests. I believe that we should draw attention to this contradiction in the context of the MFF negotiations.

Allow me, Mr Oettinger, to refer to a classic example of customs fraud which is the Greekisation of agricultural and livestock products. That is, products are imported from third countries and appear as Greek. We have greekization of milk and dairy products, resulting in a drop in the price of milk. We have a lot of imports from Romania, from Albania, from Skopje. Companies bring these products and baptize them Greek, resulting in a collapse in consumer prices. Now we also have an import of French potatoes called Greek potato. Tomato producers in Tymzaki, Crete, complain that various imported tomatoes have now appeared as Greek.  It is a classic case of customs fraud which, in addition to the problems it creates, I think has also broken up the rural economy itself. We need to take this seriously. And you as the Commission. I would ask you whether you have been informed by the Greek authorities on this matter and whether OLAF should, at last, undertake to check what is happening with the Greek mafia of agricultural and livestock products.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ECR", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 404, "date": "2018-10-03.json", "name": "Notis MARIAS", "mepid": "125069", "text": "   Mr. The Commission. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report and for the way in which it has been I would like to begin by saying that there is no punitive action at stake. It is simply a question of us having to investigate abuses, everywhere. In other Member States, too, there are suspicions, investigations, surveys and results. Nor is it about centralisation, on the contrary! Tariffs have been a source of revenue that has been sought since the founding of the European Union – once with far more, today with about 14% of our total revenue. With tariffs, we relieve the Burden on the Member States by not having to make national contributions in the amount. Customs enforcement is the responsibility of the authorities of the Member States – a decentralised system. Some Members deplore this and find that there are shortcomings in the implementation of the relevant obligations by local authorities. We do not want Commission officials on the ground. However, we want local officials, national civil servants, to fulfil their obligations, in the interests of their budget – they receive 20% – in the interests of customs revenue, indirect vat revenues and in the interests of the European budget. If an MEP, who has already said goodbye and went into the well-deserved evening of work, spoke of measures such as those in the Soviet Union, then I reject this as simply absurd – simply absurd! In general, I note that those who criticise us here have said goodbye to this part of Parliament. But with 'Soviet Union' I do not allow the European Union to be insulted, let alone compare it. We are looking into tobacco smuggling. As you know, we have terminated the agreements with the tobacco industry and we are doing everything we can to reduce or prevent imports of tobacco products that do not correspond to our legal bases from countries such as Belarus, Ukraine and other countries as best we can with our limited possibilities. In the UK case that is at the centre today, we have not only calculated the amount with the best investigation, we have also collected interest on debt, so that, in the end, if the amount can be brought in, there will be no disadvantage to the European budget. I think the good thing about this is that it shows that our fight against fraud is producing results. That is why I can only encourage you: OLAF is your authority and my authority, and whenever you have suspicions, see specific abuses, please give news! OLAF will then be entitled and obliged to make a case out of it, to make enquiries and to avert damage on the expenditure side and the revenue side from the European budget. Therefore, when you, Mr Marias, show that there is indirect fraud on the subject of the reclassification of food stuff and agricultural products, you are giving me specific indications! I will follow them up and then give you a report on whether and how we see this legally. I am interested in your surveys.
