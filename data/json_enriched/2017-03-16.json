The data is used to assess the state of fish stocks, the profitability of the various segments of the sector and the impact of fisheries and aquaculture on ecosystems. But the data are also needed to evaluate EU policies: fisheries management measures, financial and structural measures to support fisheries and culture, mitigation measures designed to reduce the negative effects of fishing on the ecosystem. We need scientific data to apply good rules and effective fisheries management policies and we need data to assess whether these policies work or need to be modified and improved. For this reason, a European Union framework for the collection and management of fisheries data was established in 2000 and became the Data Collection Framework (DCF) in 2008, which represented an important advance in development of a harmonized set of Union standards for the collection of biological, environmental, technical and socio-economic data on the fisheries, aquaculture and processing sectors. The common fisheries policy requires us to manage fishing activities taking into account their impact on the ecosystem. On this basis we must build a deeper and more complete knowledge of marine ecosystems, so as not to move blindly and not realize the consequences of our policies only after they appear, often in a negative way. This is particularly important in order to achieve Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY) by 2020. Maximum Sustainable Yield is a relatively new and very important concept, but it is based on numerical values ​​that need to be established scientifically and based on data, studies and research. The Commission's proposal on this dossier was based on what already worked in the current data collection system, thus maintaining continuity but at the same time allowing for adaptation to the new requirements. What we have managed to achieve, thanks to the work we have done together with the shadow rapporteurs, with whom there has been great agreement on this report and great sharing especially in difficult moments of discussion with the Council, is an expanded scope in to understand the collection of data for the protection of the marine environment, i.e. data used to assess the impact of fishing on the marine ecosystem, including vulnerable marine areas and the most sensitive species and habitats. This, of course, together with the data necessary for the sustainable management of all commercially exploited species and in particular for the achievement of good ecological status by 2020. We have included the need to cover those so-called data deficient fisheries, ie without necessary current support of scientific knowledge; we also wanted these data to be available to everyone: institutions, researchers, environmental associations and anyone interested in studying and evaluating them. But we have also set tighter deadlines for Member States to respond to requests for data from end users and other stakeholders. We are moving in the direction of databases at the regional level, this is important because the data are collected on larger marine areas and in a standardized and harmonized way. We will also collect data on aquaculture, both on a biological and socio-economic level; we will collect data on recreational fishing, although in this case we were partially defeated because it was important to enter socio-economic data but we did not make it; we still have the environmental impact of fishing recreational.We have insisted that an adequate and comprehensive number of mandatory research campaigns at sea be achieved, to be established at Union level, and finally, following a long tug-of-war with the Council, we have achieved that most of thedata collection, in particular the list of which data and which categories of data to collect, is adopted through delegated acts.In this way we have defended the prerogatives of the European Parliament which must be able to evaluate and pronounce on such important acts.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 2, "date": "2017-03-16.json", "name": "Marco AFFRONTE", "mepid": "124797", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, can I just say a few words on behalf of Commissioner Vella, who would very much have liked to have been here for this discussion, but who unfortunately could not travel. Data collection might seem a rather technical issue, but it is – as we have just heard – fundamental to work in this area. It has been said that if you do not measure it, you cannot manage it, and management of our fish stocks is of critical importance for the stocks themselves and for the livelihood of our fishing communities. The European Parliament and the Council recognised this at the time of the adoption of the common fisheries policy, making a common declaration calling on the Commission to fast-track the review of the data collection framework. The Commission delivered, and today I am happy to see that we have reached a political agreement on the new regulation, which can finally be adopted and published. This will enable the scientific institutions in Member States to start collecting the necessary data for all the new requirements of the CFP. This has been possible thanks to this House’s will to tackle efficiently such a technical subject. We can now move one step forward towards enhancing regional cooperation in data collection, which has been an important objective of the CFP reforms. The data collection framework is essential for the implementation of the CFP as it provides the basic data for scientific advice on fishing quotas and on impact assessments for the evolution of EU fisheries. The recast was focused on two main issues. First, to ensure delivery on CFP reform objectives, providing the scientific data necessary for sustainable fisheries and aquaculture, while protecting the marine ecosystem and reducing discards and, at the same time, achieving economic, social, unemployment benefits and food security. Second, to simplify the current system: collect only what is needed, remove overlaps and reduce the number of rules at EU level. Overall, as has been recognised, the current framework has proven to be fit for purpose, and therefore the basic principles will not change. EU multiannual programmes are agreed and adopted at EU level and then implemented by national work plans in which Member States divide tasks amongst themselves. Basic data storage will remain at Member State level, and Member States will remain responsible for ensuring that good quality data is available to end users such as the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.  An important issue that was debated in the final stages between Parliament and Council was the adoption procedure for the multiannual programmes on data collection, which define the detailed data requirements, the list of scientific surveys at sea and thresholds for the obligation to collect data. We are satisfied with the final compromise, which splits up the multiannual programme in a delegated act for the data requirements and implementing acts for the thresholds and the list of surveys.

I would like to extend my warmest thanks to the rapporteur, Marco Affronte, who has done very constructive work on this. It was a good cooperation with the shadow reporters too. And we all agreed that collecting data from the fishing sector, but also from recreational fishing and aquaculture, is an important basis for assessing the current situation of fish stocks, i.e. the stocks. We are there and are making multi-year, multi-species plans for the Baltic Sea, we are now with the North Sea, continue to the west-east Atlantic and then afterwards also to the Mediterranean. And for this it is absolutely necessary that we have scientifically based data available. Everyone has to cooperate, all stakeholders who are, so to speak, involved in the system. The sector plays a very decisive and major role, i.e. professional fishing. She is of course obliged to document the data on her landed catch anyway and to give it to the responsible authorities. But we also want to tackle this in the area of ​​recreational fishing. This is increasingly a sector that we are grappling with because, firstly, it is of great economic importance, but secondly, of course, the fishing mortality of different fish species also plays a very decisive role. It is therefore necessary that we also collect data there. In the area of ​​aquaculture, I would like to say that this is of course also very important for supplying the population with fish and fish products. Europe is the largest import market in the world. We can only realize about a third with our own resources and supply our population, our customers. Everything else is imports. That is why we pay particular attention to the area of ​​aquaculture, the circular economy. But of course we also need data for this. Right, Commissioner, you mentioned that: it is necessary for us to be able to enforce the common fisheries policy, the basic regulation, even more precisely in the future. The International Council for the Exploration of the Sea then of course also needs data. You can certainly also collect these alone with your research vessels, but not to the same extent as if we include the three sectors - that is, commercial fishing, which brings quoted catches, but also unquoted catches, recreational fishing, which ultimately also provide their data must, and in aquaculture it should be in a special way the marine area, that is, aquaculture that takes place in the coastal areas, that we have the data there to also get feedback on what effect it actually has on the ecosystem. The interaction between the individual species also plays a role. In this respect, I have to say, we have achieved good results and, as a Parliament, have prevailed over the Council to such an extent that the delegated acts are clearly defined: Who has to do what? It is clearly clear that the mandatory data collection applies to the open sea and that the threshold values ​​are specified there. This is decided as an implementing act, so to speak, jointly between the Council and the Commission, and the delegated acts remain, so to speak, with the possibility of objection by Parliament - everything that relates to the basic regulation.

I think we have concluded a good regulation. As a shadow rapporteur by the Socialists and Democrats for this diploma, I emphasize that scientific fisheries data have been essential for knowledge-based management and decision-making. The review that we approve here opens up new possibilities for cooperation between Member States, making cooperation at regional level coherent. As I myself come from a scientific institution that deals with fishing data, I reinforce the importance of the consistency of the information collected. This new regulation also emphasizes the possibility of scientific cruises and not only the acquisition of biological data for the discharge of commercial fishing. Scientific cruises, independent of commercial fishing, are essential to complete a holistic view of resources. Another very relevant aspect is the greater transparency in access to data resulting from the programs covered by the regulation. Institutions with a valid reason will be able to request fisheries data obtained from collection systems financed at European level. This diploma will foster transparency and will certainly result in better knowledge to support better management. However, it concerns the lack of guarantees in the participation of regional authorities in the planning and collection phases. As the entities that most closely deal with the problems, in many cases, regional governments have even responsibilities in resource management and may, if that is the interpretation of the Member State, stay out of the process. I will be attentive and ensure that no one is excluded. Finally, I would also like to highlight the elegance with which the legitimacy of monitoring and implementing the program was resolved.

I would like to say that sustainability must include the environmental issue. There is no sustainability if we do not protect the environment and if we are not all involved in this project and in this work to protect the environmental quality of the oceans. Only then will fisheries be sustainable, only then will fisheries be able to fulfill their economic objective. But, on the other hand, I also want to emphasize that a balance must be created between the interests of professional fishing and the interests of tourism associated with recreational fishing in certain regions.

What is questionable, however, is that these needs are better met within the framework of the centralizing vision that continues to prevail in the European Union's common fisheries policy. A vision that has a concrete expression in the institutional framework foreseen in the Lisbon Treaty, which confers exclusive competences to the European Union in this area, which has always been our disagreement. Time has shown the pernicious nature of this vision. In addition, the same European Union, which mistakenly has exclusive competence in defining the policy, throws a substantial part of the financing costs of that policy up to the States, not fully assuming, as it should, the responsibilities at the level of the financing, for example, data acquisition and management.

Everybody wins. The agreement reached by the co-legislators provides for an improved and simplified framework to collect comprehensive and reliable information and to make it available to all those involved at regional and European level. The new rules are intended to ensure that all relevant data is collected on a cost-benefit basis and without duplication of effort. It includes new types of data collection necessary for the CFP, such as ecosystem data or aquaculture data, and promotes regional and, in turn, customized solutions through the establishment of regional coordination groups. For the reform of the CFP we need data, more than ever, to measure the progressive achievement of the maximum sustainable yield, as well as the effects of the landing obligation. Therefore, this agreement is welcome. Of course, we need to see how it will work in its application, because we are concerned about what regional coordination will look like in practice, as the Regulation does not include a precise description of the role of the regional coordination groups, nor is there a very clear Regulation. It is also unclear who the end users will be, as it was decided not to include any definition in this regard. And this is a sensitive issue, as data confidentiality is vital for operators. Even in the last regional coordination meetings, the need to limit this term itself in some way has become evident, since not doing so will imply a lack of rationalization of the available resources and, possibly, not meeting the objectives that we seek in this Regulation.

At the same time it is necessary to avoid that the same data is collected several times for different purposes, because this would involve an unnecessary waste of resources.

I will make sure I give a full account of this discussion to Commissioner Vella.  We provided for transitional arrangements so that immediately after adoption and publication of the recast there is no legal vacuum. The current Multiannual Programme for Data Collection will remain applicable until replaced by a new one. There have been a couple of comments about data storage. I would just record that basic storage of data will remain at Member State level and Member States will remain responsible for ensuring that good quality data is available for end-users. The current multiannual programme was adopted last summer and it was already updated with many of the new requirements. So, there is no need to replace it urgently. The Member States’ work plans for data collection were approved last summer. Member States will already have started collecting data accordingly. When important modifications are needed, Member States will need to resubmit the work plans for approval in the normal way. Meanwhile, Member States have already started to transition from regional coordination meetings to regional coordination groups, ensuring more continuity and better involving the relevant end-users in data collection.  In summary, by the end of 2017 we expect the new legal framework for data collection to be operational for collecting all data needed for what I take to be our shared objective, the effective implementation and monitoring of the CFP.

I also thank the Commission because it clarified a point that I would have clarified and that is the fact that the data are not centralized but remain at the level of the Member States, even if I am of the opinion that the interventions we have heard, especially from the extreme right, were those of those who have not actually read the document but of those who have only made his \"classic\" intervention. Having said that, I would like to take this opportunity to thank those who worked with me on this dossier: there was a great deal of agreement from the shadow rapporteurs of all the political groups. We have worked very well, we have tried to do things effectively but also quickly, because we know that the Member States need to be able to start with the collection as quickly as possible.

President Mugabe's government has repeatedly violated the rule of law, civil liberties are being restricted, and corruption has effectively inhibited the country's development. As freedom of expression, freedom of association and assembly are enshrined in the Zimbabwean constitution, reports of governmental actions against Pastor Mawarire and other human rights defenders, including Itai Dzamara, who went missing under mysterious circumstances, are very disturbing. Numerous public protests calling for improvement in the economic situation and respect for human rights were brutally suppressed by the government, and despite his release, the pastor was presented with politically motivated charges.

The recent arrest of Pastor Mawarire is, unfortunately, another case that raises important concerns about what is going on in Zimbabwe. The EU, through its delegation in Zimbabwe, has been following the case closely. Together with representatives from the Member States, we attended Pastor Mawarire’s High Court bail application hearing on 8 February. We welcome the positive ruling at the High Court to grant bail, and we take careful note of the judge’s remarks about the weakness of the State’s case. The case has been raised with the government at senior level, and we will continue to follow developments closely.  The right of Pastor Mawarire to express his views and opinions in a peaceful manner is a fundamental freedom enshrined in Zimbabwe’s own Constitution. Human rights defenders, organisations and activists are playing a critical role in the promotion of human rights in Zimbabwe. It is essential that they are free to operate in an environment that protects fundamental human rights and freedoms, as set out in Zimbabwe’s Constitution. They deserve recognition and credit for their significant and persistent contribution. The EU is committed to fighting discrimination, to preserving the rights of individuals to enjoy the full range of human rights in Zimbabwe, and we are determined to continue supporting the work of civil society organisations and protecting human rights activists.  Zimbabwe is at a critical juncture, as a number of you have said. Continued political and economic reforms are essential to restore growth and achieve inclusive and sustainable development. Respect for the rule of law, human rights and the consolidation of democracy are also essential. The electoral commission should engage with all parties to agree on an electoral framework for the 2018 elections. Our overall objective remains to re-engage fully with a stable and democratic Zimbabwe. I would like to recall the EU’s continuing commitment to the people of Zimbabwe and emphasise that the EU remains amongst the most important donors to that country.

Anyone who has visited the Crimean Tatars at home on the peninsula in recent years knows what the renewed loss of their homeland and the loss of all their rights means for this group of Ukrainian citizens, who knows what it means a few decades after their rehabilitation Against the persecution under Stalin to be at the center of systematic criminalization and persecution. I think it is good that colleagues from all the other groups have come to an understanding with all of us to adopt this resolution today with a very broad consensus against the annexation of Crimea, against the ongoing occupation of Crimea. It is for the Ukrainians in Crimea and it is extremely important for the Ukrainians in their country that we show solidarity against the injustice, against the violation of international law by Russia. When we worked out this resolution, which of course relates very strongly and with good reason to the Crimea, new facts were created in the areas of Luhansk and Donetsk which were occupied with Russian aid. Not only is the ruble a means of payment in the Luhansk area, but Russian passports are recognized and Ukrainian companies are nationalized. Dear colleagues from the Rada! I would like to use this debate as an opportunity to say again that the sanctions that the European Union has adopted against breaches of international law must not be called into question. With these sanctions we defend security and order on this continent. Those who repeatedly question the sanctions are not only endangering the people who get caught up in the injustice mills of Russian persecution in Crimea or in eastern Ukraine, they are also endangering the future of security and stability on the entire continent.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "Verts/ALE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Greens and regionalists"}, {"id": 53, "date": "2017-03-16.json", "name": "Anna FOTYGA", "mepid": "28353", "text": "  author. – Madam President, we commemorate the sad anniversary of the illegal annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation.

For Russian tsars and Bolsheviks, for Stalin, and now Putin, politics has always been about expansion and domination. To destroy the Europeanisation of neighbouring nations, to deport and suppress those who protest – this is the line of the Kremlin. Next to the Kurils and Sakhalin in the East, the Kola Peninsula in the North, Kaliningrad in the West, Crimea – once an attractive summer resort – is being rapidly built as a military stronghold in the South. From 12 000 military personnel before occupation up to a figure of double that today, and 43 000 in the near future, this is the ‘Russian world’ in Crimea. A so-called ‘new world’ in Crimea is being built at the expense of the oppression of Crimean Tatars and Ukrainian citizens.  Colleagues, Russia is surely back to its imperial military posture and we must take it absolutely seriously.

At least 39 people are being held in detention in Crimea on trumped—up charges, while the practice of the transfer of detainees to distant regions of Russia still continues. Moreover, systematic violations of human rights, the use of torture and degrading treatment of political prisoners have been recorded by various organisations such as the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission and Amnesty International.  Too much time has passed to continue as if nothing had happened. I urge the Commission to immediately address Russia with a demand that the political oppression on the Crimean peninsula be stopped.

Maintaining this resolve, in which the rule of law and peaceful relations triumph against the ‘might is right’ dogma and spheres of influence espoused by Putin, is essential for the European Union.  Many will remember the visit of Mr Dzhemiliev, leader of the Crimean Tatars, to this House last year and the moving accounts he gave. The personal events of his life have been mirrored in the turbulent history of Crimea, and it is a tragedy that in 2017 we are seeing further destabilisation. For the second time in his life Dzhemiliev has been banned from entering his homeland, whilst for those able to remain from his community, economic conditions and the human rights situation have declined. Cases of disappearances and allegations of arbitrary arrest and torture are very concerning. As we saw in the case of South Ossetia, annexation is assumed by the Kremlin to result in only a temporary cooling of relations with the West, only later to be forgotten.

As has been underlined, on Saturday we will mark the third anniversary of the illegal annexation of the Crimean Peninsula by Russia. The EU is following with great concern the deterioration of the human rights situation on the peninsula. Let us be clear: arrests and arbitrary detentions, ill-treatment, abusive use of anti-extremism legislation and violations of due process represent grave human rights violations. These target especially the Crimean Tatars and people who reject the illegal annexation.  The EU calls for a thorough investigation of these cases and the bringing to justice of those responsible. Increasingly frequent attacks on the vital work conducted by human rights defenders, such as human rights lawyers Emil Kurbedinov and Nikolay Polozov, represent worrying developments. Forced psychiatric examinations of the Deputy Chairman of the Mejlis, Ilmi Umerov, Emir Hussein Kuku, Eider Saledinov and Rustam Ismailov, are clear violations of international human rights standards. The EU continues to call for full, free and unhindered access of international human rights mechanisms to the peninsula. The EU stands ready to work with the UN and other international organisations to implement Resolution 71/205 on the situation of human rights in Crimea and Sevastopol, adopted by the General Assembly last December. The EU follows the situation closely and has repeatedly urged Russia to release all illegally held Ukrainian citizens, whether held in Russia or in the illegally annexed Crimean Peninsula. Representatives from EU delegations and Member States’ embassies in Moscow have been present in court hearings and are in contact with the lawyers.  The EU also raises individual cases – such as those of Oleg Senstov, Olexander Kolchenko, Stanislav Klich and Mykola Karpyuk – in bilateral meetings with Russian representatives, as well as in public statements, including in international fora such as the Council of Europe and the OSCE. Human rights must be respected fully in the illegally annexed Crimean Peninsula. The right to legal counsel and access to consular officers needs to be fully respected. Access to healthcare needs to be ensured. In this regard we also follow with concern the case of journalist Mykola Semena. Finally, let me restate that the European Union remains committed to implement fully its policy of non-recognition of the illegal annexation of Crimea and Sevastopol. We fully support the sovereignty, the independence and the territorial integrity of Ukraine.

Just six months ago, we passed a resolution to express our serious concern at the violent crackdown by President Duterte on the users and sellers of narcotics. Today, this policy continues to claim the lives of thousands through extrajudicial killings, with more than 60% of deaths carried out by unknown assassins and under complete impunity. Senator Leila De Lima has been a strong voice, raising legitimate concerns over the legality, humanity and actual effectiveness of such a brutal policy. De Lima is now being punished for simply condemning Duterte’s war on drugs and attempting to legally investigate killings, in accordance with the rule of law. Freedom of speech and political opposition are critical to the functioning of any democracy. The government must therefore drop its charges against Leila De Lima and guarantee her protection from any further harassment. Moreover, I call on the government of the Philippines to put an immediate end to the wave of extrajudicial executions taking place, and to condemn and investigate the actions of vigilante groups carrying out these killings. The illegal drug trade in the Philippines is a serious problem that needs to be addressed, but encouraging and condoning murder is not a solution. No matter how serious an issue may be, no government can permit violations of human rights and the rule of law to achieve an outcome. While condemning these actions, the EU should also seek to assist the government to uphold its human rights obligations.

It also raises serious concerns for other opposition politicians and activists in the country. Let us be clear about this: this is not a war on drugs.

We must work with all our partners and all those who support due process and democracy in the Philippines to convince Mr Duterte’s government to stop the re-establishment of the death penalty, to review the minimum age of criminal liability, and to end these extrajudicial killings and political persecution.

The EU has called on the Philippines to respect its obligations under international and domestic law, in particular to ensure the respect for the rule of law and human rights. This includes the right to due process, the independence of the judiciary, and a fair trial for all citizens. The proceedings in the case of Senator De Lima will be followed closely by the public, both in the Philippines and internationally. The EU will continue to underline the importance of the freedom of expression and opinion. As regards the wider human rights situation in the Philippines, the EU and Member States, in various meetings both in Brussels and Manila, have conveyed their significant concerns on the legality of the killings in the so-called war on drugs. We have underlined the need for effective investigations of all killings, due process and access to remedies in this respect, and our concerns on the proposal to reintroduce the death penalty and on the proposal to lower the minimum age for criminal responsibility. We have called for the protection of human rights defenders, and underlined the importance of the freedom of expression and the freedom of opinion. The EU set out these concerns in its statement to the UN Human Rights Council earlier this week. The EU and Member States will remain engaged with the Philippines on all of these issues.  At the same time, as has been recognised, we will also continue to assist the Philippine Government in their efforts on the peace process, the economy and poverty reduction. Further to a request by the Department of Health, the EU is prepared to continue to provide assistance in support of a holistic approach to drugs policy. Under the Multiannual Indicative Programme, the strengthening of the rule of law through legal and judicial reform is one of two key sectors. In particular, the EU Governance in Justice Programme includes activities related to criminal justice and contributes to strengthening the capacity of the Human Rights Commission of the Philippines.

Moro ended up being murdered in cold blood by his kidnappers about two months later, more specifically on May 9, 1978. Aldo Moro's death was due to the confluence of two factors: the bloodthirsty fanaticism of his kidnappers and the inhuman intransigence of Italian government, which refused to heed the pleas of Aldo Moro's family and Aldo Moro himself to release leaders of the Red Brigades who were in prison. The question I want to share with you today, in the European Parliament, with you, my dear colleagues, is whether the intransigence of the Italian Government was worthwhile. We have all done the legal or judicial, political and moral judgment of the material perpetrators of the crime, but Aldo Moro's murderers were tried, convicted and eventually returned to freedom. Today, everyone is at liberty, but no one has restored Aldo Moro a life. Therefore, when new fanaticisms and other intransigences are glimpsed on the European horizon, the question I leave you with is: was Aldo Moro's sacrifice worth it?", "language": "en",

Cooperation between human traffickers and NGOs engaged in search and rescue in the Mediterranean.  On 15 December 2016, the Financial Times, which I am sure you all know, published several excerpts from leaked Frontex reports that suggest a high level of cooperation between smugglers and NGOs: - ‘…criminal networks were smuggling migrants directly on an NGO vessel’; - ‘…clear indications before departure on the precise direction to be followed in order to reach the NGO boats’ - ‘…people rescued by NGO vessels were often “not willing to cooperate with debriefing experts at all, with some claiming that they were warned not to cooperate with Italian law enforcement or Frontex”.’  This period has also witnessed a surge in NGO activity in the region and a sharp drop in rescues in response to distress signals. Frontex suggested the latter is due to ‘NGOs cooperating closer to Libyan territorial waters’ or even the lights used by rescue boats, which the agency said acted ‘as a beam for the migrants’.  Does the Commission believe that such actions constitute cooperation with the smugglers, and if not, could it define what would?  Does it believe that such actions constitute collusion, and if not would it define what would?  Does the EU provide any financial assistance to NGOs engaged in search and rescue in the Mediterranean?  Is Frontex hiding anything we should all know about, since we are paying them? I think this place should know more.

First, as has been reiterated in the EU action plan against migrant smuggling, the duty to render assistance to persons or vessels in distress at sea is an obligation under international law. This is a binding obligation on states, who are obliged to ask ship masters of private, commercial or military vessels to render assistance. The ship masters vessels of nongovernmental organisations are bound by the same duties as ship masters of state vessels.  Second, it does not help to make, if I may say so, general assumptions on the role of all civil society organisations. These organisations are mostly active in support of governments and international organisations. At the same time, rules must be respected, and close coordination between all involved in search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean is obviously key to ensuring the safety of all concerned, migrants and crews alike.  Coordination of the rescue efforts is ensured primarily by the state responsible for the region where an incident is taking place. Any assisting vessel, be it private owned or state controlled, must therefore follow the instructions of the responsible Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre. So to take this example, in the case of search and rescue in the central Mediterranean region, coordination must take place with the Italian authorities.  Third, when it comes to criminalisation of migrant smuggling, we need to be clear about the existing legal framework. According to existing EU legislation, facilitation of unauthorised entry is the act of intentionally assisting a person who is not a national of a Member State to enter or transit across the territory of a Member State in breach of that Member State’s immigration laws. National authorities are the competent body to judge this. They are also competent to assess whether the conduct of any NGO, or indeed other legal or natural person, rescuing people in a specific case could amount to a form of collusion or cooperation with migrant smuggling networks.  So far the Commission has not received any official information from any Member States about investigations or prosecutions of NGOs involved in search and rescue activities in the Mediterranean for having participated in migrant smuggling.  Finally I would like to emphasise that the Commission does not provide any financial assistance to NGOs engaged in search and rescue activities in the Mediterranean. EU funding through the International Security Fund can support search and rescue operations at sea which arise during maritime border surveillance operations. These are the exclusive responsibility of public authorities, hence search and rescue operations carried out by third parties, such as NGOs, are not eligible under the Internal Security Fund for EU funding.

Personally, the answers did not completely satisfy me, they were very general. I believe that if there have been some statements or leaks of information from Frontex in the media, then the Commission should examine this more and look more at how relevant the agency's information is or whether it is just some of the contextual theses and they are basically untrue, they are only misaligned. I am a supporter of the non-profit sector, I consider their activities important. On the other hand, if there is a suspicion that some non-profits, even if unknowingly, are helping smugglers, then this is very important information and should not end with just such a general statement. So please, it would be good to go into this more, to hear the representative of Frontex and possibly inform Parliament in some more detail. I am convinced that these problems, which are described here and also described in the media, are due to the fact that we are still failing what we often talk about, to set up some refugee camps in North Africa where these people could be. temporarily collected and from where their possible asylum procedure in relation to individual EU countries could be addressed. Until this succeeds, there is a risk that the number of refugees from Africa will increase in the future, and there is also a risk that tragedies at sea will unfortunately not fall sharply.

This is the dominant element in the Aegean islands today and, Commissioner, the deportations must begin. This situation can not remain. Secondly, from the first moment I have officially complained that NGOs are a state within a state. They do whatever they want at the level of Greece. They have no control, nor do they have control by the Commission. In Chios they have created an improvised hospitality area inside the archeological site. If this had been done by a Greek citizen he would have been arrested. What matters is what the funds become. That's the key! 195 million euros have been given by the European Union to NGOs and they are having a party. The refugees thawed in Moria, in Ritsona.

This is an important topic and needs to be addressed, and not simply brushed under the carpet. In December last year, the Financial Times published excerpts from a leaked Frontex report that suggested there was a high level of cooperation between people smugglers and NGOs. The leaked report claimed criminal networks have been assisting migrants by giving clear indications on which direction they need to take to reach the NGO boats. Unforgivably, there have also been reported cases where migrants have been smuggled directly onto NGO vessels, so it is alleged.  It is not just criminal gangs and NGOs who are benefiting from this crisis, but also Islamic extremism. Current migration policies adopted by the EU and Chancellor Merkel have enabled terrorist organisations such as ISIS to smuggle their supporters into Europe, which has enabled them to carry out a number of attacks. Opening up Europe’s doors indiscriminately has put at risk not only the lives of migrants who make the treacherous journey, but also the lives of ordinary Europeans who now face the threat of terrorism on a daily basis.  UKIP have said from the very start of this crisis that we need to have a tough but fair policy on this crisis to stop innocent lives being lost at sea and to stop the profiteering of criminal gangs and ISIS. To date, the UK government has committed over GBP 2.3 billion to helping refugees in Syria and the region, the second largest donor, and since its inception, almost 4 500 Syrians have entered the UK under the Syrian vulnerable person resettlement programme. Perhaps the EU would do better to follow the UK’s example rather than have desperate people paying vast sums of money to smugglers who only view them as a disposable commodity.

I would like to use this topic of the “migration crisis” here again, perhaps to put the topic of Turkey in the focus of my interest after we have been accompanied by these provocations immanently in the last few days. It's terrifying what you hear - especially from the Turks - and I think this deal with Turkey is not worth the paper on which it is written - and they now know it too. It gets intense when you listen to the latest statement from the Turkish Foreign Minister today, who says: There will be religious wars. He will ensure that we experience religious wars. Of course, it is not wise to respond to every provocation by a Turkish politician with a counter-provocation. But it should not be as discouraged as one experiences on the part of the European Union or the Member States. Because I can tell you that you will only get respect from Turkey if you say at some point: this far and no further. But these are - and this is what is particularly frightening - the partners that the socialists and conservatives are bringing into the Union. The membership negotiations have only been put on hold; That would mean: We have your partners, whom you would like so much to have, then also sit here in the house. When the Turkish foreign minister talks about religious wars, that is very significant, and I think we should pay attention. Because we know that, thanks to the failed policy of Merkel and Co., millions of migrants have come to Europe, of whom we have no data, do not know their names and do not know who these people are.

The newspaper has since retracted claims that Frontex had accused NGOs of collusion with smugglers. No doubt about it, but this is a very troubling accusation in an already distressing human rights situation. Rescue missions are conducted with great valour, bravery and spirit on the part of those people involved in them, whether they are the European Border and Coast Guard, Frontex, Member States or non-governmental organisations.  In this regard, I would like to sincerely sympathise with the families of Captain Dara Fitzpatrick and the crew of the Irish coastguard helicopter that tragically crashed this week, illustrating the point.  The European response to various crises has been adopted in the spirit of solidarity and cooperation on which the European Union was founded. I would hope that this approach will continue to guide our action in this area and that we will move forward. I would like to highly commend all those who work in the sector. 5 000 people died at sea last year. From an Irish point of view I am disappointed with such claims, given the European and my own government’s commitment to relieving the humanitarian crisis as it has developed in recent years. In September 2015, as a direct response to this humanitarian crisis, the Irish Refugee Protection Programme was established. In a gesture towards the most vulnerable individuals of this migration crisis, Ireland pledged to accept the quota asked of it by the EU. I wish to take this opportunity to stress our deep commitment to delivering our decision to accept these refugees and asylum seekers. At present, more than 12 500 refugees have been rescued from Mediterranean waters by Irish naval forces. We have dispatched countless naval service vessels and our commitment to continue doing so still remains undisputed.  However, suggestions of collusion between human traffickers and NGOs provide yet another obstacle to the roll-out of Europe-wide rescue and resettlement efforts. It is thus paramount that no cloud should hang over the human rights agencies and NGOs which are entrusted in these areas.

And if one were to ask a hypothetical question: if that cooperation saved thousands of human lives, who can be against such cooperation even if it is actually a deformation and not a policy? This question shows that the European Union cannot have an answer to the mass influx of refugees if it does not use force, or at least inhumane behavior. The real solution to dealing with the great pressure of refugees is, of course, to act in those areas where crises occur - humanitarian, economic and security.
