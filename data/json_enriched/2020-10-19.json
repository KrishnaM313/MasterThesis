After months of negotiations, more than 1 000 amendments in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection (IMCO) and a lot of hard work, this Committee agreed on a progressive and robust report on the Digital Services Act.  First of all, I would like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs working with me on the IMCO report for their transparency and also for their cooperation. I do not think that we would have been able to achieve this tangible positive result without all the support, which I hope you can confirm in tomorrow’s vote in the same way that you did during the negotiations and the vote in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Affairs.  Today we are discussing all three DSA reports. Despite the fact that they are interlinked, they all have different scopes. The IMCO report is the one that deals with the comprehensive revision of the 20-year-old e-Commerce Directive and the first—ever internal market ex—ante instrument in the digital sector. The e—Commerce Directive is one of the most essential pieces of Union legislation and the foundation of the digital single market as we know it today. Digital transformation has profoundly changed the functioning of the global economy and of our societies, which requires an update to improve the situation in several areas. The Digital Services Act will be this first update to the legal framework on online services after 20 years. The report therefore sets the internal market and consumer protection priorities on how digital services, including online platforms and marketplaces, should be – and must be – regulated in the future. The Committee recommendations touch upon a range of issues. However, some of the fundamental points and measures that the Commission must, and should, introduce in the DSA are as follows. First of all, introduce the principle that what is illegal offline should also be illegal online, together with consumer protection and also user—safety principles. The second point is to extend the scope of the DSA to companies established outside Europe, mainly the ones targeting our European market, our European consumers and our European citizens. The third point is that the online harmful business models’ manipulation and discriminatory practices, designed to maximise user attention dedicated to the platform based on illegal or sensationalist content, must be addressed through privacy and accountability measures such as the ‘Know Your Business Customer’ principle. The ‘Know Your Business Customer’ is a new obligation on platforms to check and stop fraudulent companies from using their services. Such a measure would reduce the number of illegitimate traders and illegal activities online.  The Commission must promote transparent advertising practices that do not track our consumers and users through the Net. To this end, the DSA should include stricter measures on harmful advertising practices, digital nudging, microtargeting, recommended systems for advertisement, and also preferential treatment.  Another essential element in my report is targeted measures on online marketplaces and here we have dedicated a whole chapter in our report targeting online marketplaces such as Amazon and Alibaba. Consumers should be equally safe when shopping online or in stores and the Commission must, and should, address and reinforce liability for online marketplaces.  The report also deals with the e-Commerce Directive’s fundamental parts, dealing with the liability regime when removing illegal content online. Finally, we are also proposing, for the first time in the digital sector, ex—ante rules to tackle the digital players’ uncompetitive practice. The Commission must, and should, introduce this as a separate instrument from competition policy.  I would like to conclude by saying that I am hopeful that we can get your support for the IMCO report in tomorrow’s vote and that this institution will send a strong message to the Commission on the measures to be included in the DSA.

Madam President, I would like to thank the president for her Commissioner, in recent weeks the documentary \"The social dilemma\" has consistently been in the top ten most watched films on Netflix. The message of the film or the documentary is frightening and very powerful at the same time.  Social media platforms have long since ceased to be a simple communication tool, but huge profit machines that play a major role in shaping public discourse. They do this by not only deciding what information we receive, but also deciding which content can be displayed at all and which may not – unfortunately often also contrary to the law. However, I do not want the freedom of expression of users in Europe to be in the hands of private companies, which present themselves as auxiliary sheriffs and make decisions that are actually only allowed to be taken by courts. If we say that the law should apply both online and offline, then there must be an end to interference with freedom of expression through overblocking and arbitrary deletion by platforms. That is why the JURI report proposes to establish clear procedural rules for the notice-and-action system for dealing with illegal content. This is important because it creates legal certainty for the platforms on the one hand, but also creates legal certainty for users and respects their fundamental rights. In addition, our report calls for a strong European supervisory authority that can ensure compliance with the rules and, above all, has the necessary enforcement powers to ensure the necessary transparency. An online platform must not be a black box. Its actions must be transparent, well-founded and comprehensible, especially when it makes such important decisions about the freedom of expression of users.  And that brings me to a point that I am particularly proud of in our report, that we have proposed that we install a system that does not require prior checking of uploaded content. In fact, we explicitly require the Commission not to encourage platforms to use upload filters. Also, the voluntary use of technical aids by platforms must not result in content being scanned and blocked at the time of upload. And I think this is a huge success after last year's debate and a step towards an Internet without additional upload filters.  There is also content that is legal but can still cause great social damage. Such content as fake news, disinformation, hate speech and propaganda cannot be subject to the same rules as when dealing with illegal content, as such content is often below the taste limit, but is protected by freedom of expression. And the problem we have with such content is not so much that it exists at all, but that it spreads like wildfire through the Internet and is preferably flushed into users' timelines by platforms, because algorithms believe that attention-grabbing content is more important than democratic debate, for example. Thus, platforms can promise their actual customers – not us as users, but the advertisers – a particularly effective submission of targeted personalized advertising.  But if algorithms exploit human curiosity for attention-grabbing content for profit, and fake news, hatred and hate speech are the gift wrapping paper in which personalized advertising is packaged online, then we as legislators must step in and take action against this business model. That is why we are calling in the report for users to have more control over their content. They have to decide what content they see, and they have to decide whether they want to see targeted online ads at all. We must not allow user algorithms to be at the mercy of algorithms that erode our common social information base and jeopardise our democracy. If this is to be the price of Silicon Valley companies being able to make more profits with personalized advertising, then that price is clearly too high, and this business model has nothing to do with our digital single market. That is why I am strongly in favour of remaining unequivocally in the text of the Committee on Legal Affairs in tomorrow's vote, despite the split vote requested on advertising. The split vote on paragraph seventeen seeks to undermine protection against these very harmful business practices – and it is clear to us that this must not happen, the business interests of the advertising industry must not be allowed to be protected from the interests of the citizens.  Ladies and gentlemen, we are not yet at the forefront of the European Union's development of AI, but with the discussion we are having here today, we are a big step ahead of both China and Silicon Valley.

Some people born in a different time, like myself, might want to go back to how it was before, because it seems like a simpler time. But we can’t. We simply cannot put the genie back into the bottle. The online world with digital services, with artificial intelligence – it’s all here to stay. The future will be more digital, not less, and it brings incredible progress that we, as policymakers, should embrace. But... it also brings dangers that we cannot ignore anymore. Let us be honest with each other, colleagues. The EU has done more to regulate the online world than any other continent. Yet, even here, it is still the Wild West! Over the past decades, we have not followed up on illegal content and illegal activities online with the same rigour as we have illegal activities offline. We have not achieved any meaningful transparency over how algorithms push content to users on a massive scale. We have not grasped the impact of it on our democracies, our culture and our fundamental rights. Instead, we have focused on voluntary cooperation, which is good, but not good enough. Not nearly good enough. So as this European Parliament discusses these six reports on the Digital Services Act (DSA) and artificial intelligence (AI), I have one overarching message: these digital files matter a great deal more than many people think. We cannot leave this to the private sector without oversight and enforcement. We must keep this in the public debate as a priority and we must regulate, no matter how technical these files are. The difficult challenge before us is to find the balance between digital progress and respect for fundamental rights. As rapporteur for the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) DSA report, I’m raising a few issues right now. The value of lawmaking is the real change it effects. If we start off with conflicting regulations and directives that undermine each other instead of complementing each other, we have lost the battle before it starts. We must respect the scope of each digital file. Secondly, the fundamentals of the e-commerce Directive were great, but its greatest issue was transparency. We must improve and enforce meaningful transparency, and I call for a clear mandate from this Parliament. Thirdly, we all agree on the importance of notice and action mechanisms to remove illegal content online, but it places the burden almost entirely on users. We therefore should complement notice and action with clear and appropriate obligations to remove illegal content, and it’s the public authorities who should provide the funding to follow up on this.

The framework of ethical principles applicable to artificial intelligence is the first legislative initiative report in the artificial intelligence package, drawn up in Parliament. The position of the European Parliament which we will adopt this week will undoubtedly be essential in future European legislation. The report is the result of lengthy and complex negotiations between all political groups, which were based on far-fluer positions, and also from the work done with the seven parliamentary committees that have issued opinions. On the part of the rapporteur, Ibán García del Blanco, I would like to thank you all for your work and your commitment to achieving totally new regulation, which puts Europe at the forefront of creating regulation that allows technological advances to become benefits for all.  The legislative report contains a motion for a Resolution with recommendations to the Commission and a proposal for a European Regulation laying down the ethical principles applicable to the development, implementation and use of artificial intelligence, robotics and related technologies in the Union.  Artificial intelligence is presented to us as a technology with the potential to change the world as we know it, offers great opportunities and carries great risks. Our proposal is a balance to, on the one hand, to ensure the trust and safety of citizens in new technologies and, on the other hand, to support innovation in Europe. It is a proposal that respects technological neutrality and provides an appropriate future framework to respond with solvency and responsibility to the speed of change.  Our report is based on the creation of a regulatory framework of ethical principles that is mandatory for software, algorithms and data included in artificial intelligence, robotics and related technologies that are developed, implemented or used in the European Union.  All technologies operating in Europe must respect this anthropocentric perspective. The human dignity, autonomy and security of citizens cannot be called into question and, likewise, we must ensure compliance with fundamental rights and the legality of the Union. Technologies that involve a violation of these principles will not be able to operate in Europe, no matter where they occur or whether they are supported or in the cloud.  Secondly, we have agreed on an approximation based on the risks they may present. Technologies that may have a significant risk of causing harm or harm ⸺that to citizens as well as society as a whole⸺, violating fundamental rights or breaking Union laws will be considered high risks. To assess these risks we have established objective criteria, taking into account the sector, the uses or purposes and the severity of the damages that may be caused. This definition is intended to avoid legal loopholes. It also includes an exhaustive list of sectors and uses that are considered high risk, such as education, health, employment and recruitment of workers, finances and lending, automatic vehicle transport, public administration decisions or environmental issues.  Where an application or technology is considered high risk, it must ensure compliance with a number of legal requirements and obligations: ensuring human control, strict security standards, transparency, explainability and accountability, data reliability, non-discrimination and bias removal in algorithms and the results of automatic decisions, with very strict privacy guarantees in the case of remote recognitions with biometric data and the requirement to apply the most stringent rigorous governance standards. In Parliament, we also want to ensure environmentally sustainable artificial intelligence with social responsibility, because ethical artificial intelligence is democratic, egalitarian, respects workers and intellectual property, cultural diversity and the right to digital illustration. That is why we call on the Member States and the Union to direct research investments to projects that offer a social or environmental benefit. To ensure the democratic development of technologies, both European and national authorities should have a dialogue with stakeholders, including civil society, trade unions, setting parameters and governance standards, as well as supporting SMEs and start-ups. In addition to establishing the principles, we must monitor compliance with these obligations. Our model strengthens European coordination and lists the tasks to be carried out, inter alia, to establish mandatory guidelines for the assessment of conformity with ethical principles.  Where proven, a European certificate is granted in accordance with ethical principles. This guarantee or seal of quality will be voluntary for non-high risk technologies.  Each Member State shall appoint an independent authority responsible for implementing those guidelines, granting the European certificate and continuously monitoring compliance with ethical principles, providing it with sufficient resources and resources.  The Commission should assess which existing or future agencies and agencies can perform these tasks.  With the rapporteur, in my group we believe that a European agency for artificial intelligence will add value in achieving a common objective, shared by all the members of the House: to make the European Union lead an ethical artificial intelligence in the world, to place human beings at the centre of their development and to guarantee our principles and values.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 8, "date": "2020-10-19.json", "name": "Stéphane SÉJOURNÉ", "mepid": "197508", "text": "   Madam President, since we are talking about artificial intelligence and new technologies, thank you very much to the European Parliament and also to the Paris office for giving parliamentarians the opportunity to intervene from the offices! Thank you also to the President of Parliament. Madam President, we are talking about artificial intelligence: it is present in our daily lives, with social networks of course, with everyday algorithms, and in our economy too, of course. By 2022, 42% of tasks will be performed by algorithms, compared to 29% today: this is an exponential measure. Two out of three companies already use artificial intelligence on a daily basis. Two reports have already been submitted on accountability and ethics. I would like to thank Mr Voss first of all for his important report, because it deals concretely with the question of responsibility, as well as how to regulate the major technologies of the future, such as the autonomous car. It also allows for a right that does not break down and to have legislation and jurisprudence that are precisely unified at European level. I would also like to thank Mr Garcia Del Blanco, who has also not been able to be with you, for his work on the question of ethics, which is a matter of trust first, and in this respect transparency is not an end in itself, it is a tool of trust. I will take the example of image recognition: used by smartphones, recognition is, when it works, a good tool, but there can be drifts, as when we see a number of police states use this technology. My report, Madam President, is also an element of protection. After the protection of ethics, after the protection of responsibility, there is also the protection of innovations, which must be protected via intellectual property. We recommend that the Commission review this issue and reset on it. Never before has the world had so many ideas, with 3.3 million patent applications filed last year, and it is constantly increasing. The question of this report is who owns the intellectual property rights to intellectual work entirely generated by artificial intelligence. My report, without wishing to discourage human creation, gives a number of recommendations. I'll name three. We recommend not recognizing legal personality to artificial intelligence. We also recommend distinguishing the creation that was aided by artificial intelligence from a creation that was entirely generated by artificial intelligence. There will also need to be a major data strategy. I know that Margrethe Vestager and Thierry Breton are very sensitive to these issues. This strategy is necessary, we need large data sets for an artificial intelligence system to develop and also develop ideas. I will end up, Madam President, with a topical point which may be outside the scope of my report, but which is also part of this joint debate on digital services legislation (DSA). The French news also shows us how much we will have to think collectively about data regulation: I am talking about the tragedy we experienced in France with the beheading of a teacher who had been lynched on social media for weeks. For my part, I believe that we must put an end to the self-regulation of social networks and an end to hateful content. We need to get out of the hypocrisy on this issue. Who can accept that Twitter accounts promote terrorism for weeks without anyone doing anything? In my opinion, no one! Who can accept such a hate spill on all networks, on Facebook? No one. Who can accept the public lynching of a teacher who was just doing his job? No one. Madam President, it is a question of taking responsibility, with our colleagues, with all the European representation, with the Commission and in its support. It is about our values, our European values, our values of democracy. It is a question of regulating social networks and going a little further than just the issue of illegal content by addressing that of harmful content. I think it is a good way to act. Thank you very much for allowing us to integrate this reflection from the Paris office and from other offices for other colleagues.

Madam President, Vice-President Vestager, I would like to thank the Rapporteur on the work she has First of all, my report is now about liability and artificial intelligence, and I would like to begin by thanking the shadow rapporteurs very warmly, because we have had a very cooperative spirit here that has taken us forward, but which ultimately also sends a strong signal, both to the Commission and to the Member States. Digitisation as a whole is, of course, extremely important and challenging for society, for the economy, but I believe that it is also about our economic survival. Artificial intelligence is of particular importance in this context and poses a particular challenge and is of strategic relevance to our overall economic development. We will only really be able to absorb competition if we actually get a digital single market, otherwise we will simply be too fragmented to face other regions of the world. That is why I believe that the Member States must also go into themselves here and sometimes go beyond their competences and say that this is for the good of all, if we also talk about civil liability accordingly. You cannot just block it and then say that is our competence. No, this is about a digital single market, about all of us making progress. Consequently, we are basically calling for a regulation in this regard, and we really mean this seriously, particularly with regard to this digital single market. What actually led us to do that? We want individuals to receive compensation as they do under normal national offences. But we also don't want him to explain whether it was the software, the hardware, the wrong operation or the wrong algorithms. We just want him to be compensated. We also want to comply with existing liability regulations from the member states. We do not want to prevent artificial intelligence and its system, and we want to move forward in a forward-looking way.  Why do we think this is important? It is now up to us to develop this. We therefore need a clear view of things, legal certainty, legal clarity, a fully harmonised framework, not fragmentation, in order to exclude the different applications in the internal market. We also want clarity – not only by the highest courts after five to eight years – and we want to fill legal gaps.  That is why, in the end, there is no over-regulation, so the whole thing is not a revolution, but merely the connection of correspondinghigh-risk artificial intelligence systems to what already exists, and we also consider this connection to the existing law to be reasonable. That is why we must keep in mind that, as the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Affairs, we cannot at the moment offer a coherent system either, because we simply cannot take certain things into account, following internal regulations. The aim here is actually to limit ourselves to high-risk applications, because we think that only that actually makes sense to provide this with appropriate liability. Other risk AI systems are in any case subject to the normal legal consequences of liability.  Because of the legal clarity, we want to have a clear list of which AI system is covered, and we, as legislators, want to be flexible so that we can also quickly point out rapid changes by providing the Commission with delegated acts. In addition, non-material damages are also mentioned, and we ask the Commission to examine whether there is a need for harmonisation here too.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 10, "date": "2020-10-19.json", "name": "Dita CHARANZOVÁ", "mepid": "124708", "text": "  rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection. – Madam President, the Internet is a vital part of our lives and our economy. Because of this, we all should want an Internet that reflects our European values, while being a fair single market for businesses to compete in. This is what the Renew Europe Group wants and this is what is in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection (IMCO) report, and for this, I thank the rapporteur. Renew Europe wants any future European regulation to respect what makes the Internet great, which is the freedom to speak your mind, to upload your creations and to, at the click of a button, share new innovations and new business models which change the world. We don’t want to over-regulate. The reason why we have this Internet we love is because we set down very basic rules in Europe and then got out of the way. We let the Internet grow organically. We let innovation and start-ups run free, and here we are 20 years later.  Governments should not get in the way of a global system that is working well. Governments should especially not get in the way of the freedom of speech online. This must be equally true for the EU as a whole.  At the same time, a lot of things in the digital world have changed in 20 years – just look at where this debate is happening. One of these changes is the growth of Internet giants. The Renew Europe group is not against such companies that millions of users use and trust. Nevertheless, we must make sure they play fairly with other companies and take a greater role in social responsibility. We, however, don’t want to force actions where they are not needed – regulation for the sake of regulation. Artificial barriers to foreign companies and the creation of false European champions are not the answer to a strong digital single market in Europe.

Madam President, Vice-President Vestager, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Vestager, for the work she has The Internet was and is a place of freedom, especially in autocratic states, and preserving that freedom is our most important task. But today, the concern is huge: misinformation is spreading at breathtaking speed, hatred and hatred are displacing women and minorities from the public digital discourse, and this, too, threatens freedom of expression. But how has this happened in the last 20 years? Today, it is a few monopolistic companies that make a decisive decision about what people see on the Internet in the first place. That is why we now need new legislation on digital services and new rules for competition.  What are the most urgent tasks? First of all, we need to put an end to an advertising business model that spies on people and manipulates their behaviour. We must also seize this opportunity to put the financing of the quality press back on a safe footing, because we need it so urgently in times of uncertainty. Today, three-quarters of digital advertising revenue – in France and Germany, for example – goes to Google and Facebook. Secondly, online platforms must disclose the principles under which they prioritise contributions. We need to shed light on these platforms, and users must have the opportunity to design their timelines according to their own wishes.  Thirdly, we need very clear rules for dealing with illegal content, that is, detailed and binding notice-and-action procedures. Transparency and democratic control, then, are also our guiding values for artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence must serve European priorities, and that is first and foremost the European Green Deal at the moment, because our most urgent task is still climate protection. But when it comes to people, we need strict rules, because we know that artificial intelligence is a good servant, but a bad gentleman. We know that artificial intelligence projects past imbalances, such as racism or the disadvantage of women, into the future and therefore anchors us in the past, and we do not want that.  Finally, we must effectively enforce European fundamental rights, including in the case of artificial intelligence, and this will only be possible with a European body that can represent the interests of European citizens on an equal footing with global digital companies.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 12, "date": "2020-10-19.json", "name": "Josianne CUTAJAR", "mepid": "197394", "text": "   Rapporteur għal opinjoni tal-Kumitat għat-Trasport u t-Turiżmu. – Tkellimna ħafna fl-aħħar xhur fuq kif l-Ewropa trid tikseb awtonomija teknoloġika.

But only people can ensure that values such as pluralism, solidarity and democracy vacute us against mistakes and abuses that can turn this opportunity into a pandemic of 'artificial negligence'. We need clear, simple, flexible and common legislation that does not harm the competitiveness of our entrepreneurs in the global market and avoid fragmentation, that controls the processes of generation and operation of these tools, detects risks and corrects dysfunctions through ongoing evaluation and ensures structured participation of users.  This global plan should encourage intense local action, focused on coordinating and better understanding technological capabilities, promoting talent and supporting intra-establishment and the creation of new companies. Thus, by bringing knowledge and value to the local industrial system, regions such as the Basque Country, recently identified as an example of innovation by President Von der Leyen, must help the Union gain global competitiveness. Artificial intelligence needs ethical principles to prevent biases in algorithms, clarify industrial and legal aspects, and establish formulas for determining and debugging civil liability arising from facts where the influence of artificial intelligence is key.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report and for the way in which she has been rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has The debates on the Digital Services Act so far have shown me that we have not yet sufficiently internalised what it actually means that the EU has been a legal entity of the UNESCO Convention for the Protection and Promotion of Cultural Diversity and Expressions for 15 years now. The random presence of many colorful videos on the net may be entertaining, but it is by no means the safeguarding of cultural diversity or even media diversity. Cultural and media diversity will only be ensured if we oblige all key actors to guarantee the discoverability of journalistic content and the content of cultural education beyond economic interests without ifs and buts.  This requires bold regulation that starts before large service providers are important or even gatekeepers. This requires special regulation, because media are not only an economic asset, but also a cultural asset and must therefore be treated differently from butter or screws.  It is not the variety of colourful videos, but the existence of credible and high-quality information that is easily accessible to everyone, that is the basic prerequisite for enabling a meaningful public debate in a digitised world that forms the foundation of a free, democratic society. Because this is so important, special regulations are needed, especially in the area of cultural and media diversity. And in a world where big data and algorithmic decisions are playing an increasingly important role, we are facing a paradox: for the intermediaries themselves, the processes of opinion-forming are becoming more and more transparent through data that is accessible to them. But the public knows less and less about the mechanisms and influences that shape political opinion formation.  You can see for yourself that the disclosure of algorithms alone will not be enough for this. There is a need for courageous and, above all, pre-designed protection of diversity and, above all, new policy initiatives to ensure independent quality journalism in the EU.

Do you know that YouTube’s filters suppressed a parliamentary debate on torture because they confused it with violence online? Many constitutions ban ex—ante censorship. It is high time we take back control and do the same with censorship machines used by digital platforms.  Secondly, let’s tackle the predominant business model of surveillance capitalism. Major platforms are tracking our every click, everything we read and write online, to analyse our personalities, our likes, our weaknesses, our illnesses.  We cannot accept this permanent surveillance of users online, and therefore we need to make sure that we are not subject to pervasive tracking.

This topic is very close to my heart. I come from Estonia, a country where we have had the privilege of enjoying the benefits of online services for almost 30 years and I will continue in Estonian. The COVID-19 crisis proved to the whole world what we have known about digital society in Estonia for nearly thirty years. We are used to the opportunities offered by digital services, and we know the challenges and risks that the use of digital services entails.  I am convinced that a functioning digital single market will bring economic and societal benefits to every person, to every Member State, to the European Union as a whole. And I am pleased that we have reached a review and modernisation of the regime governing digital services at European Union level. The e-commerce directive was adopted twenty years ago. It needs to be modernised. I look forward to the Commission's proposal for legislation on digital services and hope that it will take into account the proposals made in our report, which focus in particular on fundamental rights and data protection. I'll mention the most important of them. Digital services must be based on existing European Union legislation, including the General Data Protection Regulation and the ePrivacy Directive. A fair digital ecosystem must be ensured, which respects fundamental rights, in particular freedom of expression and information, and any discrimination must be ruled out. What is illegal outside the internet must also be illegal online and eliminated. Digital service providers, including online platforms, must be subject to clear and specific obligations to eliminate illegal content. Cooperation between service providers and national authorities needs to improve. The general supervisory obligation, which is laid down today in the e-commerce directive, must continue to be prohibited. In doing so, it should be stressed that today's automated means do not adequately analyse and understand online content, and that the final decision must remain with the people.  I am convinced that the digital services market cannot be complete and perfect without a european current digital ID. I hope that the Commission will speed up action to enforce the electronic identification regulation across the territory of the European Union, because the current pace cannot be satisfied. And I welcome the conclusions of october this year, which emphasise the need for the safe identification of persons through the European Union-based framework. I would also like to emphasise aspects of cyber security, both from the consumer point of view of the consumer and from the point of view of the provision of services.

Even though it will be, I think, a truly amazing debate today, it will in no way do justice to what has gone before this debate, because it is truly a thing that includes the entire Parliament. This is also why it’s a bit unfair to start thanking some rapporteurs and leaders in this, but I would say to Alex Saliba, Tiemo Wölken and Kris Peeters that this is outstanding work.  We will respond to your initiatives with two legislative proposals: the Digital Services Act and the Digital Markets Act, and this will reflect ideas. Fundamentally we share the same goals. I think that is most obvious. We want to better protect citizens when they use the internet, whether that is in protection against illegal goods, services, content online. As it was put, we need to make sure that as we feel safe offline we should feel safe online.  Also, to better secure the freedom of expression online. This of course, as you have heard already, is a tricky balance to strike. To achieve this, we need to lay down a solid and impactful EU—wide accountability framework. Obviously that has to come with enforcement, because words alone will not do it; then it would be just window dressing. The balance we will have to strike here is of course that we will have to say to some of the gatekeepers, the largest platforms, that things will change.  Europe is open and we will do this in full compliance with our international obligations, also because we would want to work with the rest of the world to set new standards. In order to do so, we intend to break down legal barriers in the internal market and combat unfair practices by gatekeeper platforms. This will help European innovators, small businesses, to scale, to grow, to be able to compete for our attention, to compete for our business.  With the Digital Services Act I think two things have stood the test of time: no general monitoring of user content is one; and, second, a well—balanced system of liability, and the internal market as the core.  But things have changed, so obviously we also need to set out in law the responsibilities that platforms must have in relation to their role as societal and economic impactors, as they are. This is one of the reasons why we’re working on this Digital Markets Act in parallel with the Digital Services Act. This regulation will specifically target large digital gatekeepers defined by objective criteria, setting out a clear list of ‘dos and don’ts’ in full compliance again, of course, with international obligations. It will also provide for a market investigation framework to address digital markets that may be prone to market failure and prone to the creation of new gatekeepers.  On artificial intelligence, let me thank also MEP Ibán García Del Blanco for the intense work. I really welcome Parliament’s contribution here. This is ground—breaking, this has not been done before. We share the same ambition to create a sound and future—proof legal framework for trustworthy artificial intelligence in Europe so that people can benefit from AI—driven products and services that are safe and that respect European fundamental rights and values. For this we need an AI framework that creates new opportunities for European businesses to innovate, to scale up. We ought to be the global hub for AI Made in Europe and set the global standard for trustworthy AI. We want to fully leverage the potential of AI while mitigating associated risks, and I think we all recognise that this is the balance. We will be discussing this back and forth and back and forth, because it is indeed a balance to be struck as not every AI implies a risk. High—risk applications of AI should be put under intense scrutiny. However, we should not define high—risk AI so broadly that it creates legal uncertainty and disproportionately overburdens businesses or hampers innovation. We need to form a framework that is future—proof, and I expect that we will engage in this very intensely because it is indeed a balance.  We also welcome the report for dealing with liability for AI, and here Axel Voss has done outstanding work. It’s very impressive, and we agree that the current liability rules are challenged by AI characteristics. Our institutions also agree on the objective for liability aiming for the same level of protection for victims of AI—related damages, and victims of damages of other technologies. I think that is a very sound and straightforward principle. For what concerns the Product Liability Directive, the Commission appreciates the Parliament report. We will carefully consider it and then we will discuss. On the Parliament report on intellectual property (IP) rights, I think that shows the pivotal role of IP rights for the EU to become a leader in artificial intelligence. Without this, it will not happen, and we want to thank also MEP Stéphane Séjourné for his excellent work. We need an EU IP framework that enables innovations in the field of AI technologies. Companies in the European Union, must be able to efficiently protect but also to share their inventions in the field of AI technologies. That is what will create excellence in artificial intelligence. Thank you again also for this ground—breaking work.  Last, but not least, I think this will be an amazing debate. We have started it, I think, already in the best possible manner. One of the delights is to see how there is convergence between the different reports, between the thinking of the Commission and what Parliament is proposing here. I think that is very strong because that shows citizens that what we want to create is a society where technology serves humans, where humans are empowered, where humans are in control. We don’t want a society where people feel estranged, feel that there is the risk that some machine will take some decision in complete transparency without knowing if their rights are actually being fulfilled. We have one generation to do this. This is now, it is happening, and I do hope that you will recognise many of these valuable points in what we suggest. I’m looking forward not only to the debate today, not only to the proposals, but also to the debate that we will have to make sure that we get a strong European regulatory framework that can actually be enforced in real life.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 19, "date": "2020-10-19.json", "name": "Lina GÁLVEZ MUÑOZ", "mepid": "197702", "text": "  drafts member of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. – Madam President, as rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on the report on the ethical aspects of artificial intelligence, prepared by Ibán García del Blanco in the Committee on Legal Affairs, I would like to underline the significance that this dossier has for the dignity and rights of workers.  The greater flexibility or efficiency that the use of these technologies may bring cannot be synonymous with more sophisticated forms of exploitation or supervision of workers. As a result, the law, our legislative framework, must move forward with regulations that protect workers from monitoring and metric mechanisms that violate their privacy, reputation or promotion possibilities or stay in their workplace.

I therefore welcome the Commission's commitments and progress in introducing a harmonised approach to the obligations of digital service providers, including online intermediaries, in order to avoid the partitioning of the internal market and inconsistent enforcement. However, when introducing the new rules, we must bear in mind that burdening small and medium-sized enterprises with unnecessary new obligations can hamper their development and prevent them from gaining market position.  The Digital Services Code must also respect the fundamental rights of users and consumers, such as privacy and non-discrimination, and, above all, must not undermine freedom of expression, the great prey of the internet. I would also like to stress the importance of respecting different national traditions so that, in the fight against illegal content, we do not impose the same rules throughout Europe, for example in the case of controversial statements. I am therefore in favour of maintaining the ban on the general obligation to monitor content, and I believe that supervision of the content moderation system should be ensured so that it does not become a censorship tool for private companies.

Madam President, I would like to thank the president for her Artificial intelligence is everyday life for us. For example, when our music streaming app suggests new songs based on our listening habits. Other areas may be less commonplace for most of us, but they have the potential to change products, industries, and even our entire lives – in medicine, mobility, or agriculture. The EU has now set itself the goal of creating a single set of rules. This is pioneering work, and it must also be said that it offers a real economic and social opportunity and can become a great locational advantage. There are three points that we must pay particular attention to: firstly, we must encourage innovation rather than slow down. We should remain open to technology in any form of regulation and rely on unbureaucratic rules.  Secondly, civil rights are non-negotiable. The protection of fundamental rights is high on my agenda. There must be no mass monitoring through automatic facial recognition, nor must there be any obligation to upload filters. Thirdly, harmonisation in the internal market. We are only raising the opportunity of artificial intelligence for people and the economy with uniform rules for the entire internal market. This creates maximum legal certainty for businesses and consumers. But we don't have to reinvent the wheel for that. In many areas, we already have existing rules, for example on the issue of liability, on the issue of intellectual property. But we need to look closely: in what points do we perhaps need updates that correspond to the characteristics of artificial intelligence?

First of all, I wanted to thank the rapporteur, Mr Saliba, and all the shadow rapporteurs for the effort and spirit of collaboration to reach consensus during the negotiations on this report. I believe that we have all done a good job and reached agreements which send a clear message to the Commission on how the Digital Services Act should be addressed. The Digital Services Act should aim to create a safer, fairer and more transparent digital single market for all: citizens, consumers and businesses, especially our SMEs. To this end, it is important to develop balanced legislation tailored to the challenges that come to us from the constant evolution of the digital field. The European Commission has established three pillars on which to cement its strategy: the digital pillar, the environmental pillar ⸺or the Green Pact⸺ and the European way of life. This report by the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection is, by its nature, based on the digital field. We also reflect the importance of the Green Pact: e-commerce must take into account the environmental impact and act accordingly, provided that its practice does not burden the competitiveness of our companies. Throughout its history, our values and way of life have made us different from the rest of the world. It has made us an example to follow in many areas. We're neither Chinese nor Americans. Here we have a high consideration of our privacy and data protection, we do not give them to governments or companies in any way. We care about transparency, we want to know why, how and why our data is collected and who stays it. Every foreign company operating here must comply with our way of doing things.  In short, we need to find our own way of regulating the digital ecosystem, finding a balance which, in the long run, will undoubtedly be a competitive advantage for our SMEs, our citizens and in general for the European Union. That is why I think it is important to collect the European way of life. Without this third pillar, the report is incomplete. The amendment I table on behalf of my group goes in this direction, it is not against anyone; rather, on the contrary, it is in favour of each and every European and aims to reflect the values that un bring us together.

Thank you, Madam President, and Commissioner!  We are having a very wide debate today with a wide range of aspects around digitisation and artificial intelligence, and I think it is very useful. However, with my speaking time today, I will give priority to looking at what is about the internal market and consumer protection. My message today to the Commission is very brief: it is that in future legislation we must ensure that what is illegal offline also continues to be illegal online. That is why it is also great to hear that the Commissioner has already indicated that it is also the approach of the Commission with the forthcoming legislation that is really important. However, we have seen numerous examples of dangerous baby rangers, toxic toy figurines, useless face masks, etc. – things that are being sold today online that are dangerous to consumers, something we would not accept lay on the shelves of physical stores. It is important to get something done about it, even when we have the e-commerce directive revised. In fact, we must ensure that consumer safety is at the forefront, even when we shop online, and that is why I am also pleased that the report we have produced in the IMCO attaches particular importance to this. Consumers must be as safe when shopping online as when shopping offline.  It is also important – and we are also sending a signal about this in the report – that companies that want to sell goods to European consumers, even if they come outside Europe – that is, businesses – must comply with European rules. If they want to benefit from the European market, then they must comply with it and we must ensure that it can happen. And i also think it is important to stress that consumer information is also a key issue when people shop and act online. We must ensure that companies inform consumers if a product is removed from their platform. So what is happening offline in the general market today must in fact also be something we transfer to online companies in the future. In this way, we can ensure that consumers can be safe, and I look forward to the Commission also taking it into account in future legislation.", "language": "en", "original_language": "da", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 27, "date": "2020-10-19.json", "name": "Karen MELCHIOR", "mepid": "197567", "text": "  renew group. Thank you, Madam President, and Commissioner! Ladies and gentlemen! I am speaking to you from the House of the European Parliament here in Copenhagen. I would first like to ask you: do you remember the good old days as far back as 2010, when we still believed that the new and fantastic Internet itself would open up and democratise public debate, allow everyone to speak up, enable subjugated peoples to organise and overthrow dictators. I remember those days. A dream of an open internet for an open and free world. But unfortunately it didn't stay that way. We were wrong!  Much of the public debate has shifted to the online platforms, and this has given them a huge impact on our democracy – and unfortunately probably not for the better. We've seen how the platform's business model has fertilized the ground for conspiracy theories and polarization, because it's exactly the type of content that creates interaction and makes you stay just a little longer. It is not a business model that has our public debate and the well-being of democracy in mind. That is why we need to legislate and make demands on the platforms. Firstly, platforms must be transparent and open to community control. Platforms shall have rules and continuously evaluate their content guidelines and engage in a dialogue on them. Secondly, platforms should not become censorship machines with the use of upload filters. The removal of illegal content must be carried out after a transparent process and with human control, with the exception, of course, of clearly illegal material such as calls for terrorism. Thirdly and finally, the responsibility for settling disputes between users and platforms must not lie with the platforms themselves. We don't put the fox to guard geese either! Online platforms have given us countless opportunities, but we need to address the challenges they face and tackle the challenges right. And that is exactly what the Committee on Legal Affairs' report is about. That is why we must dare to demand the platforms with the greatest power. As Pippi Longstocking would have said: when you are extra large, you have an extra obligation to be fair to others.

It is also a great source of jobs and economic development, especially for start-ups and small and medium-sized enterprises. However, we must be vigilant, as it can also be a danger. It is to deal with this that the three reports Voss, Garcia Del Blanco and Séjourné were written. Overall, these three reports have achieved their objective by requiring that artificial intelligence always remain under human control to avoid possible liberticidal excesses. I particularly agree with the Voss report, which has the merit of avoiding excessive centralisation by asking that the damage caused by artificial intelligence be entrusted to national liability regimes for misconduct. It is rightly only for high-risk artificial intelligence systems that he advocates a new liability regime based on the obligation on their deployer to take out liability insurance, in order to guarantee their victims compensation. However, not everything is perfect and I regret in particular that some reports continue to consider the creation of a new European agency dedicated to artificial intelligence. From my point of view, there are already too many agencies. I also regret that the report Garcia Del Blanco envisages the use of artificial intelligence to censor hate speech and false information: these are too vague incriminations that will open the way to abuses against freedom of expression. They should be clarified, for example by clearing the offence of inciting Islamist terrorism. Finally, with regard to the report on digital services, I agree with its main guidelines, in particular the idea that the legality of content generated by their users should be determined by a national judicial authority and not by a private commercial entity. I also support the principle of respect for the freedom of expression of platform users, as well as the desire to combat the most intrusive forms of targeted advertising.

I just tried the bot and found one thing: normal human-like communication is not possible away from keyword—bingo. A chat bot of the Federal Government is of course not a reflection of the breathtaking developments we are facing, but it clearly shows one thing: there can be no AI without humans as creators, but also without people as end-users. Our artificial intelligence strategies must be thought of human-centered. And with these reports, we are taking the first real step in this direction. We establish human responsibility for AI. But we also write: responsibility for people. Intelligence may be artificial, but only with real, non-artificial fundamental rights can we make progress. That is why we warmly welcome the fact that the report on ethics is not just about philosophising on abstract ethical principles, but also a basis for binding European rules and fundamental rights.  Where algorithms cause damage – and we welcome this in the other report – it should not only be about property that is protected, but also about personal rights, about human dignity, about equality. If humans don't understand the federal government's chat bot, then the technology has failed. If humans are discriminated against by algorithms, then technology has failed. If artificial intelligence changes human habitat to the point of being unrecognizable and destroys our climate, then technology has failed. And this is not an appeal for pessimism, but for the optimism of progress. That is the most important thing for us.  After all, AI should not be thought of without green accounting. Of course, we need AI for our green transformation, but we cannot imagine it without looking at the damage of artificial intelligence. In Frankfurt alone, 20% of energy costs are generated by data centers. Internet consumes more CO2 in Germany than air traffic.

However, no technology is reliable. It is necessary to amend existing rules in areas such as the enforcement of liability for accidents and failures caused by AI-based systems. The redress and redress process must be transparent and the identification of the person responsible for the payment of compensation must not be a problem.  Obligations in this regard should be adequately integrated into the ability of manufacturers, operators and users of AI-based systems to control risks.

Mr President, what is at stake in these various texts that we are discussing this evening? The question is: can we regain control over our digital lives? And is it possible, is it possible to invent a European model that is different from that of the United States, where we really notice the pursuit of profit at all costs, and which is also different from the Chinese model, where we see that technology is put at the service of mass surveillance for the dictatorship to continue? I think it is possible, if you are respectful of a number of fundamental principles, that you are able to set limits and set a framework. There are at least two points on which I think we can go further. The first is facial recognition. I share the doubts expressed by the many human rights organizations, which have warned of the use of artificial intelligence-driven video surveillance, which will totally disproportionately limit the possibilities of anonymous movement and which constitutes an unbearable intrusion into privacy with, in addition, risks, because AI is unable to avoid misidentification based on gender, age or ethnicity. This is a real problem and we need a European moratorium on video surveillance or, in any case, on facial recognition. The second point is consumer protection. Intellectual property must be respected, which is not the case today. Platforms like Amazon or Alibaba market counterfeit products. Almost two thirds of the products today, according to the European Consumers' Bureau, are illegal products. And there, Europe must crack down, because it is not up to the platforms to determine what is allowed and what is not. Finally, let me, because I speak from Paris, to tell you that it is absolutely necessary that the rights of citizens, respect for dignity and respect for human rights be ensured by the platforms, so that we escape the outpouring of digital hatred that led, the day before yesterday in France, to this abominable murder of a teacher who was really being pursued by a fatwa.

The starting point is, quite rightly, an ethical reflection which must give rise to appropriate laws. We cannot allow the ethical threshold of IA systems to fall below the human threshold.

There is a risk that the software that manages THE IS will be sabotaged or tampered with.  It would be naïve to think that cybercrime and cyber terrorism will not make a quantum leap as artificial intelligence systems evolve. Theft and smuggling of data, hacking, industrial copyright infringement, sabotage and hostage-taking of IA systems. We're not talking about science fiction, it's already happened. While we need to protect the patents that run the systems, it will be necessary to make these systems accessible to those conducting investigations, such as magistrates and police forces. It has already been seen in the past that companies holding encryption systems have obstructed or even refused access to those investigating terrorist groups and criminal organisations.

I propose that each social network be forced to post on its home page a link to an online pre-complaint, where appropriate, to create a real capacity to respond to victims. Finally, I propose a new status for social networks because it is indecent for them to take refuge behind their hosting status in order, in fact, to absolve themselves of their responsibility.

Social networks clearly played a fundamental role in the attack, as calls for hatred flourished there.

Their producers are usually not established within the EU, so consumers also have to go abroad with their complaint. And now that we work, learn and shop online, e-commerce in Europe is growing fast. That is good, but it is important that people can cope with the quality and safety of their products, especially since our European marketplaces and producers – with an exception – do follow the rules. I am therefore pleased that the European rules on online services are being revised so that consumers are better protected and our businesses do not lag behind.

It follows to me that not only services that are quasi-free today will be paid for, but also various other services can become more expensive. We must also know, with each proposal, what costs will be incurred by the consumer. It is therefore good that the report has succeeded in including rules to be adopted in view of the overall impact on consumer welfare. If we stick to this rule, I believe that we will help not only the consumer, but also the entire European digital market.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sk", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ECR", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 39, "date": "2020-10-19.json", "name": "Kateřina KONEČNÁ", "mepid": "23699", "text": "   – Mr President, I am glad that we are talking here about a subject that will play such an important part in the shape of the future world and Europe – artificial intelligence. The penetration of AI systems into manufacturing, services and all sectors of the economy is an integral part of Industrial Revolution 4.0, which will have major and broad-scale impacts. Ultimately, it will not be a technological change, but a complex transformation of cyber-physical-social. The development of artificial intelligence will have an impact on society as a whole and on all parts of our lives.  Artificial intelligence is not only a robot, as we might imagine based on karel Čapek's game and science fiction, but also software – simply an algorithm, which is often not completely obvious and can cause credibility problems. In doing so, it is essential that the systems used in Europe enjoy well-deserved credibility, also on the basis of respect for the principle of legality and regulations and ethical principles.  It has certainly been said many times today, and it will still be said that we must strike a balance – we must have clear rules, but we must not destroy the chances of European firms in the market with excessive restrictions. Of course, this approach can be partially agreed with. I also prefer that we use European systems and technologies in Europe and become notional champions on the world market. However, this must never happen at the expense of protecting European consumers. I believe that it is necessary for AI systems to be developed, implemented and used in the European Union only if they respect ethical principles relating to respect for human autonomy, harm prevention, justice and explainability.

The first principle is the easiest way to make this clear. As Our Colleague Kris Peeters has said before, what is illegal – what has been decided politically, that it is illegal – must also be illegal on the Internet. The decision as to what is illegal is made by politicians – they cannot make the platform. Enforcing this will be a crucial issue that we want to address with the Digital Services Act.  Secondly, Mr President, we are, of course, united in all our reports, we are opposed to general control of users on platforms. Freedom is a core principle of the European Way of Life, which we in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats defended with particular emphasis.  Thirdly, ladies and gentlemen, fair markets. The fight against oligopolies or monopolies is a core principle of the social market economy, which has unfortunately fallen into a bit of a mess in the digital environment.

I believe, more specifically, that if we look into my report, the LIBE report, on which I was able to co-write – and I would also like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Peeters – we have ensured that there is more transparency in the algorithms, that users should have more opportunities to actually have a say in what they see in terms of content, that we have clear rules for notice and takedown, and that we have already made it clear – , that also decides on the Internet courts and that ultimately does not decide the platform.

However, there are also significant risks and side effects here.  One side effect, for example, is the so-called fact checkers. The problem is that fact-checkers don't check facts, they check content for the right – politically desired – attitude. The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung aptly stated that this was the case – and I quote: \"The journalist's office Correctiv, which facebook hired as an anti-fake news brigade, should apply the same standards to others, be blind in no eye and not just research in one direction.\" The next step in ordeal is the so-called upload filters, which prevent politically undesirable opinions from being published in the first place. We saw how this works in the US last week: It appears that presidential candidate Joe Biden is embroiled in a major corruption scandal in Ukraine, which the New York Post wanted to address in a publication. But because it cannot be what cannot be, this article on Facebook and Twitter was blocked by upload filters. And so the world is unaware of Biden's corruption scandal.

But where does the current structure lead? The structure of opacs algorithms that determine how the world is displayed to us based on our personal information sold to whoever is willing to give the most money to them. When misinformation spreads much faster than anything verified, and when algorithms know exactly who is most receptive to conspiracy theories.  This structure leads to the easy manipulation of voters, the organized spread of disinformation and conspiracy theories, the sale of illegal, harmful products, hate speech, even incites violence and unfortunately often actually leads to violence.  All this - not least because of those politicians who abuse people's fear and anger for their interests and wage a cultural war with the media and the ghosts of the past - all of this purposely undermines people's trust in the profession and authority, undermines the quality of public debate and general culture and, consequently, makes it impossible to solve people's real pressing problems.

But a synthesis between power and ethics is possible. Our Greek and Christian philosophical heritage allows us to navigate the murky waters of modernity. However, this path can only be ours if we emerge from our lethargy.

We are therefore looking forward to an ambitious package of legislative proposals from the European Commission.  From the point of view of the Committee on Education and Culture, I would like to draw attention to two points. First, it's a problem to remove illegal content immediately. This is especially important if you're violating live content, such as sporting events or music concerts. In its opinion, the Committee on Culture has called on the European Commission to clarify what it is to remove without delay the illegal content already referred to in Article 14 of the E-Commerce Directive. Online intermediaries should react as soon as they receive notification from rights holders, up to a maximum of 30 minutes. This is crucial when removing illegal live content.  Secondly, I would also like to mention the amendment that my political group tabled with regard to the Saliba report from the IMCO Committee. I hope that it will receive broad support from all political groups. In this amendment, we would like to add a reference to the Audiovisual Services Directive. It is worth recalling that the digital services act should apply without prejudice to other sectoral legislation, such as the Copyright Directive or the Data Protection Regulation. Unfortunately, at this point, this reference to the Audiovisual Services Directive is missing, and i therefore ask you to support this amendment in the vote.  I also very much regret that, unfortunately, there is no specific paragraph in the annex to the Report of the Committee on Legal Remedies which makes it clear that the legislation on digital services should provide a horizontal framework complemented by existing and future sectoral rules, such as copyright and the Audiovisual Services Directive, and that the legislator will avoid conflicts of laws.

Connected products are increasingly being used, algorithms influence consumer decisions, they control connected household goods, even make decisions about creditworthiness or in a human resources department. These are all achievements that are very beautiful, very good.  However, we must remember that this also involves dangers and can also cause damage. That is why it is right and proper that we have thought about how we can adapt liability law to developments in the field of artificial intelligence. For us Social Democrats, a few specific points were particularly important, and I would like to single out three of them. One is that it is very important to us that not only physical damage but also non-material damage is addressed. Algorithms may be fed distorted data and can lead to incorrect decisions being made, which can be highly discriminatory. They can mean, for example, a denial of credit, and that is absolutely unacceptable. We must ensure that we have answers to them.  Secondly, we need liability not only from the manufacturer of the product, but also from the software developers, because they may have better and greater control over the procedure in this area.  Thirdly, we want the burden of proof to be fully reversed. If, for example, a coffee machine is defective, we will notice it very quickly and may also be able to see, as consumers, why this is actually the reason. However, if it is a software product, we cannot, and it is therefore important that the burden of proof does not remain with consumers. That is why we are appealing to the European Commission: fundamental rights must in any case be respected in all areas of artificial intelligence. The new rules must be created in a consumer-friendly manner and must be considered in the risk assessment of all dangers and damage.

The report, focusing on the revision of the E-Commerce Directive, is intended to be a valuable contribution to the Commission's imminent legislative proposal. The future rule should continue to respect principles well laid down in the Directive, such as the internal market clause, the freedom of establishment and the prohibition on imposing a general monitoring obligation on digital intermediaries.  Now the important thing, however, is that this e-commerce directive should be updated and thus, for example, clarify the content management liability regime and provide tools to deal with the growing volume of illegal goods, which are so damaging the manufacturing sector.  That said, the scope of the new proposal must go beyond the E-Commerce Directive and adapt the concepts of competition to digitisation. As has been done in other sectors, national regulators must have tools in place to address the growing number of barriers to access to data that companies encounter in trying to reach customers. I am referring to removing uncompromising access conditions, unlimited access to operating system functions or also legal transaction data.  In short, we must ensure that in a digital market all companies have access to third-party suppliers on a level playing field and transparency, because that will ultimately result in better services and further research.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 62, "date": "2020-10-19.json", "name": "Adriana MALDONADO LÓPEZ", "mepid": "197735", "text": "   – Mr President, Commissioner. First of all, I would like to value the role that the plenary of the European Parliament is having here today. Many months of work by different committees of the European Parliament are reflected here today in an intense, technical and solvency debate of different committees. I therefore think it is important that the Commission listens to the European Parliament and highlights the proposals which, through the various reports submitted by the European Parliament, we bring to the European Commission. They will therefore agree with me that the European Union has changed a lot from 1985 to 2020. That is why I would like to emphasise the Defective Product Liability Directive, which deals with that year. But society has changed so much, that this directive does not speak at any time of mobile phones, computers or telework, fundamental elements in the European economy, in the way we relate, in the way we work today in the 21st century. Therefore, for European Socialists, it is very important that this update of the 21st century be highlighted. It is true that around 50% of European product manufacturers today use artificial intelligence in their product processing processes; and it is also true that a large part of European citizens consider artificial intelligence not entirely their confidence in using their day-to-day life. Therefore, as legislators, we have the challenge of being able to work on a directive that gives confidence to the European institutions, but above all to our citizens. That security has to be without a doubt armed with the safety of many of our products.  And, as mentioned here too, it is essential that this burden of proof does not be on consumers. It is true that we need to empower our European consumers. We need European consumers to have a greater understanding of everything that has to do with new technologies, but a responsibility that has to be of producers cannot fall on them.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 63, "date": "2020-10-19.json", "name": "Maximilian KRAH", "mepid": "197481", "text": "   Mr President, I would like to thank the Ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is the area with the lowest innovative power of the major economic areas in terms of IT and artificial intelligence.

At the same time, therefore, this is also a signal to the current financial negotiations. Additional investments are needed for modern high-speed connections, people's digital know-how and research and product development in the field. It is the way in which Europe can remain competitive and successful in the future.  But in addition to investment and innovation, we need to ensure that we have legislation that supports new innovations and encourages the introduction of new technologies and new applications. At the same time, we must ensure that good consumer protection and people's fundamental rights are also realised in the digital world, and here it is important for us now in the legislation to find the right balance. We must not go out of our way to over-vote on digital services or artificial intelligence, but at the same time we must ensure that consumer and business confidence in digital services is maintained.

However, at a time of digital technology, more and more ambiguities are entering this area. We need to answer the questions that we would have recently put earlier in the world of science fiction. If AI can create, who will actually own the results of this creation? Who will be responsible for the autonomous decisions of the machines? And what if AI starts to form itself?  This may seem premature, but development is going at a tremendous pace and sooner or later we will be faced with these dilemmas. And that's when we need to have clear rules and clear legal frameworks. The guiding principle that we must bear in mind is that technology always serves man and society and not the other way round.

Unfortunately, it is obvious that this 22-year-old was motivated by hate speech and fake news on the internet, and worst of all, unfortunately, after the act took place, we could see a series of outbursts of glorification of his act, right on social media.  This shows how dangerous the spread of hate is online, shows how dangerous the spread of disinformation is and how much we must combat such phenomena. Of course, this does not mean that we need a \"Ministry of Truth\", this does not mean that we are in for censorship, it just means that we have to strike the right balance between freedom of expression on the one hand, but also hate speech, which is very dangerous and that can lead to tragedies like this in the future.  I am pleased that the Commission is acting in this direction, I am pleased that the measures announced are precisely towards achieving this balance and I believe that we will be able to achieve this balance and that we will protect all those values that constitute and protect the European way of life.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 73, "date": "2020-10-19.json", "name": "Alex AGIUS SALIBA", "mepid": "197403", "text": "  rapporteur. – Mr President, first of all my thanks to all the colleagues who participated in this very interesting discussion. I want to start my last intervention by quoting, as my colleague Tiemo did, the social dilemma: if you are not paying for it then you are the product. And this is the idea that we are fighting throughout our report, by increasing transparency, by increasing consumer protection – we must never treat our citizens just as simple products. Today we are living in a world where digital services and platforms are essential in our social and economic lives. Just imagine the consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic on our lives without digital infrastructure and without digital industries. These digital services basically helped us to continue with our commercial and social lives. But online platforms and digital services have largely evolved during the past 20 years and therefore, as EU legislators, we need to catch up. The ideas that we are moving forward in our reports are aiming at this target. Therefore we are directly asking the Commission to be ambitious, as we were in our reports, by introducing in its proposal these concepts: know your business customer principle, and know your business customer principle not only for online marketplaces but for all digital service providers; ex ante rules for digital sectors; special responsibilities for online marketplaces to guarantee consumer safety; stricter controls on targeted advertising and the AI mechanism; and a scope that will encompass companies established outside the EU which are targeting us and targeting our consumers. I want also to reply to a comment made by one of our colleagues and make it totally clear that our proposal is stating explicitly that what we are proposing is without prejudice to the Audiovisual Media Services Directive (AVMSD), to copyright law and to specific legislation.

Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner and now also Michael for the German Presidency! I would like to begin by saying a few words about today's debate. In fact, this was a very intense, very revealing meeting. There was also a great deal of concern for consumer rights, and on this point there is also an amendment to the report in the Committee on Legal Affairs. Tomorrow I will recommend the rejection of the amendments in this area, because I believe that they would have been included in the IMCO report, and because I also believe that we could have discussed these issues very well in the shadow rapporteur meetings.  I would like to say two or three words about the report 'IP rights for artificial intelligence', where I was shadow rapporteur: I believe that the success of artificial intelligence also depends largely on the availability of data, and it does not only help to train algorithms, but we must ensure that they operate without discrimination, and for that we need the sharing and sharing of data. And we need this in order to break up data monopolies and make the Digital Single Market fair for all market participants. This would encourage innovation in Europe. However, it is important to us Social Democrats that there should be rules on intellectual property rights that do not have the effect of affecting the sharing and recycling of data. We reject the concept of data ownership, as well as rules that would have the same effect in practice. At the same time, however, we must pay close attention to ensuring that the fruits of the work of human creators are adequately protected. At a time when more and more works are being developed using AI-based tools, and when AI is increasingly able to generate works independently without any human input, the value of human labor must be recognized, especially in the arts and creative sectors.

Our core idea for digital intelligence should be clear as well.

Mr President, Vice-President Vestager, Mr Roth. I think it is nice, Mr Roth, that you have come to this really important debate this evening, and I would also like to refer again to what I said earlier. How do we manage to put all the good ideas that are now coming from the Commission or also from Parliament into the Member States?  If Europe does not succeed in acting as one at the end of the day, we will ultimately not be able to win competition with China and the United States. That is why, I believe, we need a different mind set in the Member States, namely that we pursue a European objective and not a national objective at European level. I do not know how we can achieve this, and it should not be a reproach to you, because I know that you are in a very different position. But I believe that this is one of the most important things about why we will not succeed if we do not make progress with Europe, or why we will not be able to implement it accordingly. That is why I believe that we must work to ensure that we really act as one. Of course, the individual points we have presented today are only a small building block. We also need many, many other small points, whether money, investment and infrastructure, etc., in order to become digitally sovereign in order to keep up. It is, I believe, also up to the Member States that we are blocking ourselves too much here, and I would ask that we make further progress on this. I believe that we need a sensible strategy, a concept in this regard, and I believe that what we have heard today can also be improved by the Commission itself.  Ultimately, I believe that we must also enforce the rules that we have afterwards. But in all this there is no way around the fact that we have to act as a unit and orient ourselves forward and not just be careful that things are going well in France, Germany, Spain, etc. in some way.

We have come from liability, intellectual property rights, innovation, hate speech, upload filters, consumer protection – I think we have shown the width and the depth of the work that has been ongoing here.  But, the thing is that the fundamental question is answered with a ‘yes’. Can we have a European model? There are other models, obviously. But the debate tonight has shown with all clarity that no one wants just to leave that to the state. Neither will anyone just say, ‘well, let business take care of this’. Now this has been a promise: that democracy will shape our society. That promise has been given tonight by everyone who has been taking the floor, that in our democracy we will shape this – for the state, for the business community, to serve the real asset here, which is the individual citizen, and that I find extremely promising.  Obviously, the level of complexity is quite high. There’s been a lot of very nuanced speeches, trying to balance that on the one hand, there are so obviously things that should not be out there, because it’s illegal in the offline world, while at the same time, no one wants censorship, no one wants the state to control. No one wants to limit a debate that can be free and nurture our democracy and that, of course, is the thing that we will have to grapple with in the months to come.  I just read an article in a Danish paper, in Danish, about artificial intelligence and part of that article was written by AI, in my mother tongue, on a rather complex subject, and I couldn’t distinguish what was written by the authors and what was written by AI. Maybe the grammar was slightly better by the AI – I wouldn’t know, but it’s just to say that when we’re in a world where artificial intelligence can write an op-ed, can write a poem, can write music, and we cannot tell the difference anymore, then it’s about time that democracy catches up with technology. Otherwise we cannot stand by the promise that the humans are the empowered here and that the machine is a servant.  The thing is that now the digital world, the online world, is not another world. It’s our world. For the children who are being bullied, it is just as real as when it was in the schoolyard back in the day. For the people who decide not to participate in democracy because of the hate speech online, it is as real as if someone has threatened them offline. This is our world and this is now, when we went to frame it, because it has matured. Back in the digital stone age, in the year 2000, of course, how could we have known any better? But this is the time and with this level of complexity, what a pleasure it is to see that we then discuss the principles. What are the fundamentals? That humans are in control; that transparency, responsibility, accountability, is what we want to work with; that you should know your customer; that you should be able to identify yourself to create the trust that people know who they are dealing with and you know that you are in control of the data that you create.  The principle of freedom, of fair markets. I think that is the core of the debate today and then, of course, the obvious: that the legislation that we will discuss and hopefully decide upon, should be implemented, should be enforceable, so that these promises are not empty, that it’s not just more words on paper, but that it’s real rights for citizens, for businesses, in the real world, to make the best possible use of digital technologies. It is, of course, a framework of legislation. It is the Digital Services Act, the Digital Market Act, it’s the legislation on artificial intelligence. It will be the Data Governance Act and the Data Act and the European Digital Identity, just to mention the most obvious things.  That should create ecosystems of excellence – because Europe has so much to offer. We have a culture of doing this and we will do it again. This is how we can create an ecosystem of trust, so that citizens do not feel estranged to a society that they have seen in the movies and found fascinating, but never ever wanted to live in. And obviously, as was just said, this is a European debate that should be rooted in every Member State. As we have seen with all the different proposals coming in every Member State because this is not just something down in Brussels. This is grown from every Member State but it needs a European response and this response you have given tonight by a promise that democracy will make sure that we frame this.

It is therefore essential to modernise the definition of online services. The main positions of the e-Commerce Directive should certainly be maintained in the modernisation process: the principle of limited liability, the principle of the country of establishment (COO) and the principle of the general prohibition on the obligation to observe. The regulation of digital services should not impose disproportionate new obligations on businesses. Nor should regulations undermine innovation.

Our education and training systems are now facing severe challenges due to the COVID—19 pandemic. 94% of the global learner population, meaning many nearly 1.6 billion learners, were affected by the closure of education and training institutions at the top of the crisis. Unfortunately, today the numbers remain high in the context of a potential second wave. Not everyone had access to digital education, with severe gaps at EU level. Up to 32% of pupils did not have access to education for several months in some Member States, among them Romania, where close to one million children did not have access to online education.  Despite that, many countries are still unprepared in front of the second wave that is now hitting Europe. More things should be done to ensure access to quality education and training for all Europeans, and for that we need to invest more in education. We need to invest in infrastructure, in digital skills and lifelong learning, in improving the connectivity of remote areas, in new initiatives like the European Online University, in the new tools, curriculums and devices that have been developed across Europe.  This crisis has shown us positive examples set up by professors, parents, learners, civil society and education providers, and we praise everyone’s efforts. Therefore, we recommend scaling up and increasing the visibility of effective initiatives and providing a platform for Member States to share good practices. We deeply regret that the Council is proposing budgetary cuts specifically in those programmes that support education and training policies. We reiterate our call for the Erasmus+ budget to be tripled while actively encouraging Member States to significantly increase public spending on education and on the Commission to prioritise education and training in the recovery plan – some of us are even calling for a 10% allocation.  Education is a right, and access to digital education should not be a privilege anymore. Therefore, we are asking the Council and the Commission to present a transparent and complete assessment of the impact of the crisis. It is key to see the lessons that have been learned. The upgraded digital education action plan and the plan to achieve the European education area by 2025 are just initial steps. The current situation demands a much quicker and stronger reaction, both at national and European level. We call upon Member States, with the support of the Commission, to present the education policy priorities that have been identified to make our education and training systems more inclusive and more evident in the current context. You must come up with a long—term vision for EU education policy. We need to see the EU playing a more prominent role in shaping education policy, and the first step could be to see better cooperation and coordination among Member States on how to deal with the current crisis. Our resolution, and this is the goal of this debate, calls to work closely together to minimise the health risks for staff and learners and to maximise the chances that in—person education and training is safe and can continue. The future of education depends on us making sure that all individuals, without discrimination, have access to education.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 91, "date": "2020-10-19.json", "name": "Victor NEGRESCU", "mepid": "88882", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Victor, Commissioner, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. We are all experiencing this particularly painfully these days and weeks: the Corona pandemic has a dramatic impact on all political, but above all, all sectors of society, and the education sector in particular is not exempt from this – quite the contrary. We have had very painful experiences in recent months since the outbreak of the pandemic. The first step was to ensure that our educational institutions – from kindergartens to high schools – had to take strict protection and hygiene measures. In a second, much more painful step, many, many educational institutions in almost all EU member states had to be closed. Then, when the situation improved significantly, it was a question of: how can we reopen schools, kindergartens? And what does it mean to combine learning from presence components in institutions and distance learning? This was a serious test for the Member States and for all those in the European Union who are responsible for education and higher education and science. Now you all know, honourable Members, that education is one of the essential competences of the Member States. However, there is, of course, also a task for the European Union, and this is above all this in these difficult times: learning from each other, learning from each other. Corona has, and this is the most painful experience we have had in these months, Corona has dramatically exacerbated the differences in education. Those who have had insufficient access to education so far are now punished once again. I would like to draw attention to a few special tests which are currently shaping the discussion of the Ministers of Education in the European Union, but also of all of us. First, inclusion and equal access to distance learning are still difficult to achieve. This is not only about the lack of digital skills, which we find partly in the social environment, but also partly in schools. It is also a question of the lack of access to the Internet and technical equipment. This is a major, major obstacle, because here in the European Union we are not yet as far as we should be in terms of digitisation. Another important point that is particularly close to my heart and to the Council is that schools, universities and universities – and I am now also explicitly including early childhood education – are not just places of learning. They are also places of social interaction, they are a safe environment that gives children, but also older learners, a sense of belonging and community. The pandemic is in itself a cause of stress, anxiety and great concern. Added to this is the fear of increasing social isolation for many learners, because they can no longer meet their friends, their classmates.  Educational institutions, especially schools and their staff, have had to show great flexibility, as have families. Teachers had to adapt very quickly to the new bitter realities, especially the reality of distance learning. This also meant additional targeted training for many school institutions. But families and learners also had to be accompanied by psychological and emotional support. Here, too, we still see large deficits. Many families, many students, but also many teachers feel left alone in this crisis.  At the level of educational institutions and education systems as a whole, one of the greatest tests is performance assessment and grading. How can we make a comparable assessment of performance at school in a school year that contained little in-attendance? This is a question that has made a massive demand not only for pupils, but also for teachers.  The pandemic has, of course, also had an impact on learning mobility programmes. I am particularly sorry about this, because this is a core competence of the European Union. When I think of the Erasmus+ programmes, many young people who were looking forward to a semester abroad were unable to take this semester abroad and did not have the opportunity to learn, live and love in another European country. I hope that, in retrospect, we will be able to give these young people something of what I consider to be a self-evident claim to these young people. The The impact of the crisis is therefore significant, and the European Union's education ministers will draw conclusions on this on 30 November, particularly on digital education in Europe's knowledge-based societies. And our message, which should also come from today's debate, is that the Corona generation must not become a lost generation.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 3, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 92, "date": "2020-10-19.json", "name": "Victor NEGRESCU", "mepid": "88882", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, this year has been an unprecedented year of challenge and disruption for education and training with 100 million learners across the European Union affected by the physical closure of educational institutions. Major and impressive efforts have been made by educational institutions, their staff and learners. Still, many learners were lacking suitable devices, appropriate tools, reliable internet connections and interaction. Educators and teachers were struggling to ensure a structured process and to keep students engaged. Teachers were not adequately prepared to use digital technologies. Teaching practices varied significantly, leading to uneven quality.  Initial findings estimate that the closure of schools has negatively affected learning outcomes. The lack of social interaction between pupils has also had a negative impact on the well—being of children and pupils. School—leaving exams and enrolment in higher education institutions have also been a major challenge and Member States’ approaches varied significantly. Most importantly – and most alarmingly – the pandemic has affected vulnerable learners most, including those from disadvantaged backgrounds and unsupportive home environments. As for the lesson learned from this crisis, Member States managed to switch to online learning quickly, but it’s clear that there is room for improvement. First and foremost, the shift to distance learning raised significant challenges in terms of equity and quality. We need to overcome the suboptimal practices leading to inequalities and learning losses. Second, the digital skills of learners and the capacity of educational institutions to provide quality and inclusive education remotely need to improve. Third, we also learned that the effectiveness of the response at national level was linked to the level of preparedness in terms of infrastructure, tools, content and teachers. The adaptation to the crisis was easier for those Member States that had national digital education strategies in place and had made efficient use of relevant EU funds. Regarding your next questions on education policy priorities in response to the crisis, the recent Commission communication on the European Education Area takes the lesson learned from the pandemic fully on board. Inclusion and equality are indeed at the heart of the European Education Area. It recognises and reinforces the role of education and training in the recovery and represents an ambitious answer to Member States’ call for cooperation at EU level to build resilient and forward-looking education systems. Dedicated initiatives in various areas, such as inclusion, building capacities for the digital transition or supporting teachers are vital to achieve this goal. While the pathways to the school success initiative will address the risk of dropout and low achievement, the proposed Erasmus teacher academies will promote cooperation between existing teacher education and training institutions.  The new Digital Education Action Plan also addresses the lessons learned from the ongoing COVID—19 crisis and the more structural challenges linked to the digital transformation of education and training. It looks at what is needed to enable and foster the development of a high—performing digital education ecosystem and it also aims at enhancing digital skills for the digital transformation. Last but not least, the future, more inclusive Erasmus Programme aims to provide a wide range of opportunities for institutions, learners and educators to be better equipped for digital learning and for overcoming social dividers.  The European Education Area and the Digital Education Action Plan, together with the emblematic Erasmus Programme, contains the geist of the Commission’s vision for EU education policy. Indeed, education is the foundation for personal fulfilment, employability and active and responsible citizenship. The Union is resetting its growth strategy with the green and digital transitions as its transformative drivers. Education is at the heart of these transitions, strengthening the social market economy and democracy with freedom, diversity, human rights and social justice.

The crisis reminds us of where we urgently need to retrofit in Europe. I support the initiative to set up a European education platform with digital education opportunities, for the sharing of educational materials and for the exchange of best practices. Equal opportunities in education are also important. It is unacceptable that a child cannot participate in digital education to the same extent as others simply because their parents may not be able to afford the necessary resources. High-quality education systems are the basis of the EU's global competitiveness. However, well-functioning education and training systems require appropriate public investment.

Even in EU countries, one in ten households is completely without internet access. It is estimated that in some countries up to a third of pupils were completely left without education during the coronavirus closures. It is clear that this gap in learning will have to be closed for a long time.

We are already living in a second wave of coronavirus and investment in education is needed more than ever.

But what I want to stress is your need.  The Lisbon Treaty entered into force more than ten years ago and, with the Lisbon Treaty, the area of freedom, justice and security, which makes the management of the Union's borders and the free movement of persons within the Schengen area finally a common policy subject to the legislation of this European Parliament, one of whose pillars is a common visa policy and European visa legislation.  This Parliament has done its job. It adapted the first Visa Regulation of 2001 in 2013 on the principle of reciprocity enshrined in the Lisbon Treaty. And the principle of reciprocity means that the European Union grants third States and their nationals visa exemption on a reciprocal basis that those third States exempt nationals of the Member States of the European Union from the corresponding visa to access the territory of those countries.  In addition, in 2018, we established not only a reciprocity regulation with a list of third States whose nationals are exempt from visas provided that those third States exempt Europeans from visas, but also a European Visa Code from which I had the honour to be rapporteur.  As far as 2017, we asked the Commission the question of when the Commission will comply with existing European law which mandates that, if a third State which has visa exemption does not guarantee it to all the States of the European Union, the European Union has an obligation to adopt a delegated act to suspend that visa exemption in terms of reciprocity by , at least six months.  We told him in 2017 because there were two visa-exempt states, Canada and the United States, which were not then guaranteed to five European Union states: Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, Croatia and Cyprus.  Poland already has visa waivers and Canada has guaranteed it to all Member States of the European Union. But the United States is still denied it to four Member States of the European Union: Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Cyprus.  The legal consequence is therefore required, further sanctioned by the Court, to which the Commission brought a case in 2013, decided in 2014 favourably for the European Parliament in 2014, making it clear that the Commission does have an obligation to adopt the delegated act when the States notify after a period of 24 months.  That 24-month period passed loosely in 2016 because the notification occurred in 2014. The European Parliament brought the matter to plenary debate in 2017 and remains pending.  That is why we bring the matter a second time and ask you the question clearly.  Firstly, does the Commission share the legal obligation to adopt the delegated act as required by the European Parliament?  Second, are you going to adopt him?  And third, if not, explain why.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 99, "date": "2020-10-19.json", "name": "Juan Fernando LÓPEZ AGUILAR", "mepid": "96812", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, I know how important visa reciprocity is to you and I especially thank Mr López Aguilar for his great engagement in this subject. I know that Parliament expects the Commission to do its utmost to ensure visa reciprocity for all EU citizens, including Bulgarians, Croatians, Cypriots and Romanians. For me, visa reciprocity – for all Member States – is a priority.  With the United States, we remain engaged in a result-oriented diplomatic process towards full visa reciprocity, in close coordination with the Member States concerned. Our communication on visa reciprocity of March 2020 details our engagement with the United States and shows we’ve consistently placed the issue high on the agenda. That communication also reported significant progress. In November last year, Poland entered the US visa waiver programme. Our approach is working. It has worked with other countries such as Canada, where full visa reciprocity for all EU citizens has already been achieved, and it is now showing results with the United States as well. Working on the result—oriented process, the four other Member States concerned have made continued progress. The United States is providing concrete guidance. The Member States have a clear perspective of joining the US visa waiver programme once they meet the outstanding requirements. These are not arbitrary but set out in US law. The Commission actively supports and works closely with these Member States to help them to fulfil all benchmarks and requirements. All four Member States have concrete prospects of progress; some appear to be very close to fulfilling the requirements and to being considered for entry to the US visa waiver programme. All four Member States want to continue this approach. This is important. None of them has asked the Commission to temporarily suspend visa-free travel for US citizens. They have all agreed to continue dialogue and to work on the benchmarks. Temporarily suspending the visa waiver for US citizens would be counter-productive. It would undermine the progress achieved in our current work. Suspending visa-free travel for US citizens would inevitably lead the United States to impose visa requirements for all EU citizens. This is the opposite of what we are trying to achieve. It would be difficult to explain to EU citizens how this were in their interest, especially when diplomatic engagement has brought positive results. I should also say that, with the global COVID-19 pandemic, maybe this is not the time to escalate. At the moment, COVID-19 travel restrictions are in force on both sides of the Atlantic. Non-essential travel is simply not taking place, visa-free or not.  Despite COVID-19, the Commission continues to work with the United States and the Member States concerned to accelerate progress on visas. We discussed visas at the most recent EU-US Justice and Home Affairs Ministerial Meeting in May this year, and at the meeting between the United States, the Commission and the Member States concerned on 18 and 19 June of this year. Our continued engagement in difficult times shows how important this issue is to the Commission.  Finally, I turn to the legal aspect raised in your question. The visa reciprocity mechanism, as set out in the visa regulation, requires the adoption of a delegated act suspending the visa waiver for nationals of the third country concerned for 12 months. According to the legislation, we must also take into account the possible consequences for the external relations of the EU and its Member States and for all European citizens. On the one hand, there is the progress achieved so far, notably Poland achieving visa-free access last year and the continued progress made by the other Member States concerned. On the other hand, the expected negative effects of visa suspension for our external relations and visa reciprocity. My assessment is that as long as we see continuing progress through engagement with the United States, full visa reciprocity for all EU nationals can be best achieved through continued diplomatic cooperation. We will of course continue to keep you informed. I know that we all share the same objective: full visa waiver reciprocity. I’m confident that the remaining Member States will join the US visa waiver programme and I call on you to give this approach another chance.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "S&D", "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 100, "date": "2020-10-19.json", "name": "Marcel KOLAJA", "mepid": "197546", "text": "  The debate is closed.

Strategies were developed, agencies and instruments were created, defence funds were set up. We ask today if they are effective.  With every conflict in the Neighbourhood of the Union, we are increasingly aware of our dependence and almost vulnerability in the face of a potential threat. It is true that we are taking steps forward, but unfortunately too small to be able to realistically say that we are able to ensure our safety in our surroundings.  In recent years, hybrid conflicts such as cyberattacks, disinformation and economic pressure have also come to conventional threats. In addition, global challenges: climate change and pandems. We have realised that Europe must have an impact on building order in its region. Our soft strength must be complemented by a hard force. The European Union needs a common security and defence policy for its own security, to stabilise the situation in its surroundings. Those who today, including in my country, shout so loudly about national sovereignty do not see or ignore our dependence on security. It is time to build more responsibility for our own security, not in contrast to NATO, but next door and in support of NATO.  However, reaching a compromise around PESCO has highlighted the degree to which political rhetoric is detached from military reality. Political narratives of European strategic autonomy collide with the reality of glaring shortages in military capabilities and the current uncertainty about the US military presence on the continent.  So what is PESCO? The permanent security cooperation described in the Treaty of Lisbon was not established until 2017 more than a decade ago. It is a form of military and defence cooperation currently attended by 25 Member States, including Poland. It is based on two pillars: the implementation of 20 commitments and the joint implementation of projects.  The main recommendations contained in my report concern the call on the participating Member States to move from national defence priorities to a European approach, as no Member State is able to meet the current threats on its own. In its original idea, PESCO was an avant-garde concept, involving the most developed and ambitious Member States in the field of defence. The participation of 25 countries means that PESCO is not a collaboration between leaders. We call for no cuts in national defence budgets as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, as paradoxically military spending can increase readiness for a possible next pandemic. Several of PESCO's current projects, such as military mobility and the European Medical Command, would enhance our ability to act together in a pandemic.  We also recommend considering the inclusion in PESCO of the European Union battlegroup system, which undoubtedly needs to be reformed. We suggest that this could increase its operational capacity and efficiency by establishing permanent multinational units used for military tasks or crisis management. Instead of sticking together a brigade from national battalions, the European brigade should consist of volunteers from the Member States and be financed from a common budget and report to the Foreign Affairs Council.  Finally, we call for the immediate adoption of a decision regulating future pesco cooperation with third countries.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 104, "date": "2020-10-19.json", "name": "Josep BORRELL FONTELLES", "mepid": "28267", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission / High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. – Mr President, let me thank your rapporteur, Mr Sikorski, and all Members of Parliament who have contributed to this recommendation on the implementation and governance of Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO). It is very timely as the PESCO strategic review will be finalised in the coming weeks. I can say that I will probably support and share your recommendations. We need to strengthen PESCO’s operational dimension. We need to maintain the European Union’s budgetary ambition in the field of defence, including with regard to the European Defence Fund and military mobility, and we need to sustain efforts to ensure coherence among defence initiatives. There are many of them and we have to make them work together in a coherent way.  PESCO is a key tool for Member States willing to cooperate more in the field of defence within the Union – for those who want to cooperate more in the field of defence. It has three main objectives: first, to enhance the European Union’s capacity as an international security actor; second, to maximise the effectiveness of our spending on defence; and third, and above all, to contribute better to the protection of the population of the countries of destination and, hence, European Union citizens. I think that we can be proud of what has been done in such a short time frame because, let’s not forget, PESCO projects were launched just a couple of years ago in 2018 and 2019. A large-scale PESCO project requires between 10 and 25 years to see the light of day. Whether carried out within the framework of PESCO or not, it takes 10 years. However, 15 PESCO projects could be operational as early as 2025, including in the cyber domain (the cyber rapid response teams), the field of medical support (the European Medical Command) and the area of land battlefield missiles. Other projects, such as those in the anti-missile defence field – the European Patrol Corvette or the TWISTER project – will need more time, but they are already producing concrete and variable results and reinforcing our European Union and our Member States’ military capacity to act and enhance their strategic autonomy. Today, everybody is talking about ‘strategic autonomy’, but there is also a big debate about what these words that everybody is using actually mean. I know that there are strong differences of opinion on the meaning of these two words. However, I think that we can already see good coherence between PESCO and the European Defence Fund. In fact, 50% of the actions that will receive funding from the European Defence Industrial Development Programme, the precursor of the European Defence Fund, are related to PESCO projects. We will keep working together with the Commission, with my friend Commissioner Breton, to ensure such coherence and synergies.  Let me also highlight that 38 of the 47 PESCO projects are fully coherent with NATO priorities. The need to avoid overlap with NATO priorities is considered when selecting new PESCO projects. The other nine projects are more of an operational nature, combining existing capabilities, or they specifically contribute to the development of European technological sectors. This is the case, for instance, with the project ‘material and components for technological EU competitiveness’, which will develop highly technological electronic components. At the same time, one of the key goals put forward for the next phase of PESCO is to focus more on operational projects. We should prioritise projects where Member States stand ready to deploy joint forces on the ground and which deliver concrete and visible results. I think this is the kind of project that we have to prioritise – several Member States deploying joint forces on the ground – as this is something visible that makes it easy to understand what it means to have a common European security policy.  PESCO has great potential, and it is only just starting. Of course, we are still on a learning curve and there is room for improvement, as I stressed in my assessment report this year and as you point out in your recommendation. More binding commitments are at the heart of PESCO. We have seen progress in many areas, including on the need to regularly increase defence budgets. That said, I think there is scope for Member States to better fulfil their commitments. Allow me to give a couple of examples. I think that there is scope for them first to provide substantive support to cover security and defence policy missions and operations – as I said, deploying forces on the ground through our missions and operations should be a priority – and, second, to make more systematic use of the European Union defence tools in national planning and decision-making. As I stated in my recent letter to EU defence ministers, the PESCO strategic review should serve to set up clear milestones for the next phase. I can assure you that many topics raised in your recommendation will be reflected in this review.  Wrapping up this review offers an opportunity to reaffirm PESCO’s main political objective for the next five years, to highlight the projects that will deliver concrete results before 2025 and, last but not least, to identify concrete incentives that will help Member States to fulfil their commitments, in particular when it comes to operational projects. We will discuss these issues with defence ministers in November and I sincerely hope that our Member States will decide on an ambitious next phase for PESCO.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PSE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "PSE"}, {"id": 105, "date": "2020-10-19.json", "name": "Marcel KOLAJA", "mepid": "197546", "text": "  The debate is closed.

It is about shared values and a common destination. We are partners, the Republic of Moldova and us, because we made a commitment to each other. At the heart of that commitment lies one value, one which is being debated now even amongst ourselves, the members of the Union. That value is rule of law. And as we tell and remind our own Member States that rule of law is the fabric of democracy, we also tell and remind Moldovans, over and over again, that the commitment to rule of law and democracy is the essential building block for the common destination that we have set ourselves, which is European integration. My report and the main message which I would like that we, as Parliament, pass this week to the Republic of Moldova is precisely about these fundamental choices and these fundamental values, those that make us all European.  The Republic of Moldova has delivered on a number of reforms in the course of last year and the report acknowledges those efforts, albeit the political instability and the often—confusing signals coming from the authorities. Very importantly, Moldova followed through with the concrete institutional and legislative deliverables that were conditionalities for the second tranche of macro—financial assistance. The citizenship for investment scheme was abandoned, the legislative framework for NGOs was duly adopted, some elements of the judicial reform package were implemented. That led to the disbursement of the much—needed financial aid, along with an additional amount of redirected assistance focusing on COVID—19 immediate response measures. Add to that the EUR 100 million in the omnibus instrument and we have a consistent package for which I praise the Commission and the European External Action Service (EEAS), which understood the need to stand by the Republic of Moldova in these times of need. The report also acknowledges those reforms that are not yet complete, where either the political will is still faltering or where the administrative capacity is insufficient. Democratic mechanisms need to be strengthened, the civil society needs to be more involved, and above all else, the judiciary needs to function independently, beyond any suspicion of political bias or outright corruption. For that reason, the Superior Council of Magistracy needs this reform completed, the activity of prosecutors must be freed of interference and undue pressure, including from obsolete legal provisions in the criminal code. The banking and financial sectors require transparency, stability and predictability if trust in the investment environment of Moldova is to be sustained. It cannot be that several years later, the Moldovans still do not know who is responsible for defrauding EUR one billion from their bank. The Union and us, the European Parliament, will keep watching over those reforms because they are important for Moldova and for its citizens. Now, a final word to them, the Moldovan citizens, and I will do that in their own mother tongue. Europa a fost și va rămâne „acasă”. Este deja pentru mulți dintre moldovenii care circulă liber, momentan afectați, ca noi toți, de restricțiile legate de pandemie, pentru cei care muncesc în toate colțurile Europei, sau cei care își însoțesc familia.  Conducătorii Moldovei – oricine ar fi ei – datorează cetățenilor lor o țară din care să le vină mai greu să plece, iar reformele pe care noi – Uniunea și instituțiile sale – le cerem autorităților sunt acolo pentru voi, pentru a construi o societate și o democrație funcțională, sănătoasă și prosperă.

It has been in place for the last four years. It’s rooted in democracy, respect for human rights and for the rule of law. These values are at the core of the objective of political association and economic integration of the Republic of Moldova with the European Union. But as you have been emphasising, only tangible significant progress on the Moldovan side, with the full implementation of necessary reforms, will enable progress in addressing long-term challenges with which you are very familiar. These challenges are weak state institutions, persistently high levels of corruption and oligarch structures, a deficient judiciary, an aging population and economic challenges faced by young people, leading to poverty and brain drain through immigration. As an associated country, Moldova remains an important partner within the Eastern Partnership Framework. The presidential elections on 1 November will be a crucial juncture in our partnership, and as the report highlights, these elections will be a test for democracy and the rule of law in the country, thus practices contravening international standards must be absolutely avoided. In previous elections, the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) observed vote-buying, misuse of state resources and pressuring voters, among others. That’s quite a lot – vote-buying, misuse of state resources, pressuring voters, among others. In the current COVID-19 context, it is even more important to ensure that all Moldovans are given a free and fair opportunity to vote, following a transparent, inclusive and credible election process, which we will be closely monitoring. We also expect the Moldovan authorities to address the recent actions that risk the hard-won independence of the National Bank of Moldova and the stability of the global banking sector. I agree with your report that the lack of results of the prosecution are unexplainable – not to use another word. Multiple postponements of the ongoing trials of the 2014 one-billion-dollar banking fraud, which means 15% of Moldova’s GDP, are deeply problematic. Clear delivery on that issue is a litmus test for Moldova’s fight against corruption. On the other hand, the COVID-19 pandemic is having a devastating impact on Moldova. Our solidarity and assistance in response to the pandemic has been strong and the European Union remains the biggest provider of aid. We have mobilised over EUR 100 million in bilateral grant support, focusing on the immediate need for protective equipment, strengthening the healthcare system and supporting socio-economic recovery.  Looking ahead, we will be updating our association agenda. This offers a further opportunity to focus on reform priorities across all sectors, supporting civil society and, in particular, engaging with local actors and strengthening independent media will remain key. We shall also continue the full implementation of the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area, supporting small and medium enterprises and advancing the ambitious process of regulatory approximation. Our future assistance will continue to be linked to clear delivery and reforms. The European Union’s strict and smart conditionality phase out as it pushes the necessary reform to improve lives and strengthen Moldova’s resilience. This is the purpose of our association agreement, and I am very happy to participate in this presentation of your report. I fully agree with the need to continue working with Moldova and to fully engage on the fight against coronavirus and these challenges that I have been mentioning which show that this country really needs and deserves our support.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PSE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 2, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 1, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "PSE"}, {"id": 109, "date": "2020-10-19.json", "name": "Marcel KOLAJA", "mepid": "197546", "text": "  The debate is closed.

I support the proposal to create a strict conditionality mechanism linking EU assistance to the adoption and implementation of the necessary reforms at a rapid pace.
