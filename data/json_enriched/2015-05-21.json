The Commission published its spring 2015 European economic forecast on 5 May. Its main message is that the near-term outlook for the EU economy has improved. This was confirmed in the first quarter of this year, where real GDP increased by 0.4 % quarter-on-quarter in both the EU and the euro area. The economic recovery therefore continued in both regions and even strengthened somewhat in the euro area. The euro-area economy recorded its highest growth rate in nearly two years.  The economy is getting an extra boost in the short term from tailwinds such as low oil prices, a weaker euro and quantitative easing (QE) from the European Central Bank. The combined strength of these positive factors underpins a slight upward revision for GDP growth this year. According to our forecasts, real GDP growth in the EU is expected to increase from 1.4% last year to 1.8% in the current year, 2015, and 2.1% in 2016. In the euro area, it is now forecast to pick up from 0.9% last year to 1.5% in the current year, 2015 and 1.9% in 2016. However, underlying weaknesses and legacies from the crisis remain and weigh on the medium-term growth outlook. Unemployment remains intolerably high. The level of debt, in particular corporate and sovereign, remains very high. The share of non-performing bank loans is elevated and continues to rise in some Member States. The shortfall of investment over the past six years has reduced economic growth potential.  Across EU Member States, the recovery is expected to remain uneven. All countries are set to gain from the positive tailwinds, but the extent to which they will benefit will depend on several factors such as the varying responsiveness of individual economies to lower oil prices and the euro depreciation. The ECB’s QE is also likely to have a higher impact in countries with tight financing conditions.  The recovery of the labour market in the EU is progressing and is becoming fairly broad-based across sectors. The unemployment rate is projected to decline slowly, reflecting the persistence of high structural unemployment and the large unemployment gaps, as the rise in economic activity is not strong enough for a more marked improvement.  Inflation is bottoming out. Later this year, and more noticeably in 2016, inflation is expected to pick up. It will be underpinned by stronger domestic demand, fading effects of lower commodity prices and higher import prices triggered by the euro depreciation. Inflation expectations have recovered, and the risks of deflation have moderated as a result of the ECB’s QE and the stronger growth outlook. The fiscal outlook is improving and the aggregated fiscal policy stance is expected to be broadly neutral in the current year in the European Union. In many EU Member States, deficit ratios are projected to continue falling in 2015 and 2016, helped by stronger growth and lower interest payments on public debt.  Following the substantial fiscal adjustment achieved over the last few years, the aggregated fiscal policy stance in 2015 in the EU is expected to be broadly neutral and therefore more supportive to growth. Moreover, for the first time since the onset of the crisis, the debt burden is also expected to decrease as of this year. Uncertainty remains elevated but risks to our growth outlook are broadly balanced. Growth could surprise on the upside if monetary policy and low oil prices have bigger effects than anticipated. Also, the Investment Plan for Europe, for which a cautious approach has prevailed in our assessment, could have a stronger than expected impact.  Downside risks include geopolitical risks, as tensions related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict remain high. Also, if oil prices rebound faster than assumed, this could erase the windfall gains from lower energy prices. In financial markets, the risk of renewed financial market volatility could weigh on economic growth.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 2, "date": "2015-05-21.json", "name": "Ildikó GÁLL-PELCZ", "mepid": "102886", "text": "   We have made very important progress and we have very good forecasts.

However, growth is slow and still unstable, and there are serious unknowns in the future. For example, some have been mentioned here: the risk of the relationship with Russia, the negotiation with Greece, the lack of reforms in some of the large countries. The truth is that the confrontation between growth and austerity turned out to be a false debate. Today it is clear that without austerity and reforms there can be no growth. My country, Spain, is a good example: four and a half years ago it lost 70 billion euros of revenue, it had 30 billion euros of hidden deficit, it lost three and a half million jobs in just four years, every two minutes three jobs were lost, we were in recession and the financial system lost 250,000 impossors. Today, four years later, of austerity and reforms, we met the deficit targets, those who charge less than 20,000 euros a year already pay less taxes, no hospitals have had to be closed, no school, no purchasing power has lost pensions, 500 000 jobs have been created in the last year. Eight jobs are now created every two minutes. A ransom was avoided, Spain did not have to be rescued. GDP has grown by 3.5% in the first quarter and the growth rate of the economy is the highest of the large countries of the European Union. We are idealists, but we must not be illusory and much remains to be done. You have to stop it from being believed in magic wands. They don't exist in economic policy, it's more like math. That is why we must ask everyone to fulfil their obligation, because Europe is a club in which we are all equal in rights, but also equal in obligations and what has been obligatory for the Countries of the Mediterranean must also be mandatory for others, whatever their size.

For a sound recovery we need certainly a push for reforms, but I would say reforms having in mind better growth potential in our economies, providing better jobs – these are the kind of reforms we need to have – but most of all we need to have a large investment plan really providing opportunities for many strategic projects which are still waiting for proper financing.

That is a good thing, but, ladies and gentlemen, let us not tell each other blows. Our economic engine had stalled. We were able to get it going again. But how? Mainly because of low energy prices and the monetary dumping currently practised by the European Central Bank.  Yes, the ECB's policy pushes us from the red to the green figures, but those advantages do not outweigh the disadvantages. The interest on our savings accounts is falling. Our pensions are becoming increasingly insecure and we are blowing bubbles in our economy. Anyway, the economic engine is running again. How can we ensure that we continue to progress and to keep moving forward? This can only be done if we opt for a genuine recovery policy, because short-term windfalls can never be a foundation for a strong economy.

We do have plans for an energy union, because energy prices are of course much higher than in other parts of the world. We really need to work on this quickly with the internal market.

Where is the reduction in unemployment, especially among young people? Where are the investments, public and private? Where is the strengthening of cohesion, social and regional? In recent years, Europe has gone backwards and the weak growth rates of recent months are mainly due to external factors. So we need a shift in economic policy from the doctrine of unilateral austerity and cuts. And this shift needs to be made, at last, also in Greece, which has suffered from the most catastrophic recession and the most savage unilateral austerity. It's not just a matter for the Greeks, it's your case. We must ensure better administration, less bureaucracy, less corruption, a stronger economy, but you must also rid the country of a programme that has destroyed both the economy and society.

As an EU member, the UK has to accept all of the EU’s growth-toxic legislation; and by the way, only 15% of the UK’s GDP is accounted for by EU trade. The EU also imposes alternative energy policies. In direct consequence, electricity in the European Union now costs twice as much as in the United States, and indeed energy prices in the EU increased by 40% from 2006 to 2013. Further, the EU is a protectionist construct. It was set up that way. It inhibits free trade, and one example is that Member States cannot enter into their own trade agreements.  The EU single currency – the euro – defies economic sense, Mr Pons. Spain is in a monetary union with Germany. Greece is in a monetary union with Germany. It does not work.

Three aspects are, in my view, of particular importance here. Firstly, this is a responsible budgetary policy. Especially in the current environment, it is essential that budgetary rules are respected in order to make economic and monetary union fit for the future. Secondly, more investment. I am sure that the investment offensive that is just beginning will bear fruit in the long term. However, we should not forget that investors are looking not only at economic data and risk indicators, but also at economic performance, debt ratios and deficit figures. Investment and forward-looking economic policy are two sides of the same coin. Thirdly, the implementation of structural reforms. At the root of all efforts are still the Member States, especially those Member States that are in difficulty and need to press ahead with the reform agenda. It is about the courage to undertake far-reaching structural reforms, not empty promises of reform, the implementation of which is a long time coming.

There are Member States that are strict, that are struggling, that are also a little bit of a thing for their citizens, but they are making progress and they are generating growth figures.

Where are people better off? I recommend a look at the realities, and we will see that there is more and less progress. But, in principle, europe is making progress.

Most of these countries that have been in difficulty – Spain, Ireland, Latvia, Portugal – are making progress, and other countries are making really good progress. It is about corporate culture, it is about frugal fiscal policy, about incentives for growth. It is not a question of spending more money – such nonsense!

Why, moreover, do you not refer to the work of economists at the Central Bank, who believe that the unemployment rate will remain in double digits, including in 2017?

Parts of the Eurozone system are benefiting from an internal under-valuation. This allows them to maximise sales of their output within the zone. They thereby achieve better scale economies for their output, which helps them penetrate better in non-Eurozone markets. Meanwhile, other parts of the euro system are internally overvalued, which makes them uncompetitive both within and outside the Eurozone.

The European economic forecast has rarely benefited from such a strong conjunction of supporting factors. However, these are expected to be largely temporary and the legacy of the crisis will continue to be felt for years to come. In order to make the recovery sustainable and avoid the risk of falling back into negative growth, it will be essential to invigorate more permanent growth drivers. Three sets of actions are imperative. First, a coordinated boost to investment. Many of you have already mentioned this. It could be achieved by reorienting public expenditure towards more growth-enhancing investment and by swiftly implementing the investment plan for Europe. Second, a renewed commitment to growth-enhancing structural reforms and reforms in product, services and labour markets that increase productivity and foster investment, which are key to enhancing the euro area potential growth. Reforms implemented in recent years in some Member States are starting to bear fruit, and accommodative monetary policies help facilitate their implementation and enhance their effectiveness. Third, the continued pursuit of fiscal responsibility. The current broadly neutral aggregate fiscal stance is appropriate in the light of the gradual recovery. Yet, in order to address both the short- and medium-term challenges Europe faces, Member States with fiscal space should seize opportunities to step up useful investment, while those with large deficits can consolidate debts. Everywhere, the composition of public finance can be designed in a more growth-friendly manner.  These three actions have been the economic priorities of the Juncker Commission since its first day in office. They were the guidance given in the 2015 Annual Growth Survey, and the package of country-specific recommendations we adopted last week fully reflects these key priorities to reinvigorate growth and employment in the European Union. Under this new Commission, we have revised our policy coordination process to promote better implementation of the recommendations. So far, about 55% of the recommendations to Member States from last year have recorded at least some progress in their implementation. The ongoing recovery is an opportunity for all stakeholders to redouble their efforts.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I am speaking on behalf of the chairman, Jerzy Buzek, and therefore on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy – which is also represented here by other Members who will certainly be speaking in this debate – to ask the Commission very strongly for an answer on certain points in the question, which relate to significant compliance with our energy policy.  We are all very aware that over the years there has been a growing need for an EU energy policy, there is also a legal basis with the Treaty of Lisbon. There is, however, a very strong need for the integration of the various national markets towards the creation of a single European market. In this respect, Parliament has worked legislatively over the past few years and we have arrived at the so-called third energy package, which contains very significant rules, a whole series of implementing regulations.  I call on the Commission – and in particular you, Commissioner, to also make an active spokesperson for it – to emphasise the fact that our objectives, which are always very ambitious, must, however, be just as ambitious, as much tenacity in the implementation phase, otherwise we are making great objectives but then we are not achieving them because we are not setting in motion the necessary instruments, the necessary resources.  I am thinking in particular of the third energy package. I was in Parliament, like other Members, when we launched it, but we are very deficient, as we know, in the implementation phase. Not all the rules laid down have been implemented in all countries, in all Member States: in some, yes, but in others these objectives are still a long way off. And there is also a strong asymmetry between the reality of the different countries, which makes our European market very limp. That is why – and I stress this – this attention to the need to proceed more concretely in our policies as well. In particular, the question concerns the case of the implementation of the obligations provided for in the regulation called REMIT (the regulation for the monitoring of the wholesale energy market). With this 2011 regulation, it is expected that from this year ACER – the European agency that has been entrusted with coordinating national energy regulators – will be given, in addition to the tasks it already has as a coordinating body of regulators, also the task of monitoring the wholesale market. And as early as this year it should look at a very large number – I do not know if we are recalling this here, in the question, but it is a very, very considerable number – of contracts, of transactions that have been carried out, but on which we are not sure that they correspond to those criteria, those rules of transparency, those rules of fairness that we foresee. ACER therefore faces an absolutely demanding task for our mandate and must do so as from October of this year. But we have noted, in the hearings that we regularly hold in committee with all the agencies that deal with matters that are also within our competence, that it has absolutely no human strength and the appropriate resources to do so. So we ask the Commission: what do you think? If this monitoring task fails, what happens in the European market? Is there more certainty or is there more uncertainty? Is there more transparency or is there more opacity? That is why we are asking precisely to assess this situation, to predict what will happen if ACER is not able to carry out this task.  We would also point out that the partial authorization that has been given to supplement the resources it currently has with about 15 units is insufficient. They calculated with a very accurate study that it takes at least 45 units of a certain level. I know that the Commission has adopted – and I agree with it – a policy of constraints and sobriety for staff, including cuts, and we often oblige the agencies and also our parliamentary institutions, the Commission and the Council, when they make requests for enlargement, first of all to see whether there is a possibility of a review of the distribution of staff within it. All this is absolutely right. But here, it seems, there is no possibility of using internal resources or even of having experts from the national authorities who, at times, are already under-equipped for the tasks they have.

The Commission shares the view of the European Parliament that ACER will play a key role in the compilation and proper functioning of the Internal Energy Market (IEM). The implementation by ACER of the remit which ensures the effective monitoring of the wholesale energy market is essential for the functioning of the IEM. The Commission is committed to ensuring that the agency is adequately equipped to perform all its relevant tasks. It has so far ensured that the level of funding allocated to the agency is sufficient and will be vigilant and propose additional funding when these prove necessary. When carrying out its assessment, the Commission will also consider the Energy Union framework strategy adopted in February this year, 2015, which has further emphasised ACER’s role in completing the EU’s internal energy market.

Well, I'd probably plough that field too — if not this year, then maybe next year, well, maybe next year, until I finish it. This work would be very slow and counterproductive.  We are in fact in exactly the same situation. The European Union has therefore adopted a law, a regulation on the monitoring of both electricity and gas wholesale markets.

It is a thing we take for granted, and indeed rightfully so. When it comes to energy, it has to just work. But someday, Commissioner, it very well might not work. I need not tell you that maintaining, running and supervising the energy infrastructure of Europe is no small feat. That is exactly why we need a strong, active and engaged ACER that can supervise it all and tackle the problems faced by Europe as we move towards an Energy Union and a true internal energy market.  The remit, of course, is the most pressing issue at hand, but before us lies a long list of obstacles to be removed before we can achieve the Energy Union that Europe needs: real infrastructure bottlenecks between European countries prohibiting the free flow of energy across borders due to the lack of transmission capacity, as you know; and artificial energy bottlenecks, where available transmission capacity is intentionally under-utilised or blocked outright, fragmenting further the internal energy market. To combat this, we need ACER to just work, but without manpower it will not.  Commissioner, when will the Commission provide ACER with the necessary financial resources to handle its obligation on the remit? That is my first question. When will the Commission come forward with concrete and detailed information on how and when the mandate and powers of ACER will be expanded, and will the Commissioner guarantee that such a proposal would be accommodated by the much-needed increase for the ACER budget, keeping also in mind that new responsibilities must also come with additional resources?", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 56, "date": "2015-05-21.json", "name": "Marek Józef GRÓBARCZYK", "mepid": "96790", "text": "  On behalf of the ECR Group. – Madam President, i voted in favour of the report by Mrs Schwab ACER plays an extremely important role within the energy union currently being created.

This can only be achieved through a strong system of governance which ensures that Member States do not pull in different directions and pursue contradictory policies. Above all, it must ensure that we increase cross-border energy flows to deliver a genuine, functional single market for energy. This is precisely why we have an agency like ACER. As previously mentioned, ACER has been given increased responsibilities within the third energy package. However, it is crystal clear that it lacks the resources needed to meet all those responsibilities. ACER itself has identified the need for 118 members of staff but has been approved resources for only 77 members of staff. As a result of this, crucial actions related to its remit are being postponed at a time when action must take place faster than ever before in order to build a true European Energy Union.

He said the new Commission wanted to be big on big things and small in small ones. I took that statement with some skepticism at the time. I don't think you can build big things without paying attention to the little ones. In the current situation, when it comes to financing ACER, this is precisely the problem we are facing again. The Union proclaims great things: it proclaims an Energy Union, the Commission appoints a special Vice-President, Maroš Šefčovič, for the Energy Union, and adopts an energy security strategy.  ACER itself is being assigned tasks that go far beyond the tasks it has carried out so far, and when it comes to small things, it is practiced to create the necessary conditions and to provide it with the necessary resources, then somehow the Commission's attention disappears and runs out. This is a very important issue. ACER is a guarantee that the big plans that the Commission cherishes in the context of the Energy Union, in the context of the unification and interconnection of the European energy market, can also be put into practice.  Moreover, it is not just the energy market. In general, it is a question of trust in the EU institutions that we face. If the Commission deploys tasks to one of its institutions and does not provide the necessary resources to ensure that it is able to carry out the tasks properly and fully, it will encode in the system that that institution will fail, and sooner or later consumers, whether retail consumers or market participants, will experience this on their own skin. And what are they going to conclude from that? They will conclude that the institutions of the Union are not functioning, they are not able to carry out their tasks. Therefore, if we want European voters and European energy market participants to have confidence in the European institutions, it is essential that we provide the necessary resources to do the task. And when we talk about consumers, it should also be bearing in mind that ACER's task is, inter alia, to eliminate market disruptions that may mean higher energy prices that consumers may need.  Is the Commission determined to do everything possible to ensure that European consumers have access to energy at the lowest possible price, by enforcing competition on the market, or not?

This cannot be achieved without a strengthening of the role of ACER. Europe’s energy system is still too fragmented.

At the same time, the Commission as a member of the troika is pushing for an increase in VAT, which will lead to an increase in the price of electricity, which will further increase energy poverty as thousands of households already do not have access to electricity. The troika had also for months blocked the implementation of the institution of maturity which would lead to a reduction in the price of energy for energy-intensive Greek industries such as LARCO.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 77, "date": "2015-05-21.json", "name": "Ivan JAKOVČIĆ", "mepid": "124754", "text": "   – Madam President, Dear Mr. Commissioner, in this high house we talk about energy practically every session.

The Single Energy Market is not possible without free cross-border energy flows subject to regulatory rules common to all Member States. A strong pan-European Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators is therefore needed to have the necessary human and power resources to lead the single market and ensure uniformity of the rules for the functioning of the energy market in individual countries. ASER has a responsibility not only to ensure the regulatory completion of the internal energy market with the relevant rules and regulations in cross-border energy exchange, but also to coordinate the activities of national regulators in this regard. The new European Energy Union, on which work has begun with a strong political impetus to achieve greater energy security, requires significantly greater coordination and cooperation between Member States on connectivity between energy systems and for open and free trade in energy between them.

The authorities are playing a grotesque confusing game here. You could call it endisappearanceforced , something that the international community outlaws. Zimbabwe has committed itself accordingly. We demand complete clarification. We are asking for his release as long as he is still alive. I hope that this could also be a new beginning. However, we must help.

Previously, human rights defenders abducted in Zimbabwe have usually reappeared after a few weeks. Prior to their release, Zimbabwean civil society could also usually get information about them through informal contacts with members of the security forces. Mr Dzamara was abducted on 9 March and it is a matter of concern that there have been no indications about his situation. The European External Action Service (EEAS), through the EU Heads of Mission in Harare and services in Brussels, is closely following the fate of Mr Dzamara. The European Union seizes every opportunity to convey to the Zimbabwean Government our concerns and to demand that the authorities do everything in their power to restore him to freedom, as well as respect to their legal obligation to report to the court the progress of the investigation. The European Union also reminds the Zimbabwean Government that human rights lie at the core of our partnership and the gradual normalisation of our relations. To mark the second month of this abduction, the European Union missions in Zimbabwe published on 9 May a new statement underlying these concerns and calling on the government of Zimbabwe to ascertain Mr Dzamara’s whereabouts and safety, and to bring to justice those responsible for his abduction. EU statements were previously released on 11 March and 9 April. EU statements have been welcomed by Zimbabwe’s civil society and human rights defenders who expressed their appreciation for the EU’s swift action. The fate of Itai Dzamara was also raised by the head of delegation in Harare during his Schuman Day speech. Vice President Emmerson Mnangagwa described in the parliament on 11 March the kidnapping as a barbaric act and gave assurances that the government was engaged with the relevant departments to investigate this case.

Currently, about 8,000 people have been floating in bad boats without water or food on the high seas for weeks or months. Malaysia and Indonesia have refused to land some boats despite extreme exhaustion. It is admirable that Indonesian fishermen have rescued boat refugees on their own initiative. We call on the governments of Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand to adopt at the forthcoming conference a policy that saves the refugees from danger to their lives and grants them asylum. We also call on the Thai Government to continue to combat trafficking in human beings in order to put an end to slave-like exploitation. However, victim protection must play a central role in this.

Rohingya people there need the State’s permission to marry and to have children. They have had no protection from sectarian violence and, indeed, they have been victims of state violence and eviction. So it is not surprising that many of them have fled across the borders, where again they find themselves at risk of being instrumentalised. It is clear, as others have said, that the source of this problem lies in Burma/Myanmar. They have not even taken back the 200-300 people that they have recognised as their citizens from the camps in Bangladesh.

Moreover, they are then forced to flee to neighbouring countries, and so what is happening is the exploitation of minor workers and the trafficking of human lives in Thailand shamefully, in camps that are often not far from the images we have seen in the history books with regard to the Nazi concentration camps.

The European Union watches with great concern the unfolding humanitarian crisis involving thousands of Rohingya and Bangladeshi migrants and human trafficking victims adrift on the Andaman Sea. The situation definitely calls for urgent action by all countries involved, in line with their international obligations and international human rights standards. The priority has to be on saving lives and not putting more lives at risk. I therefore welcome the outcome of the meeting of the Foreign Ministers of Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand on 20 May, which clearly recognised the serious humanitarian dimension of the crisis, including their commitment to provide at least temporary shelter to persons still at sea. We also understand that a further regional conference will take place in Thailand on 29 May. Dealing with this crisis requires a regional response to tackle transnational organised crime, human smuggling and trafficking networks. It must include addressing the root causes of the problem. The EU encourages ASEAN to play an active role in addressing the issue.  One of the root causes is, of course, the status and welfare of the Rohingya minority in Myanmar and the under—development of Rakhine State, where most of the Rohingya originate. The situation needs to be urgently addressed by the government of Myanmar. Only an improvement in the overall human rights situation, including the status of the Rohingya, can put an end to the exodus of this minority, which has been going on for a number of years and has recently increased dramatically. The European Union has been at the forefront of calling for a durable solution for the Rohingya. Over the years, the situation in Rakhine State has dominated our political dialogue with Myanmar, including at high-level meetings and in the EU-Myanmar human rights dialogue. We continue to table resolutions on the human rights situation in Myanmar in the EU and in the General Assembly of the UN Human Rights Council, with a strong focus on the situation in Rakhine State. The EU is also a key provider of humanitarian assistance and development cooperation, benefiting Rakhine State in Myanmar as well as areas hosting the Rohingya in Bangladesh. We encourage the countries in the region to jointly address the scourge of human trafficking. It was deeply troubling to learn about the discovery of mass graves in the southern part of Thailand and victims of human trafficking kept caged in camps for ransom. Human beings should not be reduced to commodities. The European Union has consistently called upon Thailand to combat human trafficking, including forced labour on fishing vessels, and the European Union stands ready to work together with the countries concerned in addressing this issue. Thank you for this debate and the very strong resolution. All your comments have been noted. I will soon discuss this matter with Vice-President and High Representative Federica Mogherini to make our action more effective on this matter because it is necessary to be more active in this very painful situation regarding the Rohingya refugees.

However, there is a huge degree of responsibility that lies within the international community. And that applies to the western international community, as to the Asian international community.

In our active engagement, we have since the very beginning in March 2014 always expressed our serious concerns regarding the issue of freedom of the media and freedom of expression in Swaziland. Thulani Maseko and Bheki Makhubu were arrested on 17 March 2014 after they had written an article in The Nation magazine criticising the way the courts had handled the arrest of a government vehicle inspector. From the outset, the EU delegation in Mbabane, in consultation with our partners, has followed both cases very closely. The EU Ambassador, who has been present at the court, has been in close contact with the relatives and the legal team and has introduced a formal request to visit both men in prison.  The European Union made a local statement on 31 March last year in order to express its concern about the detention of the two accused, followed in June 2014 by mentioning this in an EU statement during the ILO International Labour Conference while discussing labour standards in Swaziland. Nevertheless, the men were sentenced to two years’ imprisonment without the alternative option of a fine. The trial was widely condemned by leading international rights groups as unfair and not complying with international standards. A spokesperson’s statement was issued after this severe sentencing in July 2014, in which we called upon the Swaziland authorities to respect and promote the freedom of expression in line with the country’s constitution and international and regional human rights obligations. The European Union admits that the human rights track record is unsettling, and unfortunately improvements are extremely slow but, since last week, trade unions are no longer banned. The latter unfortunately does not guarantee that their meetings will not any longer be disturbed nor that their militants will not remain in prison. Let me conclude by saying that Swaziland’s whole justice sector is under pressure. Chief Justice Michael Ramodibedi has been accused of 28 infractions, including abuse of power. Judge Simelane, who tried the two activists, is himself currently arrested and charged with abuse of power and defeating the ends of justice. Finally, the Minister of Justice...

It cannot be ignored that structural deficits, as well as the long and not particularly flexible decision-making process, are at the forefront of operations carried out under the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP).

This report on the implementation of Mr Danjean's common foreign and security policy is a serious attack on one of the elements of national sovereignty. True to the policy of small steps, but denying this will, this report proposes to add a stone to the utopian edifice of \"European army\" already rejected in 1954 under the name of CED. We talk about pooling and sharing, i.e. pooling and sharing national defences through the common foreign and security policy. Worse, the pretext of austerity and the breakdown of national defence budgets is used to promote this mutualisation and thus speed up the Process of the European Army.  Moreover, the CFSP is only one of the faces that the EU's policy of submission to the American and NATO desiderata has taken.

In view of this, third countries can interpret (or live) the EU's trade policies as a segment of geopolitical interests under the United States of America, and can therefore look with suspicion at the strengthening of trade and relations with the Union.  On the other hand, a clear separation between the EU itself and NATO would be appropriate and appropriate to the EU's economic interests. Finally, it is a serious mistake to call – as the report does – for the industrial base of European defence to be strengthened and for the Member States to spend at least 2% of GDP on defence. This means looking for a way out of the current economic crisis in strengthening the war industry that is inevitably linked to state orders: while European citizens are suffering from the crisis and austerity and poverty is spreading, it is unacceptable for Europe to spend time rearming itself.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "EFDD", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Eurosceptic conservatives"}, {"id": 313, "date": "2015-05-21.json", "name": "Marc TARABELLA", "mepid": "29579", "text": "  In writing.

The EU cannot consider implementing its own military policy, nor should it try to do so. The scarcity of financial resources, the lack of efficiency and effectiveness of decisions and the difficulties of including military missions in the Union budget simply run counter to the European legal framework, which is not prepared for the decision or implementation of military measures, especially in the presence of a CFSP and a CSDP that have not yet been integrated and in the light of a lack of real political union.  Increasing the defence budget, which would be poured into 'Petersberg tasks', also seems to contradict the union's integration objectives: the leadership would always fall within the hands of the most militarily gifted EU States, alienating the possibility of expressing the Union's unique position, if not legitimising the assimilation of weak to strong voices.

For years, European defence budgets have seen significant reductions. While in 1997 Member States spent an average of 2.1% of their GNI on defence, this figure was only 1.7% in 2007.

This lack of coordination puts the Union at risk because it means relinquishing crucial strategic capabilities for the CSDP.

A more influential Europe needs a strong and active common security and defence policy, which in turn requires a more competitive and effective defence and security sector. In reality, the defence industry remains too fragmented in Europe, with significant state aid in several countries, leading to a difficult internal competition situation. European companies are faced with large American groups, which benefit from a much larger market. At present, European countries share only one-fifth of their equipment purchases and, even worse, they achieve only one-eighth of their joint research and technology effort.

As a means of consolidating defence policies, the report broadly reinforces the enhancement of the European defence market as an indispensable tool for strengthening the EU's warlike capacity. In its objectives, the European standardisation of security measures on the most diverse fronts, intervention in the framework of NATO's policies and objectives, a tool at the service of US imperialist policy, the European federalisation of its foreign policy, in particular through the role of the VP/AR, which we do not recognise and reject, are pursued.
