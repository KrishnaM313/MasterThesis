I am also convinced that this European Parliament has until the next elections and little but enough time to do a lot of work on the basic laws that need to be adopted. I am convinced and I want to assure you that when you need our expertise in the Western Balkans, in cohesion policy and in migration, we are at your disposal to share our experience, and of course to make a commitment, which you would impute to us. There are four priorities for our presidency: the future of Europe and young people as a key priority; the European perspective and connectivity of the Western Balkans; a secure and stable Europe; the digital economy and the skills needed for the future, which is also of direct and important importance for the whole internal market. I assume that after your speeches and later after the questions, there will be a lot to talk about, but I would still like to share with you why and in what areas I think it is important to make progress during our presidency, to have a debate and to look for the most serious and correct solutions. For 30 minutes now, we have been debating with President Tajani, and many times with the President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, on the Dublin agreements, on tackling the flow of migration. I dare say that Bulgaria managed to make the migration pressure zero within a year. This was achieved with a lot of work, and I think that on the Bulgarian-Turkish border we showed how together with European solidarity and assistance - thanks to the Council of Bratislava, which allocated 160 million euro for technical means - with the efforts of the state and with the agreement we have with Turkey, we can work to minimize the flow of migration. And yet you know that we have a huge sea border on the Black Sea with Turkey and a large land border. Therefore, on the subject of Turkey, I believe that the agreement must be signed, must continue to work and that we must try - despite the firm position we have and which we must defend with regard to the rights of the media in Turkey, with regard to the rule of law. law - pragmatically try to resolve the issue of the migration agreement to continue to work, because there are millions of migrants who are currently cared for by the Turkish side. Of course, one of the main topics, one of the main disputes between the Member States, is how to relocate migrants entering Europe afterwards and how to take care of them. We will try to solve this issue with a lot of tact, with a lot of diplomacy, because on the one hand, in several countries of the European Union there is a huge concentration of migrants - they put a lot of effort, spend huge resources. Other countries do not want to take part in this process, and there is a third group of countries, such as Bulgaria, Greece and Italy, which are at the very entrance of the migrant wave and I think that we should find a solution to support the common protection of the European border. The solution, in my opinion - something I have always insisted on for years - is to guard our external borders so that entry into Europe takes place only through checkpoints and there is a proper check. And for those fleeing wars, fleeing bullets and missiles, for which Europe has always been the most humane, let us take care, but let it be known that this will be until the end of military conflicts. Or to make centers, safe centers, which we can support and provide financially close to military conflicts, so that people can then return and participate in the reconstruction of their countries, because perhaps you have all seen in the news, the degree of destruction where there is such a war. And those who are economic migrants should be allowed where they are needed. These are the suggestions I have for a solution, of course you will tell me how to do it. As far as the Western Balkans are concerned, there are several options, so we have proposed one that I do not think poses a risk to the European Union. We are sure, we know, and Jean-Claude Juncker was in Sofia only a few days ago - thanks to President Tajani, Jean-Claude Juncker and President Tusk for coming to Sofia to open the Bulgarian Presidency - that in the mandate of this Commission there will be no new Member States from the Balkans accepted into the European Union. At the same time, we must tell them very clearly and very honestly what hopes they can have, how our views on their integration into Europe would be set in time. I dare say, knowing the region, that this is the right time to do it. You see how a shot in Kosovo literally blew up the whole Balkans yesterday, the Kosovo-Serbia negotiation process and immediately the mood changed. At the moment, the peoples of the Balkans truly expect and believe that, being geographically and historically in Europe, they will finally have a plan to join the European Union. Some are ahead, some are further back. I think that Bulgaria and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia have given an exceptional example that there are countries in the Balkans that can solve problems with tact and goodwill and not come to you with their problems. The good-neighborly agreement between Bulgaria and Macedonia, which has been dragging on or being worked on for decades, but was not accepted anyway, was signed only a few days ago. Yesterday, respectively, the Macedonian Parliament adopted it, ratified it, now, I hope, next week and the Bulgarian, but Prime Minister Zaev was, as he said, quite brave, as we are. We really hope that the name process between Skopje and Athens will also end now, because that will give Skopje a great perspective. I say this not by chance to irritate my Greek colleagues, but to give a perspective to NATO and the European Union, because this is a place in the Balkans that is like a cornerstone, the one that holds the construction sites - and if it moves, they start moving. the whole Balkans. What would happen if we did not make this decision, we did not work on building the infrastructure? I would just like to remind you that Corridor № 4, Corridor № 8 and Corridor № 10 are European corridors and we have the rare chance to prepare the Western Balkans for both investment and tourism without any risk. Let us not allow them to become depopulated, let us not allow young and skilled people to leave for America or Europe and leave there mostly elderly people, let there be no one to work for the payment of pensions that ensure a normal life. Bulgaria went through this path. And then completely different political parties appear and I don't know if the process will be able to continue. If we do not do it - the interest that Russia, Turkey, China and Saudi Arabia have in the Balkans is great - someone else will. That is why we are ready to work with everyone individually, I know the region, we have held multiple meetings with all leaders in Sofia and Belgrade, and now is the time to give them perspective. I really hope for the support of Mr Tajani, Mr Juncker and all of you, because the stability of the Balkans is directly responsible for the stability of Europe. Then we will wonder where Islamic fighters came from or where radical Islam came from, because there is a lot of fertile ground there, due to the large percentage of the Muslim population living in the Balkans. The way out is a European perspective. They expect it, they want it. In this way we will be able to have the necessary influence and security in this region. Of course, on the subject of Turkey I said. The topic of Russia, with all the remarks we have, there are Member States that they want the sanctions to fall, others are just the opposite - extremely harsh, they want to deepen even more. Ultimately, we will try to seek normalization of relations with our other big neighbor, such as Russia, but of course this far exceeds our threshold of opportunity. This will be a pan-European solution. In connection with all this, as we are already working with Commissioner Oettinger, with Jean-Claude Juncker, with President Tajani we have now talked for a long time, is the common European budget. I do not make it a follow-up priority. I trust and rely on the European Parliament very much, because the budget of a country or the budget of Europe actually makes the policy, gives the challenges and through the budget and the financing of the individual programs, we will be able to defend a given priority accordingly. Is the common agricultural policy important? It is important. Is cohesion policy important? It is extremely important. If we, the recently admitted countries of Central and Eastern Europe, the Balkans have prosperity - here I am making a bracket: Bulgaria has 4% economic growth, 6% unemployment, zero budget deficit, huge fiscal reserve, fixed because we have a currency board, the exchange rate of the lev to the euro, we are making efforts and I think we are ready for the 'waiting room' of the euro area - these policies have largely contributed to this. They contributed to what we managed to build in the field of infrastructure, competitiveness, educational infrastructure, ecology, transport, and here is the place to thank all donor countries that have helped so much for Bulgaria, but I think for the whole region. I have impressions of the former socialist countries before 1989, of what they looked like then. Now, when you go to Budapest, Prague, Bratislava or Warsaw, the difference is huge. And I think here we need to find the balance of mutual respect for the donor countries that have given billions of euros for our accession, in order to reach and be competitive with their economies and everything else, and what we have not only as a market but also as a culture, as a geostrategic location, so I think there is nothing better than walking all together and there is no better place to live . It is no coincidence that everyone wants to come to Europe, to the European Union. So cohesion policy must continue. In just a few words, I would go through the common European defense. Given the great geopolitical challenges we are facing at the moment, I think we are looking a little at the threats. We usually react a lot after they have already happened. We let whole processes develop and we be a kind of spectator. We leave the presidents of the big countries - Russia, the United States, China, Turkey, Iran - to make decisions on issues that we are actually facing with a terrible force in Europe. From these wars come migratory flows. When there were banking crises, then Europe paid the big price and we - around the clock - I remember there was advice until 5-6 o'clock in the morning - solved the financial crisis in Europe. It is an honor for all those who ruled the Council, the Commission and Parliament at the time - I apologize if I sometimes confuse the seats. This is not out of disrespect, just out of a desire to use my time and speak faster. But we have managed, albeit slowly, to deal with the financial crisis. Europe is already growing and I am convinced that there is no one better than us, that is for sure, than a united and strong Europe. The energy union, the social pillar, what Jean-Claude Juncker proposed yesterday ... I have three options to read, long and tidy, but on the one hand I want to save your time and at the same time really feel what is very important for us and what we consider a priority and to be able to clarify with the questions to us if there is something misunderstood. Not to miss Yuri and the Estonian presidency. I think Estonia did a great job, they put a lot of effort, they were very modern. It will be a joy for us if we can get closer to Estonia's good performance. And I dare say that with the Chancellor of Austria Sebastian Kurz, who is the next president in 2018, we already have maybe 4-5 phone calls. He will come to Sofia very soon and we want to work on the Bulgarian and Austrian presidencies so that in 2018 all the priorities we have, both we and they, are not interrupted, but to continue with your help in all portfolios for which I spoke. Finally, on the crucial role of the European Parliament. I know that there are many parliamentary groups, many different opinions. Our strength is in this diversity that we have in Europe. But in the end, the most important and most valuable thing that we in Bulgaria have written to our parliament is that \"Unity makes strength\" That is why we proposed and believe that this would be the most appropriate motto for Europe as well - \"Unity makes strength\".", "language": "en", "original_language": "bg", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2, "date": "2018-01-17.json", "name": "Antonio TAJANI", "mepid": "2187", "text": "Thank you above all for reiterating, during your speech, the centrality of the European Parliament in the action on behalf of the citizens, in favor of the improvement of our Union.This is an important step and an important recognition, which will allow us to work well together.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE-DE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 3, "date": "2018-01-17.json", "name": "Jean-Claude Juncker", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "President of the Commission. - Mr President, let me start by saying that one of the most pleasing aspects of the Bulgarian Presidency is that I will get to see my good friend Boyko more often than usual. As I said to him when he hosted the Commission in Sofia last week, this is a special moment - for Bulgaria, of course, because it is the first Bulgarian Presidency of the Council - but also for me personally. It was under the Luxembourgish Presidency - with myself in the chair of the European Council - that the decisions necessary to launch the overall enlargement process was taken in Luxembourg in December 1997. As President of the European Council once again, I had the honor of signing Bulgaria's accession treaty to the European Union in Luxembourg in April 2005. I remember the year 2005 for so many reasons, in particular because we signed the accession treaty in April. I remember that day like it was yesterday. I remember the emotion that I felt at seeing Europe’s history and geography reconciled. I remember what it meant to a proud European nation to join its friends and allies in our Union. The clocks you had installed everywhere throughout Sofia counting down the days until Bulgaria’s EU accession is a picture I always have in my mind. I felt a kind of ‘Anticipation’, as the Germans say - ‘pre-happiness’, to some extent. The hope and joy we all felt on that day must never fade away. I even remember some of the words I used: that day I said (I sometimes say things like that) that 'history without truth is like a day without light', and the truth is that Bulgaria had to come a long way to join our Union. It had to make changes in a handful of years, that other countries made in decades. It had to be patient; it had to be determined; it had to be courageous, and it was. Today it is with great pride, but also with great expectation, that I look forward to the next six Bulgarian months. Monsieur le Président, Mesdames, Messieurs, je me félicite que la présidence bulgare se soit particulièrement bien prepared for ces six mois, car ces six mois bulgares seront cruciaux pour l’Union et pour son avenir. J’ai pu constater la bonne préparation de la présidence, la semaine passée, lorsque la Commission s’est rendue à Sofia. Pour les Bulgares, pour nous tous, il s’agirait d’abord de finaliser les travaux sur les grands enjeux pour lesquels une action européenne efficace peut véritablement faire la différence. Depending on the pense notamment à la migration, à l’économie numérique et à la sécurité. The Premier ministre a fait de la recherche du consensus l’une de ses grandes priorités. C’est toujours, en Europe, un choix judicieux, qui s’impose aujourd’hui plus que jamais. Depuis novembre 2014, depuis le début du mandat de la Commission, celle-ci a présenté 89 dossiers prioritaires aux colégislateurs, dont 29 ont été adoptés à ce jour. D’ici au mois de mai, toutes nos propositions auront été mises sur la table des colégislateurs afin de permettre au Parlement et au Conseil de terminer le travail législatif avant les prochaines élections européennes. La grande priorité, voire l'urgence des prochains mois, sera donc de traduire ces propositions en actes législatifs et de mettre cette législation en œuvre, car plus le Parlement et le Conseil parviendront à conclure rapidement le processus législatif, plus nos concitoyens rapid ressentirontens effets positifs de nos politiques dans leur vie quotidienne. Le temps presse et j’aimerais vraiment que ce travail aboutisse avant le prochain rendez-vous des Européens avec le suffrage universel. Et puisque le \"B\" de Bulgarie veut alsi dire \"budechte\", ce qui signifie le futur, il s'agira également de preper l'avenir en définissant nos ambitions européennes pour les prochaines années, ainsi que le budget qui sera nécessaire pour les réaliser. Il faudra évidemment faire des choix, décider quels sont les domaines où nous devons dépenser plus et ceux où nous pourrions dépenser moins ou différemment. C’est la raison pour laquelle je plaide pour un débat vertueux qui doit d’abord porter sur le fond des choses, sur les priorités, sur le contenu et puis sur les financements indispensables, et pas l’inverse. Ne commençons pas le débat budget en fixant des plafonds, commençons le débat budget en nous mettant d’accord sur les priorités et sur les contenus. (Applaudissements) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen! Bulgaria has repeatedly demonstrated that it can contribute to European compromises and build bridges - both among the current Member States and with our neighbors in the Western Balkans. Bulgaria is predestined for this, as it knows the region, the culture, the people, their characteristics, their languages ​​and has successfully gone through the difficult EU enlargement process itself. Whenever I am asked about EU enlargement, I therefore refer to Bulgaria, which has achieved great things, including in terms of economic development. The Bulgarian economy grew by 3.9% last year, employment is developing positively, Bulgaria has an excellent grip on its public debt and budget, better than many member states of the euro zone. These are the best conditions for Bulgaria to be able to join the European Exchange Rate Mechanism 2 - the so-called ERM II - and in a few years also the euro. Nominal convergence is important, but so is real convergence. There is still a lot to be done here, including the fight against corruption, and I know that the Bulgarian government is working very hard in this direction. Bulgaria is a real success story that can and will inspire our neighbors in the Western Balkans. It was therefore right that the Bulgarian Prime Minister made the Western Balkans and our relations with the Western Balkans a priority of his presidency. At the On May 17th a Western Balkans Summit will take place in Sofia. This is the right address to talk about the Western Balkans and our relations with the Western Balkans. In Sofia I will also end my trip through the Balkan countries, which I will undertake at the end of February / beginning of March, because I would like to find out on site what the expectations of the various countries are like. And I would also like to tell these Balkan countries what our expectations are of the Western Balkans. Accession doesn't just happen - it doesn't fall from the sky, it has to be worked for. And I would like to say here - in a friendly, as friendly way as possible - that all border conflicts that exist between the Western Balkans must be resolved before accession. Not that we are seeing, as we are now with Croatia / Slovenia, that the problems at hand are only discussed after accession - years after accession. The problems - the border problems - must be resolved before there will be further accessions. (Applause) The countries of the Western Balkans deserve to be given a real European perspective. These accessions will not take place during the term of office of this Parliament and this Commission because not all conditions will be met by then. But the goal must be clearly stated: the goal is the accession of the Western Balkan countries, and these accession can take place once the necessary reforms are made in these countries. Then accession will move closer bit by bit. We have joint projects with the states in this region - security issues, migration, transport, digital, energy and others. The rule of law is one of these projects because the rule of law is the foundation on which our Union, which is a community of law, rests. It is such a fundamental value that only states that adhere to it can join. If this applies before joining, it will of course apply if you have become a member, even after joining. (Applause) We are in - yes - constructive dialogue with the Polish government. I received the new Polish Prime Minister in Brussels and we both tried to bring our positions closer together. We are not at war with Poland, we have a dispute with the Polish government. Recourse to Article 7 (1) of the Treaty is not a sanction. It is a statement and warning article. That is why we should stop - and stop doing so in Poland too - pretending that we are determined to sanction Poland - whatever happens. That is not the content of Article 7 Paragraph 1. (Applause) I appeal to the Bulgarian Prime Minister, Boyko Borissov and his government to participate constructively and in a compromise way in this undertaking on the rule of law in Poland. One of the tasks of a presidency is to seek compromises. But it is also one of the tasks of the presidency to implement decisions taken by the Council of Ministers, at least to help so that they can be implemented. I do not want to abuse this speech in order to make another long digression about Brexit. But yesterday I was unable to answer all the questions that were asked, especially those that our colleague Henkel asked. I am of the opinion that there will be no winners when it comes to Brexit. This is a lose-lose situation, both for the British and for the members of the European Union and for the institutions. I still see Britain's exit as a catastrophe, even a defeat, that we must all tackle. But the reasons for the British decision are deeper. As Mrs May herself said, the British have never felt comfortable in the European Union and have not been given the opportunity for 40 years either given to be able to feel more comfortable. And that's why many are to blame. We - Mr Tusk and myself - held out our hands again yesterday and said to the British Government that if the British people, the British Parliament, the British Government wanted to go any other way than Brexit, then we are ready , to talk about it. We're not throwing the British out. We would like the British to stay. And if that's what you want, then that's what you should do. (Applause) But I noticed that people in London reacted almost piquely to this suggestion. So be it. But even if the British have resigned under Article 50, there is also an Article 49 that allows re-entry. I would like that and I would like us to treat each other sensibly now and not try to sideline each other. (Applause) Mr Henkel asked whether I really wanted to go down in history as the one responsible for Brexit. That calls for a double answer. First of all, I am glad that Mr. Henkel - and we have been with one another for many years - assumes that I will go down in history; I didn't know that before. And when it came to Brexit, I said what I had to say. I am confident that the Bulgarian Presidency will do well. Prime Minister Borissov is a proven European democrat with a strong will and conviction and persuasiveness. (Applause) We know from experience that what matters is not the size of the country, but the strength of will that inspires a government. In the matter of Borissov and in the matter of Bulgaria everything is right for this presidency to be a success. Blagodarya! For those who are less fluent in Bulgarian, that means \"thank you\".

Willkommen im Europäischen Parlament und willkommen zu einer historischen Stunde: der Übernahme der Ratspräsidentschaft durch Bulgarien. Wenn man das in Bezug setzt mit den letzten 30 Jahren – der Kampf gegen den Kommunismus, der Kampf für die Freiheit und heute die Möglichkeit, dass Bulgarien Europa führt: eine wunderbare Entwicklung, die eingetreten ist.  Die bulgarischen Bürger können darauf stolz sein, weil sie immer proeuropäisch gehandelt haben. Bulgarien als Land kann stolz sein und, Herr Premierminister, ich glaube, Sie dürfen auch stolz sein, weil auch Sie bewiesen haben, dass Sie Bulgarien in diesen Jahren, Jahrzehnten hervorragend führen und viel Vertrauen von Ihren Bürgern bekommen haben.  The first question now we have the Bulgarian Presidency is what can we learn from Bulgaria? I think that is a good starting point, and one of the lessons we can learn is to look to the economy in Bulgaria. The growth rate is double that of neighbouring Serbia, and that shows that being part of Europe means strong economic success. When you look at Bulgaria, then you can learn that you can count on its values, it has a modernised state that is going forward with European values in the fight against corruption. That is what Bulgaria has been doing in recent years, very successfully. And, finally, we can learn that Bulgaria wants to be a full part of the European Union. It has a clear idea about the next steps ahead: to be part of Schengen and to be part of the euro area. The clear commitments from the Bulgarian Government gives us a clear indication that we should believe in our project. That is what we can learn from Bulgaria, and now let’s have a look at the tasks which are ahead of us. First, I want to underline what Jean-Claude Juncker also said, that the most important thing will certainly be the debate about finances in the European Union. The debate about the multiannual framework of our budget will start in the first half of 2018, and we as the EPP ask for an ambitious approach. We support Jean—Claude Juncker’s view that first of all we have to define what the priorities for Europe are, and then we have to talk about the necessary funding. The second task is migration. A kind of final debate in the European Council about the migration challenge for the European Union is planned in June. Prime Minister Borissov underlined his country’s success story in protecting the border. That is one big thing. The second big point in migration management is to practise solidarity inside the European Union. Hopefully we can manage in the next weeks and months to bring these two things together. On the management of the border, let me finally underline that we are asking for more European engagement, for there not only to be Bulgarian officials standing on the border, but that Frontex should also be more present in the border region.

The Western Balkans is part of Europe and has a chance to become a member of the European Union. When we and the Commission look at the Commission proposal on the enlargement process, we are in favour of this perspective for the Western Balkans and we as the EPP want to focus mainly on concrete projects. People must see that it is a benefit, a positive development to be part of the European Union. So let’s focus on infrastructure, on railways, on motorways. That is what people expect from us.

You arrive at a time of tough ideological battle. An ideological battle between open and supportive Europeanism and the worst ghosts of exclusive populist nationalism. You see, ladies and gentlemen, hearing today about the defense of the white race by a European leader produces real chills. So you have a lot of work ahead of you if you want to push the European Union exactly on the path of openness, solidarity and the future. You have presented a very well put together program, and I would like you to stand out, to leave your mark on some of those policies that you present. If we European socialists were to elect a mark of the Bulgarian presidency, we would like it to be justice. Social justice. The development of the social pillar that so many Europeans are waiting for. Social justice, which will not be possible without tax justice. We need, gentlemen of the Bulgarian Presidency, fiscal harmonization in Europe so that convergence is possible, so that development and the fight against inequality are possible. We share your intention to work hard to develop the Digital Single Market. And if we are serious about migration - we did so in this House yesterday, in the presence of the Council and the Commission - I will tell you that this Parliament has done its job. The Commission, too. We are awaiting the Council's decisions. It is the Council that now has to make the decisions and you know very well, Mr Borisov - because, furthermore, you are Bulgarian and understand this logic very well - that we need a common system of asylum and migration in Europe, and that we need reform the Dublin Regulation urgently. We count on you For that. But there is also the rule of law, democracy, the defense of democratic values ​​- Article 7 that the Commission has activated with respect to the Polish Government - freedom of expression, the fight against corruption. All of this is part of European values. His contribution in the Western Balkans is also highly anticipated. Europe is a community - this is not a cliché - that has to defend the same values ​​everywhere and the same values ​​for all citizens. My group will not accept any discrimination. Bulgaria and Romania must be part of Schengen. Nothing will be easy, but you can count on this group if you go down this road. And one last thing, Mr. President.

The ECR Group hopes that the Brexit negotiations will not just lead to a new EU-UK relationship, but act as a catalyst for a reformed EU. We hope the Bulgarian Presidency will be vocal and resolute in the face of continued Russian aggression in Ukraine. We hope that you will help Western Balkan countries on their journey of reform and, on the migration crisis, that you will ask EU countries what they can do to help – whether giving resources or taking people – rather than telling them what to do.

Recently, major co-operation initiatives have been taken in the Balkans. The Tsipras-Borissov agreement on joint infrastructure investments, the dialogue that begins today between the governments of Athens and Skopje on a solution to the long-standing name issue - which I believe will lead to a solution that will be good for both Greece and FYROM for both the Western Balkans and the European Union - is the road that can turn the Balkans from a European powder keg to a bridge of cooperation between the European Union, the Eastern Mediterranean, the Middle East.

A presidency is always, of course, a very good time for a country to shine in the European Union, but it is also always a great time to shine a light on the country specifically and to have a look at what is happening there. I think we can see a lot of things happening there right now: looking, for example, at the mobilisation of thousands of people on the streets, protesting for the preservation of a unique centuries—old forest – the Pirin National Park – which you are, of course, familiar with. They are protesting against corruption and a very dodgy decision to permit a skiing resort and also commercial logging in this precious natural heritage site, which is also protected by European Union law. Thereby, it is not just an environmental issue, which of course is important, but it is also an issue of how we respect European Union laws and rules. There, I think, as a presidency, you should really lead by good example, and that is one area where I think you can make a big difference. (Applause) Eleven years have passed since the accession, but we have also had 11 anti-corruption reports by the European Commission. Bulgaria is still listed as the country with the most corruption in the European Union. That is a great pity. Also, looking at the anti—corruption measures that have been taken in Bulgaria, many of them can be seen as ineffective and even counterproductive. For example, looking at the most recent anti—corruption law, which will say that whistle-blowers, i.e. people who from inside the administration highlight corruption cases, will face the danger of being persecuted. Citizens may still have to pay bribes for access to public services, and there is still a problem with high influence on public life and media from very obscure circles. The Commission cannot ignore all of those issues. I think the Presidency is a great chance for you to improve not only that image, but also the situation itself, to go deep and really take on the fight against corruption, which will also greatly benefit the citizens of Bulgaria. Let us know how we can also support you in this very important issue.  2018 is a very important year for the European Union, with the elections coming up. Many issues that have been highlighted – the eurozone, finally getting real on climate change, social issues, the rule of law – are very important issues. You have picked a very interesting motto: United we Stand Strong. I think this is very correct and true: we have to be united and we have to be strong in order to address those issues. We also have to be strong as a European Union of values which is fighting for democracy and against racism and xenophobia. I hope all of your ministers could sign that statement. If you are following through on this motto, then we are very much ready to support you all the way through.

In recent years, Europe has been chronically ill with brain drain and youth unemployment. Despite the much-heralded recovery, the figures continue to be frightening: the average of the three rear-viewers - Greece, Spain and Italy - is around 36%. Young people, we young people, continue to feel the effects of the economic crisis and this undermines not only Europe's growth and ability to innovate and innovate, but the very foundations of our project. It is necessary to work together to find concrete and effective solutions and to implement an expansive, counter-cyclical and Keynesian policy that prioritizes work and innovation as soon as possible. Yesterday it was already late. The Bulgarian one was then also baptized as the \"Balkan Presidency\". I too am a firm supporter of the absolute need to relaunch the accession process of the Western Balkans, whose stability and prosperity are of fundamental importance to us all. Today, the lighthouse and example of the integration process is undoubtedly Montenegro, which is ever closer to reaching our large European family, and it will be our task to assist all the countries in the area, applying the principle of \"more for more\": reward those who are most committed to the process of necessary reforms without, however, abandoning others.

I am convinced that Bulgaria will be not only a good mediator, but also a good leader in finding solutions to current challenges.

We belong to European civilization, but the communist dictatorship had separated us for decades, both us and much of Eastern Europe from the European family. The path outlined by our national revivalists, who wanted Bulgaria to be equal to other European nations, has much in common with the vision of a united and free Europe. In the Balkans, history, especially in the 20th century, has opened deep ideological wounds among the peoples of our region. European integration is the best medicine to overcome these historical and ideological divisions and to heal open wounds. That is why I welcome your decision, Mr Prime Minister, that one of the main priorities of the Bulgarian Presidency should be the Western Balkans. We must close these wounds, and not compete over who is greater, but walk together in the common European home. History teaches us that Europe destabilizes very easily through the Balkans.

Important topics are on the Union's agenda. In addition, the priorities set by Bulgaria put on the table other important topics, such as the continuation of cohesion policy as a key tool against division and disintegration in the Union and the European perspective of the Western Balkans. I appreciate the fact that the topic of the Western Balkans has moved to a higher level on the European agenda, but that alone will not solve the region's problems. The six countries need systematic, political and financial support. To make real progress, they need a clear, clear roadmap. It can be prepared during the Bulgarian presidency, setting the deadline proposed by the European Commission until 2025. Europe should not worry about the Western Balkans, but should pursue a policy for the Western Balkans. Only with the integration of the region can we say that we have completed the project of Europe as a zone free of ethnonationalism. But let's not be fooled, Mr. Borissov. These causes can be doomed if you continue to rely on the extreme nationalists in Bulgaria and lead Europe with them. Fill in the credit of trust given to you by Mr. Juncker.

I especially want to respond to the Greens, because I am a green person myself. The protection of Bulgarian nature is, I think, largely protected by our government. I have great respect for our environmental organizations and I met with them only ten days ago. I have stopped infrastructure projects for years so that the new storks can hatch because of a stork's nest. I have made the ministers personally carry marsh snowdrops so that not a single stalk is crushed by a roller. All our European infrastructure projects have tunnels for bears, wolves and turtles. We have changed the routes and I think they have no claims on me. What they have told you - I want to guarantee in front of you, and you will pass it on to them - is about a second lift, a single lift at the resort in the top ten in Europe - Bansko. Now there is only one lift and tourists wait in line for hours. I can sign you and guarantee you here that this is only a second lift. Why is it needed? Not just because of the tourists. Now these thousands of tourists board the road with their cars to the top of the mountain and descend from there. To keep the road running this time, we salt it all the time, as they do in Strasbourg, I guess. Dozens of trees around him are dying. I guarantee you that not only will illegal logging not be allowed, but - only here I am opening a bracket - in recent years Bulgaria is the first in Europe for new forests and the only one, perhaps, that has expanded its forests from all European countries. What kind of illegal logging are we talking about here? We are fighting such a battle with this, and what greater guarantee that when there is a second lift and this tourism, which investor will let the pines be cut down? So you have my guarantee that in addition to a second lift, a tile will not put there anymore. To answer those colleagues who raised the issue of corruption. Corruption is everywhere, we are fighting a huge battle. I will connect her with the Greens again. I have been elected 10 or 11 times, together with my party as winners in elections in Bulgaria. We started from the opposition, and we started from scratch. There was an unprecedented garbage crisis in Sofia when I became mayor. There was no factory, no processing, nothing. It was dumped in the ravines in Suhodol. We started and now Sofia is the best organized, I think that after Zurich, thanks to your European solidarity, with complete composting, processing, with a plant for household waste, with landfills - everything, as written in European books. At the same time, if there is such corruption as you say, will there be such economic growth, more investment and this growth? How will people always choose us in the first place? And as a policeman I was elected mayor of Sofia because of what I did in this area. And I guarantee you that, as we have done now, as with the garbage of Sofia, in 2-3 years we will cope. And we will do well. And with the new legislation, and with the will, and with your help and efforts. Please, these friends of ours who are protesting, they were also my coalition partners. They split the election into three parties, to have three leaders, and could not enter parliament just six months ago. They are our most natural partner. It is not my fault that they split into three parties to have three leaders. It is not my fault that I won the election under the government of the Socialist-elected president. They held the election and we won. Sorry, I'm not guilty. At the same time, I want to be responsible for the Istanbul Convention, which only last Wednesday the Bulgarian government adopted in my person. But it was the Bulgarian Socialists at a plenum on Sunday who decided not to support her in parliament. I will make every effort to pass in the parliament and support it, because there is violence against women and children monstrous not only in Bulgaria but in the whole of Europe. So you can count on it and I think the Greens would support me here too ... I hope. I would like to answer all of them. I deliberately wanted to concentrate on where the main criticism is. I want to tell my colleague from the MRF that we work with the United Patriots in this way, we have clearly understood that ethnic tolerance, the ethnic model and exactly what Bulgaria has achieved for decades, thanks to you, we will keep as the pupil of because Bulgaria is an example for the whole Balkans, with its ethnic tolerance.

Of the four priorities identified, none of them deal with human rights, nor are there any references to the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. \"Immigration management\" is often mentioned, with the aim of increasing the effectiveness of \"return policies\" and \"border control management\", but no mention is made of the reform of the Dublin Regulation, nor of the redistribution of migrants.

I believe that the European Union is at a decisive point now in our history. Despite all of the upheavals in recent years, the rise of populism and euroscepticism, nationalism and anti-democratic forces, we meet today in solidarity and with a renewed sense of purpose. The European ideal has always been inspired by a spirit of optimism and a belief in a better future. While that ideal has been tested, it has not been broken. Based on the achievements of the past, we have a renewed appetite to face the challenges of the future.  Back in 1947, representatives from 16 countries met in Paris to discuss how, in the words of Jean Monnet, they could resist economic decline and preserve political freedom.  En 1947, des représentants de seize pays se sont réunis à Paris pour discuter de la manière dont, selon les termes de Jean Monnet, ils pourraient résister au déclin économique et préserver la liberté politique. L’Irlande était l’un de ces seize pays. La sagesse de la prédiction de Monnet selon laquelle «il n’y a pas d’avenir pour les peuples d’Europe autre que dans l’union» s’est vite fait jour. Dès le début, les petits pays ont contribué de manière non négligeable au développement de l’Europe. Dans les années cinquante, Joseph Bech, luxembourgeois et grand architecte de l’intégration, a joué un rôle capital dans la création de la Communauté européenne du charbon et de l’acier, et dans la tenue de la conférence de Messine en Sicile. Interrogé sur la présence de politiciens européens réunis en Sicile en 1955, un haut dirigeant politique britannique rétorqua que ces derniers avaient pris part aux fouilles archéologiques! Des fouilles qui ont servi de base au traité de Rome. Wir sehen die Stärke der europäischen Wertvorstellungen im Erbe der Persönlichkeiten wie Konrad Adenauer und Hans Dietrich-Genscher, deren Vision für Versöhnung und Integration in ganz Europa so wichtig war. Wir sehen sie in der Arbeit Helmut Kohls und seinem Glauben, die Bedürfnisse und Gleichberechtigung kleinerer Nationen zu beachten. Und wir sehen sie in der Vision Jacques Delors' und seinem Glauben an einen tieferen Sinn Europas – eine Seele für Europa –, ohne den das ganze Projekt scheitern würde. Seine Arbeit bei der Schaffung einer gemeinsamen Währung, des Euro, ist ein bedeutsames Erbe. Seine Aufgabe an uns, einen größeren Sinn anzustreben, ist noch bedeutsamer. Mr President, the promise of a better future has motivated people to work for the European ideal since the very beginning. And speaking in this chamber today I am reminded of one of the greatest figures in Irish politics, and one of the greatest figures in politics from Northern Ireland, John Hume, whose birthday it is tomorrow and who served as a Member of this great Parliament for 25 years. John Hume spoke many times about the symbolism of the bridge not too far from here, connecting Strasbourg to Kehl just across the border in Germany. He spoke about how easy and ordinary it was to walk across that bridge, and given Europe’s dark history how remarkable and profound that ordinariness was. In the European Union John Hume saw a model and a vision for how a lasting peace, however improbable, could be fostered and built. and he saw how that model of people working together with a shared purpose and endeavour, spilling their sweat instead of their blood, as he put it, could provide an inspiration for my own country. Today there is a peace bridge crossing the river Foyle, bringing together the divided communities in John’s native city of Derry in Northern Ireland, a bridge that the European Union helped to build. Dear friends, it is hard to imagine the Good Friday Agreement being made without our shared membership of the European Union and its single market, and in Ireland we are now having to contemplate our future without that foundation which underpinned it and made it possible. That’s why the government which I lead has been so determined to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts and all that flows from it. And it is why we have insisted that there cannot be a return to a hard border on our island, no new barriers to the movement of people or to trade. And it is why we are so deeply grateful for the remarkable solidarity and support from other Member States. It is everything we hoped for and proof-positive of why small countries benefit so much from membership of this Union. (Applause) And so the Irish people are profoundly grateful for the unswerving support of this Parliament, and in particular I want to thank your President, Antonio Tajani, your Brexit coordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, the leader of the PPE Group, Manfred Weber, and all of the other political groups that have been so supportive. The solidarity of Parliament has been matched by the Commission and the Council. I’d also like to extend my thanks to President Juncker, to the lead Commission negotiator, Michel Barnier, and also to Council President Donald Tusk. The European Union has consistently recognised the unique position of Northern Ireland and the unique situation in which it finds itself given the decision of the United Kingdom to leave the European Union. A decision which we respect. Notwithstanding that, the majority of people in Northern Ireland voted to remain in the European Union, the majority of the representative elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly want to remain in the customs union and the single market, and it is likely that the majority of people living in Northern Ireland will remain European citizens after Brexit, because of their unique status under the Good Friday Agreement which allows them to be British citizens, Irish citizens or both. The breakthrough achieved before Christmas means that the United Kingdom has guaranteed that whatever the future relationship with the European Union is, a hard border on the island will be avoided, and the common travel area and all the associated rights that flow from it will be maintained. As the negotiations move forward into phase 2 we will continue to rely on your support and solidarity as we work to ensure that what has been promised in theory is delivered in practice, and there can be no backsliding on this. So it is important that these commitments are fully reflected in the legal text of the withdrawal agreement and firmly embedded in the UK’s future relationship with the European Union, whatever shape that ultimately takes. For my part I hope that the new relationship that exists between the United Kingdom and the European Union is as close and as deep as is possible, but consistent with the needs of the Union to protect our internal market and customs union. Mr President, I was born European and am part of a new generation of political leaders who were born after our countries joined the European Union or its predecessors. We treasure what has been achieved and share the vision of the founders for further integration and cooperation. While I’ve always lived with the benefits of European membership, I’ve never taken them for granted. I very much value what was hard won by past generations and what they sacrificed for us. That vision delivered peace in Europe and opened the door to peace and prosperity in my own country. These values of solidarity, partnership and cooperation which are essential to the European project have brought Ireland from the position of being one of the least-developed Member States when we joined the Union to one of the most prosperous today. And for us Europe enabled our transformation from being a country on the periphery to an island at the centre of the world, at the heart of this common European home which we helped to build. The promise of Europe unlocked the potential of Ireland and it allowed us to take our place among the nations of the world. So, along with other Member States who’ve benefited so much from the European Union, I believe we have a particular responsibility now to lead on the future of Europe debate. We have much to offer and also much to give, and I firmly believe it is our responsibility and relish the opportunity. So we should approach, all of us, the debate on the future of Europe with a positive attitude, talking about what we want to achieve for our citizens rather than what we want to block or resist. Many of the policy challenges we face are increasingly global and they cannot be met by nation-states acting alone. Issues such as uncontrolled mass migration, climate change, cybersecurity, international trade, the regulation of medicines and major corporations, many of whom are now bigger than states, cannot be solved by 28 countries coming up with 28 different solutions. In unity there is security, in cooperation there is strength. As we say in the Irish language ‘ní neart go cur le chéile’, there’s no strength without being together. So we should, I believe, welcome those who aspire to and who are ready to take on the responsibilities and obligations of membership. The prospect of membership of the European Union can be a powerful motivator for those who seek to build peace and freedom and prosperity and democracy in the Western Balkans and these countries should, I believe, be given a pathway to membership. Mr President, I believe that in the Europe of the future all European countries and all Member States will be small states, even though perhaps they don’t realise it yet, and you only need to look at the list of the top 60 cities in the world in terms of population, only one of the top 60 is in the European Union, and it is currently getting ready to leave. In terms of population now there is only one country in Europe that is in the top 20 in the world, and its population is falling. So in a global context, we are very much now a union a small countries. And I know that population doesn’t equate to economic power or military strength, but there can be no doubt that these are also shifting east and south globally. So I think we need to stick together if we are to protect what we have and continue to export our values and worldview. (Applause) A Europe worth building is a Europe worth defending and with the launch of the Permanent Structured Cooperation on security and defence (PESCO) in December, which Ireland was pleased to join, we are coming together to answer new threats in an inclusive way. The threats we face in the 21st century include cyberterrorism, international terrorism, uncontrolled mass migration, natural disasters and drug and human trafficking, and we want to be involved in European actions against all of these. We definitely can’t do it on our own. My country also has a very proud history of military neutrality, participating in UN peacekeeping operations and EU common security and defence policy operations, and we are not members of NATO, so we will participate in PESCO in a way that is consistent with those traditions as other countries will too. President, I believe the Europe of the future must do four things. First of all, we should continue to do what we currently do well. Secondly, we should focus on the big new challenges facing Europe and its citizens. Thirdly, where appropriate, we should devolve some powers back to Member States, municipalities and regions. And, fourthly, we should engage more with citizens in direct democracy. Ireland, as you know, has moved from being a net beneficiary of the EU budget to one that is now a net contributor. Nonetheless, we’re open to contributing more, but only if it is spent on things that contribute to the advancement of the European deal and the European project. For example, structural funds for Central and Eastern Europe to enable them to unlock their economic potential as we did. The European Union should also continue to fund well programmes and policies that work and have stood the test of time, such as the common agricultural policy and providing funding for research, innovation, Erasmus, Interreg and the European Investment Bank, among others. Budgets for these, in my view, should be protected. Europe can do new things and Europe should do new things, but new programmes require new money. Ireland is a founder-member of the euro and a founder-member of the single market, and we were among the first to open our labour market to Europeans from Central and Eastern Europe. We now want to see the completion of the single market and the digital single market and, above all, a single market that serves the interests of all our citizens, and not just corporations. So I want to commend this Parliament on the work it has done to make the lives of Europeans better by removing roaming charges on mobile phones within the European Union. That helps bring people together. Your recent action on credit card charges and, likewise, I commend the way you’ve championed air passenger rights and your plans for interrail. Now is the time to fulfil the promise of the single market in other areas. For example, take financial services, insurance, mortgages and loans, so that people can get cheaper loans from European lenders and insurers if needs be. I’d ask the Parliament to work on this in the period ahead, and I think it is something that would very much be welcomed by our citizens. I also believe we should work much more closely on the cost of medicines, and new, innovative medicines in particular. This could save billions for taxpayers, freeing up funding to ensure that modern medicines are available to patients in every country at the same time, and countries are not played off against each other. So let’s pool the buying power of 450 million people to do so. I also believe in more free trade agreements with third countries and in completing monetary union, and I believe in a banking union to protect citizens’ savings on a pan-European basis and reduce exposure to individual Member States. And I also think that a capital markets union would provide the building blocks for an integrated capital market across Europe. In terms of improving democracy within the EU, I support a Europe-wide list for the European Parliament. I’d like to get people in cafes in Naples and restaurants in Galway talking about the same election choices. Perhaps that’s an ambitious idea, but I think it is one we should strive for. (Applause) And I believe we should also make permanent the Spitzenkandidat system and democratise the choosing of candidates for other leading positions within the EU. And let’s establish as well a common asylum policy and system to replace the current system, which we all know is not working. Too few countries have shouldered the responsibility of providing refugees with a fresh start in Europe, we can all do more and we must. (Applause) And let’s put fire back into the engine of our social Europe by following through on the proclamation that we issued in Gothenburg last year on jobs, employment rights and pensions, among other things. Whatever our future holds, Europe needs to be competitive economically. And one of the ways to ensure this is by allowing competition among Member States, and I think this is particularly important for peripheral and less developed countries whose domestic markets are small and need inward investment. My strong view is that national taxes that fund national budgets should be determined by national parliaments and governments, but equally strong is my view that corporations should pay their fair share of tax, and we cannot tolerate a situation where large companies avoid paying any taxes anywhere. And that’s true for American tech companies as it is true for European car manufacturers and international aerospace and defence companies. (Applause) Ireland has already taken steps to close loopholes in our tax laws and will do more in the years ahead, but we strongly believe this should be done on an international basis through the OECD, as Europe should not give advantages to our competitors on other continents by acting unilaterally. Mr President, as a community we must also look outwards, offering leadership and partnership, especially when it comes to Africa, a continent which is only eight kilometres from Europe. And I believe that Europe must show much greater leadership on Africa, and I support the idea of an EU Marshall plan for that continent. We’ve already witnessed the terrible impact that chaos in Syria and Lebanon has had on people in those countries and its impact on Europe. Libya and Syria are small countries, imagine what would happen if similar events were to unfold in massive countries with massive populations, like Egypt or Nigeria. The consequences are too awful to contemplate for us and for them. By contrast, we can look east to Asia and the successful development of those countries in East Asia who have transformed themselves from countries to which we gave aid, to countries with which we now trade. So in the 21st century Africa must succeed. It is in our interest and it is in theirs, so let’s make it part of our mission as Europeans. I also strongly support the subsidiarity and proportionality task force. It is interesting to me and for many of us who travel the world that on many matters and many issues US states and Canadian provinces, and even counties and municipalities, have greater autonomy and greater variation among themselves then EU Member States currently have. So do we have the balance right? Not always. And does everything have to be harmonised and standardised? I don’t think so. So, Mr President, in making decisions I think it is vital that our citizens are engaged. In Ireland we’ve launched a national debate, a citizens’ dialogue on Europe and our starting point is to focus on the hopes and dreams of our citizens. Led by our minister for Europe we’re undertaking a series of regional meetings and other initiatives across the country between now and Europe Day on 9 May, and I strongly encourage other countries to do the same. Mr President, it is been an honour, a great honour, to be the first European head of state or government to speak to the European Parliament on this hugely important topic of the future of Europe. All of you across all political groupings have enormous political experience, insight and knowledge. There is a mass of wisdom in this chamber and also imagination, and I believe it is the perfect place to debate our future as we move forward and to ensure that into the future that parliaments and governments are more connected to each other. I know that under the guidance of President Tajani you’ve already started to discuss the issues in a thoughtful and productive manner, and even before the Commission’s white paper you adopted three resolutions on our future. I hope that this first debate in this series and the others to follow will be lively and spontaneous, and I look forward to engaging with you during the course of this session. The European Union has always offered the promise of a better future. It is a future that will not be handed to us, we must work to create it. We can achieve a more perfect union and we can speak to Europe’s soul. Our values, like peace, friendship, freedom, justice, opportunity and cooperation, are the values we are committed to in advancing on the island of Ireland within our European family and in our relations in the wider world. Europe has been a great success and we owe its achievements – peace, individual rights, equality before the law and prosperity – to that political creativity and the friendship that we’ve built together. I believe that Europe is the outcome of one of the greatest acts of political creativity in human history, and that same creativity and vision of the founders should drive our work today. The European ideal took flight in the second part of the 20th century when people imagined a world joined by mutual interest, trust and affection replacing one that was torn apart by jealousy, fear and animosity. Building on the great successes and achievements of the past, I believe that with our imagination, with creativity, with courage, we can provide a soul and a heart for Europe, creating opportunities for all of our citizens, and we can ensure that the European ideal that took flight in the last century will soar in the 21st. Mr President, I want to conclude with a few words in the first official language of my country. A Uachtaráin, creidim gurb í an spiorad dearfach agus creideamh i dtodhchaí níos fearr ba chúis le hinspioráid an idéil Eorpaigh i gcónaí.  Murach an Eoraip, ní chuirfí ár dtír i gcuntas i measc náisiúin na cruinne. Táimid buíoch do Bhallstáit na hEorpa as a ndlúthpháirtíocht agus as an aire a thugann siad dúinn le linn chomhráite Brexit.  Deimhníonn sin an fáth a bhfaigheann tíortha beaga tairbhe as a mballraíocht in AE.  Anois tá an deis againn Eoraip na todhchaí a shamhlú. Ba mhaith liom leanúint ar aghaidh leis an dul chun cinn atá á dhéanamh againn, agus díriú ar na dúshláin mhóra nua atá i gceist.  Ba mhaith liom go mbeadh páirt níos gníomhaí ag saoránaigh i ndaonlathas díreach.Tá súil agam go léireoidh an Eoraip níos mó treorach faoi chúrsaí na hAfraice. Tacaím leis an smaoineamh maidir le ‘Marshall Plan’ don Afraic. Agus muidne ag cur le rathúlacht na laethanta atá thart, creidim, le samhlaíocht agus le misneach go mbeimid in ann anam agus croí a chur ar fáil don Eoraip, agus deiseanna a chruthú dár saoránaigh go léir.

But I have to deliver a speech because the disappointment would be too great if I did not do so. I wanted to say that I am delighted that my good friend Leo comes before this House today, and I would like to thank President Tajani and the Parliament for holding this timely debate on the future of our Union. This is the first of its kind and I hope the first of many. Since he became Prime Minister, Leo has proven to be a committed European. I knew this before, but he has proven it by being where he is for the time being. It is fitting that today we remember with sadness another true Irish and European statesman. I would like to pay my personal tribute to Peter Sutherland. He was the first ever Commissioner to receive the gold medal from this House. I was deeply saddened to hear of his passing. Peter Sutherland was a proud Irishman, another giant of European politics and a friend of so many. He will be missed, but his legacy lives on. As Peter in the past shaped our policies of today, so can we shape the policies of the future with the choices we make today. It was less than a year ago that I presented to you the White Paper on the future of Europe: five possible scenarios for our project. Since then, the debate has picked up in all corners of Europe. The White Paper set a new approach – debate, not dictate – and the White Paper and the different scenarios are still inspiring the debate across Europe. However, the future of Europe cannot remain a scenario. The time to take decisions is now, because citizens will head to the polls in May 2019 and, in doing so, they should have a clear understanding of how the European Union will develop over the years to come. Last September, I therefore presented to you my very own vision for a more united, stronger and more democratic Union: a Union where solidarity and responsibility go hand in hand in all policy areas, from migration to the banking and monetary union, from energy to our common budget; a Union where the rule of law is not optional but the very basis of everything we do, from implementing decisions jointly taken to preparing enlargements; a Union of equals where the euro and Schengen, the most visible expressions of European integration, continue to unite our continent. Since the publication of the White Paper, a lot has happened. The Commission has organised hundreds of citizens’ dialogues – six of them in Ireland, which is important. I am happy to see that the Taoiseach himself has launched citizens’ dialogues on the future of Europe across Ireland, from Galway to Dublin. This is how it should be. To succeed in Europe, we have to put an end to this eternal artificial opposition between the Union and its Member States. Our Union can only be built with our Member States and never against them. This is why the invitation of the national leaders to this House, President Tajani, is so important. I am delighted to see the commitment from the European Council. It has agreed the leaders’ agenda: 17 summits in the next 18 months on the road to Sibiu (Hermannstadt) to chart our common future. This is even more than we had at the height of the eurozone crisis, but with one important difference: this time we are not repairing the burning plane while flying, as we had to do during the crisis. Instead, we are now fixing the roof of our European house while the sun is shining. We know what we need to do together: completing our economic and monetary union; securing our borders; delivering on our social agenda; making our tax system fairer; reforming our asylum system; getting back to Schengen; and completing the digital market and the energy union. In all these talks on Europe’s future, I have been privileged to have a close working relationship with the Taoiseach, and there is no better example than to say that we worked during the first phase of negotiations with the United Kingdom. When it comes to the issue of Ireland in these negotiations, Europe is united. It is all for one and one for all. The Commission and the Irish Government worked tirelessly, side by side, to help us reach the sufficient progress needed to move onto the next phase of the talks. This partnership will continue and will grow stronger as we work on the future of our Union at 27. I read with pleasure Leo’s speech at the Citizens’ Dialogue last November, when he set out his vision for ‘a Europe that continues to do well what it does well, that focuses on big things and that, where appropriate, devolves some powers back to Member States’ municipalities and regions’. For me, this is more than just a beautiful poem. These are the essential questions we all need to answer when going into the negotiations for the next European budget. This debate on the budget will be an open and honest discussion and one that goes right to the heart of the debate on the future of the European Union. If we want the European Union to have nothing more than a single market, a single small budget will be sufficient. But if we want a European border and coast guard to protect our external borders or European civil protection teams to help in the case of floods or fires, then the answer is simple. Member States must put their money where their mouths are. (Applause) Herr Präsident! Genau weil diese Zukunftsfragen jetzt in Angriff genommen werden müssen, haben wir vorgeschlagen, unter der Leitung von Vizepräsident Timmermans eine Taskforce zu Subsidiarität und Proportionalität einzurichten. Im nächsten Wahlkampf wird das genau so sein wie im letzten Wahlkampf. Nur wenige haben den Mut, in Bürgerversammlungen, auf öffentlichen Plätzen, im Bierzelt oder sonst wo aufzustehen, wenn es heißt, die Europäische Union und die europäische Politik in Gänze zu verteidigen.  Man wird immer wieder den Bürgern sagen: Europa macht zu viel, und Europa muss weniger tun. Es gibt Bereiche, wo Europa mehr tun muss – ich habe sie oft hier erwähnt. Es gibt aber auch Bereiche, wo wir uns zurücknehmen sollen, wo weniger mehr wäre und wo weniger Tatendrang mehr Fortschritt brächte als blindes Losstürmen hin zu Zielen, die für uns eigentlich – von unserem Instrumentarium her – unerreichbar sind.  Deshalb wäre es mein Wunsch, dass das Europäische Parlament sich an dieser Taskforce beteiligt. Mir wird berichtet – but this is a house full of rumours, dass das Europäische Parlament an dieser Taskforce nicht teilnehmen werde und wolle – das ist ein grober Fehler! Denn wir brauchen das Europäische Parlament, wenn wir darüber reden, welche Kompetenzen der Europäischen Union in die Mitgliedstaaten zurückverlagert werden können.  Dies wird eine Debatte sein, wo man dann natürlich auch darüber reden muss, was wir besser machen können, indem wir mehr tun. Auch über neue Kompetenzen muss geredet werden. Aber die Hauptaufgabe ist, Ordnung zu bringen in das Zuständigkeitsgerangel zwischen Europäischer Union und den Mitgliedstaaten. Ich bitte deshalb herzlich – vor allem die großen Fraktionsführer dieser Welt –, diesen Beschluss – falls es ihn dann gibt – zu überprüfen, weil es nicht im Interesse des Europäischen Parlaments ist, dass die Kommission und die Vertreter der Mitgliedstaaten sich alleine, ohne das Mittun des Europäischen Parlaments, mit diesen Fragen beschäftigen.  Mr President, since 1999 the Good Friday Agreement has preserved peace and enabled progress where once there was bloodshed and discord. We all know that peace can be fragile, and I see no more important use of our new budget than guaranteeing and financing the peace process in Ireland.  This is an unconditional European commitment. This is what the Commission will deliver with its proposal on the next Multiannual Financial Framework in May. Our new budget must be as ambitious as the goals we set ourselves and as flexible as possible in order to adapt to new and unforeseen challenges. Our future cannot wait. Together with Leo, with the Irish, and with others, we will swim in that direction.

It was a great speech and a great contribution to our debate. We can first of all conclude from this speech that it is good to follow the Irish example, because when I look at the past years, Irish politicians – Enda Kenny, Leo Varadkar – didn’t point the finger at others when it was taking on responsibility for cleaning up the budget and making the necessary reforms. They simply did their job. The Irish Government also showed in the past few days how big and how strong you can be if you are part of the European Union in the Brexit negotiations. This is another example where the Irish point is a good point.  And finally, I must say that the tradition of referendums in Ireland helps a lot in explaining to people what Europe is all about. It is not blaming and shaming Brussels, but explaining what is going on in Brussels and explaining what is going on in Strasbourg. That is great. There are a few aspects that I see when I look to Ireland and the future of Europe, but now Europe stands at a crossroads between hate and hope. Demagogues play with people’s fears, and for their selfish goals they are spreading hate. That is our challenge. We have to bring hope to the people. We know that the Europeans do not want to live in anger. They are proud of their European culture, of their achievements, and they want to protect the European way of life. They want to combine prosperity with fairness; they want to combine freedom with security, and cultural identity with tolerance. That is what Europe is all about. And then we have to keep this in mind, I think we have to make concrete what Leo said in his speech. We have to talk about job security, social fairness, quality of life and whether we can protect this in a globalised world. This promise has to be founded. We have to give good arguments for this. It is either a Europe which is fair, or not a Europe at all. Furthermore, we see in times of Putin and IS that people are looking for protection, for security. That is why your statement on the future of European defence is a great statement. A few months ago, I was in Estonia and I visited the NATO air base there. A Belgian pilot told me what he was doing with air policing towards the Russian border. I asked him whether it would be a problem for him if there was no longer a Belgian flag on his uniform. What would he say if there were only a European flag in the future? And this young pilot said to me, for him it made no difference. For him it was always clear that he defended our European values when in his aircraft. Dear colleagues, it is either a Europe that is strong in defence or it is not a Europe at all. Finally, about culture, I think we have to be aware that the whole world is listening to European music, is reading our literature. Europe is the leading cultural continent in the world, and Europe provides cultural diversity instead of the commercial mishmash from Hollywood. The question now is: how can we protect this? How can we bring this into a globalised and a digital world?  The idea of Emmanuel Macron to create a European Netflix, to bring all our cultural heritage in one digital form together, with free access for everybody, would probably be a good idea in this regard. It is either a Europe sticking to its cultural richness, or not a Europe at all. There are lots of things to do, but having our fundamental ideas for the European Union in mind, our founding fathers – De Gasperi, Kohl and others – were always aware that European integration was ambitious. It was always concrete in terms of projects, and that is why we have to look for these concrete projects in the days, weeks and years to come. Let’s get things done. It is either an ambitious Europe, or it is not a Europe at all.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 43, "date": "2018-01-17.json", "name": "Jeppe KOFOD", "mepid": "124870", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group. – Mr President, I wish to thank Taoiseach Varadkar for an excellent speech, for his commitment to Europe and for his commitment to cooperation.

We have benefited from the single market, from the wealth of trade agreements with third countries, and from EU funding and cooperation throughout its history. But for us as Socialist and Democrats, Europe is much more than trade and profits. It is about solidarity. It is about the prosperity of our people. It is about protecting strong welfare states where no citizen is left behind. Solidarity is the future of Europe, and working together to help each other to overcome shared challenges in the 21st century. Globalisation, climate change, the refugee crisis – all of these we have to face together.  Next year the United Kingdom will leave the European Union.  (Applause from certain quarters) This, of course, will have a special impact on Ireland and the people of Ireland. Let me be absolutely clear: the European Parliament will stand firm on upholding the Good Friday Agreement and securing peace, cooperation and prosperity throughout the Emerald Isle. It is very important. (Applause) We also expect solidarity from the Irish Government – and I must take the opportunity this debate offers to express this – and the same commitment to solidarity, fairness and cooperation on other issues. So when we build a single market in Europe, with the free flow of capital, goods, services and people, it is also important that we fight tax evasion and avoidance, protect our tax bases, our welfare states, our people, against the tax evasion we are seeing. What we have seen in Europe – and I have also to give the example of Ireland – when Apple only pays EUR 50 per EUR 1 million it earns on its profits, is a disgrace. It is not acceptable. We need to change that behaviour.  (Applause) We need to stop the never—ending race to the bottom on corporate taxation. We need to protect our welfare state. We need a common rule book in Europe on corporate taxation, and that is also why I am asking you, Prime Minister, to fight for the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base, creating a tax system in the 21st century that is fair, that serves our states, that serves our citizens.  I also want to say we share a lot of challenges. We also need to build a Europe, as you said, Mr Varadkar, that will protect the citizens of Europe, the workers. Good decent work and good salaries are the basis of our societies, and therefore also the social Europe you mentioned is part of that agenda and we need to see action in that field as well.  We also need to ensure, when we do trade liberalisation and make trade agreements, that these trade agreements also follow our values, our rules on sustainable development, protecting the environment, protecting labour rights, protecting human rights, and ensuring that big corporations pay their fair taxes. This is equally important.  In building a Europe of the 21st century we are, as you said, much stronger together than apart. That is true. And you said the single market is not just for all of our citizens if we do not also protect our citizens against, for example, big corporations, against people that take advantage of a single market to undermine our society. That is very important.  So, Mr Prime Minister, I have to commend you for standing up for Europe, but I think we also need to talk about what type of fair Europe we can create for the future. Thank you so much for this and I look forward to working with you and all others who want to change Europe for the better of the people.

To be honest, that is somewhat abstract to me. It's about the future of our citizens! It makes sense that in the presence of the Irish prime minister, Brexit is central. The answer of many European leaders is: “never waste a good crisis”, full speed ahead to more Europe. I believe that pushing towards an ever closer Union is “penny wise but pound foolish” and will have the opposite effect on our citizens. Yes, it is true, the latest Eurobarometer polls show that people think a bit more positively about Europe. But don't forget that every referendum on Europe in recent years has gone wrong for the pro-Europeans. Think of the referendum on judicial cooperation in Denmark, the referendum on the association agreement with Ukraine in the Netherlands and the Brexit referendum in the United Kingdom. If the citizens then think more positively about Europe, why do they always vote against? I think our citizens want to see a Europe that really works. But it doesn't do that yet! We introduced the euro on the basis of the no-bail-out clause and the Stability and Growth Pact. Then we ignore those two and go through each other's national budgets in detail. That is, of course, a fairly useless exercise if enforcement against the structural budget sinners, such as France, has been lacking for years. And then we also have to start with a eurozone budget and European debt securities? That seems to me to be the perfect route to once again see a no from our citizens and a low turnout in the European elections. Then what? I think a pause. And first start with enforcing and especially fulfilling what we have agreed with each other. In this way we regain the trust of the citizens.

When I say that, I am not talking about the weather forecast, naturally. I am talking about what I call the Irish capacity to transform and to reinvent itself, as has happened over the last decades. I think that is exactly what we need in Europe today: this capacity to transform ourselves and to reinvent ourselves – and not to destroy ourselves, as some of our colleagues want. Thirty years ago, Ireland was a very different country. I think only 7% were born abroad. Today, that figure is more than 70%. I think that Ireland today has become one of the most diverse nations of the European Union. The Irish economy has successfully integrated migrants from all over the world – from Poland, from Nigeria. Ireland has also become the home country for a number of big companies, such as international IT giants. Today, Ireland is no longer a country of emigration; it has become a destination country and also a country with many pro-Europeans – sometimes very critical but always constructive, and that is absolutely key. What I hope to see in this debate is that Ireland can show the same European leadership as happened in the past. Let me remind you that in 1985/1986 it was Garret FitzGerald, your predecessor, who gave the final support to the Single European Act. That support was crucial, because it was the first time that Ireland broke away from the British position and made it possible to push forward the European agenda. It is the Single European Act that later resulted in the single market, and that is now seen as the biggest European achievement. Even Margaret Thatcher found it the biggest achievement of European politics. The same thing happened in 2004 and 2007. After the enlargement of the European Union, it was Ireland who championed, in fact, the freedom of movement of all people in the European Union, including the Polish plumber and the Romanian doctor. I hope that Ireland continues to have such a commitment to reform the European Union now. Your voice is critical in this debate. I see four things to do. The first is the new governance for the eurozone. The second is the European Defence Union. The third is the new European asylum and migration policy. We have to get rid of Dublin – not of Joyce’s city, naturally, but the Dublin Regulation on migration. We need to have something completely different, where Italy and Greece do not bear all the burden. Finally, I think we also need a deep democratic reform, with a transnational democracy. I thank you for your support on that important reform, which I hope we can achieve in the coming weeks. Lastly – and the President of the Commission is right – we need a budget that goes in parallel with this. It is impossible to say to the citizens: ‘Look, citizens, you’re right: we need more this and we need more that; we need more European action’ but, at the same time, we do not give the necessary instruments and the necessary budget. Finally, President, I think there is a new generation of politicians in Europe who are standing up. You need to know one thing. It is the last thing I am going to say, and it is on Brexit. Whatever stance you take, Taoiseach, Europe will always be behind you. We know what is at stake in these Brexit negotiations. We know how existential it is for you, but know that we will always be behind you.

Welcome, Taoiseach, to our debate here in the European Parliament! Since Brexit at the latest, we have suspected the consequences of such an exit in terms of social and civil rights for the people affected - not only in Great Britain itself, but on the Irish island and throughout the EU. We cannot go back to hard borders in Europe; we will always refuse. My group will also do everything it can to defend the Good Friday Agreement in all of its components. From my point of view, Europe will grow together and build up inevitably. And yet the question arises, because we have to think beyond Brexit and the Brexit negotiations, whether today's Europe, today's European Union with its treaties, with its structures, with its institutions is suitable to really raise the hopes of the people a social, solidary togetherness, to actually implement a fight against climate change. We say in my group: we have serious doubts that it will work that way. I don't even want to list the problems the EU is currently facing. We have done that often enough here. I would just like to say that it is important that we face the inequalities between the Member States and the inequalities between population groups, that we finally make serious efforts to fight poverty, and that is where we need forms of governability in the European Union. I have the impression that the European Union cannot and cannot be governed on a number of crucial issues. That is the question of migration, that is the fight against tax havens, that is the fight against social inequality. And the EU is in a legitimation crisis.

Taoiseach, you have demonstrated again in your speech the depth of your country’s and your own commitment to the European project. We all got familiar with your name on the occasion of the Brexit debate, and Ireland is obviously the Member State that will be most affected by it – not just for economic reasons but because this is about peace on the island. Let me just say this: we are at your side on this. Letting violence erupt again in Ireland will not just spell disaster for the communities concerned, but it would it would be an arrow through Europe’s heart because the European Union is, and remains, a peace project.  Brexit is a challenge we could have avoided, but it should not detract us from those challenges that are existential to the future of Europe. Allow me, Taoiseach, to mention two of them that I find particularly relevant to Ireland. First, all societies need to find ways to live within the biophysical constraints that nature sets us. There is simply no way around it. Europe has a choice here – either to become leaders in the ecological transition of all societies, thereby becoming solution providers to the rest of the world – or to stick with the past, thereby becoming solution takers from the rest of the world. From a young, entrepreneurial Prime Minister such as you, I would expect the first option.  Yet, Taoiseach, your government has been sorely lacking ambition on tackling climate change. You said when you became Prime Minister that climate action would be your first priority. Yet it doesn’t really show. This year Ireland was ranked as Europe’s worst performer in tackling climate change. It is one of only two countries in the EU that will miss its 2020 emission reduction targets. And now your government seeks special deals and exemptions from the quite modest 2030 targets.  On a similar line, Prime Minister, your government opposes the waste reduction bill proposed by the Irish Greens, which only aims at bringing your country on a par with best practices across Europe on the way to a more circular economy. Come on, Taoiseach, with its abundant resources for renewable energy, Ireland has the potential to be a pioneer in green transformation. Your country and Europe’s prosperity depend on it.  You will hardly be surprised by the second topic that I want to raise which is, of course, taxation. If we want our single market and single currency to thrive and to deliver benefits to all and not just the richest, we need to stop this race to the bottom on taxation and on social protection. And you know that Ireland often comes to the fore as a tax haven for corporates. Of course, you would argue – and I would agree with you – that several Member States offer real taxation rates to multinationals that are way lower than the Irish nominal 12.5%. And you would say that Ireland should be allowed to find ways to make up for geographical disadvantage. I agree with all of this, but surely the alternative cannot be between a one—size—fits—all taxation system that would work for the central big and core European countries to the detriment of everyone else and the no—holds—barred tax competition that we have right now. Instead of playing hold—out, instead of fighting European Commission decisions in court, I would expect Ireland to be at the core of efforts to better cooperate on tax matters in order to give tax justice a chance in Europe. It is not just our excessive ecological footprint, but also ballooning inequalities that threaten the very existence of all civilised societies.  Taoiseach, the European Project is about establishing a lasting peace on our continent through shared prosperity on the one hand and, on the other, through anchoring our societies in the values of freedom, democracy and human rights. I am very glad that your government wants to ensure the right of women to control their own bodies. I hope that the upcoming referendum will allow your country to make progress in that direction at a time where we see progress in the other direction in too many parts of Europe.  Taoiseach, if you can deploy the same leadership on ecological transition and on tax justice as the one that you have deployed here, you will have done a lot for the European Union. I am sure you can do it.

Well, Mr  Varadkar, you are very popular here! A standing ovation from left and centre and right; Mr Juncker looking joyous! In fact this European project could have no greater, stronger devotee for a militarised, expansionist United States of Europe. You, of course, worked here as a young man; you’re a devotee. In fact, we should call you, I think, a European Unionist – whatever the cost to Ireland may be. Normally, of course, small countries count for nothing here. It’s run by the big boys, but right at the minute you are important and you’re useful, because you have helped with the obstructionism and the delay of Brexit. Firstly, on the Good Friday Agreement, where, as you know, the European Union had little or nothing to do with it. They were written in at a later stage, but of course, as everyone knows, nothing binds either side to continued membership of the Union, and you know the UK Government intends to fully uphold it. The border issue has been put up as a problem, but I think your predecessor Bertie Ahern has said, look, in practical terms we don’t face a problem. There has been a common travel area between us, of course, for decades, but it is on trade where that border could in some ways be challenged. And of course, when you think that nearly 50% of exports from Irish-owned companies go to the United Kingdom and in agriculture in some sectors it’s as high as 90%, you potentially have quite a lot to lose. And yet, despite the fact that no one should be fighting harder for a genuine rounded trade deal than you, that doesn’t appear to be the case. In fact, I’d even go further and say that if there was no trade deal between the European Union and the United Kingdom, an exception should be made for Ireland because of political sensitivity, and it’s something that the World Trade Organisation, I have no doubt, would back up. And yet it seems to me that you are prepared to put your devotion to the European project above the interest of Irish farmers and other companies too, and I wonder why. Well, let’s cast our minds back a short distance: the rejection of the Lisbon Treaty by the Irish. A second referendum forced on their people, conducted on the most unfair, undemocratic lines that I have ever seen. You are part, of course, of a big attempt here and elsewhere to frustrate and to attempt to overturn Brexit. You don’t want Britain to leave, because you know if they do, others will leave too. And I would just say this to you: I don’t want a second referendum on Brexit – absolutely not. But I fear that you are all working together with Tony Blair and Nick Clegg to make sure we get the worst possible deal. I say that because I’ve seen it all before.

I’ve written down a few notes. I mightn’t be able to answer everyone but I’ll do my best to touch on as many topics as I can. First of all, I particularly want to thank almost all the speakers here today for their ongoing support and solidarity with Ireland. That’s very much recognised, and we are very grateful for that. I think Ms Zimmer spoke about the need to reduce inequality among Member States, and I think that’s something that I can very much sign up to as well. It’s been a long time since enlargement and there is still a huge gap in prosperity between Western Europe, on the one hand, and the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, on the other. That’s why it is so important that the next multiannual financial framework and the next European budget contain adequate funding to continue to improve the infrastructure in Central and Eastern Europe, and also to support the common agricultural policy. That’s why it is so important as well, as I mentioned in my speech earlier, that we put forward a realistic pathway to European membership for the Western Balkans. I think the best way we can stabilise that part of Europe, those countries that used to be part of Yugoslavia and Albania, is to give them a pathway towards joining the European Union. On tax, which I know is an issue of contention between many people in this Chamber and in Ireland, the view that we take as a government – and I think it is shared by a lot of governments – is that national taxes should fund national budgets. That’s, therefore, a national competence and a matter of national sovereignty. We do have European taxes at the moment that fund the European budget, or at least in. We have that with customs, we had that to a degree with VAT, and that’s something that I am not opposed to at all. If you look at the model that exists in the United States, which is a federation after all, there is a lot of tax competition between Member States. There are federal income taxes and there are state income taxes. There are different sales taxes in different Member States. So if the United States, the most successful economy in the world, can have tax competition among Member States, why can’t we have the same? As I have said, we have a number of federal taxes, European taxes, already, that fund the EU budget, and that is something that I think works quite well. In terms of the Apple case, it is important not to forget that it is a state-aid case. Technically it is not a tax case, but a state-aid case, and the contention is that Ireland had a special deal with one particular company. Quite frankly, we didn’t. That is why that case is being appealed both by Apple and by the Irish Government. Ultimately, the European courts and the European Court of Justice will make a judgment on that and, whatever that judgment is, our government will accept it. We’re establishing an escrow account, we will collect the money, or at least start collecting it, in the second quarter of this year. And the money will be held in the escrow account until that decision is made by the European Court of Justice. But it is our contention and it is our belief that we did not have a special arrangement with that company, and we can’t say that we did when we know that we didn’t. But, ultimately, that is going to be a matter for those courts to decide. I want to say that Ireland is not a tax haven, we don’t want to be a tax haven, and we certainly don’t want to be seen or perceived as a tax haven. We have no interest, in fact, in a race to the bottom. Our low corporation tax rate, 12.5%, has been around for 20 or 30 years now. We haven’t increased it, we haven’t reduced it, but we’ve just kept it exactly as it is now. Ireland won’t win a race to the bottom. It’s already the case that a number of countries have a lower tax rate for corporations than we do – Hungary and Bulgaria, just to give two examples. So if this is a race to the bottom, it is not one that Ireland is going to win. As was mentioned by other speakers, countries like France, just to use one example, have a high corporation profit tax on paper but have so many exemptions and so many different ways not to pay tax that, according to the OECD, their effective tax rate is actually lower than ours. So if it is a race the bottom, it is not one that Ireland is going to win and, therefore, it is not one that we want to participate in. The future of our economy and the future of our prosperity is going to be much more about human capital and attracting talent and people than attracting companies based on corporate tax rate. We have already made a number of big changes to our tax policy. We’ve abolished the ‘double Irish’, got rid of stateless corporations, and we’ve started taxing intellectual property again just this year. We’ll continue to make steps in those directions and close loopholes, but we want other countries to do that as well, quite frankly. There is a bit of hypocrisy about that when you look at the amount of money that we actually collect in terms of corporate taxes versus other countries who collect so much less but yet on paper have a higher tax rate. I think that needs to be challenged. (Applause) It’s also very much my strong contention that the progress that we make on this should be done at international level through the OECD process. I say that for a very obvious reason: Europeans should not do something unilaterally that only causes other countries that are not part of the European Union to gain an advantage over us, whether it is the United States, Japan, or whether it is the United Kingdom, which, of course, is going to leave. We need to bear that in mind in anything that we do. On climate change, Ireland is somewhat unusual compared to other countries in that a huge amount of our greenhouse gas emissions come from agriculture. That’s because we have never really had heavy industry. We never had those big heavy industries that other countries have decommissioned and shut down, and achieved their targets in that way. That’s not something we can do. As far as I am concerned, we are a laggard. I am not proud of Ireland’s performance on climate change. We need to do a lot more, and one of the things my government will do in the next few months is to publish our 10-year investment plan, our capital investment plan for Ireland over the next 10 years. Central to that will be the kind of things that we want to do around climate change to make sure we meet those targets in 2030. That includes things such as, in transport, electrifying our railways. We only have one small part of our railway that is electrified. It’s about transitioning our public transport and our bus fleet to low emissions. It’s about electric cars, in particular, where we have put in some incentives, but have not got the results that we would like. There are lots of things that we intend to do so that we can meet those targets. It’s something that I am very committed to, and certainly my generation of politicians is committed to. It’s not just the right thing to do; it makes sense economically, I think, in the longer term as well. In terms of the contribution of Ms Dodds, which I very much welcome, certainly I have no wish to see any borders between Northern Ireland and Ireland. I also have no wish to see any new borders or barriers between Britain and Ireland, or between Northern Ireland and Britain. That’s why I did not want Brexit, because I do not want any borders. (Applause) Certainly, we will do everything we can to avoid any of that taking place. I know what you said and I understand what you said, that the union that is most important for you is the United Kingdom, and the single market that is most important to you is the single market of the United Kingdom, and 70% of Northern Ireland’s trade is with the rest of the United Kingdom. I acknowledge that, but it should not be a choice between the 70% and the 30%. Why not take the hundred per cent? It’s possible to have special arrangements for Northern Ireland, if needs be, that allow Northern Ireland to have that because of its unique situation. That is something that I work for and something that I hope that politicians from all sides in Northern Ireland will be open to. If 100% is possible, take that, not 70% instead of 30%. I hope it is possible for us to have that discussion. It’ll be more in the future. In relation to Mr Farage’s contribution, as a matter of information I have never worked here, by the way. I have worked in Ireland and the United States. I have never worked in Europe or for a European institution. (Applause) But in relation to small countries, I really have to disagree because I experienced that in a very personal way, not just in relation to the support that we have received on Brexit from the European institutions but also when, for the first time, I attended a European Council meeting of the prime ministers and presidents of Europe. It’s a really interesting and humbling experience to get to do that. I know some of you who have been prime ministers will have had that experience, but for Council ministers it is very different. You go into this massive room, you sit there, the ambassador sits beside you, you have six officials behind you and it is a very different experience when you go into the Council of Ministers. I went into the Council of Ministers for the first time last year. I sat around the table. There were no officials there. The only people there were the President of the Council, the President of the Commission and the heads of government of 26, 27 or 28 Member States. I come from a country that has only 4.5 million people. We’re a small country. There are many provinces, even cities, in other European countries that have more people than mine, have a bigger economy than mine, and I was sitting around the table as an equal with the President of France, the Chancellor of Germany, the Prime Minister of Spain, the Prime Minister of Italy, these really big countries, and that isn’t the way Europe used to work. Before the European Union, the big countries would get together, decide what was right for Europe, and would tell the rest of us. That doesn’t happen any more because of the European Council and because of these European institutions. I am not so naive as to think that a country like Ireland, with 4.5 million people, can ever have the power or importance of a country like Germany, with 80 million people and its massive economy. But the European Union allows small countries to have a seat at the table when decisions are made, as opposed to having no say at all. That’s why I believe small countries are so much better off in this Union. (Applause) Finally, in relation to Britain, I want to say that Britain is a country that I care a lot about. Irish people are very close to British people in so many ways, even though sometimes we don’t like to admit that. In so many ways we have a shared culture and a shared history, and that’s very much the experience of my family as well. My parents met, fell in love and got married in England. She’s an Irish nurse and he’s a doctor from India. They both went to Britain to build a new life and that’s where they met, that’s where they married, and that’s where they fell in love. That’s where my sister was born. She still lives there, in London, with my niece and nephew, who are English kids. They point at the Union Jack, and they say, ‘Leo, that’s our flag’. That’s how close Irish people in many ways are to British people. We are connected by blood in so many different ways and that’s why I really regret the decision that has been made on Brexit, because so much will be lost. Young people will lose the right to live, work and study anywhere in the European Union, losing those rights as European citizens. My niece and nephew won’t, because they are entitled to Irish passports, but the other kids in their class will, and I think that’s a real shame. British businesses could lose their access to the biggest market in the world. Farmers, food producers, even the beer makers that you and I are so fond of, could lose the subsidies that they currently benefit from, which are not guaranteed beyond this Parliament. I am also conscious of British veterans, very brave people who fought on the beaches of France not just for Britain but also for European democracy and for European values, and people like that are always in my mind. So, notwithstanding the decision to leave, and I respect that decision, I will absolutely fight hard to ensure that we can have a partnership and relationship between the UK and the EU that are as close as possible. It’s in Ireland’s interests and I think it is in the interests of British people and in the interests of the European Union as well. We should conclude a new partnership and a new agreement with the UK. But fundamentally what we have to move away from is any idea that any country can have a relationship that involves taking all the benefits and none of the responsibilities and obligations. That’s the fundamental thing that we need to insist on.

This ongoing destruction of billions is the promissory note legacy, a direct result of the full bail-out of an insolvent Anglo Irish Bank, that bail-out at a time of crisis in the EU, a time when Ireland was left isolated on the front line by its so-called friends.

In the banking crisis the EU institutions thought nothing about bending and breaking the rules. Today you say that PESCO doesn’t impact on our neutrality.

These centrifugal forces are, of course, also at play in the EU, culminating in Brexit which will impact your country, Mr Varadkar. I’m aware of that. And it will impact my country, the Netherlands, and we should limit that impact as far as we can. But this – I am glad to say – was not a debate about Brexit: it was a debate about the future.

I was asked how we can avoid boom and bust again, and I think there are two things here. First of all, it is ensuring that we do not have credit bubbles again in Europe, and the European Central Bank is best placed to do that. And it is also around fiscal policy: balancing the books for the first year in 10 years, Ireland will not have a budget deficit this year. It is about reducing our debt so that we can ensure we have the capacity to borrow again in future if we need to, and it is also about setting up a rainy-day fund – which we have set up – to put some of our budget surplus into, to prepare for a future downturn, which inevitably happens at some point. Ms Childers asked about the social contract and social Europe. I think the best thing we can do to put fire back into the engine of social Europe is to build on what was agreed in Gothenburg. We actually agreed a really good political statement in Gothenburg and I would like to see us turn that into reality by using the proclamation made there to guide European legislation in those areas in the years to come. I am delighted to see we are joined by Commissioner Thyssen for this particular part of the discussion.  To Ms Harkin, I have to say that I like the idea of a citizens’ initiative. I think it is a good idea. It would be a good example of direct democracy though we would also have to have safeguards because, while one million people is a lot, in the European Union of 500 million it is also a small minority. So we would have to make sure that any citizens’ initiative was not a loud minority, but was actually reflective of a majority view, and that is what representatives do best. To be frank, it is our intention to increase defence spending. We are not going to increase defence spending to anything like the level that you see in other European countries, but we intend to do it for two reasons: first of all, because a lot of the members of our defence forces – our air corps, our soldiers, people in our navy – are quite poorly paid. We are now restoring and increasing their pay and, of course, that involves an increase in defence spending. We also need to replace a lot of out-of-date equipment – our fishery protection vessels, some of our helicopters – so, yes, there will be an increase in defence spending, but it something that we would have been doing anyway even if we were not involved in Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO). On Catalonia – one of my favourite parts of the world, and Barcelona is one of my favourite cities – I think the only solution is dialogue, and I hope that the central Government in Madrid will engage in dialogue with the new Government in Catalonia. Mr Rangel asked me to reflect on a few things in relation to a single European constituency. He makes some good points, notably that the United States, which is a federation, does not have a single constituency for anything. They elect their president, for example, through an electoral college. But perhaps they should have a single constituency because, on two occasions out of four now, the candidate who got the second highest amount of votes won the presidency. That, of course, is a matter for them. I am not entirely sure that transnational lists would necessarily benefit big countries because I see what is here in front of me – the heads of groups – and I see that a number of the people who are heads of their groups are actually from small and medium—sized countries. So why might that not also happen on a list? But I think we have an opportunity now. The UK is leaving, there are seats that are free, so it is possible to have a transnational constituency without any individual Member State losing any positions, and it gives people two votes: one vote for their MEP, who represents them in their region, and a second vote for a European party, challenging people to think about those ideas. It is a big challenge and I imagine a lot of people would cast a blank vote the first time round. In time, however, people would get used to the idea.  To Mr Nicholson, I just want to thank you very much for your constructive comments. I concur totally with what you said about the new relationship and also the need to get the executive and assembly up and running. The Tánaiste and the Secretary of State have already met on this, and I will be in touch with the Prime Minister on it as well. We really want to drive that forward. Finally, Mr Peterle asked about how we can inspire Europeans. Perhaps one of the ways we can do that is something I touched on in my speech, which is really to take action in relation to Africa, to make a part of Europe’s mission to improve Africa, to stabilise it, and to make it prosperous in the way that much of Asia has become prosperous. That is a way in which I think we can turn a thought into a feeling and really give people in Europe a positive feeling about what Europe can do.  Thank you very much again for your contributions. It has been a real pleasure and a real honour to have the opportunity here to speak to the Parliament and to answer some of your questions. Thank you again.

I agree with the proposal to move from Permanent Structured Cooperation, now launched, to deeper integration in defense, to tackle common challenges such as cybersecurity or drug and arms trafficking. I share the understanding of the need to deepen the internal market, building a Digital Single Market that understands the dimension of financial services. In this regard, I welcome the Taoiseach's commitment to the defense of greater integration in the fiscal plan, to combat fraud and evasion. Although I do not expect an enlargement in the near future, I follow the understanding of the need to deepen relations with the neighborhood, namely with Balkan countries.

My position is that, within the EU, the double standard must be abolished and, above all, the competences of the Member States must be restored. We see that the mood of people who want the institutions to be closer to them is growing all over Europe. We see what is happening in Catalonia, but in the end it is normal.

But we also need a Europe that is able to change and adapt. We have a historic chance to establish a new relationship with citizens, and the wind is indeed in our sails. The levels of support for the EU have returned to those of before the crisis: 57% of Europeans today support their country’s membership in the EU, and 64% believe EU membership has benefited their country. In fact, many Europeans today are asking for a more engaged EU in spheres like migration management, security and defence and even social policy.

As profits in the biofuels sector increase, so does their influence over policy-making, and their destructive impact was evident today. By increasing the cap on biofuels in the transport sector, Parliament is incentivising the land for fuel policy that has led to global food insecurity. Biofuel crops grown on peatland and deforested land contribute almost as much in carbon emissions as fossil fuels.

First we have to recognise, and then to raise awareness and share expertise within the Union. I commend the work of the European External Action Service (EEAS) East StratCom Task Force, the EU Hybrid Fusion Cell and the Centres of Excellence for Strategic Communication and for Countering Hybrid Threats, but I regret that the EU capacities are under-funded and under-staffed. The Commission and the EEAS have not heard the alarm bells that have been ringing in this House and in the European capitals since the war against Ukraine. I invite Commission Vice-President and High Representative Mogherini and other EU leaders to balance their meetings with Lavrov and Putin with due attention to the Kremlin’s attempts to weaken and undermine our democracies and alliances. Secondly, we have to make our societies more resilient. There are many aspects to this but some require swift legislative action by the House. Through the revised Audiovisual Services Directive we have to mandate national media regulators to adopt a zero tolerance policy against hate speech, irrespective of the media platform, and there is a need for significantly increased transparency of media ownership so that citizens know who’s who in the media they use. Freedom of speech should be defended against those who use it against our fundamental values. Transparency and stricter regulation are the key words for political-party and campaign funding in the Member States. The EPP Group has called for a major review looking into indirect Kremlin funding of European political protagonists, and particularly into shady support for anti-European and anti-democratic forces in our societies. This is closely linked to the need for enhanced investigation and prevention of money laundering by Kremlin-linked entities through European banks and companies. Thirdly, we have to consider how we credibly deter the Kremlin from cyber meddling and disinformation operations. When told in no uncertain terms that it will face unpleasant consequences and bear significant costs, the Kremlin tends to listen. But any deterrent is credible only if it is based on capacities and the political will to deploy the instruments available, and once again we need adequate resources at European level. The EU Cyber Security Agency is in its infancy and, if we want to be serious about it, its budget should be increased not twofold but tenfold. One key to our capacity building in the cyber domain is trans-Atlantic cooperation and NATO, and, given the political dynamics in Washington, European states have to take the lead in any collective action vis-à-vis the Kremlin, as well as in setting international rules for cyber space. Europe drives the global agreement on climate change and it should be among the rule makers for cyber space. Fourthly, there is no substitute for independent and fact-based journalism. The world’s richest and most powerful publisher, Facebook, has replaced editors with algorithms, shifting entire societies away from critical thinking while making billions from our clicks. I am convinced that quality journalism should be supported by governments, and by the EU, because otherwise it would disappear and leave us all at the mercy of Kremlin and other trolls who have learned how to play the social media game.

En tant qu’ancienne députée européenne, je sais très bien à quel point il est important de travailler ensemble, en étroite coopération, pour pouvoir répondre aux attentes de nos citoyens et garantir la légitimité démocratique de l’agenda européen et des politiques de l’Union européenne. Comme nous le rappelle la devise de notre présidence en bulgare, l’union fait la force. Now I will switch to the language of Shakespeare in order to thank you for inviting the Presidency to intervene on behalf of the Council in this topical debate and on this very topical issue. In this Chamber you have indeed discussed the issue of propaganda and fake news several times in recent months.  As regards Russia, in March 2015, the European Council stressed the need to challenge that country’s ongoing disinformation campaigns. It invited the High Representative, in cooperation with Member States and the European Union institutions, to prepare an action plan on strategic communication. It noted at the same time that the establishment of the communication team was the first step in this regard. As a result, the East StratCom Task Force was launched in September 2015. It has been engaged in developing communication products and campaigns, focused on explaining EU policies in the Eastern Partnership region. This includes proactive communication campaigns, as well as analysing disinformation trends, explaining disinformation narratives and myth—busting. In November last year, EU Foreign Ministers took stock of the current work on EU strategic communications, in particular as regards outreach to the Eastern Partnership region, the southern neighbourhood and the Western Balkans. They agreed to enhance work further and expressed their support for the development of all three task forces. In December 2017, they decided to reinforce cooperation with NATO partners on countering hybrid threats. Member States have also underlined the importance of expressing positive EU messages in the EU neighbourhood, as well as the need to counter disinformation where and when needed. I am sure that today you will discuss the work and the findings of the East StratCom Task Force, as well as the influence of the reported activities in EU countries. In their joint communication on resilience in the EU’s external action last June, the High Representative and the Commission noted that the European Union, as well as some of its partner countries, was targeted by external disinformation activities that discredit the political and social systems that are central to our identity, security and stability. They underlined the importance of further developing measures to increase citizens’ resilience to disinformation, notably by raising awareness and by supporting greater media plurality and professionalism. Indeed, the challenges posed by the proliferation – including online and on social media – of new sources of disinformation need to be addressed on many different levels. We must, for instance, not forget the important role of education and the need to develop democratic resilience, media literacy, tolerance and critical thinking. These efforts have become key to fighting off propaganda and manipulation through fake news, which threaten the very foundation of our societies as citizens elect their representatives on the basis of political views shaped by an open and fair debate. These issues were discussed notably during the third annual rule of law dialogue in the General Affairs Council in October last year, when Ministers discuss the topic of media pluralism and rule of law in the digital age.  Finally, I would also like to refer to the High—Level Expert Group on fake news launched by the Commission. Its first meeting was held at the beginning of this week. It will help define the roles and responsibilities of the different stakeholders and formulate recommendations. Its work will be of interest to all of us. I look forward to your debate which I will follow attentively.

On behalf of the Commission, I welcome the analysis set out in Parliament’s resolution on EU strategic communication to counteract propaganda against the Union by third parties. There seems, frankly, little doubt that the pro-Kremlin disinformation campaign is an orchestrated strategy, delivering the same disinformation stories in as many languages as possible, through as many channels as possible, as often as possible. This conclusion is based on two years’ work by the EU’s East StratCom Task Force, which has gathered more than 3 500 examples of pro-Kremlin disinformation, contradicting publicly available facts, repeated in many languages on many occasions. Russian authorities are not exactly shy about the goals of this disinformation campaign and disinformation activity. In Russia’s official military doctrine, as well as statements by top Russian generals, they describe the use of false data and destabilising propaganda as legitimate tools, and information as another type of armed force. While EU Member States are obviously in the front line for such Russian disinformation, the Commission’s main role is to try and head off any fragmentation that might arise from differing Member State responses to such activities. That is why we place great emphasis on the role of the East StratCom Task Force under High Representative / Vice-President Mogherini, responsible for countering disinformation in the EU’s eastern neighbourhood. Its objectives, as we have already heard, are to ensure more effective communication and promotion of EU policies towards these neighbourhoods and EU Member States, to contribute to a strengthened media environment in these neighbourhoods and Member States, and to improve EU capacity to forecast, address and respond to disinformation activities by external actors. In terms of positive communication, the Task Force supports and advises EU delegations in the Eastern Partnership, Russia and Central Asia on how to improve their communications. It provides media products to support that activity: for example, the team was responsible for the communications campaign in the run-up to, and during, last November’s Eastern Partnership Summit. The Task Force works closely with the Commission and EU delegations in the eastern neighbourhood in support of independent media. The Task Force is a permanent member of all the relevant donor committees supporting independent media. It has also launched a Russian-language service from Brussels, providing updates and fact-based background information about the Union for Russian-language journalists. The aim is to increase visibility and more accurate representation of EU policies in the Russian media.  Lastly, the Task Force produces a weekly disinformation review. Its Twitter account ensures that the Task Force’s products reach up to two million people per month, in addition, obviously, to regular background briefings, including to international media, think-tanks and academics. This work is very important. That is why I welcome the proposal that Parliament has advanced to strengthen both our East and South StratCom Task Forces. We have heard about the importance of cyber security. I have had the occasion to address this House on cyber security previously, and I am afraid time does not allow me today to go into details but, from the Commission side, as set out in the proposals last September, we strongly support measures to build our cyber resilience and our cyber deterrence. Rightly, there has been a focus on the wider phenomenon of fake news. It is one of the Commission’s priorities for the coming year. As we have heard, in November last year we established a high-level expert group, which has now started its work to advise the Commission on scoping the phenomenon, grasping its international dimension, defining the roles and responsibilities of relevant stakeholders and presenting recommendations. The group will contribute to the preparation of a strategy addressing the challenge of fake news, which we will issue in spring this year. The Commission has also launched a public consultation on fake news, which is open until 23 February. There are two questionnaires available – one for our citizens and one targeted at legal entities and journalists to draw on their professional experience. We will see what those consultations highlight, but we believe that strong media literacy and promoting quality media are important elements of meeting the challenge of fake news, because media freedom and pluralism are pillars of our of our democracy. They are fundamental rights and they are crucial guarantees for open and free democratic debate. It is primarily for Member States to guarantee media freedom and pluralism. That said, the Commission is aware of existing challenges and is taking a number of measures, within our competence, to strengthen media freedom and pluralism across the Union, including, further to an initiative of this Parliament, funding the European Centre for Press and Media Freedom in Leipzig to address violations of media freedom. We have to remain vigilant. The purpose of a disinformation campaign is to get people to believe that the disinformation is fact, is credible. If we look at opinion polls measuring how many people accept obvious disinformation planted in pro-Kremlin media, then unfortunately we have to conclude that Russian disinformation can be extremely successful. That is why we need to redouble our efforts to debunk this propaganda and why we welcome the debate today.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 112, "date": "2018-01-17.json", "name": "Ioan Mircea PAŞCU", "mepid": "33984", "text": "  You are right, because if we do not pay proper attention it means that fake news becomes truth and then truth becomes fake news.

That is why the enemies of Europe practice disinformation, to unbalance us and demolish those democratic principles that the European Union represents. If the European Union were not a beacon of democracy, the European Union would never be attacked with fake news. It is because we are democrats that they attack us, not because we are European. In the case of Russia, I must say that we are not talking about an enemy, although Russia sometimes treats us as if we were. The Kremlin has 1 billion euros a year in public media, a television network in one hundred countries and thirty-three languages ​​and an army of ghost accounts ready to spread fake news. And they use them in the field of the European Union. The European Union, to defend itself, has, however, only a million euros budget and the Task Force, which is seventeen people. Seventeen people compared to € 1 billion a year in public media. We are really quite helpless. Every time the European Union has a problem, fake news appears, cyber attacks appear, emails are stolen and the Russian media takes action. We must start to react more seriously. In recent events in Catalonia, for example, more than 4,800 robots have been detected acting in favor of the break-up of Spain, constantly spreading false or manipulated information on the internet. Some Russian televisions even opened their news in Spain with images of battle tanks, tanks heading to Barcelona, ​​which only existed in the editor's imagination. Therefore, I end up with two ideas. First, disinformation and propaganda campaigns are a threat to democracy, and as such we must treat them.And second, we Europeans do not want to impose our lifestyle on anyone, but we must know how to defend it, even on the internet.We are proud of our democracy, of the separation of powers, of freedom of expression, of the rule of law and of a free press, but that should be a strength, and never a weakness.Europe is an uncomfortable intelligence for the enemies of the truth, and post-truth is just another name for a lie.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 114, "date": "2018-01-17.json", "name": "Liisa JAAKONSAARI", "mepid": "96684", "text": "On behalf of the S&D Group. - (FI) Mr President, it is a fact that Russia's strategic communication in Europe is extensive and that aggressive behavior on the networks has increased.

But for that matter. What can be done now to combat disinformation and false news? Just as it has been shown here, the European Union's strategic communication must, of course, be strengthened and given more resources. But also the media, social media, investigative journalism, incubators, and NGOs all have their own roles to help people distinguish between facts and lies.

And for many Western countries, I think it was a problem for the Baltic States or the countries of the former Eastern bloc that Russia's concept of the world was starting to work as an element of propaganda. Unfortunately, we see that Russia is capable of interfering in propaganda and many other weapons in the information war, as has just been the case in the United States, not to mention a number of European Union countries in their political processes. Most importantly, it was not appreciated here that lies can be confused with truth in various proportions - up to one hundred percent lies and zero percent truth.

It has always been there. It comes from many states, as well as from private actors. But today in the internet age, people are very unclear as to where it comes from and who has sent this news. Indeed, as the Commissioner said, in order to have media literacy, it should be clear who has written these messages. What is interesting is that those who were at Maidan Square to support the democratic revolution against – let me say – the cronies of Mr Putin, find ourselves back on internet. I have seen myself at Maidan Square with big guns in my hands, but the guns were so big that they were bigger than my hands themselves. Normally, you would say that it’s nonsense, but people believe it. Why were you at Maidan Square with a gun? Well, again, I was not there. That is why I am sympathetic to the idea of President Macron of France that there must be transparency, on the platforms too, as to where the news comes from.  This is not intended to have a negative impact on news; there should be freedom of news, but there should be transparency as to where it comes from. You also have to see who sponsors it, because if you read something on the internet, you should know if it is supported by the state or by a private agency. Therefore, there must be transparency, and that is the most important thing concerning this. Once again, the best thing is that we provide not counter propaganda, but facts, facts and more facts, so that not only the Russians, but also the Chinese people and others, can have access to sources that they don’t normally have access to.

We have known for a long time that not only the propaganda media of Russia, but also parts of Russian politics are designed to promote divisions and polarization in the European Union, to undermine democratic debates and to strengthen Euro-skepticism. Fake news has become a particularly popular tool on social media. But it is also interesting that the Kremlin systematically supports anti-European parties, right-wing extremist populists such as Five Star, but also left-wing nationalist parties and incorporates activities against the European Union into this propaganda. We noticed that in the Brexit dispute, we have evidence of it, Ms. Spinelli, from France. And in the German elections there was an extremely interesting collaboration between bots from Nizhny Novgorod and the American alt-right movement to strengthen the alternative for Germany. How do we deal with this? The argument that we are waging about it does not serve to somehow defeat the Kremlin, rather the argument that we are waging serves to strengthen our societies in their democratic constitution. That is why I believe that it is right that we have DG StratCom. But it is too small and the networking with the national level is not good enough. In addition to tracking down the propaganda and the lies in the propaganda, I believe that the European Union urgently needs to strengthen journalism.

I agree we have to tackle these challenges; it is high time to build up the resilience of our Union. In my opinion this should include four points. Firstly, to thoroughly investigate Russian interferences in election campaigns. Secondly, to impose targeted sanctions against hacking and falsified publication of sensitive data. Thirdly to turn the East StratCom task force into a permanent EU structure with adequate funding and increased personnel. And, fourthly, to develop an effective, well-targeted and tailor-made strategy on how to communicate and promote our European policies and values. In all our actions we ought to keep in mind that the European Union’s main strength when facing hostile influence from Russia is information rather than criminalisation. And, Mr President, a final remark. As a European Parliament we could perhaps improve things in our own House too. I observed in 2017 a few of our Members using the technical infrastructure of this Parliament to broadcast discussions and interviews on Kremlin-backed news channels such as Russia Today.

Strengthening the EU's anti-propaganda campaigns is extremely important and a good direction, but it is worthless in countries where governments themselves are the main consumers and disseminators of Russian propaganda. In recent years, the Hungarian government has consistently sided with Russia, not only in economic and political alliances with Vladimir Putin's Russia, but also played a significant role in disseminating Russian false news and propaganda in Hungary and beyond. Russian channels that spread fake news - Sputnik, Russia Today - operate not only on official channels, but also, of course, on online platforms. Thousands of trolls help spread false news, propaganda. In Hungary and some other Member States, they receive significant support from the state and public service media, which should be a forum for politically independent, impartial, real news. Therefore, the European Union can no longer go without a word in favor of the countries where the public service media themselves and the government itself are the main consumers and disseminators of this false news.

A few action points: we need transparency rules for political advertisements online. We need algorithmic accountability and the tackling of botnets and trolls. We should actively try to reach Russian-speaking minorities in Europe and populations in the countries around Europe directly in Russian language with pluralist sources and opinions. We should defend and promote democratic values in Europe and abroad and not compromise them.

Deliberate disinformation raises the stakes. It raises the stakes both for freedom of expression and for our properly functioning democracies. The challenge for public authorities at all levels is to find ways of tackling disinformation without having an adverse effect on freedom of expression, as a number of you have underlined. It is no good our seeking to counter disinformation or fake news by setting up some kind of 1984-style Ministry of Truth; and we are not going to do that.  As I said earlier, the Commission is looking at what more might be done to address the challenge of hostile propaganda, fake news and online disinformation, always bearing in mind that balance between countering disinformation and respecting our democratic rights including crucially freedom of expression.  So we are reinforcing our StratCom’s efforts. We will continue our support to media freedom of expression. We will come forward with proposals focusing on this challenge of fake news later this spring. We are looking at what more we can do with the big Internet platforms to address these issues and we are pursuing, with you, the measures that need to be taken to reinforce our cybersecurity, our cyber resilience and deterrence.

This issue is highly relevant from the defense perspective, since the relationship with Russia is one of the crucial points in the creation of the European Defense Union. The EU has considered this issue as key and a specialized unit has been established to address it.

I would also like to thank, of course, all the experts who really contributed to making the report good. We had our first meetings a year ago, and in order to see what the experience is also in the field, we also carried out an inquiry mission to Slovenia and Croatia. 224 amendments have been tabled to the report, and I think we have covered all the main findings in them and in the report itself, and highlighted the challenges we will have to face in the future as we continue the Youth Employment Initiative. What is a youth employment initiative anyway? It is a financial program that supports a project launched by the European Commission in 2012. At that time, a commitment was made to provide young Europeans with a quality job offer, further education, within four months of losing their job or completing their education. apprenticeship or traineeship. With the Youth Employment Initiative, with this program, which has € 7.6 billion at its disposal, we will be able to achieve this goal more easily. But the important thing, of course, is that the money is spent effectively and that it covers the most vulnerable groups of young people. However, the available data unfortunately show that only a small proportion of those inactive were covered. Despite some shortcomings, mainly related to the target groups and the measurement and monitoring of results, the final results of the implementation of the initiative proved to be very positive. The most important issue that remains a challenge for the future of this program, however, is the issue of cost-effectiveness. So how money is spent, efficiently or not, and the Court of Auditors has also pointed this out. One of the findings is that Member States use the funds from the initiative as a primary source instead of an additional source, and in fact replace them with those national resources that they would otherwise have to contribute themselves. The monitoring and evaluation process is also very demanding and unfortunately non-uniform, so today we do not have very exact evidence of whether it is good or a little less good efficiency, and of course I also pointed this out in the report. One of the key issues in this report, and also in our debate, was the issue of the quality of job offers. These offers are usually or often very questionable, especially today, when atypical forms of employment predominate, this is a problem. That is why I am glad that we have reached an appropriate compromise on what a quality offer means. Finally, I must add that the measures taken by the initiative have supported more than 1.6 million young people in the European Union. Therefore, we need a secure strategy to transform the initiative into a more stable and sustainable funding instrument beyond 2020. At that time, we will probably face different challenges in the labor market, but it will always, indeed always, be necessary to take care of those in the labor market. , which are our future, that is, for our young people.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sl", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 182, "date": "2018-01-17.json", "name": "Marianne THYSSEN", "mepid": "1832", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, I would like to thank Ms Tomc for her report, which stresses that youth employment is, and remains, a top priority at Union level. Your report, Ms Tomc, comes at the right moment to take stock, four years into the launch of the Youth Guarantee and the Youth Employment Initiative. As you know, there are two sides of the coin: the policy and the financial support dedicated to young people not in employment, education or training, the so-called NEETs. Setting up the Youth Guarantee required commitment and political support from Member States, building new partnerships, as well as significant reforms of the labour market, education and training policies. Back in 2014, only a few Member States had fully set up their implementation structures and launched measures to benefit from this dedicated funding. Given their budgetary constraints, many Member States were struggling to ensure sufficient financial liquidity so that measures could take off. Therefore, my first action as a Commissioner was to address this shortage by proposing to release 30% of the Youth Employment Initiative resources directly as advance payments to the Member States.  These efforts are now bearing fruit. Since the launch of the Youth Guarantee, around 11 million young people have received an offer. The Youth Employment Initiative has directly helped at least 1.7 million young people to receive job training or a further education opportunity.  In parallel, we observe a strong decrease in the youth employment rate, from a peak of 24% in January 2013 to 16.2% last November. There are now two million fewer young unemployed in the Union and one million fewer young people who are not in employment, education or training. I believe that the combination of the Youth Guarantee, the Youth Employment Initiative and the European Social Fund (ESF) has contributed to this remarkable improvement. Together, they have created new opportunities for young people and acted as a powerful driver for structural reforms in all Member States. However, I agree with you that our work should not stop here. Youth unemployment is still far too high in many Member States, and the figures diverge, from 5% in the Czech Republic or 6.6% in Germany to around, yes, 39% in Greece, and also, still, more than 30% in Italy and Spain. Inactivity among young people, as well as untapped potential, remains a reality across the Union and, as your report and also the report of the Court of Auditors highlight, not all young people have benefited equally from these initiatives. Let me stress a few aspects that we will further concentrate on. We need to step up efforts to reach out and to support the low-skilled and those with fewer opportunities. We know that young people with disabilities, those with a migration background and young parents with caring responsibilities remain much more at risk of becoming NEETs.  I agree with you that we have to expand the pool of good-quality offers. We need to ensure that they really help young people to get a solid foothold in the labour market. For the second phase of the Youth Employment Initiative’s implementation, until of the end of the current financial framework, we will pay close attention to this quality aspect.  The Commission is already helping Member States to improve the quality of their job and training offers and to design outreach measures. This is the case for the ‘find-bind-mind’ outreach method that certain Member States already use successfully to ensure that the most disadvantaged and vulnerable young people are given special attention and receive the personalised assistance they need. And let us not forget that the ESF can also be used. It can be used as an additional support for an integrated approach to these young people. It can also invest in the reform of services and the setting up of the so-called one-stop-shop approach, offering young people a single contact point for all formalities and assistance provided by several services – social, employment or education. In order to offer policy guidance to Member States and stakeholders, we adopted a proposal for a European framework for quality and effective apprenticeships. We are also working to increase the supply, quality and image of apprenticeships through the European Alliance for Apprenticeships, and we will continue our efforts with the social partners on promoting the implementation of the quality framework for traineeships.  As regards monitoring the Youth Employment Initiative progress, we continue providing guidance on a regular basis and requesting Member States’ feedback on data collection and monitoring. In 2019, we will report to you and to the Council on the main findings of the Member States’ evaluations of the Youth Employment Initiative, which they are currently carrying out. The Commission will also continue to support mutual learning and dissemination of good practices among Member States. Last October, for instance, we organised a Youth Guarantee learning forum that brought together Youth Guarantee policy coordinators from Member States and Youth Employment Initiative managing authorities. The aim was to disseminate good practices, take stock of the lessons learned so far and come up with proposals for the future.  Your draft report confirms that the Youth Guarantee and the Youth Employment Initiative are, and will remain, important instruments for fighting youth unemployment in Europe. As the Court of Auditors pointed out, we need to reach out further to the NEETs far away from the education and labour market, and ensure the quality of the offers provided. The Commission and the Member States are committed to improve further the outcome of these schemes. Finally, let me thank Parliament once again for supporting the increase in the Youth Employment Initiative resources until 2020. This additional EUR 1.2 billion will allow Member States to support around one million more young people until 2020, in the Member States and regions most affected by youth unemployment.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 183, "date": "2018-01-17.json", "name": "Andrey NOVAKOV", "mepid": "107212", "text": "  rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Budgets. – Madam President, I am happy that this debate is coming just a few hours after the presentation of the Bulgarian Presidency and its priorities.

People with disabilities, the less educated and the long-term unemployed remain outside these statistics. In my country, Bulgaria, the situation is similar. The scheme benefits almost entirely young people with secondary and higher education at the expense of the low-skilled. Young people registered with employment offices are rather rare. That is why we need to think about alternative solutions. One of my proposals as a rapporteur for the Committee on Education and Culture is the creation of single information desks. There, young people will be able to receive information about various opportunities for training, internship or work in one place.

I believe that also thanks to the contribution of the colleagues rapporteurs of the groups we are facing, in the end, an ambitious text, which presents a precise picture of the implementation of this fundamental European program to combat unemployment and youth inactivity, not only because it is analyzed in detail the available data and the impact of the resources deployed to achieve the Youth Guarantee objectives, but also because the elements that require more critical consideration are carefully evaluated, proposing specific recommendations on how to deal with them. I am strongly convinced, in fact, that today a reform of the Youth Guarantee and its financial instrument, the Youth Employment Initiative, is necessary, which knows how to build on the experience accumulated in recent years. The objective of this reform must focus above all on three fronts: firstly, to enhance its range of action, demonstrating to better involve those who need it most, namely the \"NEETs\", those inactive young people who do not study and do not work, which are on the fringes of the labor market. Secondly, bureaucratic mechanisms must be simplified, allowing greater involvement of businesses and youth and trade union organizations, and enhancing the efficiency of public employment services. Finally, it is necessary to work on the quality of the offers, starting from the elaboration of a definition at European level of quality offer. I have fought, even in dissent from some colleagues, that the definition contains clear and very clear principles, including the mandatory remuneration of traineeships, full access to social services for trainees and respect for rights and rules on I work in complete manner. The ultimate goal of the measures funded by the Youth Employment Initiative must be long-term integration into the labor market and cannot be limited to financing short-term internships which, for example, have been predominant in my country in some regions. It is therefore necessary today to equip oneself with tools to prevent any possible abuse, such as late payments or the violation of contractual conditions and the rights of participants, which damages not only the educational and professional process of the many young beneficiaries but also the reputation of the Union. European Union in its action to combat youth unemployment. For this reason, I have proposed that a European Union hotline against the violation of the rights of young people be set up, allowing them to communicate directly to the Commission any negative experience during their participation in the program, allowing the investigation of possible abusive practices in the use of EU-funded policies. A key element in the discussion concerns the funds to be allocated after 2020. I strongly believe that the Youth Employment Initiative must change from an extraordinary anti-crisis instrument to a permanent mechanism, which finances the Youth Guarantee in the years to come. Discussions on the new multiannual financial framework will start shortly: the European Parliament will have to fight to ensure that this program remains an absolute priority for Union action.

I also thank all the other colleagues who have worked on this topic. I agree with many of the suggestions in the text of the report. I agree that we need a better exchange of comparable data and a more active approach to more vulnerable young people or young people outside larger cities. It is important to me that the report warns against the risk that European Union funds may - and sometimes tend to - replace national funds. However, the initiative should be the engine of reforms. It must not replace the Member States' own policies and ideas.

I really appreciate her efforts. We can talk about the Youth Employment Initiative in many beautiful words and argue with numbers and statistics. But for me, the main goal is quite simple, we have to teach young people to work. Work is normal. This is my message to the school leavers to whom the initiative is addressed. Although the programs funded by this initiative do not replace working hours, they make a lot of sense. I welcome the efforts to transform the initiative into a more permanent financial instrument to tackle unemployment beyond 2020. Negotiations within the multiannual financial framework will ensure the necessary continuity with the program. Member States should make full use not only of the opportunities of the initiative, but also invest themselves in promoting job mobility, the potential of which remains untapped. The EU's workforce is around 243 million people, but only 8.5 million of them work abroad in Europe. At the same time, young people are the ones who are most willing to move for work. Let's support them! After all, we already know well from fairy tales that success and happiness were only waiting for Honza, who went out into the world to experience it. I also see a problem in the fact that our companies cannot rely on a functioning education system that would equip young graduates with skills that meet the needs of the labor market. So let's connect successful companies and educational institutions with young people who are actively looking after their future. Only in this way can we help to address the skills gap, which is one of the main causes of high youth unemployment rates. Let us join forces in our own countries, let us communicate with the national authorities, which can do the most to make better use of the initiative. We should not ignore the given hand, but press it firmly. So let's teach young people that going to work, gaining experience and learning new things is great.

Such as the problems when mobilizing funds, because they did not reach the countries that most needed them, the problems in the design of the programs themselves and, as a culmination, the fact that the little data we have tells us that this policy is not being effective. And it must be said that it is a shame that Spain, having received 1 billion euros, hardly provides data on where it has applied the funds. The Youth Employment Initiative should serve so that young people could make a correct transition to the labor market and, however, we have seen how under this Initiative there are cases of exploitation, replacement of permanent workers, contingency and precariousness. Ladies and gentlemen, the problem of young people is not the lack of employability, and those who speak of NEETs in this House today I believe that they have not understood this and that, in fact, they do not understand what the solutions are for the future of our society.

But we cannot deny that youth unemployment is still a massive problem within the European Union, and we cannot let one more day pass in which we do not put all our efforts into fighting against this, because it is one of the crucial questions about whether we have a future in a united Europe or not. Yes, the Youth Employment Initiative has been presented as the answer, or at least partly the solution to this big problem of youth unemployment, and young people all over Europe have put their hopes into this initiative. It is true that some of them have been satisfied; their expectations have been met. But we must also say that many young people have been disappointed, and that there is a big gap in implementation and the success of implementation in different Member States. We have Member States where the numbers have gone down and we have Member States where the numbers have not gone down, and where I believe the wrong proposals have been made in order to fight against youth unemployment. One of the crucial questions is whether Member States have actually provided high-quality sustainable offers to young people, because the Youth Employment Initiative is not about giving something to do to young people who don’t know what to do with their time. It is about giving perspectives to young people; quality and sustainable offers so that they can enter the labour market. I believe that if we want these quality offers to be meaningful, they should, for example, also be remunerated. That is why it is important for the report to very clearly state that we need quality offers and why we should have a definition at European level as to what these quality offers mean. Lastly, I think as the European Parliament we can take a very concrete measure in order to show how sincere and how clear we are in our demands to fight youth unemployment, and that is to finally implement fair internships and to treat the interns here in this House fairly and to remunerate the internships that are being done in this House.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 193, "date": "2018-01-17.json", "name": "Tiziana BEGHIN", "mepid": "124777", "text": "on behalf of the EFDD Group. - Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, deciding what to do with the Youth Employment Initiative means choosing whether to be a country up to the problems it has or to continue living at the mercy of a national and local politics that is a victim of itself , victim of bad management imprisoned by clientelist logic, small interests to defend and nourish as possible.

It is therefore an assistantship from public funds intended also to alleviate the difficulties of private entrepreneurs in their search for qualified employees. In this specific case, however, the mechanism of the Youth Employment Initiative deserves a closer look. Indeed, if on the financial and budgetary level, one must be very circumspect, as recommended by the report of the Court of Auditors, and if its approach from doctrinal angles such as equality between men and women may seem excessive, its implementation allows us to conclude that there is a need to continue further. Our group and I were able to verify this on the ground, both in France and abroad, thanks to the rapporteur, Ms. Tomc. The conditions necessary for its implementation are better controlled and better managed financing which does not replace national funds and which benefits from regular quality evaluation.

It is the youth, my generation, who have paid the highest price for the crisis. She was and rightly is a top priority of this legislature. Europe has really tried to make a success of the Youth Guarantee and the Youth Employment Initiative and it paid off. Also in my country. Youth unemployment in Brussels, for example, fell for the 55th time in a row. Yet youth unemployment remains far too high at 24%. How did that happen? The economy is heading towards cruising speed. Employers are looking for the right talents and my government is also juggling with figures about great job creation. However, the problem lies with the mismatch. However good our intentions are, the real target group - the unemployed young people who are not in training - is still not being reached enough. That is why I support the call to Member States for more data and more results-oriented work. Show us where the money is going and deliver quality too. Every -24-year-old deserves the chance to get a real, decent job and I am glad that the Commission will soon be able to monitor this too.

The crisis turned into an economic crisis which affected millions of young people. They had no part in causing it, yet the effects will affect their lives profoundly. This is why I think it is no more than normal that the EU Member States have together committed themselves to protecting young people through the Youth Guarantee. It is not an issue of charity, but one of decency. Luckily unemployment is decreasing now – and I am very glad that it is – but youth unemployment in Member States, such as Greece, Spain and Italy, which have already been mentioned by the Commissioner, are still shocking, so we are not there yet. We owe it to young people to keep assisting them. Firstly, we have to insist that jobs and traineeships made possible throughout our initiative hit the spot. This initiative should not only guarantee the development of skills among young people and ensure their integration on the labour market, because it is not only for jobs – the initiative is for life. I want to remind Member States that it is not about lip service, but the future of their young people.  Secondly, I think the Youth Employment Initiative needs to be transformed from an anti—crisis instrument into a more stable financing instrument for tackling youth unemployment.

I therefore hope that there will be a vocational training and apprenticeship program, with a view to the next multiannual financial framework.

In this case, for example, it is not acceptable for most of the resources of the youth guarantee to be allocated to a bonus system that only means lightening the social security contributions for employers. There are no programs to create jobs or to reduce precariousness in the labor market, the most important needs that young people have when they want to work. The results are working worse than in the rest of the European Union, since the youth employment rate grows much less in Spain. In practice, the Youth Guarantee is being used, in this case, for programs that pay less wages or do not recognize the employment relationship as such. Only 30% of the program offers are for employment, compared to 70% in the EU-28, so, far from being a program that helps to have quality work, in this case it becomes a mere subsidy to the businessmen, who are precarious.

The aim of this initiative is to reach the young people who are furthest from the labor market: young people who have neither jobs nor education. We are now beginning to see that this initiative has had positive results. That is also the reason why there was a budget increase last year. But that increase only applies until 2020, and that is also the reason why we are having this debate today. We must therefore make decisions about choices. My firm view is that we must first and foremost ensure that the Member States invest more than they do today in getting young people into work. They have to make the priorities. According to both the ILO and Eurofound, it takes between 45 billion and 50 billion euros per year to achieve the goal of the program. It can be compared with the fact that there is only 8.8 billion in the EU budget, if I remember correctly, for the program between 2014 and 2020. The Member States must therefore also put the money on the table. There are big differences between the Member States, we know that very well. We know that the support from the employment initiative has been absolutely necessary for them to be able to develop their own youth guarantees. We must, of course, continue to be there, but it must be the case that the Member States also make the priorities necessary for them to keep some young people in their Member States and for them to have young people who can handle difficult tasks and who are willing to give get into it. The economic crisis has also meant a waste of time for many young people, so it is important that the youth guarantees are qualitative, that they do not mean another loss of time. To achieve this, the young people themselves must be involved in the design and evaluation of the youth guarantee.

We have to ensure that our young people have individualized support, in multidisciplinary teams, made up of technicians, psychologists, and specialized sociologists, to ensure that the training offer is appropriate both to the trainee's characteristics and to the needs of the companies. Finally, internships cannot mask employment contracts or replace job contracts. And, therefore, it is necessary to ensure an adequate definition of the functional content and the responsibility of the trainee, who must be accompanied by a monitor who supports him and gives him training.

Wallonia and the Brussels Region receive funding from the Youth Employment Initiative. Subsequently, these young people disappear into training programs and unemployment statistics and these regions can present a good news show.

Some of them have the status of unemployed (looking for a job), but about 40% are economically inactive. They do not undertake any activity to change their status, so we can expect that their situation will be similar tomorrow, the day after tomorrow or next year. How destructive such an experience is for the individual person and for society as a whole does not need to be explained in this House. Therefore, we should focus on solutions and recognize that the majority of NEETs are women. The risk of women ending up in the NEET group increases with age. The greatest predominance of women is in the 30-34 age group, i.e. when the EU programs aimed at young people can no longer help them. Commissioner! EU programs need to be better targeted as women are among the most vulnerable young people. Specific projects in the Member States should be programmed and assessed by gender.

At the start of this parliamentary term, we then called for youth unemployment to be an absolute priority. Looking back over the past three and a half years, I think we have succeeded, in particular thanks to the strong cooperation between Parliament and Commissioner Thyssen. 132 measures have been adopted in the Member States, 1.6 million young people have taken advantage of them and youth unemployment in the EU has fallen sharply. And yet I have a bit of an ambiguous feeling about it. Because it is nice that we have been able to help so many young people. But at the same time it remains sad that this was necessary and still is. Because we still see alarmingly high youth unemployment in many European countries. So more needs to be done, in the first place in the Member States themselves. Structural reforms, better use of available funds and a better match between supply and demand in the labor market are absolutely necessary and can also be encouraged from Europe. Many issues have already been mentioned, but let me mention one more specific theme: if we want to give youth a future in Europe, we must not only want to look beyond borders, but also be able to look. I think one of the important things is: attention to neighborhood language education. Member States must insist from a very early age that students learn the language of their neighboring countries. We are going to pay attention to that in the resolution tomorrow and I ask the Commission to follow suit.

But we cannot be complacent, and my country certainly has no reason to do so. And we have to try to improve the program. In this report we point out many problems with the Youth Employment Initiative, and I would like to highlight two fundamentally. First, we need it to reach more young people, especially those between the ages of 25 and 30, because they are the ones with the greatest urgency for emancipation and, therefore, the ones who most urgently need a job with decent conditions and sufficient wages. . And we also need those job and training offers that are financed with this Youth Guarantee to be useful and of quality. Because this is precisely the weakest point, and that is why we have tabled an amendment. Let's be clear. Offering young people inadequate and low-quality training only causes the young person to waste their time and we waste public money. Offering them a low- or low-skilled job for which they are often overqualified takes them even further away from a true chance of getting a decent job.

The point is both to ensure the availability of training and internships by rational adaptation of workplaces, studies, teaching materials, etc. to the type of disability, and to disseminate information about these initiatives in formats accessible, for example, to blind or deaf people. In addition, Member States should review their case-law and benefit systems. It is worth limiting the adjudication of incapacity to work in a system that prevents registration with employment offices and thus prevents participation in the Youth Employment Initiative. We also limit the situations in which undertaking an internship or starting work is associated with the risk of immediate loss of benefits.

Five years ago, youth unemployment was over 40% in some Member States. Today the situation has improved significantly, although there are countries where there is still a lot of work to be done. The uneven implementation of the Initiative in the Member States makes the process of its monitoring and evaluation a serious challenge. There is no transparency in checking the results achieved, and there is no uniform understanding of the key concepts of \"good quality internships\" or \"good quality jobs\". Member States also have difficulties in defining the target population. The Court of Auditors noted that the Member States apply too general and superficial criteria. The result of this is, among others the problem with the identification of the NEET youth population, the so-called passive youth. For example, no Member State has been able to develop methods of reaching this group. Thus, those who most need support receive it the least. It is essential that Member States put more effort into finding ways to identify passive and excluded NEETs and establish appropriate strategies for them. The main aim of the YEI is to complement national funding, not replace it. Unfortunately, the available data show that in some Member States funding from the Initiative has replaced national funding. Thus, the program does not bring such significant added value as was planned at the time of its establishment, and the costs are borne by young people.

Your report is very timely as we are now in the process of elaborating our proposals for the future funding of youth employment under the next Multiannual Financial Framework. Fighting youth unemployment will continue to be a high priority at European and national levels as long as the rates of young unemployed and of those not in employment, education or training (NEETs) remain excessively high. The targeted funding and the focus on results which characterise the Youth Employment Initiative should be maintained. We will also address the challenge of simplifying implementation rules and reducing the burden on both managing authorities and beneficiaries. Many of you stressed the importance of macro-economic policies, and I would like to mention the policy of this Commission to stimulate economic growth, investment and job creation. Let me also refer to our skills agenda, and to underline our attention to quality in terms of offer in the framework of the Youth Employment Initiative. This initiative is well targeted, as you know, targeted at specific regions and groups of young people, and we have specific results indicators that act as an additional driver of quality. The Commission is also monitoring the quality of employment for all age groups under the European Semester, with particular attention being paid to issues related to labour-market segmentation. We provide guidance on the quality of traineeships and apprenticeships and we promote youth learning and vocational education and training (VET) mobility. We have enhanced the monitoring of the quality of Youth Guarantee offers in the Employment Committee (EMCO) multilateral surveillance process, and, as some of you might know, conclusions are expected soon – early this year. For the future, the commitment to quality offers for young people has been reinforced in the Pillar of Social Rights. In principle 4b of the pillar we have included the Youth Guarantee. Honourable Members, I look forward to working with you on the future Multiannual Financial Framework proposals, to securing a prominent place for investing in the future of our young generation. This investment in young people is not only, as some of you said, an expression of solidarity: it is also an essential condition for ensuring the future development of a highly competitive social market economy aiming at full employment and social progress. It is also about an inclusive society and a dynamic society. Thanks for your support.

I note that we actually have the same views on tackling youth unemployment and that we all together recognize this YEI program as one of the fundamental and very useful initiatives to reduce youth unemployment. Of course, we still have a lot of work to do in this area, and I agree that we need to make this program more effective in the future. The Commission must also be given greater powers to monitor Member States' spending of this money. However, let me draw my attention to what many of you have already pointed out before me. The European Union and the Commission make a lot of money available, and the Member States are the ones most responsible for making sure that this money, which is intended for young people, really reaches them. Another important caveat: this program and this money is neither the only nor the most important tool that Member States have to address their employment policies. They themselves are the ones who have to make all the necessary reforms first, and we are very different in that, some are far behind. Reforms on the labor market are needed, especially reforms on the market or in the field of education, namely we cannot afford for young people to enter the labor market who become unemployed but have, for example, a higher education.

Thanks to Parliament’s hard work, one of the key initiatives, the legislative package on waste, is now very close to adoption. I am grateful for the hard work of Simona Bonafè and all the shadow rapporteurs involved. The package the Commission adopted yesterday keeps us on this very positive track. The main element of this package is the Plastics Strategy for Europe. There is a tide of growing awareness and concern among people, businesses and governments about the enormity of plastic pollution. In last year’s special Eurobarometer survey, 84% of European citizens said that they are worried about the impact of plastics on our environment. The Commission also received a petition signed by 800 000 Europeans calling on us to deliver an ambitious plan, and I know that, in this House too, there is a sense of urgency about this issue. Plastic pollution is an enormous challenge, threatening our environment and health. Every second, approximately 700 kilos of plastic waste ends up in our oceans. If we go on this way, there will be more plastic than fish in the ocean by 2050. Micro-plastics are found not just in our oceans but also in our water, in the water we drink, in the food we eat, and in the air we breathe. Also, the way we produce, use and dispose of plastics today is a threat to several economic sectors: fisheries and tourism, to name two. It is also a wasted economic opportunity. Vice-President Katainen will say more about that in a second. With this strategy, we aim to foster a new, sustainable and profitable plastics economy, with the design of products and other parts of the production chain taking into account re-use and recycling needs. Plastic packaging accounts for about 60% of all plastic waste generated in Europe every year. It is therefore paramount that we address packaging as a priority. Our aim is that, by 2030, all plastic packaging placed on the EU market will be reusable or recyclable in a cost-effective manner. We have quickly begun work on future revision of rules, and new harmonised rules, on packaging. In the shorter term, we need to curb plastic waste and reduce the use of certain types of plastic. Several measures for that are provided for in the strategy. We will propose an EU-level legislative initiative on single-use plastics before summer. Single-use plastic items constitute 50% of litter found on EU beaches, and it is important that we significantly reduce the use of these products. Micro-plastics are another serious problem. We have launched a process to ban micro-plastics that are intentionally added to products such as cosmetics, paints and detergents, and we can do that under the Reach framework. Also, we will continue our work to ban oxo-plastics because these oxo-plastics fragment to tiny pieces, exacerbating the micro-plastics accumulation even more. Together with this strategy, we adopted a new directive on port reception facilities, which goes a long way, ensuring that waste is brought back to land instead of being discharged at sea. We will also develop additional measures to motivate those working on boats to bring the fishing gear to land and not dump it into the sea. Since a significant part of plastic pollution comes from other parts of the world, we will need to work together with the rest of the world to make sure that we improve the situation. We, as the EU, can be a global leader in this. We have been a global leader on climate action and we can be a global leader here as well. We need the full support of this Parliament if we are to be successful.

Today, all too often the way plastics are produced, used and discarded fails to capture the economic benefits of a more circular approach. According to the estimates only 5% of the value of plastic packaging materials remains in the economy, the rest goes to waste after a very short first use. The annual bill accounts for up to EUR 105 billion. We simply cannot afford it. This is why we are proposing rethinking and improving the functioning of the entire complex value chain: plastic producers, designers, retailers and recyclers and consumers all need to act. It often seems to be forgotten that high levels of plastic recycling can only be achieved by improving the way plastics are produced and designed. The aim is that by 2030 all plastic packaging will be reusable and recyclable. This will be achieved by stimulating design for circularity, boosting recycled content and stimulating better separate waste collection. Plastics packaging today accounts for about 60% of all plastics waste generated in Europe every year. It is therefore paramount that we address this as a priority. In the EU, the uptake of recycled plastics in new products is low; only around 6%. Our objective is to support the creation of more stable markets for recycled plastics and ensure the demand for recycled plastics is multiplied by four. In other words, our aim is, first, to create a truly well-functioning single market for recyclable plastics, second to improve waste collection and, third, promote recycled plastics. The intention is to stimulate investment in the sector. Existing EU funds such as the structural funds, the European Fund for Strategic Investments and Horizon 2020 will continue to support businesses and Member States to upgrade their waste management infrastructure. We aim at stimulating the increase of the European recycling capacity and the quality of the resulting recycled material. This will create trust in the market and attract further investment and innovation in Europe. But plastic waste reduction depends not only on the recycling infrastructure, it can also be reduced by using more sustainable materials which could replace traditional plastic while offering the same functionalities. Later this year the Commission will develop a strategic research innovation agenda for plastics. The focus will be the development of smarter and more recyclable plastic materials and products, more efficient recycling processes, the removal of hazardous substances and contaminants from recycled plastics and finding solutions addressing the problem of micro-plastics. And if we manage to set things right the world will follow us. It is always the case that good European policies are copied elsewhere, and that should be our goal, to have a global impact. This is the most effective way to ensure that the European plastics industry, employing today as many as 1.5 million people, will become stronger, more competitive and at the same time the world leader in innovation, digitisation and decarbonisation.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 259, "date": "2018-01-17.json", "name": "Peter LIESE", "mepid": "1927", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - Madam President, dear Vice-Presidents, dear colleagues! I very much welcome the fact that the Commission presented the strategy today. We have a huge problem, we have a problem with the pollution of the world's oceans. It is a dramatic portrayal, but what you said yesterday, Vice-President Timmermans, is surely something to the fact that, if we are not careful, we will have more plastic in the sea than fish by 2050. And it already brings health problems with it. We also have the problem that we use up our children's raw materials, that we have too little circular economy overall and too much of a throwaway society. So we have to do something. The Commission has made very interesting proposals. After all, there is also a legislative proposal that is already part of it. And that's where I want to start. We have to stop just talking. We have to act very specifically. And that requires legislative proposals. The European Commission is the only body that can make legislative proposals. Therefore: Congratulations on the one, very small suggestion you made. But I really want to ask that, as announced, the next proposal comes in May and that it doesn't stay that way. We need a legal framework that puts those who want to promote recycling and those who want to promote sustainable production methods better off against the competition. Because there are good ideas everywhere, and there are people everywhere who want to do something. But there are shareholders everywhere who say: If you do that, we will lose money.

That is a bit annoying for the other Commissioner, but he can listen to the interpretation. Let me start by saying “thank you, congratulations”. It was about time, but you are doing it. You come up with a plastic strategy and I think we are the only major region in the world today to take that responsibility. With this we also set the standard for the rest of the world. That's really important! We will fully support you in this. We also especially look forward to the legislative proposals, because soft law strategies and awareness-raising are all well and good, but we also need legislation. I am thinking of the working group on disposable plastics, but also of the legislation on port reception facilities. Both are very important and Parliament will certainly support them. There will also be an investigation into a tax on disposable plastics. That is a very important item in many of our Member States. Our group wants to support that. I think that's a good way to tax plastic away. What we are less in agreement with is to use that tax as a kind of own income for the Union, because this is pre-eminently a tax that you do not want to collect, that must go to zero. And when we talk about own income - and we are very much in favor of this - we want to have a stable basis for it. One last point. It is very important that the Commission proposes to ensure that all plastic packaging is recyclable by 2030. Take a look at that together with the wonderful work that our rapporteur Simona Bonafè and the others have done on the waste package and the circular economy. Then you have a good basis. But we will also have to ensure that we create a market, that the producers also start using recyclable packaging.

It is interesting to hear your proposal.  I know that it is not a very fashionable thing to say, but I am actually a great fan of plastic. It is a wonderful material. It has transformed most of our lives, certainly mine. If you are as old as I am, you can remember when there was not very much plastic around and life was very different. But we all have to accept, and there is common agreement, that we have probably got to the point where – a bit like all of our issues around climate change – it is time that we stopped just taking the benefits and realised that there are some pretty heavy downsides.  I really think that this argument is done. It is made. I doubt if you will hear too many people today, or in the future when you are putting the strategy into place, arguing with that. I think our problem is going to be about how we put these proposals in place. Perhaps, given where I stand in the Chamber and possibly a little bit my nationality, it will not come as a great surprise to you that I am not such a fan as the two previous speakers of the legislation. That is not to say that I do not think we need any – of course we do, we do need a framework – but I would like to make an appeal for that to be as light as possible in the sense of setting Member States’ targets and allowing them to use their own best efforts to meet those. The new thing in here that I took away was this issue about setting a single market for recyclable plastics, standards on how they are manufactured and what they are manufactured with. That is how you stimulate this change. It is by creating a market, making that market work and trusting the public. I can tell you that in the UK, where we have just banned microplastics, there was no resistance. They do not need to be brought on board. It is actually the functioning of the whole system that needs to be taken very seriously, so I thank you very much.

If a few years ago, someone had told me that two Vice-Presidents would present a strategy on plastics in Parliament I would have sent that person to the madhouse. So it is great to see that commitment from the Commission, and leafing through the strategy, I must say the analysis is very strong, the language is right and the intentions are very, very promising. If the European Commission were a consultancy firm I would certainly recommend it to all my friends and businesses around. But the Commission is a political body; not only that, it is the only political body that can propose legislative proposals. And that is what is still lacking here. I know some elements are technically difficult: setting common standards for biodegradable plastics is not easy, and I know there’s a huge scientific debate behind that. But there are many other elements that are much less complicated and that have already been considered by the Commission for years and years, even by previous commissioners. Ms Girling has already mentioned that tackling the use of micro plastics in cosmetics would have been easy, and it would have been quite easy to set minimum standards for recycled content in the Ecodesign Directive. And what about measures on single-use plastics? That has been done the around the world So concluding, I’m very happy with the strategy, but I had expected a little bit more on the legislative part.

On the one hand, I very much welcome the fact that the European Commission plans to work to ensure that all plastic packaging placed on the EU internal market is either reusable or easily recyclable by 2030, and that more than half of all plastic waste will be recyclable by that year. . The single internal market for plastics is the right way to go, but it will require a robust investment. We are currently facing a global crisis in terms of plastic packaging, and we do not have time to wait until 2030, and we will not solve it by starting to transport it to China, where our plastic waste no longer wants it. The situation in our seas is unsustainable in the long run, and not just because of microplastics. It is therefore essential that, on the basis of the strategy, ambitious rules be presented as soon as possible by this Commission. These must drastically reduce the consumption of both plastic objects and packaging. We did without them before that, we have to do in the future. I am not sure if it is enough to rely only on voluntary commitments from industry. After several studies of biodegradable plastics performed in our country in the Czech Republic, when it was found that in most cases these do not decompose even after two years in the soil, I am skeptical of them as well.

It really is a great day! After all, it is four years ago that the Commission, and not least Commissioner Timmermans and I, were really up for a fight. The Commissioner was sure that plastic was \"small things\" and the Commission should be petty about \"small things\". Now we are here, and the Commission has recognized that plastic pollution is \"big things\". They have even come up with something that is reasonably \"big\". It ends up becoming a habit with me to have to praise Timmermans, and I do so with joy every single time he gives me the opportunity to do so. Thank you so much! But of course there are a few little things! But let me first take the praise further: It is good that there is a coherent description of the problem, so that we have health, climate, nature, jobs and resource efficiency with us, and that the need for competitive advantages is mentioned. I also believe that we need to get the industry in properly, as it has been mentioned by several, including by Peter Liese. I support ensuring that we have progressive support for the industry. We need to have mid-term evaluations so we can see that we are actually achieving something. Then I would also like to share in the grief that there are no concrete proposals. But now I have been so happy, so I will content myself with rejoicing instead that we have been promised that the proposals will come in May. I reckon key parts of them can be finished so we can meet our citizens with proof that we are actually taking their concerns seriously. I think the best thing we can do to strengthen the European Union in this matter is to do something really good here. I have one more small thing: I know that the Commission has a problem with endocrine disruptors. I do not know if they themselves have been disturbed in the head, since we can not be allowed to have them with us. So we have to make sure that the endocrine disruptors also come out of plastic if it is to be reusable and recyclable.

The alarming figure of eight million tonnes of plastic waste dumped into our oceans every year is urging us to act. Fighting pollution by increasing the lifespan of plastics and their recyclable content, promoting biodegradable plastics and empowering consumers are steps in the right direction. But we need to go further, namely to ban plastics wherever possible, especially when other options already exist, and to move away as far as possible from the “all-throwaway” logic.

That is why I welcomed the proposal for quality standards for recycled plastics and the intention to incentivise packaging for the construction and car industries to use more of them. That creates a complete economic value chain, giving the industry the possibility to adapt to the new rules.

But more recycling alone is of course not enough. We also need to focus on waste prevention, on well thought out product designs, on new business models. I also welcome the Commission's nuanced stance on biodegradable plastics. Clear agreements are needed, but we also have to realize that even that kind of plastic is not a saving grace for marine litter, on the contrary.

The fact that China is not being replaced by Vietnam, Turkey or Africa is a question of trade policy. We are responsible for ensuring that plastic is not simply deposited here or anywhere else. The problem with these materials is that out of sight is out of mind, but not out of the world. There are reasons and arguments for a serious policy of waste prevention as well as technologies for its removal. But the industry sings its interest song as always: too high standards.

These are impressive figures if we consider that much of this waste is the primary cause of pollution of the seas: today there are entire islands of plastic in the midst of the oceans. It is good to clarify that this is not a strategy against plastic but an opportunity that we must be able to seize. Aiming to make all plastic packaging recyclable and reusable between now and 2030 is not only a way to protect the environment but it is also a precise choice, which gives new impetus to the recycling industry, to innovation for more sustainable materials, to revive the competitiveness of our businesses and support employment. Challenges requiring investment in research and development, which will be stimulated by the additional EUR 100 million. The agreement on the circular economy package that we reached in December will already concretely kick off many actions included in the strategy, starting with the strengthening of separate collection obligations, to preventive measures in the generation of waste, such as the introduction of extended producer responsibility schemes for packaging. When we talk about plastic we are talking about products and materials in common use for European citizens: bottles, cosmetics, bags. This is the right time: there is a public opinion very attentive to sustainability issues and worried about the impact of pollution on health.

Apparently, we produce 300 million tons of plastics annually worldwide. This significant percentage is also produced here in Europe. However, what I would like to point out: that in this document you do not pay attention to the combination of this strategy in the field of plastics with bioeconomy, and yet this is a kind of hope at the moment related to the fact that renewable raw materials can be a source of plastics production, which are biodegradable. Of course, there are some that can contain these components and are not biodegradable, but a large part is biodegradable. We know the changes in the agricultural commodity markets. Some of them are already polymerized into plastics (for example sugar by laccidic acid). Secondly, I would like to draw your attention (just a moment, Madam President) to the problems related to marine litter.

Therefore, I take this opportunity to appeal to the Commission and to all of us to be strict when it comes to environmental chapters.

Therefore, this is a unique opportunity for us all to finally reflect on our destiny. I agree with all the statements so far here regarding garbage and plastics.

Seldom in my three years in this Parliament have I experienced such a unity of purpose. Everyone agrees that we need to do something; perhaps not everyone agrees on the measures we need to take or the speed with which we will do it. But let me give you one guarantee: this Commission will try everything it can to put on your table legislative proposals in those areas where we can come up with legislation. We’ve already started with REACH on micro-plastics in cosmetics, paints and in detergents, but sometimes we need more analysis. How are we going to deal with micro-plastics coming out of tyres on cars or coming out of our clothes when we wash them? These are complicated things and we want to make sure we get the science right before we put legislation on the table. And as far as packaging is concerned, we will be extremely ambitious and we will come up with legislation, and we want this to happen very quickly. But we’ve also seen that the unity of purpose in this room is shared by industry: by and large they want to be part of this. They know they need to be part of this. We need to create the circumstances for them to be part of it and for it to become a profitable business. But I believe that plastics will continue to have a huge role in our society. I’m not an enemy of plastics. Plastics can be fantastic if they’re the right plastics, and we need to get the science right. That’s why we’re putting EUR 100 million extra into research through Horizon 2020. So I see the message you gave to us today as a strong endorsement for this Commission to continue along this path. This is what we will do – and this is a promise I make on behalf of all of us – we will make proposals for legislation where we can. But we will not rush into things, especially if we haven’t got the science right yet or if we can still wait for industry to do its part. If industry won’t do its part we will step in. But I have the feeling that given the sense of urgency that is shared by industry, we will be able to do a lot of things together as well. If we do this in a holistic way, if it is part of our circular economy, if it is part of the fourth industrial revolution and the benefits it brings, we will lead in the world and make sure that the health of our children and grandchildren will not suffer and our environment will not suffer more than it already does as a result of the waste of plastics.

This debate made me really happy, and I do believe that we can deliver. Thank you very much for the ideas. I have four points: firstly, why do recycled plastics not account for more than 6% of the entire volume of plastics used? It is because we don’t have European-wide quality standards for recycled plastic, and this we will change. We need a single market tool for recycled plastics. Why don’t we recycle more packaging waste, plastic bags and waste? Because there are too many different types of plastics used for packaging. So that’s why we want to change this. We need quality standards and other standards in order to create a more harmonised approach for producing plastic packages. This enables us to create a single market. These two measures enable us to create a well-functioning single market for plastics. Secondly, we also need to look at the regulatory framework for biodegradable and compostable plastics. You are right that bio products can be an alternative source for producing more sustainable plastics, but we need to get this regulatory framework right. Our consumers must also know that you cannot mix biodegradable plastics with oil-based plastics, otherwise recycling is impossible. So we have to encourage or empower consumers. Thirdly, we certainly need more innovations. Horizon 2020 has already financed plastic-related innovations worth EUR 250 million during this period, and an additional 100 million will be made available. Furthermore, FC and structural funds can provide public financing. But even more money is available in private sector if the regulatory environment is right, and that’s why we have to concentrate on this part of our work. Fourthly, on China. I must say that I could not blame China at all when they decided to ban plastic waste imports. I must congratulate them. It’s actually a good incentive for Europe to find solutions, sustainable solutions. How to deal with plastic waste. It puts pressure on us, but it also create incentives. It will change the market, and this is what we need: a sustainable market where profit is coming from more sustainable behaviour. Finally, thank you once again very much for an excellent discussion.

Among the stated objectives is the desire to massively and efficiently recycle plastics in Europe. The recycling rate in the EU is only 22%, a level considered too low. A new strategy is therefore essential, not only to encourage good practice but also to resolve the difficulties encountered by the plastics industry sector. As we know, the obstacles to better recycling are essentially technical and economic. Indeed, there is a cost gap between virgin plastics and recycled plastics, which comes at the expense of the latter. In addition, the recent decision by China to ban the import of certain plastic waste from Europe offers us a real opportunity to create the conditions for an internal market for recycled materials. Establishing such a market will also require investments in plastic recycling infrastructure, the cost of which should be borne by both companies and public authorities.

There must be no room for disposable plastics in the current and future economies of the European Union. Such plastic - its production, use and disposal, in addition to being environmentally unsafe and its effect on the health of citizens is still unknown, is also contrary to the potential of the circular economy. In order to make full use of these potentials, products must not contain toxic substances such as those found in, for example, disposable plastic bags and other plastic products. Europe produces 25 million tonnes of plastic waste each year, of which less than 30% is recycled. Also, as much as 85% of waste on beaches is plastic, if we are talking about the world level.

For this reason, I welcome any future effort by the European Union to eliminate toxic substances from plastic products, reduce their use and increase the level of reuse and recycling of relevant waste.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hr", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "Verts/ALE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 293, "date": "2018-01-17.json", "name": "Lívia JÁRÓKA", "mepid": "28141", "text": "The next item is the debate on the report by Tadeusz Zwiefka, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, on the proposal for a Council regulation on jurisdiction, the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and the matters of parental responsibility (COM (2016) 0411 - C8-0322 / 2016 - 2016/0190 (CNS))", "language": "en", "original_language": "hu", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 294, "date": "2018-01-17.json", "name": "Tadeusz ZWIEFKA", "mepid": "28301", "text": "rapporteur. - Madam President! I would like to point out at the outset that although we have worked and are still working on the recasting of this regulation in accordance with a special legislative procedure which establishes the European Parliament in a consultative role only, and the Council acting unanimously as the sole legislator, it is the work that had to be done right here We took up our House in the European Parliament with full enthusiasm and - I think - we have done it really well. Therefore, I would like to start with a thank you. First of all, I would like to thank the European Commission for preparing a really good project to recast the Brussels IIa Regulation. I would like to thank my fellow Members in the Committee on Legal Affairs, and in particular the shadow rapporteurs, with whom I really had a great pleasure and satisfaction to work on this very regulation. Although the Commission's proposal was indeed rated as very good, Parliament has made some of its own proposals which, I strongly believe, improve the Commission's proposal while at the same time making the Council want to reflect on our comments as well. I would like to raise a few of the most important points. First, the question of hearing the child. For us, this is a key point in this regulation, because we believe that in a parental dispute over the exercise of parental responsibility or the issue of child abduction, the so-called parental abduction, the child is unfortunately the weakest party and this side must be absolutely protected. A child must be the subject of this case, and God forbid, not an object, which is why we put so much emphasis on all the elements that allow the child to maintain the best possible position. Of course, we cannot order that the child be heard on all matters. This decision remains independent for the court, but what we are introducing as a novelty is the necessity to justify a negative decision in when the court decides not to hold a hearing. We also draw attention to the fact that these hearings should be based on certain common standards. They should take place in a child-friendly atmosphere, i.e. it can be outside the court. They should be carried out by a specialized judge or a prepared expert, without the influence of third parties and without pressure from parents, and thus also without their participation. This is a very important point. We suggest that in these matters related to the exercise of parental responsibility, consideration of the possibility of conducting or using mediation as an alternative method of dispute resolution. Mediation offers various possibilities, greater than the court, it also shortens the time of the proceedings and, of course, allows you to save considerable expenses. Another issue that I want to draw attention to is the issue of placing a child outside his / her biological family, i.e. in a foster family or in an educational and care facility, by a court decision. I added my proposal, adopted by the Committee on Legal Affairs, to the Commission's proposal, so that the court could consider, when taking this decision, the possibility of leaving the child in the family residing in the country where the case is pending. This is a very, very useful solution for long-term cases. We are pleased to welcome the Commission's proposals to abolish the exequatur procedure, i.e. to abandon the need to confirm processes carried out in other Member States of the European Union, which has already been tested in other cases. Thank you for the opportunity to give this introduction. I will be curious to listen to the debate and then comment on it.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 295, "date": "2018-01-17.json", "name": "Dimitris Avramopoulos", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, the Brussels IIa Regulation is a key tool to navigating cross-border legal issues in family matters and to providing protection for children. Its revision addresses the shortcomings regarding parental responsibility proceedings which have also been flagged in the past by the honourable Members.  I am very happy that the Commission and Parliament have a common goal. We want to prevent that, in cross-border cases, children end up being taken hostages of long disputes. We also want to facilitate the procedures for families by various means including by reducing the length and cost of these procedures. Before I speak about Parliament’s amendments, I would like first to express my thanks to our rapporteur, Mr Zwiefka, for the excellent cooperation on this file. I am delighted that the report acknowledges that time and a smooth return to family life is of essence for children’s welfare and their relationship with their parents. In particular, I very much welcome the measures included in the report aiming to substantially reduce delays in returning children who were abducted by one of their parents. These are in line with the Commission’s proposal. These measures will imply in practice less cumbersome procedures for parents and quicker decisions by judges in cross-border cases. This will result in giving children back the stability they need and deserve, and an earlier return to family life.  Facilitating enforcement of judgments once decisions are taken is another crucial aspect to ensure the rights of children and their families. The abolishment of the intermediate procedures to obtain cross-border enforcement of judgments will make this possible. This will avoid costs and delays, whilst maintaining the necessary safeguards to ensure, for instance, the rights of the defence. Therefore, I welcome Parliament’s support for this measure in this respect. Concerning the amendments on the rights of the child to be heard in the proceedings, I take note of Parliament’s wish for their to be common minimum standards at EU level – to be proposed by the Commission – such as referring to the practical arrangements of the hearing. We have carefully assessed such a possibility.  However, given that the existing rules and practices in Member States in this area are extremely divergent, we find it more efficient to rely on existing standards laid down in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, to which all Member States have already subscribed. Therefore, I hope to have this particular rule accepted in the final version of the new instrument.  As you all know, strengthening the rights of the child is a top priority for the Commission. Our proposal in this area will ensure that children are given an opportunity to be heard in legal proceedings concerning them. Mutual recognition of Member States’ practices in this respect will avoid refusals at the recognition or enforcement stage, thus allowing true circulation of judgments in the European Union.  For the sake of efficiency and in order to avoid overlaps we have not included specific rules on mediation for conflicts between parents, as requested by Parliament. The existing Mediation Directive already covers efficient mediation mechanisms in these situations and foresees support for parents in resolving their conflicts. Finally, I have noticed that Parliament’s amendments focus also on close cooperation between Member States’ authorities. Here again, we speak with one voice. Central authorities are the direct interface with parents and should play a key role in supporting judges in applying the regulation. The report and the proposed amendments reflect the need for more efficient cooperation.

What we are discussing today is a sensitive issue that has a direct impact on thousands of citizens, particularly children living across the EU. So it is our duty to ensure that both children and parents who act in good faith are protected. There are too many cases of international child abduction by one of the parents for us not to act, and our guiding principle is that child abduction is detrimental to the fundamental rights of any child, wherever he or she is.  It is a fact that the world we are living in is changing, and family law issues also change because family law issues that, before, were exclusively dealt with within national states now require international application. As international relationships and marriages increase, so do international custody disputes. In the Committee on Petitions we deal with cases of parents being deprived of their children, illegally taken away from them by the other parent, and that is why we believe that any proposal has to be more effective and ensure the best interests of the child.  This is precisely why we need to close all loopholes and make sure that the regulation is not interpreted in a way that favours the parent responsible for the wrongful removal of a child. We need to make sure that the court of the Member State of origin of the child is the one that takes the final decision in this respect. And we have to reduce, if not eliminate, forum shopping and ensure the interests of both parents are protected and, most importantly, reduce any possible harm to the children involved. I believe that this is the only way through which we can ensure effective judicial protection of the fundamental rights of children across the EU, wherever they are.

Mr Svoboda just mentioned it: far more people than before are living together and are aware of these achievements of the European Union, of European citizenship. Of course, there is also a downside: not all marriages that are concluded are successful in the end. When I was the mediator of the European Parliament, I saw the suffering of the children who are affected by child abduction, and I have to say that these are not nice stories to be witnessed. That is why I was very pleasantly surprised to find that the European Commission had taken up a large number of the proposals that I was drafting at the time to improve the law in this area and incorporated them into the draft. That is a good thing. In particular, there must be better cooperation between the courts and the authorities, faster cooperation, because the longer such proceedings last, the worse it becomes, especially for the children. And the legal certainty associated with it is also required. Another area that is extremely important is hearing the children. We have to ensure that the rights they have under the UN resolution are actually realized. We have to ensure that children can be heard in a child-friendly way, in their own language, but also in such a way that they can be asked in a protected setting and not in a room that can be very impossible for children, such as a courtroom is. We have to be very careful that the framework conditions are correct and also acceptable for the children. Another point - and I am very grateful to Mr Zwiefka for that, as we worked very well together - is the question of mediation. Yes, we have regulations on mediation in the European Union, but they are not yet sufficient. The It is not enough if we see that the courts do not take advantage of the possibilities that exist. We have to ensure that less well-off parents in particular do not have to bear the associated costs alone, because the very questions that have to be asked - this mediation - can lead to - as you, Mr Zwiefka, rightly said - Costs are saved because the procedures can be faster, such procedures may not even be necessary, and are also better for the parents and for the children concerned. So a very important question. However, I still have to address one last point, and we could not agree on that, Mr Zwiefka and I simply disagreed, and unfortunately neither has Parliament so far: it is the question of registered partnerships. I cannot understand why the children from registered partnerships in which there are problems do not have the same rights as the children from marriages.

Therefore, this revision of this Regulation is welcome to be able to improve legal certainty, to be more effective, to be able to bet on mediation, to be able to bet on a harmonious resolution and, above all, to protect itself, without any doubt, the interest of the minor, which is what concerns us in this case.

Unfortunately, this is not the case in our Europe.

The rules have many times today been characterized by confusion, legal uncertainty and unnecessary delays. For me and for my political group, it has been very important to put the children first in the first room, and then the children must have a say.

I believe that our proposals will contribute to better protecting the interests of children in the procedures for determining or withdrawing parental responsibility and in the event of divorce or separation of their parents, as well as in cases of child abduction in the Union. In this reform, strengthening cooperation between Member States' central authorities is key. The issue of equal treatment of the parties in divorce proceedings and in the deprivation of parental responsibility is also important. In the case of international couples, each country must be fully and promptly informed of all measures taken in a language it fully understands. The most important point of our proposals, however, concerns the consistency in the upbringing of the child, his ethnic origin, religion, culture and language. In particular, in cases of long-term placement of a child, the authorities should always consider accommodation with relatives and family members, even if they live in another country. It must be ensured that the child's parents and relatives can, regardless of their place of residence, have a regular personal relationship with him.

The abolition of proceedings for a declaration of enforceability of judgments given in all areas covered by the Regulation will also help to strengthen this mutual trust and shorten the whole court procedure.

This will improve the lives of a very great number of people. Today when you make a copy of a book, in an EU country, into a format that blind people can read, you are mostly not allowed to bring it across a national border because that’s the way copyright is constructed. But the Marrakesh Treaty, which is a UN Treaty, seeks to liberate those books so that they can be shared freely all over the world, or at least in all the countries that have ratified the Marrakesh Treaty. This will make life better for many of the 285 million beneficiaries of this treaty, who will get access to a lot more books that they can read, and access to better educational opportunities. While this will be good for blind people inside the EU, the greatest benefit will be for blind people in those countries – especially countries where they speak English or French or Spanish or Portuguese – where access to books today is very poor by comparison with rich countries such as those in the Union. Those readers will have access to books that are already available inside the EU. So this is a great step forward and it is going to happen quite soon, hopefully in September once we ratify the treaty. It has made possible partly by the work of the European Parliament, which has been fighting for this treaty for very many years. Of course, not only the European Parliament has been fighting for it: we have been working together with blind people’s organisations and with libraries, as well as a great number of concerned citizens all over the world, to make this possible. It has not always been easy. Some Member States were, let’s say, more protective of their publishing interests than they were interested in standing up for the rights of blind people, and they were very cautious, very reluctant, but we are argued them down. This is a huge step forward. What is the next step once we ratify this treaty? Well, in many Member States in the EU today there are discussions about how to implement the treaty, and some governments are considering compensation schemes – a possibility that is, in fact, allowed – to compensate publishers for the income that they will lose when blind people do not buy their books because they can get them freely through libraries with the help of the Marrakesh Treaty. I do not really understand why compensation schemes are necessary but some Member States insisted on them. I would just like to remind those governments that the implementation provisions include rules to make sure that compensation schemes which have to be paid for by libraries and blind people’s organisations shall not be an excessive burden on them. I think I speak for many people in this Chamber when I say to the governments who are considering how to implement the treaty that we will be watching them.

The Marrakesh Treaty aims to substantially improve access to books, journals and other printed texts for persons who are blind, visually impaired or who have other disabilities that prevent them from reading in the same way as persons without those disabilities. This objective is very important. Even today, too few print materials can be accessed by people with brain disabilities worldwide. Addressing this problem is fundamental for social inclusion and social advancement. Doing so will benefit people with brain disabilities, and it will benefit everybody else. The Marrakesh Treaty has been an important priority for the Commission for a long time, and we would like to support the statements made by the rapporteur of this file, Mr Andersson. Together with the adoption by the European Union of the directive and regulation implementing the Marrakesh Treaty into the EU’s legal framework on 13 September 2017, the ratification of the Treaty means that the European Union will soon be in a position to participate in the exchange of books and other print materials in formats accessible for the beneficiaries, as envisioned by the Treaty.

I would like to thank my colleague Max Andersson from the Green Group, who has led the negotiations, and the rest of all colleagues involved, because this is a historic debate and a historic vote that will take place.

Across the EU, the figure is 30 million people and globally it is 285 million. These have the right to accessibility and deserve more opportunities for talking books, Braille books or visual interpretations in different languages. It is a prerequisite for democratic participation and the opportunity to be culturally involved and be able to take part in the cultural debate and the offer.

For the first time in EU history, copyright exemptions are now being harmonized at EU level for those in great need. It's not a day too early. The EU's ratification of the Marrakesh Treaty has long been extremely important in order to give blind, visually impaired and other people with reading or visual difficulties the right to read literature and visual interpretation in different languages. Due to some opposition from some EU countries, we have during the negotiations been concerned about how the proposal could be diluted and not provide sufficient access to books for the visually impaired. However, the agreement from 13 September is generally good, which we are very happy about. Therefore, I would urge all Member States to really make sure to transpose national laws in this area as soon as possible, so that books and e-books can be transferred to readable media for the visually impaired without cumbersome copyright fees.

In other words, the opportunities and the world as such presented to people with visual impairments are much narrower than for others. Not only because they cannot access the same number of books as others but also because books are a key to education.  I am a firm believer, as are most of my colleagues in this House, in equal opportunities for everybody. Two years ago my committee, the Committee on Petitions, put forward a resolution on this topic urging the Member States to ratify the Marrakech Treaty. Tomorrow this House has an absolutely unique power to greatly improve equality by voting in favour of the Marrakech Treaty. This will not only be a big step towards increasing the variety of books translated into Braille but also towards equal opportunities.  Sadly, the world is not at all fair. Fair education for all is a faraway dream for too many. Rich countries have lots of books and smaller numbers of visually impaired persons. Poor countries, on the other hand, suffer from the opposite: they have too many blind people and visually impaired people and too few books. The aim of the Marrakech Treaty is to bridge this gap.  On the other hand, protection of intellectual property is crucial.

They called the access of blind people to books, and I quote, ‘an unbalanced privilege’. It is not a privilege: it is a human right enshrined in the Convention on Rights of People with Disabilities, the right of equal access to information and culture.

Persons who are blind, visually impaired or otherwise print-disabled sadly continue to face many barriers in accessing books and other print materials which are protected by copyright and related rights. Adopted in 2013, the Marrakesh Treaty, which allows for copyright exceptions to facilitate the creation of accessible versions of books and other copyrighted works for visually impaired persons was a landmark move to enable visually impaired people to access books with the same ease as sighted readers. Whilst working as the shadow rapporteur in the Committee on Culture and Education for this file, I consulted with a wide cross-section of stakeholders:  disability experts, NGOs working on disability issues and representatives from the author and publisher fields, who were largely in agreement with each other and stressed the importance of the speedy ratification of the treaty.

When visiting reception centres in Sicily, I was told by doctors that there was not a single women or girl who had not been raped on her way to Europe. Their stories are devastating. You can read them on their bodies. The time has come for the Anti-Trafficking Directive to be fully enforced by all Member States. Trafficking is a high-profit and low-cost business, at the expense of women and girls. We call on the Member States to do more to combat impunity and protect victims, to increase police and judicial cooperation, including with Europol, Eurojust and third countries, to ensure that traffickers are brought to justice, to combat demand for prostitution and online abuse, criminalise sex buyers and track their money, confiscate assets of criminal organisations and build trust with the victims, making them feel safe. They must provide psychological support and access to reproductive health services, allocate the necessary resources and support the anti-trafficking coordinator.  We must also make sure that Member States implement the Directive on Victims’ Rights. What is happening in Libya is totally unacceptable in modern times. It is a new slavery. The EU and the Member States must urgently act to deal with Libya and the trafficking routes, taking into account the gender dimension. From the Balkans to Western Europe, from the Mediterranean to the North Sea, there should be no hiding place for traffickers.

In the advanced Europe of the 21st century, there are more than five hundred thousand women and girls who cross our borders annually at the hands of mafias and organized criminal groups. We could put names and surnames, faces, to these deceived women and forced into prostitution. Women and girls threatened with murdering their families contract a debt that they must pay in the brothels where they work. They work in brothels, they create a debt, they pay the money to these mafias. Customers' money that ends up in the pockets of the mafias and criminals. I repeat: customer money that ends up in the pockets of criminals. I say this because there are still those who, naively or intentionally, say that this prostitution is an exercise in freely deciding what one wants to do with one's life.

And we must also talk about another issue, and that is labor exploitation.

Both situations, sexually exploited women and those exploited at work, have a common denominator: vulnerable women who suffer. For this reason, the European Commission and the Member States have to implement a strategy against trafficking in women and against trafficking in women and girls.

More mobility of workers is an often expressed wish in Europe, because a lack of mobility is one of the limitations of the internal market. In some areas, however, we have more mobility than one would assume and than one could wish for. I have recently been intensively involved in reports of thousands of women who work as modern slaves in agricultural areas in Sicily. These women are barely paid for hard work, even if they toil twelve hours a day in scorching heat. Police reports speak of around 7,500 women, mostly from Romania, who are kept as modern slaves under these circumstances. Unfortunately, we all know that these official numbers represent only the tip of the iceberg for victims of abuse and exploitation. When these women should come to rest after a stressful day, another form of abuse is often waiting for them: sexual harassment - or exploitation - by the landowner, the employment agency, their acquaintances or friends. We have to face the fact and really look each other in the eye and say: Modern slavery exists! Not thousands of kilometers away on other continents, but in the middle of us in the European Union - and not only in Italy, but also in other Member States.

Commissioner Avramopoulos! You know that we have been asking for a strategy for a long time without the Commission delivering one. You have now presented a list of measures. That is of course welcome, but let's be honest: a list of actions is not a strategy. It is not as binding, not as forward-looking and not as systematic. Nevertheless, I would like to make some recommendations regarding the measures presented by the Commission. The main human trafficking in Europe is about women and girls bought by men in the prostitution market. It is therefore welcome that the Commission is finally doing something to criminalize those who expose and exploit victims of trafficking. I read from the Commission: \"The Commission will encourage Member States to criminalize those who knowingly use the services of victims of trafficking in women or victims of trafficking.\" The problem, Commission, is that if you have someone who is knowledgeable, if you have to prove that someone is knowledgeable, then you make it difficult for those who are to prosecute. We have the most successful examples from countries that have gone further. Sweden, France, Norway, Iceland and Ireland have been most successful in combating trafficking in women. Prohibit the purchase of sexual services. It is 2018, it is time to put an end to the patriarchal notion that men can buy women and girls, that women can be bought and sold. It's simply passé. In Sweden, there has been a #metoo for those who have been exploited in prostitution and trafficking in women, against the abuse of power and exploitation that takes place there. I must also say to the Commission that I nevertheless encourage and welcome the support for women who are exploited in prostitution that you present in the list of measures and the increased support for children. But we must realize that if we do nothing for the demand, for those who buy and exploit women and girls in the prostitution industry, we will stand still and stomp. That may be the end of it.

According to data from the European Commission, 76% of the victims are women; 15% minors; from 2013 to 2014, almost 16,000 victims were registered and there were only around 3,000 convictions for trafficking. In any case, we know that the cases of trafficking today must be more than double or triple the registered numbers, because the majority of cases obviously escape the statistics. We also know that the current migration and refugee crisis is being used by trafficking mafias to identify the most vulnerable people, mainly women and girls, abusing asylum seekers who want to reach Europe or who are already in European refugee camps. . Sixteen thousand five hundred unaccompanied children entered Greece, Italy, Bulgaria and Spain during the first six months of 2017 and currently they clearly have a high chance of falling into trafficking networks. IOM has also reported a dramatic increase in the number of Nigerian women and girls who have fallen victim to human trafficking, the vast majority for the purposes of sexual exploitation. From January to September 2017 alone, 4,371 Nigerian women and girls marching from Libya identified themselves as victims of trafficking for sexual exploitation. And here too I would like to recall that, on November 6, twenty-six women and girls of the same nationality were murdered by their mafias when they tried to reach the Italian coast. We must react now to this terrible and intolerable reality, and we believe that the European Commission must act.

On the contrary, the data shows us a drastic increase. As we know, in this submerged world of human trafficking, women and girls are the main victims. The Commission has in fact recorded that 76% of the victims are women, 15% of which are minors, victims of torturers who forcefully bring them to Europe, promising them a better world and a better life. Once they reach our borders, they find themselves living a nightmare far worse than the one they left in their homelands, joining the ranks of sexual exploitation or illegal work, managed by criminal organizations. According to some UNODC data every year, in Europe, criminal groups earn 3 billion dollars thanks to the trafficking of human beings for the sole purpose of sexual exploitation. We are well aware that trafficking in human beings is often closely linked to the migratory crisis that is affecting the European Union from the east and south of the Mediterranean, particularly Italy and Greece. Does the Commission intend to take specific measures to deal with this crisis or does it want to leave the whole burden on these states? Isn't it worth stepping up investigative efforts at borders to put a stop to this shame? Finally, I find myself forced to remind the Commission that the Union is not only the destination of choice for criminal organizations; in many cases the Union is also the place of origin of the trade in human beings because, as we know, there are very many young women from the poorest Member States who are forced into prostitution in the least affected states from the crisis.The humanitarian emergency we are facing is therefore made even more serious by the worsening of the economic imbalances within the Union and organized crime is not the only enemy towards which to take a decisive position.Poverty is now endemic within many Member States: it is an equally dangerous enemy, an invisible ally of organized crime acting silently from within our borders.We can't take it any longer, it's time to stop this.We are all here, once again, asking what concrete actions the Commission intends to take to tackle the problem.There is a need for zero tolerance, as has already been said, against trafficking in human beings because, as we know, it represents a form of slavery which is in stark contrast to the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 354, "date": "2018-01-17.json", "name": "Dimitris Avramopoulos", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, let me start by expressing my thanks to our colleagues from all political families here who have initiated this debate here today. It is a very timely one and it is about an issue, as we all know, of high sensitivity, at the top of the interests of our citizens. Again, my thanks to this House for its continuous active interest and support in our joint fight against this odious phenomenon. I am sure that we will all agree in this room that when dealing with trafficking in human beings what really counts is actions and results, more than intentions and words. The modern ‘slave markets’ in Libya and elsewhere, where human beings are bought and sold as cheap commodities, will not be stopped if we do not act now.  The ruthless sick minds who take advantage of innocent children – girls and boys – or hopeless and vulnerable adults – women and men – will continue to make astronomical profits if we do not stop them now. The pain from the torture and the indelible damage on the victims’ bodies and souls will not be repaired if we do not protect and take care of them now.  Unfortunately, the situation, as you all know, is neither new, nor does it happen only in unstable countries. Trafficking also happens right here in Europe. As is rightly pointed out in your question, there is a strong gender dimension in this picture, while the available data does not capture the real magnitude of this phenomenon. It is also true that these desperate human beings are usually exploited for sexual or labour purposes. Therefore, what is needed now is exactly to focus on the specific characteristics of this crime and tackle them with the proper tools.  Let us be frank, however. The real fight against trafficking in human beings is not being fought here, by the European Union institutions. It is on the ground, and it is Member States’ authorities that need to deliver, where needed by joint efforts. Obviously the Commission will continue supporting efforts in these operational endeavours. A demonstrative example of joint efforts can be seen in the information provided by Europol. From 2016 until early December 2017, 2 476 new human trafficking cases were referred to Europol; 10 664 potential victims were registered, the majority of whom were EU nationals; 10 449 suspects have been signalled in its database, the majority of whom again were EU nationals. All these years, through an ambitious and progressive approach, we have managed in the European Union to create a solid legal and policy framework which has brought Europe to the frontline of global efforts. Now it is time, on the one hand, to fully implement and enforce our strong and modern legal armoury, and, on the other hand, to step up our efforts with targeted and focused actions.  My personal commitment, my personal aim, is to bring tangible results, to be as much as possible operational, to make a difference on the ground. This is the reason why last December, as you will remember, I presented a list of further concrete measures to step up our action to disrupt the modus operandi of traffickers, to strengthen victims’ rights and protection, to intensify internal and external efforts in a coordinated manner, and to widen our knowledge base and provide targeted financial support. We will monitor progress on the actions set out and will report on progress to this House and the Council already by the end of 2018. EU-wide updated statistical data on this phenomenon will also be made available in the next Progress Report in 2018, including on: gender dimension, children affected and forms of exploitation. We are now examining very closely how Member States comply with the EU Anti-trafficking Directive and we will not hesitate to initiate infringement procedures, if needed. On labour inspections, the Commission will come soon with the second report on the implementation of the Employers’ Sanction Directive. Moreover, gender plays a pivotal role in our new set of actions. In this respect, we will work closely with the European Institute for Gender Equality to deliver practical guidance to Member States on how to implement the provisions of the Anti-trafficking Directive on assistance and protection from a gender perspective. In terms of resources allocated and funding on the gender dimension, the Commission’s Comprehensive Policy Review (2016) demonstrated that almost 20% of funded projects were gender-specific in the period between 2004 and 2015. Future funding priorities by the Commission will ensure that the gender dimension is duly addressed. In that respect, the last call under the Internal Security Fund and Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund places priority on the gender dimension. Finally, the next Progress Report will also provide an update on the EU-wide progress made at investigative efforts, based on Member States’ information covering the period between 2015 and 2017.

In the world out of a thousand people, three are slaves, over a quarter are minors. Around the world, six to ten million children are forced into forced labor, sexually trafficked or segregated as slaves. In our very civilized Europe, according to data provided by the European Commission, 79% of the victims of trafficking are destined for prostitution and sexual exploitation. This is not the first time in this House that we have been debating and condemning traffickers and looking for the measures that can be taken to protect the victims, but if there were no demand there would be no market. We need homogeneous and rigorous European legislation, which would allow us to prosecute traffickers and clients in every corner of our Union. The Commission must be the bearer of this request and increase, with agencies such as Europol, all investigative efforts in those countries where exploitation is much more widespread. We are in 2018 and there are still sex slaves.

Women and girls are the main victims and the visit that the Socialist and Democratic Group has made to Sicily in the field of agriculture has given us a glaring example of this modern slavery. Of course, Sicily is not the only place where this slavery takes place. Romanian women are not the only victims in Europe either. The networks of Nigerian minors in prostitution in Brussels are another example. We often talk about the exploitation of sex, but there is also exploitation by companies, simply because they have an interest in making short-term profits by paying their workers as little as possible. So what I am asking is that if we work on the issue of sex exploitation - which is important, of course, in human trafficking - we must also empower European companies which today hui exploit these people, whether it is in tomato cultivation, apple picking or other activities, simply because they want to sell products at lower prices in supermarkets, without any scruple.

National Crime Agency statistics estimate that, in the United Kingdom alone, there are tens of thousands of victims of this horrific crime.

The bill gives much-needed support to victims with regard to compensation, providing ‘trafficking guardians’ for children who have been victims, and support up to and after criminal investigations.

The disappearance of children is a cruel reality of modern day slavery. In 2015, 10 000 migrant children went missing within Europe according to Europol, all with the prospect of a better life but instead headed for a life of domestic servitude, sexual exploitation or child marriage. We are letting down these victims, leaving them vulnerable and open to being trafficked and abused. How have we let this terrible violation of human dignity worsen? Criminalised gangs are taking advantage of the EU’s open borders and exploiting women and children for vast sums of money. Victims are used as mere pawns in the game of crime. Each victim is disposable and easily replaceable to the criminals. To them one death is nothing on the profitability of their enslavement.  The Commission must grasp that free movement of people is exacerbating the problem, failing the victims and aiding the criminals. As the EU prohibits the UK from conducting criminal background checks on EU citizens, it is no wonder that crime has escalated. Migrant children could start in Greece and end up in France without being tracked. This is not a simple matter, but each time we debate this nothing is resolved.

Since 2016, the EU has been completely without a strategy for human trafficking. This is despite the fact that Commissioner Avramopoulos has repeatedly promised and assured that a strategy is under way. Instead, on 5 December, the Commission chose to present a so-called communication on trafficking in human beings, a document that will hardly make as much of a difference as a strategy. I am very disappointed and angry that the Commission has chosen to act in this way. I have been working on the issue of human trafficking for over a decade in the European Parliament and have constantly met with opposition. It is astonishing that there are so many who do not realize the seriousness of the crimes that human trafficking entails. Trafficking in human beings is a cross-border activity and requires cross-border solutions and a strategy. If we lower the level of ambition in the issue, we will send signals to the Member States that the EU prioritises other things and that the perpetrators can continue to commit crimes and abuses. In terms of signaling, it is very important that the EU acts vigorously. For human trafficking in the EU, avalanches are increasing. The human suffering that results from human trafficking requires that we constantly prioritize the fight against the perpetrators. We must criminalize the use of services from victims of trafficking in the EU. We must fight demand. The principle of following the money should be used in the cross-border police work. The protection of victims of trafficking in human beings must also increase, both during and after the legal process.

As you will remember, it was launched at the European Culture Forum in Milan on 7 December 2017, in the presence of a vibrant crowd of 800 participants from a wide range of cultural organisations: UNESCO, the Council of Europe, the Member States and the European institutions. We were joined by the Estonian Presidency, the Committee of the Regions and the European Parliament. We were honoured by the presence and active participation of the European Parliament’s President, Mr Antonio Tajani, the Chair of the Committee on Culture and Education, Ms Petra Kammevert, and Ms Sylvia Costa, who led the European Parliament’s negotiating team on the decision for the year. I would like to warmly express my thanks to all of them, including the European Parliament’s rapporteur, Mr Mircea Diaconu, for the decisive role they played in making this European Year of Cultural Heritage happen. The European Year of Cultural Heritage comes at a particularly decisive moment in the history of our Union. It comes at a time when the European Union is grappling with issues that go to the very heart of the values it stands for, and that will have a bearing on how the Union will evolve. The European Year of Cultural Heritage also comes at a time when culture is high on the European Union’s agenda. In Gothenburg last November, the European heads of state and government discussed the important role of education and culture in strengthening people’s sense of belonging to a cultural community. As a contribution to this debate, the Commission issued a Communication on strengthening European identity through education and culture, which proposed, among other things, to strengthen the European agenda for culture. In December, the European Council followed up, recognising the importance of the 2018 European Year of Cultural Heritage. Indeed, the European Year of Cultural Heritage offers us a unique opportunity. By engaging with our cultural memory, we can better understand and raise awareness of the many cultural influences on which our identities are based and we can develop our vision for the future. We can reconnect our citizens with their roots as Europeans, while respecting and cherishing the values created by different communities. This is the message we want to pass on, with the motto of the year: ‘our heritage: where the past meets the future’. So, what have we done so far to put this year in motion? First, we have mobilised a wide network of civil society and heritage operators who are helping us to implement the year on the ground. We have also mobilised Member States. We each have a dedicated national coordinator for the year and have national and regional programmes of activities. We have been working very closely with the European Parliament, listening to you and involving you in all our stakeholder meetings. We have launched a specific call for proposals under the Creative Europe programme, to fund transnational cooperation projects in the field of cultural heritage. We have developed synergies with existing initiatives in the field of cultural heritage, in particular the European heritage days, the EU prize for cultural heritage and the European heritage label. All these are fully involved in the European Year, and we have established a committee of stakeholders involving 35 heritage, cultural and youth networks, selected through the voices of a structured dialogue framework on culture. Furthermore, Commission departments have joined forces to top up the Year’s dedicated budget with additional projects funded through regular funds. In the case of research, for example, this has led to over EUR 100 million of investment in cultural heritage. Finally, we have launched a communication campaign to give high visibility to our actions. The website is up and running in 24 languages, in addition to a video, leaflets, a very active social media strategy and a newsletter which goes to 4 000 stakeholders. But the year has only just started. A wide array of activities and events lie ahead. We are now putting the final touches to ten major initiatives at European level, organised around four pillars: engagement, protection, sustainability and innovation. We have an ambitious programme, comprising over 100 European-level events and around 2 000 national and regional events during the year. These are designed to resonate far beyond the year itself. It is only in the light of its long-term impact that we will be able to judge the year’s success. A successful year will help us to better protect and manage tangible and intangible testimonies from our past and ensure that our fellow Europeans become increasingly aware of the value of cultural heritage for our identity and for our future. I know the Commission can count on this House’s support and active participation to turn this vision into reality. Cultural heritage makes us Europeans. Our heritage makes Europe meaningful, so I believe that this is a project we all endorse and uphold, because in these difficult times, in this existential moment for Europe, culture is one of the pillars of our existence.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 385, "date": "2018-01-17.json", "name": "Bogdan Andrzej ZDROJEWSKI", "mepid": "124893", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - Culture as a priority - it sounds good, but the implementation is much worse.

I am preparing a report on barriers to participation in culture and I have also dealt with heritage. I would like to say that the latest data show that only 30% of Europeans regularly visit a museum or see monuments at least once a year. Once a year! 80% are proud of their cultural heritage, but do not touch it or participate in it. If we ask why this is so, there are three answers. First - lack of time, second - costs and third - lack of information. What is a heritage year for, what should be the purpose Well, firstly - to improve information on European heritage, and secondly - to increase participation in culture by removing the barriers that residents themselves feel. If only 30% of Europeans visit or visit a museum year after year, and as many as 80% of them have a museum or monuments under their noses, very close, it means that the effort that should be made is only made and only in the so-called minimum.

You mentioned four thousand players. And my question is: have you also addressed the Christian churches that built Europe? Europe is known for its cathedrals - Strasbourg also has one huge cathedral - and they are architectural gems. Ladies and gentlemen, colleagues, let me say, however, that none of those cathedrals was built for itself. The intention is - the building was to represent respect for God. Culture is based on values. Christianity, that is, faith in God, is clearly the spiritual heritage of Europe. I feel that this year of cultural heritage is neglected. Colleague Zdrojewski said that only this late this plenary is devoted to culture, but I would add that we cannot mention respect for God and the upliftment of the soul.

The first reaction was that we were violating the treaties - a disaster. In the end we all argued and we managed to achieve this, that's why we are all together. My argument then was the following: it is a year of great importance, we must all be together for this holiday, for this open museum, a huge museum for 27 countries, open for a year, symbolically speaking, to which we must we know each other, to display what we have best and most representative of our national identity in front of each other and others.

I will be very interested in how the young generation, those who have not yet been involved, will be involved and use the budget that was eventually approved at 8 000 000. As a Member of Parliament, I therefore personally support the support of regional initiatives, which are being developed, for example, in my region. It will be an exhibition of works of art Broken Time in Olomouc and also a conference on the birth of a modern Central European in Kroměříž, where we will commemorate the years 1848 and 1918. An educational project for the creative involvement of young people from 4 countries was also presented.

But this also means that 2018 must not be limited to being a mere juxtaposition of national, primarily cultural navel-gazing initiatives. European cooperation must be in the foreground. The year must not degenerate into a flash in the pan. The European project needs a fresh boost. To limit oneself to a common internal market and consumer rights is not enough. What we need is a deeper European cultural and educational policy so that citizens can continue to identify with the EU in the future. The Year of Cultural Heritage must be shaped by a spirit of European coexistence and the common values ​​that unite us all, and this spirit must reach everyone - no matter where and how they live, no matter how old they are. It also needs to send out stronger political signals.

I remember Hegel writing: \"Minerva's owl begins its flight at dusk\"; that is, it does not seem inappropriate to me. But that said, I am very pleased that the European institutions have proclaimed 2018 as the European Year of Cultural Heritage and that the Council of Europe, Unesco and Europa Nostra collaborate in this initiative, among others. European history and culture have been profoundly dynamic, beyond compare. And today we have a truly exceptional cultural heritage. I would like that by the end of 2018 an ambitious program or action plan of the Union for cultural heritage could be launched that would serve in the future to preserve and disseminate it. Indeed, this year 2018 should not be limited to a set of events or meetings during these twelve months, but should have continuity, Commissioner. And so I would like that idea of ​​the action plan. One year of paying attention to our heritage is not enough for me. I think that this action plan should even contemplate the creation of a specific fund or budget line for the Union to contribute to the recovery and preservation of cultural heritage, for example, of important architectural ensembles in the Member States. Now that we talk about the future financial perspectives, why not think about an item like that? I know that these actions are often co-financed through European funds for regional development, but a specific item would give greater visibility. It is not only peace, it is not only the economy, it is not only globalization that is the argument that justifies the European Union today. It is also the common historical cultural substrate that is reflected in this brilliant cultural heritage. Therefore, the Union must also help to preserve it. The legal basis for it?

Let us not forget that Europe is visited by millions of tourists every year precisely because of the rich way of life and culture. I hope that the placement of this topic in the public space will not pass together with 2018, but will start a serious debate on the funds allocated for culture in the next multiannual financial framework.

I think that it is through culture that we can strengthen our European belonging and thus fight against anti-European sentiments, against separatism, against nationalism.

To be frank with you, I would prefer to see more people in the Chamber today. You who are present here have proven your strong interest in, and support for, the European Year of Cultural Heritage.  Our cultural heritage forms our identity, which is naturally rooted in the national and local context, but which also transcends borders to form and strengthen a European identity. Our cultures have common denominators, such as common democratic values, common principles and, most importantly, a common cultural consciousness, which will define our common European cultural future. With full respect for our national cultures, we can build the pillars of our common cultural architecture for the years to come. I am sure that many events that will be happening throughout the year will successfully spread this message. In this context, I would urge you to become ambassadors of the Year by making its ideas and activities widely known amongst European citizens and participating in events, be it at European, national or local level. The Commission will continue working with you as one of our principal partners of the Year. More than the economy, what will define the future of our union is our common cultural identity, which will guide us towards our common future as genuine believers in the European ideal. We can be, in a very harmonious way, proud of our national heritage, and we can be Europeans in our spirit and consciousness.

However, these should not obscure the financing needs for the renovation of old buildings, while public funds are becoming scarce. The situation is particularly critical in France, exacerbated by the State's withdrawal from local finances. Thus, between 2003 and 2007, the proportion of monuments in a defective state of conservation rose from 32% to 41%, the crisis accentuating this trend. The awareness-raising actions deployed as part of the Heritage Year cannot therefore take the place of a real promotion effort, especially since the Eurobarometer of December 7, 2017 shows that the importance given to heritage is mostly shared by Europeans.
