This year it comes at a particularly difficult time. On behalf of all of us at the Court, I would like to express our deepest condolences to the French people and to the families of the victims of the recent terrorist attacks in Paris. Those who attack European values are actually attacking our democracy. We must all stand firm against them. This is a time for European solidarity, to defend the fundamental values in our Treaty. It is a time when the European Union and Member States must also address other major challenges: generating jobs and growth; meeting energy needs while achieving climate goals; and managing asylum and migration flows. In our view, the European budget could be invested better and more quickly to meet the many challenges Europe faces. Taken together, our audit results over recent years point to a need for a wholly new approach: decision-makers must align the budget better with the European Union’s long-term strategic priorities and make it more capable of responding in a crisis; legislators need to ensure that spending schemes are clear about the results to be achieved and the risk it is acceptable to take; financial managers have to ensure that the money spent complies with the rules and achieves the intended results. Next year’s mid-term review of the Multiannual Financial Framework provides a crucial opportunity to rethink our priorities and the design of some spending schemes. In the meantime, more must be done with the tools already in place. Our report identifies long-standing financial management issues that need to be addressed. But before I go through them, I would like to be absolutely clear that the 2014 European Union accounts have been signed off. They are reliable and we have issued a clean audit opinion to that effect. That said, let me highlight four areas of European Union financial management requiring attention. First, too much money is still not spent in accordance with the European Union’s financial rules. There is a persistently high level of payment errors. The overall estimated error rate for payments in 2014 was 4.4%, and it has been stable for the last three years. The Commission and Member States have made progress in recent years in preventing and correcting errors, but more errors could have been corrected if all the available information had been used. Our analysis shows that there is scope to design spending schemes that are less error—prone, in particular by simplifying payment conditions and procedures. Second, the performance of the budget. The European Union must invest the budget better. We found that the Multiannual Financial Framework could be better aligned with the EU’s strategy, both in terms of periods and priorities. We also highlight the fact that the high level of European Union targets and political aims is not translated into clear operational objectives, which is fundamental for effective management and reporting on performance. Third, the European Union needs to deal with a number of financial backlogs that have built up, not least to free up funds so that they can be used where they are needed most. In particular, some Member States are struggling to absorb the EU funds they have been allocated, and there continues to be a high level of unused funds in financial instruments. Finally, European Union financial management would strongly benefit from improved transparency, because this is crucial to ensuring citizens’ trust. We have recommended the action the Commission should take to improve transparency about long—term cash flow needs, payment errors and corrections made, as well as the results of spending the European Union budget. But it is equally important to ensure transparency for European Union policies not directly funded from the European Union budget. New ways of funding European Union policies should not put financial risks beyond public scrutiny and audit. To conclude, the European Union must invest its money better. It must act to ensure that its investments better match the European Union’s priorities; that simpler rules are framed to achieve results; and that financial resources are managed more efficiently. Taken together, all this would indeed represent a wholly new approach. The Court of Auditors stands alongside Parliament and the other European institutions at this very difficult time. Defending our democracy and ensuring the well—being of our citizens will place a great burden on our common resources. Helping to ensure that those resources are used to their best effect will continue to be the principal task of the European Court of Auditors.

It helps us to use our taxpayers’ money better. I fully agree with the call by President Caldeira for a new approach, and it is what we have embraced in the Commission with our strategy on a results-focused budget. We have made progress on financial management, and the Court has recognised that our accounts are in order by signing them for an eighth year in a row. They are modern, they are up to standard, and we thank the Court for the work it has done that helped us to stabilise the error rate and, indeed, to reduce it slightly. That is a trend that we must pursue in the future. However, we also recognise there is more work to be done, and I would like to focus my response on the four points that President Caldeira made. Firstly, we have work to do on bringing the error rate down further by improving the quality of first-level checks, by continuing our simplification efforts – simpler rules mean fewer errors – and by further deepening work on the cost-effectiveness of checks. The Court tells us that we have a higher level in respect of schemes that reimburse costs, and a lower level in respect of entitlement programmes. We have to take this into account. Secondly, we fully agree with the Court about the importance of focusing on performance. We are in a very difficult time for the European Union, and every single euro matters. The Union has to work better for our people, and this is at the heart of the work we are doing on a results-focused budget. We will also continue combining performance and compliance. We believe that work we have started already on preventive and corrective action in relation to errors is bringing positive results: EUR 3.5 billion has been returned to the budget thanks to corrective action and preventive action that we have taken. We believe that, if we take into account the calculated residual error rate, we would be very close to the 2% that we strive to achieve. Thirdly, on financial backlogs. This was a priority issue in the discussion on the 2016 budget, and we are committed to bringing the backlog down to EUR 2 billion by the end of 2016 – to a sustainable level. And of course, work has to concentrate on the new programmes so we do not end up with the same problem three years down the road. Last but definitely not least: transparency is our taxpayers’ best friend, and we are committed to continuing to improve it. We are grateful to Parliament for recognising that we have made progress over this last year in terms of the transparency of our work, and we absolutely commit here to continuing that effort in the future.

In the previous financial year, we were still 3.4%.  As usual, we are again well above the 2% threshold. The sources of error also remain the same: procurement rules are disregarded, there is no evidence to support expenditure, and ineligible expenditure is incurred and so on. What interests me is that, as of 31.12.2014, the outstanding commitments amount to EUR 9 673 million, because we are still spending money from the 8th EDF, which was made available 20 years ago.

Diagnosis remains a serious diagnosis, because the sick person, who is our budget, has undergone and continues to be subjected to great difficulties: ever smaller; increasingly financialized, through financial instruments that, as we see, have an implementation problem and also control; under great strains because of their own resources, which are european in nature, but from resources of intergovernmental origin, which means that those who consider themselves owners of the resources can decide in a conjunctural manner on their fate; and also subject to delays and serious risks of non-payment, as the Court tells us. But the Court also tells us that there is hope, that is, it tells Parliament, the institutions — also the Commission, of course - that we need a new approach and that in 2017, in this review of the financial perspective, it is when we will be able to improve, with everything we have learned in recent years, and to ensure that the European budget ceases to be subject to totally conjunctural changes.

I consider this new approach to managing investment and expenditure to be very correct at European level. As rapporteur for the 2014 Discharge of the European Commission, I am heading in the same direction.  My first priority is to put emphasis on performance and on real economic effect, not just on the legal and formal accuracy of documents. We must strike a new balance between compliance with formalities and a stronger focus on results. I believe that the way European money is being managed should be viewed comprehensively and in context. After all, if this money is public, it must be subject to competent, objective and transparent scrutiny. The economy of the management of public resources is far from over by comparing the reality of the money spent with the rules formally adopted, on the contrary, it starts for me by finding out what each particular expenditure and its overall total has actually produced in a given period. My second priority is to help the Union meet its commitments and start presenting its achievements. We urgently need to stop just looking for missteps and shortcomings, but we also need to show examples of good practice that have high added value and can inspire us into the future.  My third priority is close cooperation with stakeholders across the Institutions of the European Union. The Annual Report of the European Court of Auditors talks in several places about the culture of performance as a quality necessary for the long-term sound financial management of public resources redistributed through the European Union budget. If we can achieve this culture of performance together and adopt its common understanding and understanding, I will consider my 2014 discharge target to be fulfilled.

Thank you to Mr Caldera and the Court of Auditors for the report. It is, of course, a gloomy report, which still shows that the number of errors is too high. This will undoubtedly be discussed in the Committee on Budgetary Control next year, where pressure will be put on the Commission and the Member States.  I would like to concentrate on a few other points. We all agree that the citizens of Europe want to know the results of European Union spending, and I am very much in favour of performance and results-oriented budgeting. But there are also some risks. First, it should not get bogged down in a system of indicators that makes Democrats happy, but which in reality only increase costs.  Secondly, European added value must be made clear in ordinary human language. Let me give one example: in its annual anti-fraud report, the European Commission, as one of the most important results of the Hercules III programme, reports that 55 conferences and seminars are being organised. This is fun for civil servants and useful for getting to know each other, but it does not make citizens in Europe happy. They want to know what the real results of these meetings are now. How does cooperation really improve and how can we measure it? A result must also be compared to all costs incurred. Would projects without European funding have also been achieved? Is money simply spent because it is there or was there an acute need? How much is the cost for local regional authorities, for example, to rake in projects? In Brussels, they have almost all of them lobbying firms. They cost money, too. Do we include these costs in determining European added value? Then there's a whole other point. The Court of Auditors is right to distinguish between errors and fraud. But if the proportion of serious errors in procurement increases from 0.8% to 1.2% in one year, then I wonder if there is no longer any work to be done here. Of course, contracting is a separate profession. However, is there no deliberate malversation here and should serious errors not be treated as fraud?", "language": "en", "original_language": "nl", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 8, "date": "2015-11-26.json", "name": "Bart STAES", "mepid": "4751", "text": "  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group.

However, like my colleague Bart Staes, I have to note many and too many irregularities, especially in the management of the Structural Funds.  We have seen from your reports, which over the years always have the same indications, such as the Member States, in this opaque management of funds, especially of the European Social Fund and the European Regional Development Fund, those funds that should give added value in our territories, prove to be opaque: contracts awarded directly and failure to publish procurement documentation. It is a system that has been going on for too long and there are too many billions at stake. At a time of crisis, it is absolutely essential to act and impose, in a certain sense, transparency measures on those who are not transparent.  On the question of the European Investment Bank, it should be noted that often the lack of transparency of contracts and subcontracting relating to infrastructure investments. The documentation on subcontracting must always be clear and transparent, because the European Investment Bank – which manages european citizens' money – cannot guarantee a return to unclear companies, which may also have links to organised crime.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as in 2012 and 2013, the European Court of Auditors is giving an unfavourable opinion on the legality and regularity of payments made by the Union, estimating the level of error at 4.4%, well above the 2% threshold. As such, I would like to draw your attention to the particularly high level of error in the allocation of European Structural Funds, with a rate that explodes to 5.7%.  As this report indicates, performance should be at the heart of public servants' priorities.

Madam President, over the last five years the Court of Auditors' annual reports have unfortunately said that the error rate of European expenditure is constantly increasing. This practically translates into the fact that the accounts of the European Union are unreliable.  We must be more careful in the management and control of European funds. The practice of reckless spending needs to change, just to absorb funds. We need to focus more on results and compliance with the rules, so that in the medium to long term there are sufficient funds to be allocated to the Budget of the European Union.  In areas such as regional policy, energy, transport, the environment and fisheries, funds are managed jointly between the Commission and the Member States. As well-wishers as we are, high error rates in expenditure cannot be solely due to non-compliance with European directives.  We must control and penalise cases of fraud, inadequacy and waste. For example, if a small and medium-sized enterprise, while owning a larger one, receives payments from European resources as small and medium-sized enterprises, then we are talking about fraud and not inconsistency of rules.

At EU level we should do more on simplification to help reduce errors. For the current cohesion policy programmes, some attempts have been made to reduce errors through simplification, for example through the introduction of cohesion flat-rate payments and having one set of common regulations for the five different funds, although each of the individual funds still has its own rules. Hopefully the High-Level Group established by the Commissioner will look at this particular issue and many others, because it is important that we reduce bureaucracy and make things as simple as possible for beneficiaries, for auditors, for Member States and for regions.

You might expect me to make much of the continuing high error rate in the EU’s accounts or the auditor’s adverse opinion on the legality and regularity of payment underlying the accounts. But actually, Commissioner Georgieva is doing one thing right in talking about performance-based budgeting, as it is not just about the high error rate that we see, it is also about whether money spent actually provides value for money. There is one example in the Court of Auditors’ report that I find particularly instructive, in which it describes a sewage system in Greece: they built the plant, they built the network, but nobody had connected the system to people’s homes, even though the project had been six years in the making from 2007 to 2013. EU funds – taxpayers’ money – achieve nothing if a system cannot actually be used. At the confirmation hearing over a year ago, before Commissioner Georgieva took office, I asked whether they had introduced failure criteria so that we would know whether a project was a success or a failure, in other words what it looked like. Well in my view it is 40 years too late, but the Commission is actually talking about doing something about the problem. Here is my question: is this actually going to be implemented in a way which will be critical when needed? Will we shine a light, not just on fraud or errors but on bad planning?

First of all, I would like to thank you for the work of the European Court of Auditors, which is far from useless, but which always gives us new indications as to where we can continue to work. I would like to respond to two comments you made in your presentation. On the one hand, Member States do not use the information they have sufficiently to avoid errors. On the other hand, Member States cannot use all the resources that the EU makes available to them. My conclusion is that, in the context of the negotiations on the medium-term financial framework, some Member States are making every effort to bring as much money home as possible, and then they do not really know what to do with it. I think that one solution lies in the revision of the medium-term financial framework, because the EU budget is not only underfunded, it seems that its funds are misallocated.

So we need to focus on clearly setting goals, on clearly establishing rules and procedures that will be easier for end-users and for the entire administration to make the number of irregularities lower.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 39, "date": "2015-11-26.json", "name": "Zigmantas BALČYTIS", "mepid": "96680", "text": "   – First of all, I would really like to congratulate the Court of Auditors, which has substantially improved the quality of its annual reports, and they are crucial in contributing to the proper management of the European Union's resources.

Firstly, it calls for a fundamentally new approach to the management of The European Union's investment and expenditure.

Secondly, a focus of European Union funds is needed on cutting-edge areas such as job creation, support for farmers and small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as support for social and territorial cohesion.  Thirdly, better management and control of the way European funds are allocated is needed, especially when the Court of Auditors' own report reveals that the error rate for expenditure was 4.4%.

Of the total expenditure of EUR 142.5 billion, 4.4% or just under EUR 6.3 billion have been misused, around 1 200 cases have been referred to OLAF for examination and 22 specific suspected cases of fraud are being investigated.

The largest misallocations in volume terms are in the structural funds.

It is a very interesting debate this year, because what I am hearing is a predominant concern about how we can rebalance attention between compliance with the rules and what the budget actually delivers for our people. I think it is very important that we take this focus on performance extremely seriously. The EU budget actually has been doing good things, if you take the growth rates of Poland, Lithuania and Latvia, for example. Over the last MFF they have been boosted for Poland by 1.7%, for Latvia by 2.1% and for Lithuania by 1.8%. As the Budget Commissioner this year, I have been visiting projects funded by the EU: cancer research in Finland, SME support in the UK, connectivity of citizens in the cohesion countries and rural internet, but I also have seen that sometimes there has not been enough thought put into how this particular project connects with the rest of the economy, and there are examples where we could have – and must – do better. I think that a culture shift in thinking as regards what we get for the money has to be our overwhelming objective. Agility, focus on priorities, impact – this is what the discussion on the budget absolutely must be on. We do have now in the new MFF a better platform, because we have placed performance front and centre. We introduced performance reserve – 6% of the money we hold back, and if you do well, we give you more money. We have to work with our people in the Commission and, of course, in the Member States on a culture shift. This is not an easy thing, but it is a must if we are to be successful in making the best use of our taxpayers’ sacrifices. For every project, for every penny, we have to ask ourselves if this is the best use of money. I really appreciate each and every one of you who spoke in support of this rebalancing. It does not mean we turn our backs on compliance with the rules – not at all. Rules are there to be followed. Right now they are too complicated to be followed! We have multiple projects with thousands and thousands of people who have to grasp the concept of project management that we have introduced from the EU – a concept that may be easy for some, but it is certainly not easy for a small farmer or for an SME owner, so we have to work on simplifying the rules so they can be followed, and then we have to come with a hammer when the rules are not followed. I agree with those who have said that the persistence of the error rate is something that is undermining the credibility of the European Union. We know why this persistence is there. Rules are part of the problem, but so is how much commitment we build on to make sure that these rules are indeed followed. As I have said many times, we also have to find a way to reward those who take measures to correct errors, because this is what it is in the majority of cases – error, not fraud. Proven fraud is 0.2% of our budget – 0.2% too much. I am not at all defending it, but what about the remaining 4.2%? How do we encourage people to do what the Court tells us could be done if you take corrective measures and the error rate will go down? There we hit a problem, which is the multiannual nature of our programmes. When an error is detected in one year but only corrected in the next, that is not reflected in the error rate, and this is why in the Commission we strongly recommend that we think about a residual error rate as an acceptable measurement, because if people take measures to correct, then that should be a positive thing. We should be saying bravo, we recognise you have done it. At the moment it is difficult to do it in a multiannual fashion. We are caught in this annuality in how we measure. Finally, I do agree that we have to persistently balance performance and compliance. We should avoid the reasoning according to which focusing on performance is somehow interpreted to mean ‘oh well, compliance with the rules is not that important’ – it is important! Let me finish with the question that was posed to me on ‘name and shame’. Well, it is complicated as to which Member States are performing the worst. If you look at the Court of Auditors’ report, there is a table that shows frequency of detected errors in audit sampling for 2014 for the Member States. It is very clear that it varies from one area to another. In some areas some countries are doing better, in others they are doing worse. So I would be very reluctant to make general sweeping conclusions but rather say the following: we have to work with Member States day in, day out, because at the end of the day, 80% of our money goes in shared management, and it is only when Member States buy into being diligent and working with us that we can achieve that objective. Finally, many thanks go to the Court of Auditors for the report that it has presented. A lot of it is something that has been coming up year after year, but we are now seeing a very welcome change of direction towards performance. We have, with this interinstitutional group, a very important task to see performance eye to eye, because the worst thing we can do is to have a different interpretation of what performance means and then get into not very productive arguments about who is right and who is wrong on what has been achieved in that area. So I very much look forward to working with Parliament, the Council and the Court of Auditors on giving a very clear direction for the Commission – though the Commission is not the most important actor – and for those who implement projects, so we get the European budget to serve our people the best possible way in the future.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 47, "date": "2015-11-26.json", "name": "Vítor Manuel da Silva Caldeira", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Court of Auditors. – Madam President, I would like first to thank you for the kind words addressed to the European Court of Auditors; on behalf of all those working there, thank you. Your words encourage us to do better and to practise what you preach. We do that every day, so I want to reassure Mr Marinescu that we are doing that and striving for it. I am very pleased to hear from the Vice-President that the Commission greatly welcomes our call for a wholly new approach to the European Union’s spending and investment. I am also pleased to see the broader consensus in this House on the need for that new approach. We simply cannot ignore the fact that it is a common task that needs interinstitutional cooperation from all institutions within Member States, because it is the best possible way to tackle the financial challenges ahead of us. I stress the need to use the mid-term review of the Multiannual Financial Framework and to take it as a golden opportunity to make progress. Members of Parliament have raised a number of issues in their speeches. I will not address every one of them, but I am encouraged by their willingness to reach a greater common understanding of what a new approach means, what a culture of performance means, and what we are looking for. That is something which will not be done overnight and which needs to go hand in hand with simplification of the rules as well as with clear objectives. I have understood the call for ways of reconciling transparency and simplification. This needs to be addressed in the best way possible. We need simplification because debt is amplifying the risk of error, but we also need to be transparent so that we can then say what we are achieving with the funds we are investing. So we have to have, first and foremost, a clear overall framework that provides direction. But we also need to be aware that spending funds is always risky. I am sorry to say this so bluntly, but geography is not the root cause of the errors. As we have demonstrated, management modes are, likewise, not the main cause of the problem. The main reason for the errors that we have found, and for their persistently high level, lies in the way this House and the Council decide on the legal framework for reimbursing costs. If you continue to have costs reimbursed on the basis of self-declarations by the final beneficiaries, then you will always have a higher risk of error. Simplification does not mean forgetting about control. It needs to have cost-effective arrangements to ensure that we comply with the rules but, at the same time, we need to ensure that these are used to the best effect. Then performance has a key part to play. What we are intending to measure is the interinstitutional work that we have to do. Flexibility is also an important consideration, so some Members estimate. I think that it is also vital to better address the backlogs which we have identified and which have been recognised on all sides. We need to use the budget in a more flexible way, together with all the financial instruments available, otherwise we will have funds committed but not being used. We know that at the end of 2014, the funds not yet used by all the Member States for the structural and investment funds were of the order of 23% of the total. That situation is better today, I believe, but that means that we are not making full use of resources, and there are reasons beyond that. Probably there are administrative capacities to develop. Probably there is also a need for Member State authorities to identify sustainable approaches that would make a difference to the lives of their citizens. In addition, a lot needs to be done to determine what makes a difference to citizens, for they will not think that building, say, a water-park is enough to make a difference. We need to see how sustainable approaches work and how they change citizens’ lives. I would like to conclude by saying that our call for a wholly new approach has to be followed up in interinstitutional dialogues, because that is the only way in which we can help to address the new challenges. It is the only way to tackle the long-standing issues that we have, but we need to take the opportunity afforded by the mid-term review of the MFF to move forward.

The highest levels of error occurred in expenditure under the headings \"Economic, social and territorial cohesion\" (5.7%) and 'Competitiveness for growth and jobs' (5.6%).

The case of airports is noteworthy, but the same lack of planning and coordination is found in other areas of transport and energy policy, under the dubious approach that infrastructure will eventually create its own market. The second is the difficulties of public administrations, especially local ones, which really want to implement alternative public policies, because of the administrative implications and financial needs implicit in the adoption of European projects. There is a need to rethly European funds to ensure their efficient use and their real contribution to improving social and regional cohesion through the transformation of the productive model.

We are seeing a development in which some Taliban groups have joined Daesh and, as we all know, shia are one of Daesh's targets. When we compare it with what is happening in other countries in the Middle East, this is a very worrying development. The war in which many EU Member States were involved in Afghanistan is not over. It continues, but with less media attention when we are no longer there. It was right to leave. Democracy and the functioning of the rule of law cannot be created by military means. Instead, we are needed in Afghanistan for a long term with civilian efforts for peace, democracy, security, etc. Building a democracy takes time. In addition to aid, we must also show from the political side that Afghanistan is not forgotten and that we see what is happening. It is in this perspective that this resolution plays a role. The resolution strongly condemns the barbaric killings of 77 Hazaras. It condemns the attacks by The Taliban, Al-Qaeda and Daesh and other groups against all sections of society. It underlines the importance of protecting the particularly vulnerable Hazaras and also regrets the grief of the families. We believe in the resolution that kidnappings should be seen as a war crime.

Let me start by expressing the regrets of the Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Federica Mogherini, for not being able to take part in the debate. I am happy to stand up on her behalf. After the events in Kunduz in early October, we have now had to witness the cruel beheading of a group of Shia Muslims belonging to the Hazara community in the southern province of Zabul by anti-government elements. The EU has firmly condemned this attack, as well as other recent brutal and barbaric acts of violence in Afghanistan. We have extended our sincere condolences to the families of the victims, including women and children who were abducted last month and executed between 6 and 8 November. These new atrocities coincide with a growing number of violent clashes between insurgent groups, whether different Taliban-affiliated groups or those linked to Daesh. So far no group has claimed responsibility for the beheading of the seven people. The perpetrators must be found and held accountable for their crimes. Once again, we call on all parties to the armed conflict, including all anti—government elements, to uphold international law. The continued targeting of Hazaras risks fuelling ethnic tensions within Afghanistan. As many of today’s speakers mentioned, on 11 November there was a mass demonstration in Kabul, with reportedly more than 20 000 men and women grieving the brutal loss of life and protesting about what happened in Zabul. The demonstrators were mainly Hazaras, but they also included other ethnic groups – Pashtuns, Tajiks, Uzbeks and others. We should keep in mind that the ever—present security threat in Afghanistan remains one of the main contributors to increased migration, both to neighbouring countries and to the EU. The deteriorating security situation, with a record level of terrorist attacks and the civilian casualties stemming from them, plus a deteriorating economic situation and limited employment opportunities for educated young people: these are the origin of migratory pressures, and we in Europe are directly affected. We need to act. We have our 2014-2016 EU Strategy for Afghanistan. It flags, as a first objective, the promotion of peace, security and regional stability, and it is in this perspective that the EU has agreed to co-host next year’s ministerial conference on Afghanistan, in October 2016. This conference in Brussels will further foster the stabilisation process in Afghanistan, where strong Afghan leadership, combined with continued international solidarity, is needed to send a signal of renewed hope, confidence and positive change. We have a challenging security situation, grave human rights violations, a fragile political situation and a very dire economic situation. They all cause further risks of destabilisation and the continued flow of Afghan refugees and migrants – people fleeing because of that loss of hope. It is all the more urgent that the Government of Afghanistan and all partners in the region engage credibly to end the conflict and ensure a stable environment with the support of the international community. An Afghan-led and Afghan—owned peace process remains the prerequisite to any sustainable solution. On this path, the EU stands firm in its commitments to Afghanistan and to its people.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 76, "date": "2015-11-26.json", "name": "Ildikó GÁLL-PELCZ", "mepid": "102886", "text": "   I have received seven motions for resolutions to conclude the debate.

Recent actions against members of the opposition in Cambodia, described in detail by previous speakers, are indeed cause for serious concern and raise questions about the culture of dialogue on which the government and the opposition agreed in July last year. I do not have to stress here in this Parliament how important the role of the opposition is in the democratic process. It is the nature and even the responsibility of an opposition to question and criticise the government and to hold them accountable to the public. In Cambodia the EU has advocated for and supported a culture of dialogue established between the party of government and the main opposition party. We have stressed that dialogue should not prevent the opposition from playing its role and that it should not be used as an excuse for suppressing criticism. We have urged both parties to work professionally and refrain from personal attacks and insults. The government, especially, is in a position of power and has therefore a particular duty to act with restraint and responsibility. Patience is the sign of strength and confidence. We agree with speakers who called on the EU to monitor closely the evolution of the situation, and indeed this is what we are doing. It is important for Cambodia, for the country itself, to return to a path of engagement and cooperation. We issued a local statement expressing our deep concern about the violent attack on two opposition members of the National Assembly, and we have also been using diplomatic channels to urge both parties to cooperate constructively and to return to the spirit of the culture of dialogue, as was agreed last year. We believe that a strong democracy that allows for constructive debate about policy alternatives is in the interests of Cambodia and its people if the country is to grow and develop.

Some examples of this which were mentioned include a 2013 amendment to the Information Technology and Communication Act and the draft cyber security act, as well as the national broadcast policy and the national online mass media policy. This year has been marked by tragic attacks on journalists and the brutal murders of secular bloggers and a publisher, while others are facing death threats. This is taking place against the backdrop of a volatile security situation, which includes an unprecedented attack on a Shia procession in Dhaka last month, as well as recent killings and attacks on foreign citizens. I extend my condolences to the family of Cesare Tavella, who was killed on 28 September. There was also the attack on Father Parolari last week. These issues were discussed at a meeting between High Representative/Vice—President Federica Mogherini and the Bangladesh Foreign Minister in Luxembourg on 5 November, as well as in a follow-up at the meeting of the EU—Bangladesh Joint Commission on 11 November in Dhaka. The EU has expressed its alarm at the deteriorating human rights and security situation. We have called on the government to protect bloggers and also to bring the instigators and perpetrators of attacks to justice and to prevent the repetition of such horrible acts. We have stated our concern about legislation and policies that can be used to restrict media and internet freedom, while calling on the government to defend and protect freedom of expression and other fundamental rights. Upholding these rights is an integral part of what is so very clearly a top priority for all of us today, namely the fight against radicalisation. When we restrict the public space for dissenting voices, what we are in danger of doing is fuelling extremism. Our cooperation, as set out in the EU—Bangladesh Cooperation Agreement, is based on a mutual commitment to respecting human rights and democratic principles, respecting the principles of the international conventions on core human rights and labour rights – some speakers spoke about labour conditions – and also underpinning the scheme that provides Bangladesh with quota—free and duty—free access to the EU market. The EU will therefore continue to raise freedom of expression in our dialogue with Bangladesh as we remain committed to assisting Bangladesh in carrying out the reforms necessary to strengthen democracy and governance.

Over the last couple of years, a number of measures have been implemented suggesting that not everything has been lost.

This objective, while very laudable, has nevertheless suffered from the inability of States to agree on concrete measures.

One of the main concerns of European citizens is animal welfare: whether in respect for the feelings and suffering of animals, or from a health and health perspective related to animal consumption. It is up to the European Union to ensure this desideratum and to apply in its policies the best standards of animal protection, not least because animal welfare is strictly related to public health and animal health.

Animal welfare is an issue to which the whole of Europe must pay more attention. Unfortunately, many Member States have not even implemented the current, rather light animal protection regulation. Problems in intensive production and outright atrocities are still common in, for example, meat cattle production. Domestic animals suffer in many Member States because the ways of curbing stray dog populations, for example, are downright barbaric. It is up to the legislators, the Commission and the Member States to ensure that these shortcomings are addressed without delay. Culturally, there should be no excuse, let alone support through agricultural aid, production methods or the killing of animals for entertainment purposes. Investments in animal welfare do not always mean higher production costs in agriculture. Often, productivity is also improved, the use of drugs decreases and chick mortality decreases when the requirements of species-specific behaviour of animals are better taken into account. It would also be important to note that consumers are prepared to pay more for products where attention has been paid to animal welfare. In my country, Finland, for example, 70% of consumers see the conditions under which farmed animals are housed as problematic. One solution would be to create common, species-specific criteria for animal welfare.

In addition, the text calls for the creation of 'educational corridors', which would allow students from these conflict zones to continue their studies at a European university.

If the EU's aid increases, since it will be 4.7 billion euros in developing countries for education for 2014-2020 (compared to 4.4 billion for the period 2007-2013), this is still well below the real needs.

However, such simplification of the rules should not serve as an excuse for, on the one hand, letting your guard down from account control and the use of allocated budget items, or on the other hand, to leave the door open to financing instruments that are already beginning to participate actively in operational programmes, such as private credit institutions or venture capital funds.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "GUE/NGL", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 792, "date": "2015-11-26.json", "name": "Andrea COZZOLINO", "mepid": "96880", "text": "  in writing. \\u2012 This is a particularly sensitive and complex issue, which will be at the heart of both the 2014-2020 implementation and the post-2020.

However, a dangerous prospect must be avoided, in which small and rich countries – which have reduced financial allocations – converge on a concept of simplification strongly linked to proportionality, which is translated into: the financial dimension of resources, the quality of governance, programme management, the level of risk of regularity of investments. So the danger to be avert is a two-size world: all simple and light for the group of small and good, vice versa, multiplied controls for those who have so many resources and a weak management capacity.

The issue of administrative simplification and capacity building for meeting the requirements of the EU Structural and Cohesion Funds is crucial. In many realities, take the Portuguese as an example, the existing rules and the bureaucratic web involved in mobilising EU funds in general (cohesion unfortunately does not escape the rule), constitute an impediment to the eligibility of projects and, consequently, determine, in practice, the lack of access to cohesion funds. This issue affects, in particular, the popular-based associative movement, non-governmental organisations, micro, small and medium-sized enterprises and local authorities.

All phases of the management of EU programmes, from European to national and regional levels, as well as all phases of the project cycle faced by beneficiaries of European funds, need to be simplified. In doing so, models should be found that will enable the simple application of European programmes, improve absorption of funds and focus on results.
