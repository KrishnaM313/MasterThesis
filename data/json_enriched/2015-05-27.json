It is a great pleasure for us to welcome you to the European Parliament once again. Dear Mrs. Ban, a warm welcome to you too. You have accompanied your husband here today – we are also pleased to welcome you to the European Parliament. Seventy years ago, Mr. Secretary-General, in 1945, the United Nations was founded in San Francisco. Today, the United Nations is the most important organization of international cooperation. They are the mainstay of the rules-based world order, and they are essential for safeguarding international security – an international security that is challenged in a wide variety of places in the world as never before, and in which the United Nations plays and must play a central role in resolving conflicts, because they are one of the instruments we need to bring about peaceful solutions. The European Union – and this Parliament in particular – shares the key objectives of your organisation, Mr Secretary-General: to combat the consequences of climate change, to combat global poverty and hunger, to commit to education and sustainable awareness. These objectives alone are fundamental to setting in motion peace processes, which, as I have said, we urgently need. I am sure I can say on behalf of my fellow Members that we are fully at your side in this fight as the European Parliament.  It is therefore a great honour for me to welcome you, Secretary-General, to this House of European democracy, and I am pleased to be able to give you the floor for the second time in the European Parliament.

I congratulate President Schulz on receiving the prestigious Charlemagne Prize this month for his work to promote democracy and to bring the European Parliament closer to the people of Europe it serves. (Applause) This Parliament represents a wide diversity of cultures and traditions bound by a common belief that we are stronger and better when we work together. You play an important role across every aspect of the United Nations agenda. The European Union is a pillar of international cooperation for peace, development and human rights. The United Nations simply could not do what it does without the support, encouragement and engagement of the European Union. I am deeply grateful for your strong commitment. Today, I would like to highlight three dominant and interlinked challenges that must command greater collective attention: first, preventing violent extremism; second, addressing the migration challenge; and third, building a sustainable world for all. First, the growth of violent extremism is a grave threat to international peace and security. The unspeakable wave of brutality against civilians being perpetrated by extremist groups is a direct challenge to the universal values of peace, justice, tolerance and human dignity. The wanton destruction of cultural heritage is another affront to our common humanity.  I remain fully committed to working with the European institutions to address this challenge. I will present a comprehensive United Nations Plan of Action to Prevent Violent Extremism to the General Assembly later this year. Our long-term response needs to focus on fostering inclusive governance, accountability, respect for universal values, and dialogue among communities. Upholding human rights and the rule of law are essential. We must always be mindful of our special responsibility to avoid responses to terrorism and violent extremism that make the problems worse. We need to empower young men and women, and harness the influence of leaders from the cultural, religious and educational spheres. And we need to reflect on what motivates young men, and sometimes women, to become so alienated and radicalised that they are prepared to inflict harm on others and even end their own lives in the process. We see violent extremism most vividly in the atrocities committed by Da’esh, Boko Haram, Al Shabaab and other sectarian and terrorist groups. But it is also evident in racist acts and hate speech – including by some political figures and parties. Minorities and migrants are among the most frequent targets. Let us work together to address all of these ills at their roots. The challenge of migration is of great concern to us all. From the Mediterranean to the seas of Southeast Asia, too many women, men and children are losing their lives in perilous journeys of escape. This year, some 1 800 migrants have drowned in the Mediterranean – a twenty-fold increase over the same period last year. Half of those crossing the Mediterranean are fleeing war or persecution or human rights abuses. They qualify for international protection as refugees. Europe has an important role to play and a collective responsibility to act. Saving lives should be the top priority.  (Applause) While we need to see more effective law enforcement actions against traffickers and smugglers, we also need safer alternatives to dangerous voyages, as well as legal channels such as resettlement, family reunification and work and study visas. Two days ago in Ireland, I met with people from Syria, Afghanistan, Myanmar and the Democratic Republic of the Congo who had been successfully re-settled. Their new lives are not without difficulty, but they have found safety – and their new home is glad to have extended a helping hand. I know there are many more such examples across Europe – and we need even more at this time. This morning I had another opportunity, of meeting a nine-year-old Syrian girl who escaped atrocities and violence in her home country. I was so moved and touched when she was appealing to me and explaining her dream. I encouraged her not to despair; that the world is with her. The United Nations and the European Union are with her and her family and the Syrian people. It was one of the most touching and moving moments for me. I welcome, the United Nations welcomes, the proposals by the European Commission for a new migration policy. Today’s announcement by the European Commission of a proposal for the relocation of 40 000 asylum-seekers is a step in the right direction. I encourage EU Member States to show compassion as they consider this important proposal to share their responsibilities.  (Applause) Successful burden-sharing can enable the European Union to address the dramatically increasing flows of people while setting an example for other regions of the world facing similar challenges. The United Nations, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Organisation for Migration will continue to work with European leaders to address the crisis in a way that upholds human rights and international law. Our approach must be comprehensive, looking at countries of destination, transit and, above all, origin. We must work to end the conflicts and development failures that have displaced more people today than at any point since the Second World War. We must work together in Europe and elsewhere to address the worrisome increase in stigma and discrimination against migrants. Europe is experiencing low population growth and demographic transition to an aging population. The equation is clear: to meet its workforce deficit and maintain its economic dynamism, Europe needs migrants. (Applause) The post-war history of Europe offers one of history’s great examples of cooperation for peace and prosperity. Europe’s success has become a powerful draw for migration. Europe’s values and guiding principles must guide the response. I encourage you to live up to the standards you have set for yourselves and for the world. Let me now turn to the third and overarching global challenge on which we count on European vision and leadership: achieving landmark advances in this critical year for sustainable development.  This must be a year of global action. In 2015, we have three historic opportunities to put the world on a sustainable, prosperous and equitable path. The first is in July, where we must renew the global partnership for development at the International Conference on Financing for Development in Addis Ababa. Developed countries have a responsibility to lead on providing the funds for eradicating extreme poverty and addressing climate change. Official Development Assistance (ODA) will remain a necessary part of the financing agenda, particularly for the Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States, which urgently need continued and increased support. I commend those countries which have met the target of committing 0.7% of their gross national product to Official Development Assistance, including 0.2% for the world’s least developed countries. I urge other OECD countries to follow that example. I welcome yesterday’s decision by EU Member States to re-commit to that target. I urge them to spare no effort to reach it as soon as possible. At the same time, we know that ODA by itself is not sufficient. We must mobilise financing from a variety of sources, both public and private. The fundamental responsibility for financing sustainable development lies with governments. Thus we need to support the improvement of effective and fair national tax systems. We also need to commit to more concerted international tax cooperation, as well as to combat tax evasion and illicit financial flows. A successful outcome in Addis Ababa is crucial for building trust, generating momentum and translating our future plans into reality. This year’s second development milestone comes in September in New York, when countries will adopt a bold post-2015 development agenda and embrace a new set of sustainable development goals which will be called SDGs. This is a universal, people-centred and planet-friendly agenda. All countries must transform their economies to end unsustainable consumption and production patterns. Europe can lead the way in transitioning to a low-carbon economy. Third, in December in Paris, governments must make good on their commitment to adopt a universal, meaningful climate change agreement at the Paris Climate Conference. Strong European leadership is essential to deliver a new climate agreement that will enable Europe to manage climate risks, enhance its prosperity and strengthen its security, including energy security. Through its national commitment and climate and energy policy, the European Union is blazing the trail to a safer, more prosperous low-carbon future for its people and our world. I thank the European Union for being among the first to issue a climate target in March of this year, and for the generous contributions of many EU Member States to the Green Climate Fund. Finance is critical to securing an ambitious agreement in Paris. There must be a politically credible trajectory for mobilising the agreed USD 100 billion per year by 2020. And the Green Climate Fund must be up and running before Paris so that it can support Small Island Developing States, Least Developed Countries and Africa. I request the European Union’s strong support in ensuring this. I am also asking for the European Union’s support on designing and delivering a special package for the most vulnerable countries, including the Small Island Developing States and Least Developed Countries, that addresses their concerns across climate and development. This package would focus primarily on finance, resilience, adaptation and energy. Finally, I urge the EU to continue to champion higher ambition in the context of a Paris agreement, both through strengthening its climate target for 2020, as well as considering more ambitious targets in the post-2020 period. (Applause) Thank you for your support. This year marks the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations. Our organisation was born from the ashes of the Second World War which laid much of Europe to waste. Your peace and prosperity offer a concrete symbol of what can be achieved, even after the greatest devastation. We live in a complex and troubled world. But I believe we also live in a world of possibility, and that you are among the guardians of that promise. You are a locomotive with a most powerful engine. I urge you to pull the world from ahead and to push the world from behind with your strong engine power. Together, we can prevail in providing a more just world for this and future generations. I thank you for your strong commitment to and leadership in democracy and for the spirit of service you bring to the important job of representing the European people. I thank you as well for supporting the ideals and objectives of the United Nations – and for this opportunity to address you.  Let us walk together to make this world better for all, where all the people, regardless of where they come from, can live with dignity; where nobody will be left behind. That is our, my and your moral and political responsibility in this 21st century. I thank you for your attention and leadership.

I am here on behalf of President Juncker who had to leave for Tokyo for the EU-Japan Summit, and today leaving for Tokyo is even more difficult than usual because of the impossibility of leaving Belgium by air. On 7 and 8 June, President Juncker will represent the European Union at the G7 Summit in Schloss Elmau, in Upper Bavaria, together with President Tusk. This is the 41st Summit since the leaders of the ‘Group of 6’ gathered for the first time in Rambouillet, in November 1975. This year, under the leadership of Chancellor Merkel, G7 leaders will discuss a number of traditional topics and some relatively new issues. They will take stock of the situation of the global economy, they will assess progress on the global trade agenda and on their respective bilateral negotiations, and they will exchange views and seek common ground on the most pressing foreign policy challenges. Both President Tusk and President Juncker intend to engage in discussions with their international partners and to use the opportunity, inter alia, to share the latest information on major European projects and initiatives, such as the Investment Plan for Europe. They will also highlight current efforts to build a European Energy Union and illustrate the key elements of the recent European policy on migration. The G7 is expected to discuss and take an ambitious position in support of the negotiations on the Post-2015 Development Agenda in New York and in view of the Climate Change Conference of the parties in Paris at the end of the year. The EU will bring into this discussion its high expectations for both outcomes, consistent with the positions expressed by this Parliament.

I was on the verge of telling you something about the second day of the summit when the Heads of State and Government of a number of African countries and representatives of international organisations will attend what is known as a ‘G7 Outreach’ meeting. The G7 supports African countries in their reform efforts and in their efforts to strengthen peace and security, growth and sustainable development. The G7 countries will therefore engage in dialogue with their guests on their common challenges, including on food security and the empowerment of women. And there is, may I add, a direct link between this effort and the need to tackle the issue of migration in a comprehensive way. The preparation of the summit is now entering the final phase. The EU hopes for high-level deliberations and an ambitious communiqué, where its strong positions can become G7 positions. In Schloss Elmau, the EU will advocate for the G7 to reaffirm the need for urgent and concrete action to address climate change, to confirm its commitment to fighting protectionism, to continue its engagement to strengthen health systems, to fight antimicrobial resistance and neglected tropical diseases, and to learn lessons from the Ebola crisis on how to respond to public health emergencies. We also expect the G7 to strongly support the UN negotiations to achieve an ambitious Post-2015 Agenda for Sustainable Development, to take action to promote women’s economic participation and entrepreneurship, and to step up its efforts in support of food security and nutrition. We also hope that the summit will contribute to raising public awareness about the global challenge posed by marine litter, in particular plastic litter, about the opportunities and constraints of deep-sea mining, and about the importance of protecting and using efficiently natural resources. Last but not least, it is inevitable to note that, for the second consecutive year, this group meets without Russia. Following the illegal annexation of Crimea, G7 leaders decided to suspend their participation in the G8 until Russia changed course and the environment came back to a situation where the G8 would be able to have a meaningful discussion. This is clearly not yet the case and a return to the G8 format is not on the agenda.

Many of the tasks before us today are no longer solvable without a global perspective, without a global dimension. We are thinking only of the experience of the financial and economic crisis: closing the casino in which the financial markets have worked is now a European task, but it will ultimately only be possible if we act globally. That is why speech at global level is so important. That is why the G7 meeting is so important. We in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and EuropeanS have the hope that we Europeans will be there with one voice. There are a number of European Union states there, and we ask and hope that Europe will be able to speak together with the voices that are present there. First of all, I would like to say a few thoughts about the event as such. We all know that, in the context of this event, many citizens are also taking part in the G7 summit, expressing their opinion through demonstrations. And that is welcome, it is desirable for people to get involved, and also to express their perhaps different views on global developments. However, I would like to say on the part of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats that we hope that this will be peaceful. Violence is not possible! And violence does not come from police forces either, but violence emanates from demonstrators who, unfortunately, promote their positions with false arguments. I also appeal to those responsible for non-governmental organisations to promote and ensure non-violence. Secondly, we have the open approach of the G7. G7 does not close, but opens the doors. The welcome of the Prime Ministers and Prime Ministers of Ethiopia, Iraq, Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal and Tunisia makes it clear that the G7 do not want to discuss among themselves, but want to remain open to all the other arguments that exist. Thirdly, as a general remark on the G7 procedure, I would like to emphasise and take up the argument of Frans Timmermans: Russia is no longer at the table. It must be made clear that anyone who breaks international law isolates himself from the international community. (Applause) Beyond the procedural rules, of course, it is first and foremost about the content. For us as the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the focus is first and all on growth and jobs. We need work for Europe's youth. We are committed to market opening, to free trade. Opening up markets has always led to more growth in the past, both in Europe and globally. That is why we want to continue working on this area. We are committed to stable budgets because only where there are stable budgets do investors have enough confidence to invest in locations and create jobs. And, as a third party, we need openness to reform – a reform agenda in the internal structures of states – to take up the developments of the new century. The second major issue I would overwrite is the area of stability. How can we ensure that global development takes place in an orderly fashion, as far as possible, without major crises? One of the big issues is the issue of radicalisation. How can we prevent people from becoming radicalised, perhaps even weaponised, and violent in our societies. The fight against terrorism is important, but only the fight against the symptom. The cause is precisely radicalisation in societies. What invites young people in particular to get on the wrong track? These issues need to be addressed. Secondly, stability also includes proper environmental protection. Climate change in the areas where Europe is leading the way, where Europe sets the standard in many areas, is on the agenda. We also very much welcome the fact that there are areas such as the protection of the environment, which is perhaps not so much on the agenda today, which will be discussed as a priority at the G7 summit. Thirdly, in the heading of stability, we have seen that health crises, such as the Ebola crisis, can cause great global uncertainty. That is why we need common global responses to the safety of the health of our citizens; in particular, the focus on addressing the issue of antibiotics is to be welcomed. Last but not least, I would like to point out that the issue that has moved us in Parliament over the last few months, namely migration issues, is, of course, also a question of stability in the world. That Europe is ambitious, that we meet the 0.7% target, as UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is now doing It is one of the benchmarks for whether we are serious about fair development at global level.

Madam President, Mr Vice-President, Commissioner, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his excellent work and for the work she has done. I think it is good that the G7 is addressing the issue of climate change. We have just heard from UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in the previous speech. The three points he raised are related like on a pearl necklace. These are the major challenges we have to face. I believe that we Europeans must be able to show that we are not just pursuing climate protection on the one hand and then having debates here – climate protection versus growth versus jobs – but summarising the whole thing. The fact that growth and economic prosperity are decoupled from carbon emissions is the great challenge in the future. The big challenges ahead will also be when it comes to resource consumption and resource use. Frans Timmermans also has the topic of sustainability in his portfolio. I believe that we need to think more holistically, not only in individual areas such as the circular economy – the package is due to come this year – but to take a holistic approach to finance, the economy, but also climate protection. Because we are debating refugee flows – last part of the week. How do we want to respond? The influx of refugees will increase even more. And one reason that will further push these refugee flows will be the issue of climate change. Jobs and prosperity - right. But this cannot be built at the expense of others. And that is also the continent of Africa, which is hit hard when it comes to climate change. We are all in demand here. It is not just Europe that is needed here, but everyone is asked to change direction there so that we can take a different direction. I hope that the G7 meeting will pave the way and that this circle will then be closed – that a holistic approach will be found at the site and that it is not always just individual issues that are singled out and discussed.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 19, "date": "2015-05-27.json", "name": "Morten MESSERSCHMIDT", "mepid": "96663", "text": "  for the ECR Group. Madam President! Free world leaders come together at a time when challenges, threats and problems are rises. Challenges that seriously raise questions about our security, independence and fundamental values. I am pleased to see what both Mr Timmermann's, Mr Timmermann's and the President-in-Office of the Council, have said. As Mr Weber and others have said in relation to Russia, we also have problems and challenges in relation to our economies, in terms of security around the globe and in relation to the terrorists who are both in our own countries and also externally gaining ground.  The G7 leaders must find a way to deal with the threat posed by the so-called Islamic State in Syria and Iraq. It is horrifying to see how a darkened ideology is allowed to occupy one city after another, implement its ideology of horror and almost no resistance few. The free world must take the initiative to curb the terrorist movement that we are witnessing here. Here in the European Union, at least we could do more to find and punish those who, from their exiles in our countries, help and support the sick ideology that 'Islamic State' propagates with violence and weapons. It is intolerable to see the many civilian victims of the many massacres. It is intolerable to hear about the cultural treasures that are threatened and at risk of being destroyed. It is intolerable that the \"Islamic State\" can find supporters in our own countries who are willing to fight their cause.  Unfortunately, the threat posed by the terrorists of this world is not the only thing we have to deal with. The entire global economy remains under threat, including by the instability of the euro zone. While most of the world outside the euro zone has been able to put the financial crisis behind it, key parts of the European economy continue to be hit by recession – Why? Because the euro puts an iron ring around the countries whose only medicine appears to be internal devaluation or cuts, \"austerity\" as we call it. It is time for world leaders , not least those representing our countries, to realise that the rhetoric of a common policy as a necessary solution to all the world's problems is wrong! Our countries are not created from the top down, like, for example, the United States. Therefore, there is a limit to how much common policy it makes sense to pursue when the differences in taxation, in labour market policy and in terms of how economic and financial policy are run are obviously large. It's not just about economics, it's also about influence. The negotiations between the United States and the European Union on a free trade agreement are a clear example of the EU losing its breath. The United States has alternatives, and if we miss the chance of a free trade agreement across the Atlantic, well, then the Americans simply turn our eyes to China, India or other economies. The EUROPEAN Union is second-choice because the euro has destroyed our economy.  There are many things for the G7 to deal with. These are just two of them.", "language": "en", "original_language": "da", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "EFD", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "EFD"}, {"id": 20, "date": "2015-05-27.json", "name": "Pavel TELIČKA", "mepid": "124706", "text": "  on behalf of the ALDE Group. – Madam President, first of all let me start by saying that I highly appreciate that this is a G7 Summit and not a G8 summit for the reasons that you have expressed, and I do appreciate the consistency that we are able to apply for once.  Now, in terms of the G7 and the reading of the public and their expectations, for the public this is a global forum, a global forum to debate issues of global importance, where vision is necessary and vision is sought, where concrete issues are debated and solutions are tabled. This is the expectation. And I think that in this respect, the agenda is fine. I do not think I will comment on the agenda, I see it there and I think that a lot is hidden between the lines. There is, though, one issue which we feel, and rightly so, has a European dimension. But this is not just a European issue, it is not an issue of Libya, Syria, Eritrea or the Middle East, it is an international issue. Today it might be Libya, Syria, Eritrea, and the most affected countries such as Malta and Italy, but also Germany and Sweden. But it is also Myanmar today, and tomorrow it might be something completely different.  So I think this is a serious issue. If we look at the topics – and again the agenda is right, with foreign policy, climate change, poverty, development aid and many other issues – I think we are talking about policies which lie at the heart of this problem, which in fact we partly co-created. We had a ‘plan A’ in some countries, but we did not have a ‘plan B’.

Because, it seems, the world economy, but also the European economy, has not learned the lessons from the great crisis of 2008-2009. What happened to these promises to reform the financial system so that it serves growth and societies, not casino capitalism? Where are the global tax rules measures that will combat the huge tax fraud and tax evasion of large multinational corporations? Even the International Monetary Fund is spending weakly, economic growth is uneven, the risk of deflation and the European economy is a weak link within the global economy. The International Labour Office has shown with studies that full deregulation of industrial relations has not helped either to reduce unemployment, to boost demand, or to growth. Will what the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, rightly point out about immigration and the environment, turn, this time, into decisions, into action, into measurable results, or will we simply stick to painless wishes?

Madam President, Mr Timmermans, you are obviously speaking today on behalf of President Juncker. I think that you and the European Union have a credibility problem, not only because, in your speech, I acknowledged verbatim the press release on the G7 meeting programme - it is nice to have read it to us, but I was able to read it before you read it to us - but, above all, when we analyse the European contribution to the debate that you have announced to us.  Let's take the subject of climate. I note that the European Union, with its recent decisions on the targets, has decided on a less ambitious and less restrictive programme. Yet we will say that the Paris summit must be a success. Also in the field of the environment, I observe that we will be talking about marine pollution, especially by plastics. However, I note that when this Parliament adopted a regulation on the disposal - hopefully - of plastic bags, it was your Commission that, through your mouth, objected to our desire to show more ambition than the Commission in its proposal.  Let's move on to the issue of development. If this is true, the Commission has expressed legal reservations about Parliament's and the Council's decision to be more ambitious than the Commission in its proposal. If we look at development aid, we realize that the European Union not only does not meet the 0.7% target for direct development aid but also pursues policies, particularly in the trade field, which naturally refrain from binding compliance, for example, with internationally recognised standards, such as ILO standards, as a condition of access to the European market. You tell us that you want to impose, that you want to discuss respect for social and environmental standards throughout the production chain, but when you want to impose constraints as in the case of minerals mined in conflict zones, you see all the resistance that this creates. We can talk about Ebola and global health problems. What is there in the Ebola crisis? Europe's contributions to WHO are riquiqui, far below what the European Union, a rich continent, should be able to do in terms of global health.  I could talk about a subject that is not on the agenda, which is all the more worrying, it is financial regulation. That has been talked about. We used to say, \"Never do that again.\" Today, however, a whole series of indicators show us that we have returned to levels of tension in financial markets, to levels of inflation, to bubbles, particularly in equity markets or in real estate markets, similar to what we observed in 2007. Now it is no longer a topic of discussion. Yesterday, a timid European attempt to split retail and investment banks was rejected, an issue that should not be discussed. Each continent, arguing that the neighbouring continent does not take such strict measures, concludes that the competitiveness of its banks cannot be penalized and that, of course, it cannot be imposed on rules that others do not adopt. I listened to Ban Ki-moon's speech and heard two words several times: leadership and ambition. I am sorry, but today, when I see the positions taken by the European Union - not only the Commission, it is of course also the Member States - I see that, increasingly, we lack ambition and leadership in Europe. I'd like to finish - I've got 30 seconds left and I'm sorry Manfred Weber's gone. I heard the words \"Gewalt geht nicht\" in his mouth, and I agree with him. Among the conquests of the European Union is the resolution of conflicts peacefully, including between us. But when millions of young people find themselves condemned to unemployment in a sustainable way, when British workers are excluded from unemployment statistics because they have zero-hour employment contracts, and worse, when Greek citizens - three million of them - are faced with the loss of health and disability coverage or health insurance that condemns some of them to death, especially those with cancer or AIDS, I see that this is also violence.  It must therefore be understood that if we say 'Gewalt geht nicht', violence should not be observed anywhere and certainly not in the policies of the European Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "Verts/ALE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 3, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Greens and regionalists"}, {"id": 23, "date": "2015-05-27.json", "name": "David BORRELLI", "mepid": "124796", "text": "  Mr President, president, ladies and gentlemen, i.e. the european Union, the European Union and its Member States are Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the forthcoming G7 summit is of particular importance because it is taking place in the year that Europe has devoted to development.

Often, pharmaceutical multinationals experiment with their drugs in developing countries where this type of activity is easier and there are fewer controls.

Of course, climate change issues are very weighty. But when we think about the energy issue, we must also not forget about energy security, which is just as weight for Us as Europe. Let us remember the basic fact that in the European Union we are dependent on energy imports. The main country from which we import energy is Russia. Russia, the same country that, because of its military aggression in Ukraine, is not only destabilising the security situation across Europe, but also, of course, not invited to a meeting that was formerly called the G8, but now and now only the G7. What I think should be done at this meeting on the part of the European Union is to emphasise the need for the G7 countries to cooperate with each other directly on the issue of energy security. And here, the European Union has a very important role to play with the United States, which, thanks to their extraction of shale oil and shale gas, has a very large resource that they cannot export at the moment because of their own closures. It would be in Europe's interest to have these export restrictions lifted in the United States so that Europe can import natural gas, for example, not only from Russia, but also from the United States, thereby jointly increasing its energy security. So when we think about energy issues, of course, climate change is very weighty.

It is precisely those three issues that Germany has raised for next week's G7 conference.

Only through the right to association can workers force a positive change in their working conditions, and only through collective bargaining do they guarantee themselves a fair wage.

When you look at the real human suffering in Greece, when you look at youth unemployment, when you see soup kitchens and rocketing suicide rates, then Russia could seem like a realistic option.  Indeed, Russia and its partners China, India and Brazil, have set up the BRIC network, which is providing an important alternative pillar of political leadership in our world, in comparison to the G7. For example, the BRIC countries have swept the oceans of Somalia almost entirely of pirates; they have pioneered high-yield crops in Africa; they have built infrastructure projects in some of the world’s poorest countries. Meanwhile, the G7 pontificates on the world’s problems and it is mostly talk and not walk. It is the old world versus the new, and the old is losing. And if the best that we can come up with is threats against Greece then maybe the G7 needs a rethink. World leadership is shifting to the BRIC nations and we have a choice.

I would like to thank Vice-President Timmermans for clearly mentioning two priorities in his opening speech, which are also very important for my group and, in particular, for my colleagues in the Committee on the Environment. The first is the issue of antibiotic resistance. It really is high time that the issue was at the top of the agenda of international and therefore also European policy. Angela Merkel gave a speech on 18 May explaining why Germany is putting this on the G7 agenda. We have 25 000 deaths every year in the European Union alone because antibiotic resistance means that they can no longer be treated. And in other parts of the world, that's much more. That is why we must act. The Commission has put forward a number of things on this. To this end, we are working on a report by Francoise Grossetéte on agriculture and veterinary medicine. I would encourage Vice-President Timmermans to address the issue with a view to the Commission's work programme for 2016. In the field of human medicine, for example, we must also ensure that new medicines are developed – new antibiotics – and that the antibiotics we have are used more responsibly. The second issue that has already been raised a lot, including by Ban Ki-moon, is climate change. In This regard, we urgently need to make progress in Schloss Elmau on the way to Paris. I would like to emphasise two points raised by President Hollande and Chancellor Angela Merkel in their statement last week: we need a long-term decarbonisation target on the way to Paris – and for this the G7 summit is an important intermediate point. And we already need a mechanism for achieving what we are not achieving in Paris at the latest five years later. We must now also be sustainable with the method.

Another urgency is the global threat posed by ISIS and the spread of terrorism, both regionally and globally. Not a single country in this world is free from the danger of terrorism, and so the security tension in the Middle East will continue to grow and will pose immeasurable threats to global security.

Of course, there is a responsibility of the most developed countries in the world to support the development of those who are the poorest, but of course there is also a strategic interest in this, because to support sustainable development and eradicate extreme poverty in our neighborhood is extremely important for our own safety and the safety of our citizens.  Ensuring conditions of peace and stability in our neighbourhood is what ensures our security as well. But to achieve this, at least two things are needed, which are the right policies and on the other hand financial resources. As for the right policy, I think at least part of it has to be refocuxing our development aid policy. We need to focus much more on building inclusive and effective institutions in combating corruption in developing countries, in promoting good governance of peace and stability in these countries.  Of course, we need financial resources, and yesterday the Council reaffirmed the European Union's commitment to allocate 0.7% of national revenues for development aid. However, the Council yesterday did not set a date for when it would do so. So we can achieve this goal, but maybe not until 2030. That is why we must say here today that this will not be enough if we are to eradicate extreme poverty by 2030.  We need to reach the 0.7% target much sooner.

The European Union's duty was to respond positively to the call of the Secretary-General of the United Nations and to present itself before the G7 and in Alse Ababa with a concrete proposal, capable of inspiring concrete commitments on the part of other international partners.

Many of them have already left so I will not address them individually, but I can assure you that I will take the messages back to President Juncker.  Let me be specific on a number of issues. The Commission, as you know very well, shares Parliament’s ambition as far as sustainable development is concerned, as far as ambitious climate change goals are concerned, for Paris and beyond.  The MDGs were raised. This is something that Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon also mentioned in his statement to you. Certainly this will also be very much on our agenda. If I listen carefully, I think that much of the ambition that Parliament wants injected into the G7 meeting is directed at the other members of the G7, but I would gladly pass that message on to President Juncker to take on board.  I also fully share the views expressed that, if we want to really do something about the position of people in the workplace and about honest relationships in the economic chain, we need to have a holistic approach to the issue and look not just at the situation outside of the European Union but also at the situation in the European Union. I think this is a message that came across quite strongly.  Where I have more difficulty in understanding the message, frankly, is with regard to Russia. I think the G7 took a clear position. If there is such a flagrant violation of international law, if you simply take away part of another country’s territory, there has to be a reaction. I think the G7 has taken the right reaction, and as long as the reason for taking this reaction is not resolved I think the G7 has no other option other than to maintain that position; and I do believe that the onus here is very much on the Russian Federation and not on the G7.  What I find surprising is that some Members in this House representing parties who are always on about national sovereignty, about non-violation of borders, etc., forget completely about the violation of the borders of Ukraine when Russia does it. There is a slight inconsistency in that position, I would say.  Finally, on this point – and I cannot repeat this enough – how far do you have to be encased in your ideological position to prefer the model of President Putin to the most successful peace project in European history, which is the European Union? Only if you are so enclosed in your ideological view – which is anti-EU – could you prefer the model that President Putin has put in place for his country to the model which 500 million Europeans have chosen freely and which has brought freedom and prosperity to so many people.  And yes, there is a terrible crisis; yes, it is unacceptable that so many of our young people are unemployed today; yes, this is sometimes driving them to radicalisation; and yes, they have sometimes lost trust in the future. However, it is our collective task to create realistic prospects of reform, of inclusion, of democracy and openness as a solution to this problem.

Development is, in fact, a prerequisite for achieving greater stability in the regions affected by the tragedies of war and terrorism.

This is a very right decision. The great democracies of the world must remember that Russia's argument about the right of peoples to self-establish is clearly implemented in its immediate vicinity: first destabilisation, then ethnic cleansing, then the exploitation of the Russian minority in the neighbourhood. Now we can talk about hybrid warfare and aggressive propaganda. In the post-war order, however, the territorial integrity of states is part of the international legal order, and the right of peoples to self-establish is limited by certain criteria. Before the annexation, Crimea was not ethnically homogeneous territory. However, the Russian minority did not raise serious objections to Ukraine's respect for human rights internationally. After the annexation, the policy of the Russian authorities tends towards ethnic cleansing, aimed mainly at the indigenous people of Crimean Tatars and Ukrainians. In support of the dialogue with the African countries, I consider it wrong to omission in the agenda and in the preparations for the summit of the clearly isolated situation in Ukraine and the absence of an invitation from President Poroshenko.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is with great pride that I come to present this report on the distribution of fruit, vegetables and milk in schools, which is the first legislative report of the legislature on agriculture. This report is the result of intense collaboration with the rapporteurs of the political groups: Mrs Ribeiro for the EPP group, Mrs Muller for the ALDE group, Mr Nicholson for the ECR group, Mr Zullo for the EFDD group, Mr Ropé for the Greens/EFA group and Mr Carthy for the GUE/NGL group, whom I thank very much. With more than 22 million overweight children in the European Union, it is essential to change eating habits while promoting a healthy and balanced diet from an early age. Children's health, food education, support for agricultural products, these are the objectives of my report.  In order to meet these goals, priority should be given to fresh fruits and vegetables as children tend to turn more easily to compotes and fruit juices rather than eating fresh fruit. By focusing distribution on fresh fruits and vegetables, the new proposal will meet one of the objectives of school curricula: to reconnect children with agriculture and to support local and European producers since it was intended to give preference to local or even organic products. For milk, I believe that Member States should be allowed under conditions to distribute, in addition to milk, cheese and yoghurt, in order to normalise calcium intake in school-age children and to provide milk substitutes for lactose intolerant children.  However, I am against the distribution of chocolate milk. I do not want to offend Mrs Kostinger, my excellent colleague, but it would open the door to other products and, clearly, to flavoured products of all kinds with a sugar overload. As Members of the European Parliament, I believe that we cannot claim to fight obesity and promote both the consumption of various flavoured milks containing added sugar.  On the other hand, consumption of this type of product is not decreasing among children. It therefore needs less encouragement than others. That is why, sincerely, I continue to advocate voting against Amendment 49. Educational measures represent a fundamental dimension of new programmes with a financial envelope ranging from 10 to 20 per cent of total budgets. They will be designed to bring young people closer to local producers and to raise children's awareness of issues such as the variety of agricultural production, sustainability, environmental issues and food waste. In addition, as part of the same educational measures, children will have the opportunity to get to know local and regional specialties such as olive oil, honey, olives or Agen prunes, which I have not forgotten.  Let us not forget that school plays an important role when it comes to training young people in life and encouraging them to develop healthy eating habits. The reduction of administrative burdens, especially for schools, the improvement of the visibility of programmes, and the balanced distribution of budgetary envelopes between Member States are all other points that we have improved through the vote in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. By always pursuing the same goal, we are ensuring that more children and schools benefit from this program. It was clear that we had to try to gradually turn our backs on historical references - since Croatia (and Mrs Biljana Borzan was still telling me about this earlier) has a reference of zero - to move towards an objective criterion of number of children. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to take advantage of the Commission's presence , and I welcome commissioner Hogan's presence - to remind us that there are still two threats to this report. The first is the legal basis. I will not go any further, but you are, Commissioner, that is Article 43, paragraph 2, or Article 43, paragraph 3. Will Parliament have the prerogatives it deserves on this issue? Will the Council want to arrogate them, which is obviously at odds with the Lisbon Treaty, which gives Parliament - as you know - the power of co-decision? It is therefore quite unacceptable to hear this from the Council. Then, in the Commission's work programme for 2015, this proposal was put on hold pending the results of a new evaluation.  Therefore, can the Commission reassure us or give us information about the outcome of this assessment?

I understand that you did a lot of preparatory work and consultations with different parties in order to understand the real needs of those directly involved and who are affected by the proposal.  I am aware that the Commission’s decision to further evaluate the school schemes and recommend to the legislators to put on hold their discussions on the proposal caused some early concern in Parliament, but I want to assure you that this move was not done to ‘dictate’ or interfere with Parliament’s agenda. The Commission as a whole wants to make sure that what we are doing is in line with the key principles of EU law-making, which is to deliver on the objectives of having better and fewer rules, and enjoy strong public support.  The evaluation is in fact in line with the broader Better Regulation Agenda which was adopted by the Commission recently on 19 May. And the review of existing EU laws, simplification, greater transparency and public scrutiny will be a norm for the systematic decision-making process rather than an exception. My services have respected the will of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development to continue working on this proposal and provided all the necessary assistance in this process.  The evaluation of school schemes as regards subsidiarity, proportionality and better regulation is in its final stages. The process has been open and transparent, and has taken due account of stakeholders’ views and the positions of all institutions. If you have had a chance to look at the draft report which was published on the Commission website on 12 May, you will see that Parliament’s position is very well reflected and will be updated based on your decision today.  To ensure full transparency and allow the public to comment on the preliminary findings of the evaluation, the draft report is open for consultation until 3 June, and I expect that my services will therefore finalise the evaluation shortly thereafter.  I will duly inform you and the Council of the outcome of this process and the further steps that are envisaged by the Commission. I am here today to listen to your debate and will make sure that your position on this proposal is taken on board and conveyed to the rest of the College.  I am pleased to hear that the position you are voting on today largely supports the framework of the Commission’s proposal. Of course I am aware that a lot of work still needs to be done in the case of possible trilogues, especially once the Council resumes its examination of the proposal in due course. While there are certain elements of your position which go beyond what the Commission has proposed, namely on the list of core products, the milk budget and the allocation criteria, I take your position on board and I am confident that if we engage in further negotiations, we will be able to come to a reasonable outcome.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "S&D", "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 72, "date": "2015-05-27.json", "name": "Sofia RIBEIRO", "mepid": "124733", "text": "  on behalf of the Ppe Group. – Mr President, Commissioner, Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur and the other shadow rapporteurs for the enormous and hard negotiating work that has enabled us to come to this point with a better and more complete proposal than the Commission. In fact, it was a very difficult process to try to bring these two programmes together, which had different main objectives, into one, and would treat them in the same way. Nevertheless, I believe that the future programme will be more attractive to The Member States, as it eliminates the principle of co-financing and gives preference to short supply chains, as soon as local products.  It has a strong educational component, encouraging young Europeans to have healthy drinking habits, preventing obesity and bringing them closer to farmers and the European way of production. It is essential that they realize that agricultural products are not born on supermarket shelves, but are the result of enormous effort and dedication on the part of farmers. This programme also represents a huge asset because, in many cases, it is the only meal and food for many young people who, being most deprived, also need to be supported in schools.  Parliament also proposes an increase of EUR 20 million for the milk programme, thus allowing, during the transition to the future objective criteria of the allocation of funds, no Member State to lose funding. I reinforce here that, only through this increase, we accept the new key of eligibility criteria. There is also in the report the possibility of transfer between the two pillars up to 15% of the financial allocation, according to national strategies. It is up to the Member States to decide.  I would also like to highlight, and I would like to thank you, for the enormous support and solidarity of almost all political groups with regard to the positive discrimination given to the outermost regions. We therefore comply with the Treaties and show that this is also a Europe of the regions. Finally, I would just like to say that there are some aspects to be improved and that the EPP tabled amendment 49, for which it asks for the support of this Parliament, since we believe that it should be the Member States who decide and, I repeat, the Member States and not the Commission to decide what should be distributed in our schools.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 73, "date": "2015-05-27.json", "name": "Paolo DE CASTRO", "mepid": "96891", "text": "  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, the programme for the distribution of fruit and milk in schools is a fair programme, which Parliament wholeheartedly supports.

It has been a pretty good way of working together. At the end of last year rumours persisted that the proposals for the merger between the school fruit and vegetable scheme and the school milk scheme faced the chopping block. While the desire for better regulation is of course to be welcomed, the Commission has not completely withdrawn the proposals but instead left them in limbo pending the results of an internal evaluation. I welcome the Commissioner’s comments on that today and I hope we do get a final resolution. While Parliament has decided to proceed with its consideration of the scheme, and I think rightly so, rather than pause knowing the carpet may or may not be pulled from under our feet, this is ultimately not a satisfying business that we have been involved in. I find the uncertainty disappointing. There are a number of elements of the Commission’s proposals that are to be welcomed. The merging of both schemes under a joint legal and financial framework could reduce the administrative burden on bureaucracy for the schools that wish to utilise the scheme. This is welcome news for many schools in my own constituency that are currently using the school milk scheme. Over 70% of nursery, primary, and special-education schools are making milk available to their pupils. And I think that is to be welcomed. We must ensure that the joint legal framework reduces red tape. For instance, I welcome amendments that would prevent schools from needlessly filling in two separate sets of forms in order to apply. At the committee stage I submitted amendments to broaden the scope of the dairy products that would also be included in the scheme, such as yogurts and cheese. I consider this to be very important for the dairy sector, not only in this current crisis. I also believe schoolchildren should be better educated about the supply chain – the fact that food just does not come off a supermarket shelf. I think it is very important that they are aware of the food chain. My group will be voting against.

Mr President, Mr Hogan, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report and for the way in which he has been a member of the European Parliament.

Both are established programmes; the school milk programme has been in place since 1977 and it is a very complicated application procedure. The school fruit programme has been in place since 2007. In total, we reach 30 million children between the ages of six and ten every year within the European Union. And today we are deciding to merge the two programmes in order to reduce bureaucracy.

The latest figures clearly show that 70% of school children come to school without breakfast. In addition to the distribution of products in schools to the children, it is personally very important to me to establish the knowledge transfer about healthy eating here. It is particularly important that this nutrition education in schools can be taken over not only by teachers, but also by housekeepers and nutritionists. I would like to see a clear vote by the European Parliament today in favour of this programme and I urge you, Commissioner, to press for simplifications and also to implement them effectively in order to achieve real added value for the health and well-being of our children.

The proposal to streamline two separate schemes – the school milk scheme and the fruit and vegetables in schools scheme – makes sense. The promotion of healthy eating among children is an important and laudable objective.  In reality, it should be said that Member States should not need an EU scheme to prioritise initiatives aimed at making children healthier but, recognising that these schemes are in place, Parliament should be using our efforts to make sure the schemes are as uncomplicated as possible and as fair as possible. Funds should be allocated in proportion to the number of children in each country, and should be targeted at promoting local produce. The promotion of fresh produce and especially the consumption of fresh milk, which is in decline, should be prioritised. The principle of subsidiarity should mean that the key decisions should be made at national and regional level as it is here that the needs of local communities can be best addressed. I have to say that I have a fundamental disagreement with some of the committee amendments which would see more funds being spent on advertising EU involvement in the scheme rather than on promoting healthy living. The scheme, in my view, is at risk of becoming a very expensive and elaborate PR exercise if these amendments are passed, and I do not believe that this would be the most beneficial use of funds.

It reflects the need to continue and effectively promote healthy meals and education activities for students, bringing together the two previous programmes into one, reflecting and important proposals of the European Committee of the Regions. At the same time, I must admit with regret that, for some aspects of the report, at best questionable, we, the Greens, have had to table seven amendments. I want to mention the most important of these: – on the ban on flavour enhancers or substances E 620, E 650. As we know, such nutritional additives as monosodium glutamate (E 621) promote addiction, high blood pressure and overweight, including in children. Why the honourable rapporteur wants to feed our children for European Union funds with unhealthy chemical additives, I do not know for sure; – on publicity rules. At the moment, all schools that participate in the programme are public, but the rapporteur proposes to create mandatory standards: to put posters at the door of schools, etc. Who needs it, I cannot understand; I also want to draw your attention to the fact that the programme is not particularly large.

This programme of support for the distribution of fruit, vegetables and milk in schools is the result of data that say that young people and children in Europe are consuming food badly, that obesity is increasing and that the consumption of so-called 'junk food' products is increasing in particular. Therefore, we absolutely must react by proposing more correct diets, and where should we do it? We must do this in schools which are the environment where, as they say, the adults of tomorrow are trained. I therefore welcome the financial support given to the education programme, which cannot ignore a minimum quota that this programme itself defines. We must ensure that this change is a permanent change, because healthy eating also means a reduction in health care costs. So it is a sustainability footprint at European level. If we go into the substance of the programme itself, I am very happy with the inclusion of products. We have put a lot of attention to fresh, processed but un processed products because, as some of us have already mentioned, children need to understand where the product comes from, not from the supermarket shelf. From this point of view, the element that creates so much debate is that of flavoured milk. It puzzles me personally, because this is not a natural product, it is a product rich in sugars, it is a product that derives from large companies and not from small producers linked to the territory that this programme aims to help and support.

The European Union is therefore legitimate in this regard. Maintaining separate programmes, which ensure that the specificities of fruits and vegetables are taken into account, on the one hand, and milk and dairy products, on the other, is also important. Finally, Commissioner, it is essential to simplify and unify administrative procedures for more effective implementation of programmes in order to achieve our objectives. On the other hand, the compromise voted in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development (AGRI) is problematic because the criteria for the allocation of the proposed budget envelopes between the Member States do not seem to us to be fair in view of the previous state implementation. Indeed, after a transitional period of six years, the rapporteur proposes to remove the historical criteria for the allocation of envelopes that Member States have benefited from. Their envelopes are therefore likely to be reduced at the end of this period, which amounts to penalising states, including France, which have historically invested in these programmes. In order to preserve the balance of distribution of the milk programme envelope between the Member States, the rapporteur proposed to increase the total budget by EUR 20 million.

Ladies and gentlemen, the recent crisis, caused by the Russian embargo, shows the extent to which it is necessary to strengthen the promotional instruments available to us in the European Union in order to improve the consumption of our products both within and outside the Union, but in the internal market above all. That is why this initiative is necessary, because demand for certain products in the European Union, in some cases, is declining as a result of much of the changes in consumer uses.  Therefore, with a view to strengthening the healthy habits of all European citizens, but especially children, this programme to promote the consumption of fruit and vegetables and milk in schools allows to give an honorable outlet to a part of the productions that are affected, sometimes, by critical market situations, such as the one we now live with Russia.  I believe that the new Regulation merging the two existing regimes so far, fruit and vegetables and milk, gives coherence to the European Union's policy in this area and I hope that this merger will be a first step so that in the not too distant future the promotion of consumption of healthy products is not limited to specific sectors , but is opened to other products whose consumption also has a beneficial effect on health, such as olive oil or nuts.  If we intend to promote healthy habits, I don't see why we should limit ourselves to two very specific sectors and ignore the nutritional role of other foods as healthy as those.

Feeding properly means first of all preventing so many diseases, starting, as I said before, from obesity. Daily consumption of fruits and vegetables is important. We must educate our children about all this, healthy lifestyles to combine with healthy eating, we must educate them to conscious consumption.  Last but not least, we must teach them the importance of agriculture, of the farmer's work, of the products of their territory. At that time, as has already been mentioned, many of these programmes were also linked to the EXPO, which have shown that they are important.

These forms of incapacitation have then led to certain children simply no longer being properly cared for.  Now we are calling for food to be provided in schools. This means that the parents who are actually responsible for this – and not a single government – will be further incapacitated. I think we are starting on a completely wrong side here in the European Parliament. If family policy is also possible here in the European Parliament, then we should start elsewhere and not in the food of children in schools.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ECR", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 117, "date": "2015-05-27.json", "name": "Arne GERICKE", "mepid": "124815", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, first of all I wish to thank Mr Tarabella and the shadow rapporteurs for their work. It is interesting to listen to some of the comments that we have heard today in relation to the schemes.  The Court of Auditors indicated some time ago that there was a problem in relation to proper accountability as regards the schemes operating separately. Therefore it was important to come forward with proposals where we could reflect those particular concerns, such as the proposal that is before us in this report which is to merge the two schemes together. Even though the schemes have been evaluated before, I think that the decision of the new Commission to look at all of the pieces of legislation and all of the reports before it will strengthen the scheme going forward.  I would draw the attention of Members to the draft evaluation report which was published on 12 May 2015 and where the evidence provided through that particular evaluation report clearly indicates the need for the European Union to become involved and stay involved in these particular schemes, because otherwise a lot of the Member States perhaps would not actually implement programmes that would have improved the consumption of agricultural products or engage in healthy living – not always a priority for some Member States. Through these education programmes, some food could be provided for less well-off children in schools and, of course, they could ensure that we have, as many speakers have mentioned, an inter-relationship between urban populations and rural populations in relation to fruit and vegetables and milk products.  I think that many people do not recognise that the schemes are actually optional and voluntary. Even though some speakers here indicated that they were against these schemes being part of the competence of the European Union, the Member States which they are from are actually implementing the schemes. For example, the Netherlands and Sweden have difficulties about having the EU involved in the schemes, but they continue to implement those schemes in their Member States. Therefore, in my view, it does bring added value to have an overarching EU framework in assisting Member States to implement these particular schemes. I want to conclude by thanking Mr Tarabella and the shadow rapporteurs for bringing forward these proposals. I take on board the concerns that have been expressed, as well, in relation to bringing the Council on board in relation to these proposals. The final evaluation report will be available in mid-June which is not too far away.

Mr President, first of all, I would like to express my thanks to Paulo De Castro, my coordinator, who trusted me in the preparation of this report, to Hélène Cuisinier, from the secretariat of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, who has been very sharp on this work, as well as to Maggie Coulthard, from my political group, and alexandra Ionna Leone, my assistant. I will try to answer a few questions and objections from Members of Parliament. To begin with, I would like to welcome the Commission's initial proposal, which was in line with the restriction of products and in the direction of the public health objective. In response to Mr Rompuy, I would like to say that my group and I support Amendment 50 of the Green Group, which aims to eliminate taste enhancers. So I can reassure him on that point. We have talked a lot about local fruits and products, which are effectively supported and privileged, as well as those from organic production. But you also have to add seasonal fruits, because in a region like mine, for example, eating only local fruits in winter would be like eating exclusively apples and pears, which would soon be boring for children. Although they are not produced in my country and do not come from the region, oranges and citrus fruits, as well as kiwis , to which I will return later, are seasonal fruits and are useful for health in particular because of their vitamin C intake.  With regard to the amendment on chocolate milk, I want to make it clear that I am not an enemy of this product - my ten-year-old son drinks it, not every day, but he drinks it - but, having said that, 200 ml of chocolate milk equivalent to 20 grams of sugar, that is, half of the maximum intake tolerated and recommended for school-age children. , which is far too sweet.  Mr Flanagan and Mr Ashworth were talking about the responsibility of the European Union. It is clear that in 24 out of 28 countries too little fruit and vegetables are consumed, so if Europe can help Member States improve this aspect, why do you stubbornly refuse the European Union's help? I don't understand. Europe, without having a right to interfere, has the right to have good ideas, hoping that the Member States will apply them properly. There will be no war between bananas and kiwis, it would be useless. They are both useful fruits - banana for its natural sugar intake, kiwi for its vitamin C intake. I would remind you that there are European bananas in the outermost regions, which are also preferred and which, if not, will be replaced by fair-trade bananas, thus obviously trying to favour small producers. Finally, I will express a regret, Mr President. Food, fruits, vegetables, milk are important, but perhaps we could have talked about other drinks. Given the increase in soda consumption and the proliferation of these products, perhaps we should have promoted drinking water, which can be a useful accompaniment. I hope that it will be valued in educational measures. Like you, Commissioner, I hope that the Council, which is now rather conservative with regard to practices, will follow the common view of the Commission and Parliament, in order to move towards a healthier diet through this programme of distribution of fruit, vegetables and milk in schools.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 2, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 119, "date": "2015-05-27.json", "name": "Ryszard CZARNECKI", "mepid": "28372", "text": "   I close the debate.

Worryingly, the consumption of fresh fruit and vegetables has declined in Europe in 2005-2010. The decline in fruit consumption is 9.4 per cent and vegetables 10.3 per cent. Among the many factors that determine a healthy diet, sufficient consumption of fruit and vegetables plays a particular role. According to WHO research, insufficient consumption of fruit and vegetables was ranked as a high number of attributable risk factors for premature mortality in the EU. The diet, which includes different types of fruit and vegetables on a daily basis, is very important for children in order to increase the nutritional value of meals and to maintain the recommended body weight. The European Association for the Study of Obesity estimates that between 12,000,000 and 16,000,000 children are overweight in Europe. The number of obese children is between 3 and 4.5 million.

Respect for human rights is a basic principle of EU foreign policy and therefore features regularly in our dialogue with partners in the entire world, including Eritrea. In this dialogue, and also publically, we raise our concerns that Eritrea continues to violate its obligations and does not respect fundamental human rights. We urge concrete gestures such as the liberation of the prisoners – notably Mr Dawit Isaak, an EU-Eritrean citizen – who have been detained incommunicado since 2001. The European Union also raises those concerns in international forums, notably at meetings of the UN Human Rights Council, where we appeal to Eritrea to cooperate with the UN Special Rapporteur and the UN Commission of Inquiry for Eritrea and to give them access to Eritrea. That said, it is our belief that continued engagement with Eritrea is the best option for a number of reasons. Firstly, engagement creates the possibility to stress the need for concrete changes and progress across the board, and to insist on the importance of adhering to international standards on human rights. Isolation rarely helps in these circumstances. Secondly, engagement allows us to continue supporting the population and improving living conditions. Lastly, engagement contributes to peace and stability in the country and the wider region. Some minor progress has recently been achieved: for example, in December 2014 the Government of Eritrea announced that the previously indefinite duration of national service would be limited to 18 months for new recruits. This is an important decision, since the open-ended duration of national service was a major push factor in migration. The decision now needs to be implemented. We must do what we can to alleviate the huge stress upon Eritrea’s population. They are facing a problematic food security situation and a lack of economic prospects and opportunities. The sharpest evidence of their despair is the outflow of people, especially young people, many of whom venture on a dangerous journey, trying to enter the EU by illegal means, and are easy prey for traffickers. That is why European Union development projects currently being implemented under the 10th European Development Fund (EDF), in the amount of EUR 53.7 million and covering the period from 2008 to now, relate mainly to agriculture and food security. The second sector is governance, with the focus on capacity-building and access to justice at grassroots level, in particular through community courts. Our aid is provided through projects and not through budget support. Strict monitoring procedures ensure that EU aid directly benefits the people, creates jobs and reduces poverty. There is no support to the central government in Eritrea. As regards the programming of the aid under the 11th European Development Fund, discussions are ongoing. It is proposed that EU development aid will support social and economic development, including through increasing access to renewable energy, in order to achieve tangible results for the population such as the creation of more jobs and the improvement of people’s livelihoods in Eritrea. In addition, support for governance-related activities that would promote sustainable economic growth is also provided for. Apart from the EU cooperation financed from the European Development Fund, the European Union has also allocated thematic funds in order to support, and build the capacity of, formal and informal civil society organisations active in the areas of social, cultural and economic rights. Although the context currently allows for only limited visibility, this engagement with non-state actors does encourage plurality and will strengthen citizens’ participation, including in the medium and long term. Let me say, too, a few words about migration. Eritrea is a key country of origin. By improving the livelihoods of the people of Eritrea, development aid is addressing and will continue to address the root causes of migration. Eritrea is an active partner in the Khartoum Process, under which human rights issues related to migrants and refugees will be addressed, as agreed in the Ministerial Declaration signed in Rome on 28 November 2014. Our development aid should also be seen in a regional context. Through regional projects the European Union is linking Eritrea better to the region. Recent developments in Yemen are of particular concern and may have serious implications for the stability of the region and of Eritrea, which is located just across the Red Sea from Yemen. The EU support for the population enables people to be less vulnerable to radicalisation, and EU aid should thus also be seen as contributing to peace and stability in the region. I would be happy to hear your views on EU engagement with Eritrea.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "PPE", "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 138, "date": "2015-05-27.json", "name": "Davor Ivo STIER", "mepid": "119435", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Club.

Two-thirds of the population is below the poverty line. Although this country is relatively small in african terms, it has somewhere around 6 million inhabitants, about 30% of all applications for political asylum in the European Union are currently coming from Eritrea.  The reason is a systematic violation of human rights, a dictatorship in Eritrea that has been going on too long. Many call Eritrea the largest prison in the world or African North Korea. So where are our priorities, priorities and our development policies? In the 10th European Development Fund, priorities, as you said, were mainly related to food safety, to rural development.  No one doubts that these are important topics and that if our help goes towards the citizens, towards the people of Eritrea, not towards a dictatorial government, then it is justified. However, good governance, the issue of building inclusive institutions and respect for human rights must be embedded in the 11th European Development Fund. Simply, if we want to coordinately lead development foreign and security policy and of course immigration policy, it must also become a priority of our development assistance.

That's Eritrea.  But if we talk about Eritrea today is not so much because we are concerned about human rights in Eritrea, but because we have received the warning, the warning that there are many Eritrean citizens who are leaving their country, who are emigrating or seeking asylum or refuge. That's what makes us talk about Eritrea today, that's the truth.  With a fairly small population of six million, in the past year alone, 300,000 Eritreans left their country. Many of these who leave their country are children, they are very young children, they are children of 15, 16, 17 years old. Most of them live in refugee camps and, as you know, there is a very serious problem of human trafficking and organized torture on the Sinai Peninsula. The Commission has announced a possible aid package: three times what has been earmarked so far. It's good news; but the question, Commissioner, is whether we are really going to allocate this aid to the Eritreans or whether we will be able to maintain the status quo of the dictator of Eritrea without helping the citizens. How are we going to know that this money is not going to end up benefiting, as has happened so far, the dictator?  On the other hand, we are not talking about asylum and family reunification, which is something that many citizens do need, those who have been victims of the exodus from Eritrea.

It has been a country without democratic elections since 1993. Just over a year ago, President Afewerki said without complexes: \"If anyone in this country thinks there may be democracy or a multi-party system, let them go to another world to think of such things.\"  We are talking about a government that permanently uses the state of emergency and which recruits men, women and children to its army in a forced and indefinite manner; arbitrarily arrests and tortures; that restricts freedom of expression, conscience and movement and suppresses religious freedom. A government that provides logistical and financial support to terrorist groups. Do we need more reason to evaluate what we do with Eritrea?  But Eritrea is also Alganesh Fessaha, president of the Italian NGO Gandhi, the doctor who travels through Sudan, Ethiopia and Sinai to work at the origin, from where more than 5,000 Eritreans flee every month to Europe, escaping the Afewerki regime.  Alganesh Fessaha has managed to rescue hundreds of migrants kidnapped in Sinai. Nearly half of the six million Eritreans are under the age of 15, and thousands are the skinny boys with terrible stories behind them in Lampedusa, who eat the \"zighini\", the dish that reminds them of their land, prepared by the nuns thanks to Alganesh's recipe.  Alganesh Fessaha says that kidnappers call their families in Eritrea so they can hear their screams as they martyr them: they melt plastic into their skin, beat them to death or burn their hair with kerosene,\" he adds. They demand a ransom that claims it can amount to $45,000: \"If you don't pay, we'll sell one of your corneas or a kidney,\" the traffickers tell their relatives.  So far, Alganesh Fessaha has managed, yes, to free hundreds of them; but hope for establishing a way in which Eritrea not only enters the inclusive governance that Ban Ki-moon has told us about this afternoon, in which Europe may be that locomotive that takes it out of that repression and that lack of respect for human rights, is in our hands.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 142, "date": "2015-05-27.json", "name": "Marie-Christine VERGIAT", "mepid": "96858", "text": "  on behalf of the GUE/NGL group. Mr President, I would first like to thank all the political groups, who have agreed that this debate should finally be on our agenda. The Khartoum process, launched by the Italian Presidency for its former colonies, aims to revive dialogue and cooperation with Eritrea, Africa's worst dictatorship. Under the eleventh European Development Fund (EDF), a figure of 312 million aid was first published, and then the information disappeared from the Commission's website. The tenth EDF, on the other hand, provided only 122 million, in the end reduced to 52 million due to lack of implementation. What has happened since then, other than the fact that Eritreans are the second most represented nationality among those crossing the Mediterranean to Italy?  According to documents from the SSAE (Social Assistance Service for Emigrants), three migration projects would be funded in Eritrea.  The first would be to strengthen the Eritrean government's capacity to combat human trafficking. Commissioner, this government has just declared that the perpetrators and organisers of this trafficking are human rights activists and Western journalists. Two years ago, it was the CIA. Who are you going to work with, if not with this corrupt government and its affiliates? There is therefore a risk of funding a new wave of repression in a country where the number of journalists imprisoned is no longer counted, half of whom are reported to have died in detention. The second project would build the country's judicial capacity. That's right, we have room. The Constitution has never been implemented and there is not even a penal code.

A large part of this has not been spent because it is impossible to spend money, for example, on large-scale infrastructure works in a country where workers are not working voluntarily, but are, for example, conscripts who actually act as slaves. The money allocated at the time was therefore not spent. I can well imagine that you are now trying again to make funds available for this.

Eritrea, as a state, has a terrible record on freedom of the press and human rights abuses. In fact in 2011 the country refused to grant entry to an independent UN reporter out of fear of what they might find, and only this week the European Union has called on Eritrea’s President to free reporters, bloggers and prisoners alike.  But the benign reality is that the EU suffers from its own hypocrisy and delusion on what development aid might achieve. The EU on one hand condemns dictators, and then gives countries aid. It then wants to tackle migration into Europe, but implements harmful policies. It throws money around without any accountability. And all too often, sanctions are applied that harm the actual innocent and do not deal with the guilty.  Only this week, the African Economic Output Report stated that Eritrea’s GDP has gone up to 2.1%, and that is almost double where it was in 2013. This country is rich and could easily mine gold, iron, copper and nickel – and those are resources that most countries would dream of having available to them. What Eritrea now needs is to be coerced to diversify its economy away from a completely mining-based economy. The people need jobs, they need job security, and most of all, they need an opportunity to escape poverty.  Foreign aid just does not tackle that.

Since 2001, this Swedish-Eritrean journalist has been imprisoned in the most despicable circumstances without trial, without contact with the outside world. Mr President, this is one of the most serious human rights violations with a Swedish connection to date, and it is high time to increase the pressure on the Eritrean dictatorship. Britain and Canada have taken steps to prevent Eritrea's western embassies from enforcing the regime's forced taxation of exiled citizens. Joint action by the EU Member States in this regard could lead to a significant disruption in the flow of money to the dictatorship in Asmara. It would also respond to a direct call from the UN Security Council. Let us therefore work within the EU to stop the illegal tax collection of the Eritrean regime. Let us work together for increased and effective sanctions against the representatives of the dictatorship and let us link the development aid that we are discussing today to clearer demands for compliance with human rights. 5 000 long days have passed since Dawit Isaak was imprisoned.

Surprisingly or not, the UN Secretary-General drew our attention to the growing concerns related to radicalisation, which is very relevant to the discussion we are about to have. It is also remarkable that our debate today takes place almost at the same moment as the UN Security Council is holding an open debate on the protection of journalists in conflict situations. Strong, professional and independent mass media are indispensable for effective democracy, economic growth and development across the globe. As early as 1946, at its very first session, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution affirming that freedom of information is the cornerstone of all freedoms. The European Union, as a union based on democratic values, fully subscribes to this principle – freedom of expression is amongst the fundamental values protected by Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union. Nonetheless, it is important to recall that the freedom of expression depends upon the safety of journalists and media professionals. Freedom of expression, both offline and online, and strengthening the independence of the media are long-standing priorities of Latvia. We promote them as a part of our Presidency of the Council of the European Union, and in international organisations. Unfortunately, cyber-attacks, including targeting the media, have become part of modern hybrid warfare and terrorist attacks. Therefore, we need to mobilise all our instruments and combine all our efforts to minimise the risks of such attacks. Today, I will pay particular attention to three specific aspects. First of all, cybersecurity, secondly, combating propaganda and radicalisation, and thirdly, a broader response to hybrid threats. First, in recent years, cybersecurity has become a matter of the highest political priority for the European Union. Given the very prominent role that the media, especially electronic media, play in the daily life of modern society, increasingly often they fall victim to cyber-attacks. Hence, any attack against the media should be seen not only as an attack against a fundamental freedom; depending on the scale and damage caused by such an attack, it may be seen as an attack against critical infrastructure. The Council has already come up with a number of initiatives with the aim of ensuring that the internet is open and secure. More initiatives are in the pipeline. In June 2013 the Council adopted Conclusions on the Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union where it recognised the need to put in place safeguards and take measures to protect the cyber-domain, in both the civilian and military fields, aiming at developing an EU response to cybersecurity incidents and challenges. The same year, together with the European Parliament, we adopted the Directive on attacks against information systems. This was a very important piece of legislation to respond to the increasing concern about terrorist or politically motivated cyber-attacks against information systems, which form part of the critical infrastructure of Member States or of the Union. This Directive also identifies the trend towards dangerous and recurrent large-scale attacks against such systems or particular functions in the public or private sector. Today we are working on another very important piece of legislation – the proposal for a Directive on network and information security. This Directive will enhance cybersecurity preparedness, capabilities at national level and cooperation between Member States and across the EU. It will also stimulate a culture of risk management in the public and private sector. We are confident that the constructive work on the draft Directive will allow a swift conclusion of the negotiations and a timely adoption. Allow me also to mention briefly the importance of the review of the Internal Security Strategy. The Commission communication of last month on the European Agenda on Security prioritised combating terrorism, organised crime and cybercrime as interlinked priority areas with a strong cross-border dimension. The Council is currently working on defining its immediate priorities on this subject. We look forward to working in close cooperation with the Commission and the European Parliament on concrete measures to be taken with the aim of further shaping this policy area. Secondly, we should not forget that in modern-day hybrid warfare, the media can be both targets and weapons, victims and aggressors. For this reason, the discussion of cyber-attacks against the media goes hand-in-hand with another revived phenomenon – aggressive propaganda specifically targeting fundamental European values. We have been realistic in recognising that legislative work alone will not produce sufficient results. Effective and creative practical preventive and counter-measures that go beyond the necessary legislative minimum are equally important. Today the EU is faced with the reality that the media broadcasting for the European public are no longer there solely to inform, educate and entertain. Some states or organisations increasingly use the media for the achievement of military and political goals, turning against the fundamental common European values, attempting to manipulate public opinion. Today the media are being exploited to spread aggressive anti-European propaganda and to incite hatred. The Council remains fully aware of and concerned by this dangerous phenomenon that poses a threat to European security and public order. Discussions are ongoing as to what effective response mechanisms may be created. The Council recognises the urgent need for further action addressing radicalisation at the EU, national and local levels. Hence, Europol has been tasked to set up an EU Internet Referral Unit to target content promoting terrorism or violent extremism. Thirdly, the existence of complex external threats to the security environment in Europe should not be underestimated. We should therefore strive for better synergies and closer links between internal and external security, aiming at ensuring effectiveness in internal coordination and cooperation in areas such as cyber-defence and strategic communication. Being guided by this logic, on 18 May this year we decided to join our efforts to work on a set of proposals to help counter hybrid threats and foster the resilience of the EU and its Member States. The proposals will address the need for closer intra-EU and international cooperation with the aim of developing greater situational awareness and early-warning mechanisms for countering the hybrid warfare threats in areas such as cyber-defence, strategic communications, border security, energy security, and others. We expect to deliver the results by the end of 2015. I would like to conclude by underlining that today we live in a digital era, where virtual reality is no less real than the real world. For this reason, cyber-attacks should and must be seen to be as dangerous as attacks on real structures. The media increasingly often fall victim to such cyber-attacks, given that they rely on information technology and given the prominent role they play in modern society. Therefore, if the 20th century was marked as an era when the fundamental principles of freedom of expression were written in stone, thus giving the media the platform for development, the 21st  century is marked by the need to effectively respond to the emerging and growing new threats against media freedoms. We must spare no effort to protect our fundamental values in the digital environment.

This attack, as you know, was short-lived and did not cause serious harm, but it was very visible and serves as a reminder of the potential for cybercriminals to impact our lives. We need to defend ourselves better against this sort of attack, no matter who is responsible and what their motivation is. The benefits we enjoy from technology need to be protected against criminals and terrorists who want to undermine our values, spread their message or simply steal money. Greater cybersecurity is something we can all contribute to – the European Union, Member States, companies and individuals. From the European Union’s perspective, we are engaged in a wide range of activities to improve cybersecurity. Only a few weeks ago, the Commission published the European Agenda on Security. This document sets out three key transnational threats to be addressed in the security domain: terrorism, organised crime and cybercrime. The attack on TV5 was a cybercrime which tried to glorify terrorism and promote the nihilist message of ISIS, or Da’esh. It is therefore at the heart of what we will prioritise in the coming years. On cybercrime, the Agenda proposes reinforcing the capacity of law enforcement authorities, in particular through the European Cybercrime Centre of Europol. It also proposes to address the obstacles to criminal investigations on cybercrime such as access to evidence. Implementing existing legislation on attacks against information systems will be another priority. To combat terrorism, the Agenda proposes to enhance the role of Europol further, by establishing a European Counter-Terrorism Centre. This will be a secure centre for information exchange among national law enforcement authorities. It will build on the successes of the European Cybercrime Centre. Terrorists are exploiting the Internet to spread their propaganda, radicalise and recruit, communicate, and plan and direct terrorist activity. In response to this worrying trend, the Commission will launch an EU-level forum with the Internet industry. The forum will look at how we can enhance our collective efforts in addressing these issues – both in terms of reducing accessibility to terrorist material and in countering the terrorist narrative online. Europol will also establish an Internet Referral Unit on 1 July to help Member States identify terrorist material online and then refer it to the industry with a view to its swift removal. Cooperation with the private sector is of critical importance, with public-private partnerships to structure a common effort to fight online crime. In the first half of 2016 the Commission will propose establishing a public-private partnership on cybersecurity in the area of technologies and solutions for online network security. I would like to highlight the fact that the European Union has already done a lot to address cybersecurity. I have already mentioned the European Cybercrime Centre, which was established within Europol in 2013. It acts as a focal point in the European Union’s fight against cybercrime. In 2013 the European Union adopted a cybersecurity strategy. It aims to strengthen cyber resilience, reduce cybercrime and advance international cyberspace policy. Finally, the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA) also contributes to the European Union’s response to cyber-security issues.

We have now heard a great deal from the Commission and the Council on cybercrime and cyberattacks, and I think I can say, Minister, that I am somewhat surprised at the positive words you have said about the council's contribution, which– admittedly in a difficult situation in which you are in the Presidency of the Council – has been making the efforts that have been going on here for years at European level. , unfortunately, has not taken a significant step forward in the last nine months of our trialogue negotiations. These incidents, which we are discussing today – be it TV5, or even a few days later the cyberattack against the Belgian newspaper Le Soir – show that if we in the European Union were finally to succeed in increasing the resilience of the critical infrastructure, we would no longer see such incidents to the extent that we see today. Unfortunately, in the European Union, in the continent of 500 million citizens, we still have a large number of companies, of infrastructures, which are more or less unprepared to react to such incidents. This cannot be a portable condition in the long run.

This was deliberately used in the hope of forcing us to relinquish a piece of freedom of expression. When the media change their work because they are afraid of being victims of terrorist acts, it threatens our democratic society. Another self-evident thing to be said is that we should be aware that the Internet is not the cause of terror; rather, it is being instrumentalized.

On the public side, in only a few years what was a game for hackers, vandalising media websites and Twitter accounts has been transformed into tools of misinformation and panic-mongering. False information placed on Twitter has already led to panics on the stock market. Cyber-attacks on the media have been used in warfare to cut off information to citizens: such attacks go all the way back to the war in Georgia. And now hacked broadcasts are being used as propaganda for terrorist organisations. On the other side, journalists’ email accounts and networks are being hacked.

They are part of an ongoing threat to the free press, but there is still a lack of an open analysis of how we can make our media more resilient. As part of this analysis, European governments need to ask themselves whether their own actions are part of the problem. Europe is still exporting surveillance software that has been used to suppress journalists in Bahrain and Morocco. European governments are participating in the sale of unknown security holes in software instead of reporting them publicly and making sure that they are fixed. That leaves software vulnerabilities that are also used in domestic media. Legislation by Member States against so-called hacker tools criminalises the study of these tools, which is a vital part of proper IT security training. After the TV5 attack, the Commission was quick to highlight the ongoing negotiations on the Directive on Network and Information Security as a response, including its possible extension. I would like to ask how we can come to an agreement on this directive and whether it needs to be extended in relation to some of the topics I have just mentioned. What we need is a clear commitment to a reliable and trustworthy IT infrastructure policy, one that does not trade in short-term gains for secret services at the cost of the security of everybody else. If you want to protect the free press, then fight the introduction of government-mandated backdoors that can also be used by criminals, promote the use of open source software for all security-sensitive applications, present us with a legislative proposal for whistleblower protection and provide access to easy-to-use encryption technology for everybody, including journalists.

But we must not be consumed with accusations about which country supports such attacks. The truth is that all major powers, whether east or west, use all the means at their disposal, including cyberattacks. It is at least hypocritical to claim that only Russia or China are responsible and not to recognise the fact that the United States of America and some countries of the European Union have exactly the same strategy.

This is an alarming result, and Der Spiegel also writes this week that in the US, a hacker in an ordinary passenger plane has connected his notebook to the box that controls the entertainment program, thereby pushing the engines. In other words, the security authorities are sounding the alarm and fearing further such dramatic attacks, and the attack on TV5 is basically going in the same direction. All these examples are now dramatic, unsettling, frightening and present us with new challenges. The digitization of infrastructure, economic value chains, and the world of life not only opens up opportunities, but also poses risks.

They are increasingly threatening our fundamental rights and our way of life.  Unfortunately, there is a huge gap between a security system, based essentially on national strategies and borders, and the globality of the network and its threats, which are becoming less and less random and increasingly the work of professionals behind whom criminal organisations and even governments are hiding. We must therefore move from declarations of principle by European leaders to concrete commitments in the definition of coherent and effective legislation. A striking example of the gap between words and deeds is the ongoing trialogues relating to the directive on the security of computer networks. The Commission's proposal, significantly strengthened by the European Parliament at first reading, is certainly a first step towards the creation of a common European strategy, providing for significant forms of operational cooperation and prevention and rapid response mechanisms, thus ensuring a resilient European network. Unfortunately, the adoption of this directive, despite the Efforts of the European Parliament in seeking a compromise, is currently threatened by the attitude of the majority of Member States, which are obviously still too jealous of their competences in the field of security and so short-sighted that they do not focus on the new global nature of cyber threats.

As I have already mentioned in my opening remarks, cyber-attacks, including those targeting media, are an increasingly worrying trend. The growing sophistication of cyber-attacks and cyber threats around the world, and their use as an element of hybrid warfare and terrorist attacks, oblige us to stand on high alert and continue working to improve our capabilities to tackle this threat. We should continue to invest our efforts in guaranteeing the implementation of the existing tools and the full use of the EU initiatives dedicated to the fight against cyber threats. We should also continue and intensify work to provide for new and more comprehensive responses to the constantly evolving challenges posed by this threat. The Council remains fully committed to work constructively towards the adoption and effective implementation of concrete measures in that respect. Mr Schwab and some other honourable Members have reminded us of the importance of reaching an agreement on the Directive on Network and Information Security. Today the Presidency and the European Parliament received key input from the Commission on its recommendations for the most challenging issues in the directive, regarding its scope and several aspects of implementation, that will be instrumental in making the last remaining strides towards a compromise between the Council and Parliament. With this directive the EU is going into unchartered territory in attempting to make our new digital lives more safe and secure. This is, admittedly, not an easy process, as developing legislation on a highly technical issue that touches at the same time on national security is no easy task. The Latvian Presidency continues and will continue to work to make significant progress on this issue by the end of June. We are confident that the good spirit of cooperation which prevails will allow us to reach a timely conclusion of the negotiations on the Directive on Network and Information Security in order to provide the EU and its Member States with an instrument to improve its preparedness and capabilities for action in case of cyber-attacks. At the same time, regulation of such innovative sectors must be achieved in a prudent and balanced manner in order to avoid placing an unnecessary burden on an industry that is creating growth and jobs. We shall also continue our efforts towards introducing effective and creative practical, preventive and control measures that will go beyond the necessary legislative minimum. Strategic communication, countering propaganda, and international cooperation are on our list of priorities. At the same time, despite this late hour, I would like to recall the root cause of such attacks targeting independent and professional media. Dramatic changes in the media landscape, in particular the introduction of new technologies, have resulted in an unprecedented flow of information. Despite draconian measures, neither totalitarian regimes nor terrorists are able to firmly close the tap and fully prevent the information flow. Journalists’ independent voices and reports give the international community a unique insight into realities on the ground, including in conflict zones. It is thanks to journalists’ courage that the world is aware of what happened in Chernobyl, Chechnya, Libya, Rwanda and Srebrenica and what is happening in North Korea, Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and Ukraine. The media serve as a catalyst for a rapid and effective global response, and thus they are vital to the survival of a democratic society. It is for this reason that all of our activities aimed at improving security, resilience and capabilities should go hand-in-hand with activities aimed at safeguarding and reinforcing the ability of the media to provide independent and reliable information.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "S&D", "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 207, "date": "2015-05-27.json", "name": "Sylvie GUILLAUME", "mepid": "96952", "text": "   The debate is closed.

They are exposed to abuse and violence and are denied their rights to health and education. They are robbed of their childhood. The UN Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict, Zainab Hawa Bangura, has denounced horrible sexual abuses and organised rapes committed by Daesh/ISIS. Young girls are sold naked at the market and promised as brides at a price after recruitment. We also see an increased number of children being given in marriage in refugee camps, as desperate parents try to find a way out of poverty. I want to mention the heart-breaking story of Heda, a young girl from Chechnya forced to marry a man three times her age, despite her clear opposition. The life of the journalist who reported this is now under threat. Just last week an international conference on child marriage was organised by the NGO Girls Not Brides. It emerged that there are camps in countries like Zambia and Mozambique to initiate girls in sex and prepare them for marriage, sometimes before they turn nine. These are just a few chilling stories, but there are thousands more and none of us can remain unmoved by them. Child marriage is not only a violation of children’s rights but also a form of violence against women. Unfortunately, only 11 Member States have ratified the Council of Europe’s Istanbul Convention on combating violence against women that recognises child marriage as a criminal offence. I therefore call on all the Member States to ratify the convention and on the Commission actively to encourage more Member States to enforce it. We cannot close our eyes to this horrific practice. It is time to act in order to end it. We are talking about children. I am proud that the EPP Group took the initiative in this public debate in plenary and I warmly thank the Committee on Women’s Rights and its chair for this report. Let us join forces across political groups and at all levels to put an end to child marriage. The consequences are devastating: girls’ health is at stake, with serious risk of complications in pregnancy and childbirth, and even HIV infections; and girls are exposed to sexual abuse, domestic violence and even honour killing. It is also a question of empowerment. Girls forced to marry are forced out of school, and education offers the best chance for girls to develop skills and have a role in society. Keeping girls out of school is a way to condemn them to poverty and discrimination. I welcome the fact that the European External Action Service and the Member States have made child marriage a priority in the EU Action Plan for Human Rights and Democracy and the EU Development Cooperation Gender Action Plan. However, progress has been slow and uneven. I therefore call on the Vice-President of the Commission/ High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy to implement this commitment in all the dialogues and programmes with third countries and regional organisations. The upcoming International Conference on Financing for Development, in Addis Ababa in July 2015, will be a test for our leaders. Child marriage should be included as a priority in the post-2015 development agenda. We need to work with law enforcement authorities, the judicial system and the police, and also to provide training and technical assistance to promote the adoption and enforcement of legislation prohibiting early and forced marriages, including a minimum age for marriage. However, this is not enough. The EU also has an important role in supporting information and awareness campaigns, and our challenge is to combat stereotypes. Violence against children and women should never be justified by culture, tradition or religion, and it is time to break the vicious circle of poverty, submission and violence. We need to work together with religious communities, schools and the media to change attitudes. We need to help families and community leaders to keep girls in school and protect them from violence. Let me thank the many international organisations, including UNICEF, and the many NGOs and civil society bodies who are doing a great job. This is about girls’ dignity, and our message to the 50 million girls a year should be: ‘You are not alone.’ The European Parliament will remain committed to work with all concerned to keep at the top of the EU agenda a zero tolerance policy against child marriage.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 2, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 221, "date": "2015-05-27.json", "name": "Anna Maria CORAZZA BILDT", "mepid": "96674", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, early or forced marriages constitute a violation of girls and women’s human rights and are a brutal form of discrimination rooted in gender inequalities. Protecting children against harmful practices, including child, early and forced marriage, is a priority for the European Union. This has been reiterated in various policy documents, including the latest Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy. And rest assured: the successor to the EU Action Plan on Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment in Development will foster women and girls’ physical and psychological integrity, with a specific focus on the fight against harmful traditional practices. We all know that addressing child marriage is a very complex issue. It requires a comprehensive strategy that covers the adoption of protective legislation, the enhancement of access to quality education, the promotion of gender equality, and a change in mentalities and social norms. It also requires adequate funding and well-targeted projects. We are committed to ensuring both. At the Girl Summit in London in July 2014 the European Union committed to allocating more than EUR 100 million for the next seven years to gender equality and children’s wellbeing under the Programme on Global Public Goods and Challenges. Additional projects are also envisaged under the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights and under the Pan-African Programme in order to support the African Committee of Experts on the Rights and Welfare of Children, which is the only region-focused children’s rights instrument in the world. In order to translate our policy into actions on the ground, the European Union has developed a series of projects and actions in the framework of our cooperation with regional organisations. Also, through political dialogue the European Union regularly engages with countries where early and forced marriages take place. Eighty-four EU delegations worldwide have prioritised children’s rights in their human rights country strategies. Human Rights are at the heart of our partnership with the African continent under the Joint Africa-EU Strategy. At the 4th Africa-EU Summit in 2014, it was agreed to work together to ensure the full respect of human rights, international law, gender equality, and to fight all forms of discrimination, racism and xenophobia. The European Union participated at the Casablanca donor meeting on Ending Child, Early and Forced Marriage last week, following the ‘Girls Not Brides’ conference for a global partnership to end child marriage. All EU framework agreements with third countries – such as association and cooperation agreements concluded since 1995 – include a human rights clause. Through it, the parties to the agreement declare their shared commitment to the promotion and protection of human rights. It also gives the EU a clear legal basis on which to raise human rights issues with the respective countries. And we regularly do so. Moreover, some EU framework agreements include articles on human rights cooperation and on cooperation related to gender equality. On this basis, specific cooperation initiatives can be agreed to fight against child marriage. The European Union welcomed the entry into force in August 2014 of the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence. So far 37 countries, of which 23 are EU Member States, have signed the Convention and 18 countries, of which 11 are EU Member States, have ratified it. National ratification processes are progressing well. Five Member States ratified in 2014 alone. The Commission services are also examining the legal, policy and practical implications of a possible EU accession to the Convention. As part of its initiatives to tackle violence against women, the Commission funds national awareness-raising campaigns by Member States, grassroots projects by civil society organisations and European networks in this area. These campaigns, projects and networks play an important role in raising awareness of the Convention and in promoting its ratification and proper implementation.

At the same time, they also contradict international law, as expressed in the Convention on the Rights of the Child. I therefore welcome and support any initiative that increases children's chances of their childhood not being terminated prematurely and often forcibly by forced marriage. However, it is not possible to protest in one breath against forced marriage of children, while at the same time highlighting their right to family planning. It seems absurd to me if, in one sentence, female colleagues highlight childhood, and in the next sentence they talk about children, girls, as adult women. If we want to do something to put an end to the practice of child marriage in the world, we must, above all, demand compliance with the Charter of The Rights of the Child from the partner countries of the European Union where this phenomenon exists. I therefore share the third question and believe that the Commission is monitoring the situation of children at risk in third countries. I am of the opinion that, in dialogue with them, it is necessary to insist consistently on the end of the practice of child marriage, even at the cost of cutting official development aid. But pushing through elements of gender ideology under the pretext of protecting the innocence of childhood, I find this inappropriate and ultimately ineffective.

Forced marriage is not only an attack on human rights, but it is a violation of children's rights and is violence against women. The consequences of early marriage are devastating for girls, because it is not only health problems, sexual abuse, domestic violence, but above all the destruction of their future because it destroys their ability to empower therself, to develop through education.

There is an inherent danger to making ‘traditional values’ the standard for human rights. Not only do these values evolve constantly, they are also difficult and dangerous to define. It is within this context that culture cannot be used to undermine the universality of the human rights principles, which are applicable to the practice of early and forced marriage of girls. Firstly, the EU ensures that gender equality is on the agenda in every dialogue with third countries, especially for development cooperation. However, it should keep on mainstreaming gender equality in all policy areas and programmes, especially inside the Union. Too many girls in Europe are still deprived of their right to education, because they are forced into marriage. Secondly, there is an urgent need for reliable data on forced marriages inside the European Union. Lastly, Parliament has urged the Commission in the past to promote the national ratification of the Istanbul Convention and even launched the procedure for the EU’s accession to it.

But on an issue that is very important, which is very difficult to understand.  First of all, I would like to say that our task is to protect the rights of children, forced marriages do not only concern girls, but also concern boys. Children are the group that is most vulnerable. Children in Europe must have the right to make free choices, it is not possible to dictate who to marry. That is why a number of initiatives are being launched in Europe. Recently, an initiative was emerged in the UK that if a child wants to avoid being taken to, say, India or another country, they will take a spoonful in their underwear. The staff of the service that checks the child as he passes through the scanner can see this spoon and can actually tell that the child is being taken away for forced marriage.

The percentage is impressive, and the statistics do not stop there: one in four teenage girls is married without her will between fourteen and eighteen years old; a young woman in nine is forcibly married between the ages of ten and fourteen; one in two girls gives birth to a baby while still a teenager in developing countries. We must not forget, at the same time, that in 2009 more than half of the world's population, i.e. 50.6%, lived on less than EUR 0.70 per day, which encourages forced marriages for young women who are still seen as a source of income for their families.

To ensure this, we need to develop overall strategies that impact on issues interrelated to harmful practices, such as birth registration to provide girls with a legal identity, improved access to health services, and issues such as adolescent pregnancy which jeopardise girls’ rights. In particular, I would stress the need to focus on education. Educated girls become empowered women who can challenge social norms. We need awareness-raising, leading to public declarations of the abandonment of harmful practices, and to broad-based social mobilisation and legal and policy measures. We need knowledge so that we can better understand the dynamics of social norms. With regard to data on forced marriages and genital mutilation in EU Member States, the European Institute on Gender Equality is expected to publish a report on 9 June 2015.

Forced marriage often appears as the only possible future for these young girls, who are therefore reduced to an object when they are not simply sold as a commodity. However, this problem should not overshadow the fact that in France, as in other European countries, these practices also exist. Young girls living in the European Union are thus subjected to family pressures and forced married in the parents' country of origin.

In many countries, including mine, this programme has a positive impact on children from poorer backgrounds by providing them with snacks that they would not otherwise have. However, I fundamentally disagree with the narrowing of the range only to fresh fruit, vegetables and drinking milk. The current composition of the assortment, which also includes juices, purees, yoghurts, cheeses and others, is very well used in my country, the Czech Republic.

The two schemes, which are merging in the proposed regulation into a joint aid scheme for the supply of fruit and vegetables, bananas and milk to educational institutions, aim to encourage children to have healthier eating habits. Given the exceptional importance of this scheme, supported by at least EUR 230 million, and its early implementation, today's decision by the European Parliament is a clear signal to Member States to enter into negotiations on that regulation more responsibly and to adopt it as soon as possible with the EP. This will allow the implementation of the common scheme to be implemented and meet the interests and health of primary school children across the EU.

In 2005-2010 the consumption of fresh fruit and vegetables in Europe fell. The decline in fruit consumption is 9.4 per cent and vegetables 10.3 per cent. It is similar to the situation for the total consumption of dairy products in the EU. This decreased by 5 per cent between 2006 and 2011. The European Association for the Study of Obesity estimates that between 12,000,000 and 16,000,000 children are overweight in Europe. The number of obese children is between 3 and 4.5 million. Getting overweight has a negative impact on health and well-being at a young age. For this reason, it is essential to introduce healthy eating habits through educational institutions at a young age.
