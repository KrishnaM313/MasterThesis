First of all, allow me to thank everybody who has contributed to the work, especially the shadow rapporteurs, who have been very helpful, very flexible and very professional in working out a text which I believe can command a fairly large consensus in the House. This was not very easy to achieve. It was very important that the shadows put their work and their commitment into the whole topic. Although I am listed as the author, I have to thank all my colleagues in my Group and especially my advisers, who helped considerably in putting together a text which has a chance of passing, and which I hope will pass on the vote today. We are not getting any closer to the 2020 anti-poverty target. We are actually, by all important measurements, further away from the 2020 anti-poverty targets than when they were originally formulated. This is only partly due to the financial crisis of 2008 – after all, we are in the ninth year after the crisis – so we have a basic structural problem. The report is not on that, but one of the key elements in this attempt to reduce poverty in the European Union is related to basic resources, household costs and household expenditure. I believe that, fundamentally, energy and water are essential resources which are necessary for the survival of any household in the European Union. They are essential especially because we are more and more dependent, individually and in groups, on energy. At the same time, energy prices have been continually rising in the last almost half a decade, which makes the problem more serious than we would have thought at the time when the anti-poverty target was put together. At the time when this was formulated there was a widespread consensus that poverty is a complex global phenomenon which requires complex global treatment. So some of my colleagues, with an honest conviction, thought that selecting a particular type of poverty from the complex web of poverty might be a mistake. I would like to defend the view that energy poverty, or fuel poverty, is one of the most important elements in this, because it usually requires an upfront investment. Simple direct income support is not going to help those who are in this trap, because it requires an upfront investment. That is why what we are asking for primarily is to have a complex policy set which simultaneously attacks all the three elements of energy poverty, one of them being insufficient income, another being energy efficiency – basically the quality of the housing stock in much of Europe. Eastern Europe is significantly different in this respect to Western Europe. In Eastern Europe we do not have a meaningful social housing system, and that contributes to, and exacerbates, the problem. Finally, I would like to mention that we believe that a winter disconnection moratorium on heating is a must. Nobody should die in Europe because of not having heating available.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2, "date": "2016-04-14.json", "name": "Marianne THYSSEN", "mepid": "1832", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Meszerics, for this very comprehensive report, which confirms once again that poverty is a complex phenomenon with several causes, such as the increasing household costs in Europe. I share your concerns about the rise in the number of people at risk of poverty or social exclusion in the European Union. Between 2008 and 2013 the prolonged crisis exacerbated the existing social challenges: poverty, exclusion and inequality. As a result, instead of progressing, we have drifted further away from the Europe 2020 target for reducing poverty. However, there are now some signs of stabilisation, and with concerted efforts we can still make real progress. I take note of your recommendation to invest fully in the fight against poverty and social exclusion – social inclusion is, of course, what we want. The Commission has put social fairness at the core of our agenda, and work has already started to deliver on this commitment. I am convinced that it is only by ensuring that social considerations are better integrated in all of the European policy areas that we can truly achieve the social Europe that we want. I am glad that your report supports our commitment to ensuring a social triple A for the Union. The European pillar of social rights lies at the core of our efforts to achieve that social triple A. The Commission launched a wide-ranging consultation on 8 March. We are counting on you and on Parliament to contribute to this discussion on the social values and rights that should underpin the social model in the 21st century. The draft European pillar of social rights puts a strong focus on fighting poverty and social exclusion. It sets out principles to ensure access to adequate social protection, including minimum income, social housing and activating and enabling benefits and services. It emphasises the work-life balance and family-friendly policies such as childcare and long—term care. Greater prominence is also being given to social considerations in and during the whole European Semester process. We acknowledge the rapporteur’s recommendation to carry out impact assessments of national minimum income schemes and we would like to stress that over the years the Commission has provided policy guidance to the Member States. I would like to mention here the 2008 recommendation on active inclusion, the 2013 Social Investment Package and the various country—specific recommendations addressed to several Member States within the European Semester process. Furthermore, the Commission is providing support to Greece to help it phase in a guaranteed minimum income scheme. In 2015 the Commission finalised a pilot project aimed at developing a methodology for comparable reference budgets across the Member States. A second phase of this project will be launched later this year. Furthermore, the Commission has been funding the development of the European Minimum Income Network. I am glad that the report highlights the importance of skills. I would like to stress that one of the most profound challenges we are facing, and one of our key goals, is to make sure that people in Europe have skills for jobs – skills for jobs which will improve their life chances. This will be at the core of the proposal that I will be presenting on a New Skills Agenda for Europe. I also take note of your call to hold a summit on poverty reduction. Over the last 15 years, the Commission has been helping to organise the European meetings of people experiencing poverty. These annual gatherings aim to step up the participation of people experiencing poverty in policy—making processes at local, national and EU level. I can confirm that they facilitate exchanges and mutual learning, stimulate joint projects and aim to assess different approaches to combating poverty in the light of experience on the ground. They feed directly into the Annual Convention for Inclusive Growth to ensure that the voices of people experiencing poverty are heard. They have also been tackling homelessness, which you rightly mention in your report as an extreme form of social exclusion. We are currently finalising an EU—wide study on housing evictions. Another study on cost—efficient housing policies will be ready by June this year. We have launched a joint project with the OECD to build a housing database entry and we are working together with the Mutual Information System on Social Protection (MISSOC) and Eurostat to further improve housing data. A social experimentation peer review of Housing First was hosted in March this year by Belgium. Finally, we take note of your recommendation to submit a communication on energy poverty. As announced in the communication setting out a new deal for energy consumers, the Commission is exploring how to improve European Union-wide data collection and monitoring of energy poverty. Furthermore, with the review of the Energy Efficiency Directive and the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive, the Commission intends to focus on customer protection, following up the analysis of the Member States’ implementation of their national action plans for the protection of vulnerable energy consumers. In conclusion, I would like to stress once more that it is the Commission’s firm intention to steer the Union more firmly towards social fairness. This means that no one should be left behind. This is a social, political and economic imperative. I therefore express our strong commitment to using all means at the Union’s disposal to fight poverty and social exclusion. I am very grateful that this report is stimulating the debate and helping us to stay on the right path.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 3, "date": "2016-04-14.json", "name": "Julie WARD", "mepid": "124963", "text": "  rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality. – Mr President, I would also like to thank my colleagues for our work together on this report, which cuts across many issues and needs a holistic approach. It is quite clear that we need fresh political ambition to eradicate poverty across Europe, and we must be absolutely clear that there is no way of alleviating poverty unless we also tackle gender inequality. The financial crisis and subsequent austerity measures have had a disproportionate adverse effect on women – far more than men – causing a feminisation of poverty. This report sets out how the European Union must work to address the concerns of vulnerable women, especially single mothers and caregivers and women suffering from multiple discriminations, who are so often left behind because of government policy. The report is another step in the EU’s history of advancing women’s rights and gender equality and is particularly important in the light of austerity. We need a European definition of energy poverty and we need it to include a gender perspective, reflective of the fact that female-headed households are more likely to be energy poor. These are some of the many concrete targeted policies that we propose, which also include investing in research into the causes of female homelessness.

Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for his work and for his ongoing search for consensus. The fight against poverty in all its forms deserves us to overcome partisan divides. It must be a priority for ethical and human reasons, but also because poverty leads to a real economic mess. The main tools of this struggle are the development of employment and the guarantee of an income that allows us to live decently. The Europe 2020 targets are far from being met. If the European Union is to earn its social triple A, it must absolutely reverse this trend. We need to be aware that poor households are particularly affected by different types of costs. This is the case for energy and housing, but also for food, water, health care or public services. We need coherent policies that integrate all factors of poverty. Families living in poverty do not need speech. They need concrete and practical action. I hope that this initiative report will be heard by the Commission and by the Member States as a call to action. I will conclude, if I may, by recalling the words of the late Father Wresinski, founder of ATD Fourth World. He asks us to ask ourselves: what we do, what we say, what we propose enable the realization of a Europe where the poor will finally be freed, does it enable the realization of a Europe of human rights?

We want the Commission and the Member States to organise a summit on poverty at the highest possible level to deal with social exclusion and the possibility of a decent life. Like the Economic and Social Committee, we want to set up a poverty observatory so that we can also tackle it.  Basic income and a sustainable social policy for states would ensure a decent life. Every month, more and more families have to count their spending, give up either food, medicines or heat, and more than 10% of EU citizens have difficulty heating their homes. That is why we support the intervention in energy poverty, and the report also calls for a ban on the switchover of winter heating. Households can improve energy efficiency, but the poor cannot afford this. We must also seek ways of this in Europe, including funding from countries other than the European Social Fund.

Thank you very much, Commissioner, and of course thank you very much for all those who have been involved in the preparation of this report, in particular the rapporteur, Mr Meszerics, for this text, which could mark a milestone in the fight against poverty. A text that has brought together the will of many groups in Parliament, but that of all, beyond their ideologies, around a problem that we all share. The levels of poverty at the moment in one of the richest areas of the world, such as the European Union, are unacceptable. It is unacceptable, which leads us to something stated in this text: they must give priority to the fight against poverty over many other policies because it is the very foundation of freedom and solidarity and the principles that underscore the European Union that we do not have poor in our societies. The text basically has two aspects, which the Commissioner has seen very well. One is the struggle for a better world for the future. And we talk about structural solutions, such as the minimum income of insertion, the improvement of the housing park, a housing policy. And that is all very well, and I think the Commission needs to focus on it. But let me finish this speech by saying that poverty is a scourge of today, right now, and the poor are here today. And, therefore, in the text you will also find a whole series of non-economic measures, which are social. They can even be tax aid; but they are also subsidies, they are aids, they are social benefits, they are a better social salary to combat poverty today, here and now.

Secondly, abolish nonsensical quotas for solar electricity. This costs households tens of thousands of crowns a year extra to subsidize solar power, and moreover, if we abolish these meaningless quotas for expensive electricity, coal-fired power plants will once again have sales for coal, and coal mines will not have to lay off workers, and miners will have their incomes again.

Mr President, the Europe 2020 strategy plans to lift 20 million people out of poverty, and focuses on increasing the cost of housing, energy and education. It's good, it's pretty! Two areas of work are thus envisaged. First, to increase the incomes of poor households by encouraging the development of a framework directive on minimum income, which would be set at the national level, above the poverty line, and by strengthening social rights in order to guarantee state aid. Secondly, to encourage the reduction of expenditure, by ensuring a better allocation of the various European funds for the benefit of poor households, such as ESI funds, to combat energy insecurity, and by encouraging the fiscal shift which aims to tax the energy industries to reduce the burden on the cost of labour.  I'm sorry, but I'm saying here that you're wrong and you're dreaming. Indeed, poverty will continue to grow, as this crisis is fuelled by your austerity and ultra-liberal policies and aggravated by the arrival of migrants. European funds have only a minor impact on the policies of the Member States, and the establishment of a minimum wage or the tax shift is clearly a national responsibility.

It is important because it highlights the fact that one in six Europeans are either in poverty or at risk of poverty. In Ireland the figure is 16%. But crucially, the report points to concrete measures that can be taken to try to meet the EU 2020 anti-poverty targets. We are all aware that poorer households spend a higher proportion of their income on household costs, whether accounted for by utilities or housing or energy or food, than other households do. Therefore, a minimum income that takes into account the economic and social circumstances in each Member State and is based on a life-cycle approach is, in my opinion, a safety net. Certain practical suggestions, such as a winter heating disconnection moratorium, the possibility of extending the fund for the most deprived, and measures to reduce energy poverty, such as micro loans for investing in energy efficiency, are all important steps. Access to water and sanitation is a human right, and privatisation of these services has had a negative effect on households. Finally, I agree with the Commissioner.

Mr President, why in the southern countries with plenty of light, thousands of people are cold in their homes? Energy poverty rooted in rising poverty prevents households from paying for gas, oil or electricity.  In Greece, the risk of poverty reached 36%. In the European Union, some 22 million households suffer from the cold, while more than 40% of their disposable income goes for loans and rents.

Excellent measures have also been proposed on how to address this problem. In particular, I consider the problem of energy poverty present in all Member States to be important and particularly prominent in South East Europe.  Member States often promote energy efficiency measures that imply good financial capacity for citizens and lack measures that focus on vulnerable and socially vulnerable consumer groups. Measures to combat energy poverty and measures to improve housing standards that would allow a higher share of domestic renewable energy use and reduce unemployment have been completely absent.  I support the initiative addressed to the Commission to accurately set the definition of energy poverty in order to identify and implement the Common European Policy as soon as possible and to start implementing the Common European Policy. However, efforts should be made in Member States to identify local problems, to help vulnerable citizens, and in particular to highlight the potentials of social entrepreneurship and alternative business models, such as cooperatives and mutual societies, in strengthening women's social inclusion and economic empowerment.

The poverty of single parents also seems to be surprising. The first answer is financial protection, but saying, for example, that work is the only way out of poverty for single mothers is a profoundly antisocial reasoning. Women should be allowed to choose between work and family life by, for example, introducing a parental wage.

However, in the city of Kohtla-Järve, the residents of several apartment buildings were left without heat due to debts due to the local utility company. Low temperatures also caused damage to central heating radiators, and water pipes froze. People in Kohtla-Järve were lucky because local authorities were able to offer them social housing. This opportunity does not exist in practice in many Estonian municipalities. This is only one incident which has happened in Estonia this year. However, similar incidents were reported in many other European countries. The winter heating disconnection is often immoral, but it may, in many cases, also lead to human rights violations – not only the right to housing, but under some circumstances it may also violate the right to health and the right to life.

These gaps widen over time, as the traditional economic lag of the Eastern European states is added to the ever-worse poverty of the Mediterranean South and a large proportion of the population in countries such as Ireland.

Now more than ever we need to join forces and focus on the delivery of the strategy in a holistic way.

This implies that social considerations have to be properly taken up across all policy domains. It implies that the welfare of people in Europe and the improvement of their everyday lives have to be at the heart of policy-making, and this is what we have set out to do. The focus of the Energy Union on addressing energy poverty is a concrete way of delivering on this commitment. It is clear that if we are to reach our ambitious social goals we cannot afford ‘business as usual’ thinking. We need a forward-looking approach investing in the skills that people and businesses need.

More social commitments from the EU are a long-term unrealised political promise, so by creating a minimum income system and further improving social and labour rights and anti-discrimination legislation, the EU can aim to move to the next level of integration. Raising incomes for poor households is one of the most important aspects of the success of the Europe 2020 strategy and the fight against poverty for two of the following reasons: Since the onset of the crisis, inequalities in the EU have been increasing and one in six EU citizens are still living in poverty or are in the likelihood of experiencing it. The second pillar of the fight against poverty, especially extreme poverty, is effective reduction of household spending, better targeting of various funds for the most vulnerable households and removing obstacles to the effective absorption of resources. Better allocation of EU funds to households in energy poverty would also bring them closer to achieving these objectives.

The long-term unemployed and the elderly have been particularly affected. We must also add high levels of youth unemployment to them.

In accepting my amendment, the report also calls for the Commission to give Member States more flexibility in the use of the European Structural and Investment Funds so that they can use EU funds more specifically to reduce energy poverty or improve housing conditions.

It provides a solution to the huge financial shortfalls in funding created by the development agenda for the next 15 years. The success of the millennium development goals in the past 15 years has provided ample evidence of how to get it right in the next 15 years, but one billion people still live on less than USD 1.25 per day and more than 800 million people do not have enough food to eat. Poverty is not eliminated by hand-outs. It is only wealth creation that ends poverty. We have 15 years to fix that with the new 17 sustainable development goals announced at the United Nations last year. But how can we fund this? Lofty ambitions to end poverty in all its forms everywhere come with a huge price tag. Climate change mitigation alone will cost USD 250 billion. The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development projects a funding gap – yes, I repeat, a funding gap – of USD 2.5 trillion for the sustainable development goals. This is a staggering sum, a sum that is beyond comprehension to our European taxpayers, a sum that the already struggling European taxpayer cannot even begin to shoulder. My report highlights that such a funding shortfall can be adequately met only if the private sector is involved in development, not through more taxes, but through partnership. But first we have to end the tax fraud in developing countries, which accounts for losses of nearly 1 trillion annually through illicit funding. Money that should stay in those countries is brought to Europe and other offshore accounts and hidden away by the elite of those countries. We have to make sure that those funds stay in those countries to be used for the development of those countries. Secondly, we have to demand that the OECD members match their 1970 pledge of 0.7% of GNI. Thirdly, the sustainable development goals will require the drive, the managerial skill and the commitment of our private sector partners, for it is the private sector which creates 90% of jobs and income for poor people in developing countries, alongside donors, civil society and trade partners. Fourthly, public-private partnerships must mobilise long-term – not short-term – private finance and hold the private sector accountable to public sector tendering processes, transparency and scrutiny. So this report calls for the private sector to invest in building and running schools; digging for wells and irrigating agriculture; building, running and maintaining hospitals and hospital services; building, owning, and operating roads, airports, and harbours; and setting up meat-, fruit- and vegetable-processing factories, all of which will create jobs and wealth in the developing countries, done in partnership with the public sector and pump-primed by EU development assistance. If we mean to offer the billion people still living in abject poverty the dignity of work and of earning a living wage, then we must seize this opportunity before us now and get on with it.

It is a significant contribution to a full and coherent expression of the European Union’s institutions on the importance of the private sector’s role in development. The report reflects the priorities and challenges identified in the 2014 Commission communication, ‘A stronger role of the private sector in achieving inclusive and sustainable growth in developing countries’, and in the Council conclusions of June and December 2014. The main challenge in our cooperation with developing countries remains achieving inclusive and sustainable growth and creating decent jobs. For example, as it is expected that Africa’s population will double by 2050, we need to help it create at least 400 million new jobs. This requires sustainable investment to diversify our partners’ economies and link them to global value chains. Official development assistance is essential but not enough. Domestic resource mobilisation is key, and we must also catalyse private funding flows. The European Union blending framework is a successful tool for achieving European Union external policy objectives by leveraging public and private funds. Discussions in the EU platform for blending, involving the European Parliament, include exchanges on the issue of private sector engagement in blending. In this context, Mr President, I expect that, from the programmed resources for the 2014-2020 period, EUR 4.8 billion of EU grants could leverage at least EUR 66 billion in investments from financial institutions and private investors in partner countries in sub-Saharan Africa, Asia and Latin America. The Commission remains committed to ensuring and enhancing the local ownership of blended projects by involving partner countries and regional organisations. This strategy would be implemented also through innovative instruments such as ‘electrify’ or ‘agrify’ initiatives, which have been developed to promote private sector investments in rural electrification and agriculture. Structured dialogue and multi-stakeholder approaches with the private sector and civil society organisations are key elements in our strategy. We need partnerships that encourage businesses to put sustainability at the core of their strategies and to promote innovative, inclusive business models. The Commission will invest over EUR 2 billion to support global private sector development and facilitate responsible and inclusive partner sector investment in development by 2020. The Commission will implement this strategy through national and regional indicative programmes and through thematic programmes. European economic diplomacy can help mobilise European investments, with mutual benefits for the sending and receiving countries in terms of growth and jobs. The necessary support would be needed to allow these investments also to take place in economically riskier and emerging parts of the world. The intervention of the private sector is also crucial for the transformational objectives of the Social Development Goals and the climate change commitments. In this regard, coordination with the EU Member States and respect for the principle of subsidiarity are important elements of the Commission’s approach, fully in line with the SDGs and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda. The private sector is sending signals that it is ready to work with us to become a true financing and implementing partner in achieving sustainable growth in developing countries.

The terrorists attacked the future of the country and its diversity. The Lahore attack aimed to kill members of the Christian minority, but it also killed many Muslims. The attack comes only two years after the deadly church bombings, also in Lahore. My colleague Federica Mogherini, the High Representative, in a statement extended her condolences to the families and friends of the victims and underlined our support to Pakistan in its fight against terrorism and in the promotion of our shared values, among which is diversity. We call on Pakistan to bring the perpetrators and instigators of these attacks to justice and to take firm action against the organisations that claim responsibility. We are very worried about the rising levels of religious violence and intolerance in some parts of Pakistan and we are closely monitoring these developments. Minorities in the country, including religious minorities, continue to suffer disproportionately and they are frequently targeted by extremist militants. We call on the government to step up efforts to ensure the security of all members of religious minorities. The 2016 GSP+ Report underscores that the human rights situation remains very challenging. We always raise human rights issues in our regular dialogue with Pakistan and encourage authorities to address the challenges, including those concerning the situation of minorities. The European Union regrets the lifting of the moratorium on the death penalty in Pakistan and the large number of executions this has led to. Pakistan is now the third largest executor. Just yesterday, four more prisoners convicted of murder were hanged. The European Union is opposed to capital punishment in all circumstances and has consistently called for its universal abolition. The European Union, in all its contacts with Pakistan, continues to underline the importance of reintroducing the moratorium on executions and of complying with the minimum standards. The European Union is also supporting several projects to improve awareness and protection of human rights, access to justice for vulnerable groups and to strengthen civil society organisations in Pakistan. The European Union bilateral development cooperation for the period 2014-2020 for Pakistan, with a total amount of EUR 635 million, has human rights and good governance as one of the three focal sectors. Human rights violations remain widespread in the country, despite some of the constructive initiatives underway. Pakistan has made some progress in strengthening the institutional framework for human rights, including by establishing a national commission for human rights. Furthermore, the government recently adopted an action plan to improve the human rights situation in Pakistan. The plan includes various measures, notably the development of a national plan of action for the promotion and protection of the rights of minorities. Some action has also been taken to address the widespread problem of hate speech. There have also been some advances on legislation to improve women’s rights. The European Union has also been calling for comprehensive action against terrorism, in full compliance with international law, fundamental values and international human rights standards. More emphasis will need to be put on the prevention of terrorism, in particular in the areas of countering radicalisation, recruitment and the financing of terrorism. Let me finally underline that the European Union has been, and remains, a staunch supporter of democracy and reform in Pakistan.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 91, "date": "2016-04-14.json", "name": "Ildikó GÁLL-PELCZ", "mepid": "102886", "text": "   The debate is over.

Ms Cáceres was a prominent human rights defender, as we all know, and was very well known by the European Union for her courageous commitment in defending the environment and the indigenous rights of the Lenca community to which she belonged. In an immediate reaction to these odious murders, the European Union has called for a thorough, expedite and transparent investigation of the cases. It is of the utmost importance to give strong signals that impunity for these assassinations of human rights defenders will not prevail. The European Union continues to monitor with great attention the dire situation of indigenous leaders, members of the LGBTI community, journalists and justice officials who continue to be particularly affected by violations of human rights in the country. Precautionary measures granted by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights should be immediately implemented to avoid any further killings. The situation also calls for an urgent implementation of the law to protect human rights defenders. The European Union has been very much involved in promoting this initiative through its Development Cooperation Programmes, which provided support for the drafting of the law. The overall human rights situation in Honduras remains characterised by widespread violence in which corruption and impunity play a considerable part. To address this, rapid progress should be made in the implementation of the recommendations issued in the Universal Periodic Review carried out in 2015, the vast majority of which have been accepted by Honduras. The Union also looks forward to the full operation of the office of the United Nations Human Rights Commissioner. The European Union has constantly advocated human rights and justice reforms in Honduras and stands ready to work together with the Honduran people to address these challenges. The Union and its Member States are the most important actors in development cooperation, including on human rights issues in the country. The European Union welcomes the recent agreement on the deployment of an Organisation of American States mission to support the fight against corruption and impunity in Honduras, known as MACCIH in its Spanish acronym, and the request for support from the Honduran authorities to this mission in the investigation of Mrs Berta Cáceres’s killing.

Despite advances in security since Mr Buhari’s election, there is still much to be done to address this violence in the region and the sense of impunity surrounding it, so that justice and lasting peace is restored between conflicting communities.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 130, "date": "2016-04-14.json", "name": "Marianne THYSSEN", "mepid": "1832", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, today indeed marks the second anniversary of the abduction of the 276 Chibok girls by Boko Haram. A memorial event at the school in Chibok is being held today to remind the world that 219 of the kidnapped girls are still  missing. The Union welcomes the progress made by the new Nigerian authorities in pushing back insecurity and freeing many civilians held captive by Boko Haram. Suicide attacks continue to be on the daily agenda in the north-east of Nigeria, an area where mass abductions of children and their use as suicide bombers, child soldiers and sex slaves are still dramatically frequent. That is why security and human rights were among the top issues addressed in the ministerial dialogue that the Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, my colleague Federica Mogherini, held with the Nigerian Minister for Foreign Affairs on 15 March in Brussels. Together they condemned the horrific abuses committed by Boko Haram and emphasised the importance of a comprehensive region-wide approach with concrete actions in the political, socio-economic, security, environmental and humanitarian fields. Both parties also agreed that the fight against terrorism is a common challenge that can only be surmounted together when security forces abide strictly by international humanitarian law and respect human rights. Such a multi-faceted strategy needs the backing of the international community, and the European Union is ready to support this effort. This will be at the heart of the discussions at the next Security Summit in Abuja in May, at which the European Union needs to be represented at the highest possible level. At the ministerial dialogue, Federica Mogherini also reiterated the European willingness to continue providing support to the population in order to help stop the violence and rebuild a prosperous future. With our development assistance and humanitarian aid, and with all other European instruments at our disposal, we will assist the Nigerian authorities in their endeavours to tackle the current challenges. Finally at the ministerial dialogue, the High Representative and the Nigerian Foreign Minister also agreed to hold a dedicated human rights dialogue in Abuja sometime in 2016, in which a broader agenda of topics will be addressed. As you can see from what I have said, the European Union has been, and will remain, fully committed to pursuing its work with Nigeria on all the issues that you have highlighted in this debate.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 131, "date": "2016-04-14.json", "name": "Ildikó GÁLL-PELCZ", "mepid": "102886", "text": "   The debate will be suspended until after the vote.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hu", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 132, "date": "2016-04-14.json", "name": "Sylvie GUILLAUME", "mepid": "96952", "text": "  The agenda calls Voting Time.

It concerns the conditions for the release of the reserves in Article 216. The text to which the roll-call vote applies is the following: ‘The appropriations may be released following a Bureau decision on internalising the Members’ transport service’. This sentence should be replaced by the oral amendment I will now read to you: ‘The appropriations may be released following a decision of the Committee on Budgets’. Adopting that oral amendment would not make the report ideal, but it would do a lot to secure broader support in the final vote.

Since the adoption of Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and the free movement of such data, there has been significant changes in data protection, in particular technological improvements, more personal data collection and processing, including for law enforcement purposes, inconsistent sets of data protection rules and globalising markets and cooperation. Moreover, the application of the Directive has not achieved proper harmonisation, as the provisions of this document are implemented differently in the Member States. In this context, it has become more difficult for individuals ('data subjects') to exercise their right to data protection. Finally, this failure hampers the development of the single market, with companies (managing or processing personal data, 'controllers') and individuals facing different data protection requirements. The European Parliament welcomes the proposed transposition of reporting requirements to data protection authorities, with practical accountability and corporate data protection officers.

The protection of personal data is a fundamental right of the European Union enshrined in the Treaty of Lisbon. That is why the Commission's proposal to intervene with two new legislative instruments to protect both citizens and businesses is to be welcomed. The general regulation on data protection, first of all ensuring better information on what happens to personal data once shared, contains, among other things, two particularly interesting points: the so-called 'right to be forgotten' and the minimum age for the use of online services.

In the first attack in Brussels, the French terrorist was known to the French authorities. In the case of Charlie Hebdo, the terrorists were known to the English authorities. In the case of Brussels, which we now live in recently, the Swedish authorities had information. In other words, there is information about the terrorism suspects, they end up committing the attacks, there is no exchange of information, there is no cooperation, and with this justification we ended up becoming all suspects and keeping the flight records of all passengers in the European Union, this year hundreds of millions of euros, and we have all become a territory of fear.

The current moment in which the EU is under the threat of terrorism is an additional argument for accepting this Resolution. Although I have doubts about enabling the use, collection and sharing of private passenger data, in conditions where there is a serious risk to the safety of citizens, I support the introduction of \"PNR\" as a measure that will certainly reduce that risk and I believe save many lives. The basis for the adoption of this Resolution is the protection of personal data. Some countries already have such a system and it is precisely such a system that has proven effective in preventing human trafficking, kidnapping, drug smuggling and murder.

The text determines the criteria on the basis of which these authorities can use such data, defined in a vague and broad way. The massive compilation of data that is proposed is disproportionate and unnecessary, ignoring the recommendations of the CJEU on proportionality in data collection.

But after the attacks in Paris, the file was put back on the table under pressure from the French government on the grounds that the PNR would have made it possible to arrest the perpetrators of the attacks. It is false and untrue. The PNR only harmonizes national PNRs and therefore does not oblige States to share data.

The directive would thus, for the first time, introduce uniform and harmonized legislation on the protection of business secrets at EU level.

Turkey has its historical, cultural and religious roots, which are very different from our European ones. That is why I do not support Turkey's accession to the EU. I support a privileged partnership between the two countries and I want us to have the best relations, including economic and trade relations. However, the report also rightly acknowledges that Turkey bears the brunt of the refugee crisis and also contains the fundamental challenges to Turkey that I agree with: respect for freedom of expression, the release of journalists and a peaceful solution to relations with the Kurds.

The report has difficulty finding positive action in government action and considers religious tolerance a success. From Lake Ochrický through the magical mountains with wild, still preserved nature to the interesting coast, there are many preconditions for the development of tourism, there is also an interesting natural wealth (including deposits of natural asphalt).

Also, the development of renewable energy sources and environmental protection cannot be as important as the development of employment in industry and agriculture. Other attributes of modern society (apart from widespread corruption) are also in their infancy. Unfortunately, significant subsidies to NGOs only create another source of possible corruption.

BiH still has major problems with corruption, judicial problems, economic problems and high unemployment, especially permanent unemployment and youth unemployment. In BiH, there is still insufficient cooperation between the government and the NGO sector, and the legal and institutional framework for respect for human rights needs to be improved.

Since its independence, Bosnia has not managed to overcome its primary challenges: mass unemployment, endemic corruption, partial justice and above all a constitutional and institutional architecture based on the recognition of constituent ethnic groups (Bosnian Muslims, Bosnian Serbs and Croats). As the European Court of Human Rights recently emphasized, it appears particularly problematic not to be able to declare oneself a simple \"citizen of Bosnia and Herzegovina\" without ethnic affiliation, in order to be able to stand for election. But for Parliament, rapprochement with the European Union and its neoliberal orthodoxy will naturally resolve these problems.

High unemployment and poor economic situation in the country, which in turn leads to a brain drain, as educated people do not get jobs and are thus forced to look for opportunities abroad.

I believe that despite the difficulties, with the encouragement and help of the EU, the situation in BiH can improve and improve. However, we must not let them down here, but offer them a helping hand. In certain respects, I am not satisfied with the text of the resolution. I find it most problematic to emphasize and call for the strengthening of the ethnic principle in a country that is already too divided and fragmented. No distinction should be made between the constituent peoples and other citizens of BiH.

That is why the need to act with innovative policies is highlighted, such as the moratorium against the disconnection of heating in the winter months, the establishment of a minimum income system by countries that guarantees a decent income, although in this case the liberal groups and chamber conservatives have nuanced this end.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1440, "date": "2016-04-14.json", "name": "Paloma LÓPEZ BERMEJO", "mepid": "125047", "text": "written.- The report supports the basic elements with which to develop a global plan to fight poverty: guaranteeing access to basic services (energy, water, health, education, housing…) in the face of the predatory logic of the market;the improvement of working and salary conditions on which the well-being of the working majority depends and a system of minimum income that complements social protection to guarantee, in an individualized and effective way, a decent income and life.Consequently, I have voted in favor.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "GUE/NGL", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1441, "date": "2016-04-14.json", "name": "Ivana MALETIĆ", "mepid": "119436", "text": "written.- The European Union, in its intention to reduce poverty, is further and further from the goals set in the EU2020 strategy.Poverty and social exclusion are key determinants of a country's economy and indicators of a country's living conditions.In the Union, 11% of the population spends more than 40% of disposable income on housing costs, 10.8% of the population faces difficult conditions to maintain household heating, and 12 million more women than men live in poverty.The state of social exclusion and poverty has been further exacerbated by the impact of the crisis, which has affected all households and forced Member States to reduce social spending measures and focus on economic targets.I supported this report because it points to the burning problem of poverty and the need to define a minimum income as an instrument in reducing and preventing poverty.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hr", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1442, "date": "2016-04-14.json", "name": "Andrejs MAMIKINS", "mepid": "124746", "text": "in writing. - The European Union is one of the most developed and richest places in the world, but unfortunately not everywhere there is an opportunity for people to live decently, according to their skills and aspirations.

I therefore did not support the report on the goal of reducing poverty with a view to increasing household costs as a whole, and see it as an unnecessary and counterproductive interference with the national social policies of the Member States.", "language": "en", "original_language": "cs", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1495, "date": "2016-04-14.json", "name": "Helga STEVENS", "mepid": "125105", "text": "written. - The N-VA delegation fully supports the European fight against poverty, but regrets the approach provided in the report.

The report represents a step towards the European pillar of social rights, and affirms that there can be no fight against poverty without a fight against gender inequality.  As a lead on the report on behalf of the Women’s Rights Committee, I particularly welcome the inclusion of a strong gender perspective. The financial crisis and subsequent austerity measures can be seen to negatively affect women more than men, causing a feminisation of poverty.  When women do not have enough money to pay the bills, it is their dependents who also suffer, particularly children and elderly relatives. Women are more likely to be in precarious employment, so managing household budgets to ensure that children are warm, clothed and fed can be very challenging when energy and other utility costs are high.

It is also known the ability of investments, especially those in the manufacturing sector, to reduce market-related poverty, creating employment and well-being among working citizens. In the coming decades, global population growth and rising income in developing countries today will generate greater consumption of food, water and energy.

The adopted document rightly highlights the need to establish a multilateral dialogue platform at EU level, where the private sector, NGOs, think tanks, donors, governments and other stakeholders could more easily cooperate on development and build mutual trust more effectively. It often happens that development aid is not properly adjusted to the needs or is duplicated by many entities. There is no doubt that the private sector should play a larger and more important role in development cooperation and efforts to reduce inequality and poverty. It is this sector that is the basis for the development of any economy, and business and development goals do not contradict but complement each other.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1638, "date": "2016-04-14.json", "name": "Claudia ȚAPARDEL", "mepid": "124793", "text": "signed up. - The European Union's financial assistance for the development of poor countries around the world is a significant tool that has made remarkable progress in many areas of interest, such as health, education and agriculture.

the transport sector in the European Union. As you are all well aware, given the unprecedented inflow of refugees, several Member States have introduced internal border controls. Though temporary, they hamper the proper functioning of the Schengen area. Because of current security threats, controls are, in addition, being applied to certain means of transportation as well as at borders. The transport sector is particularly sensitive to these measures. Consequently, the reintroduction of internal border controls on a broader and more permanent basis would not only impede the mobility of citizens in the Schengen countries, it would also undermine the timelessness and seamlessness of the free exchange of goods within the European Union. This currently accounts for more than EUR 2 800 billion in value and 1 700 million tons in volume. The Commission has analysed the consequences of a systematic reintroduction of border controls at internal borders. First results show that, in the short term, increased waiting times at borders and terminals would affect passengers and trade. In the long run, reduced traffic and trade volumes would severely affect the economy. Document checking procedures would entail additional expenses for Member States’ budgets for equipment, personnel and new facilities. The road freight sector would be particularly exposed, as prompt delivery is one of the important parameters for competitive advantage, and small and medium-sized enterprises, the backbone of the road transport industry, would be the most affected. With many operating on very small profit margins, any increased costs would either be passed to the end consumers or put the survival of many transport companies in jeopardy. Expressed in numbers, the Commission estimates that full re-establishment of border controls to monitor the movement of people within the Schengen area would generate immediate direct costs to the European Union economy ranging between EUR 5 billion and 18 billion a year. Long—term and indirect effects are more difficult to quantify, but available evidence suggests that re—establishing internal border controls would have substantial negative effects on the whole European economy. The volume of intra—European trade would go down, whereas related costs would go up, chiefly affecting Member States highly dependent on intra—EU trade. 1.7 billion citizens working across borders would be affected, in particular in those Member States such as Slovakia, Estonia, Hungary and Belgium where cross-border commuting is very important. The good functioning of the cross-border labour market could thus be hampered. I believe that these initial estimates clearly demonstrate the serious negative impact of a possible suspension of free movement without internal border controls in the Schengen area, which is an essential element for economic growth in the European Union and, in particular, for the performance of the transport sector. Therefore, closing borders between Member States should be only a temporary measure, and controls should be lifted as soon as possible. In its communication of 4 March entitled ‘Back to Schengen, a Roadmap’ the Commission has outlined its plan and schedule for getting back to a normally-functioning Schengen by the end of 2016. The longer internal border controls remain in place, the more difficult and costly it will be to restore the favourable business environment which the Schengen area aims to provide. As economic actors adapt to the new reality, a return to the previous situation will not be immediate or guaranteed. Please let me assure you that we will work hard to get the Schengen system and the internal market functioning normally again by the end of this year. I am looking forward to hearing your views on the matter and on how we can best work together to safeguard the single market.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1659, "date": "2016-04-14.json", "name": "Stanislav POLČÁK", "mepid": "124704", "text": "for the PPE Group. - I would like to begin by saying that the migration crisis is really a matter for all EU countries, that is understandable. It is a big mistake for some EU leaders to think that they can avoid this migration crisis in any way. I think we will all bear the consequences of their decisions. I was very interested in the Commissioner's speech, because the figures she gave correspond to other independent studies, and I think it is a great pity that the representatives of some factions on my right, in particular, are not represented here at all. I think that if they call for the closure of the EU's borders, they should hear these numbers. They should listen to what the Commissioner has said and what corresponds to independent studies in the very case of the closure of the Schengen borders, as they are calling for. I think that the loss of the main achievement of European integration - the free movement of people and goods - can be truly irreplaceable. The creation of an area without internal borders, which allows the free movement of people and goods, has brought significant benefits to companies not only in Europe but also, of course, in dealings with third countries. Schengen is thus one of the main means by which European citizens can enjoy their freedoms and the internal market prospers and develops. Unfortunately, due to the consequences of the migration wave, which the EU as a whole has not yet been able to cope with, this system is in jeopardy. With it, of course, the concept of transport based on this system. Border controls and traffic restrictions negatively affect transport on both roads and railways, trade and transport as a whole. I therefore now see it as an absolute priority in the transport sector to tackle these problems. Our goal must be, first and foremost, to address the serious shortcomings at the external borders.

Right at the beginning I would like to make it clear once again that this is by no means a pure migration crisis, but a solid European political crisis. We see that when we look at the last few weeks and months. What is the situation like? 28 member states fail miserably in solving a humanitarian emergency which, if it were tackled jointly and seriously coordinated at EU level, would be more than feasible on an economically and politically stable continent like Europe. But as the transport policy spokesman for the Socialist Group, I would like to mention the effects on European transport in this debate. Instead of finding a common solution, some Member States are now starting to cook their own soup. Most of them can think of nothing better than to pull up their national borders again and thereby dissolve one of the greatest advantages of the European Union, the so-called Schengen area. Not only does it fail to find a solution to the problem, but it affects European transport and the freedom of travel of the more than 400 million people in the European Union who benefit from it, who make 1.25 billion trips a year. The economy has long been sounding the alarm, because border controls - as already mentioned by colleagues - delay delivery times, make working hours more difficult for employees and ultimately harm consumers - that is, all of us, because we then have to pay more for them and because we ultimately also last longer have to wait. I would like to give a clear example, Commissioner, of how the negative effects of national border controls are illustrated using the example of logistics. Logistics experts expect additional costs of around 50 euros per hour and per truck, which result from additional waiting times due to border controls. Using the example of the German-Austrian border, where around 8 million toll vehicles drive back and forth in both directions every year, this would mean around 400 million euros in additional costs. Scenarios like these would add up if the Schengen area came to an end, and according to a study by the Bertelsmann Foundation, the entire European Union would have to cope with a loss of 407 billion euros in gross domestic product by 2025.

Transport is the bloodstream of the European economy. Each serious disturbance in the proper functioning of this sector brings losses to entrepreneurs, causes delays in deliveries, and, consequently, decreasing revenues and rising costs, creating the risk of layoffs in many industries. The previous year and the escalation of the immigration crisis is an unprecedented problem that the transport industry is dealing with in practice. In recent months, I have received a lot of signals from owners of transport companies and truck drivers from the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship, who described the working conditions in the Calais area. Attacks on cars while driving, threats, thefts, attempts to break into trailers in order to illegally cross the United Kingdom border are the daily lives of truck drivers not only from my home city of Bydgoszcz, but from all over Poland, which has been a key player on the road transport market for many years in the European Union. I am very happy to finally be able to tell you about these problems here in this forum, where we so rarely deal with the real problems of the people who elected us, whom we represent here. Looking at images from the access roads to the port of Calais and seeing lorry drivers pelted with stones, it is impossible to ignore the fact that these attacks are perpetrated by illegal immigrants. Who bears the cost of these attacks? Who finances additional securing of trailers or monitoring inside trucks? After all, who risks their health and life working in such difficult conditions? Of course, the drivers themselves, as well as their employers, whose daily losses go into thousands of euros. This particular example is only one of the many visible expressions of the impact of the immigration crisis on the transport sector in the European Union. The temporary closure of rail connections between Member States, thousands of attempts to break into the Eurotunnel, massive uncontrolled movement of small boats and pontoons in the Mediterranean, and finally the Member States' gradual unilateral reintroduction of border controls in the Schengen area - this is the present day of the European transport sector. Do we want his immediate future to look that way too? Will concrete action be taken only when, in addition to financial losses, pictures of victims of traffic accidents caused by a lack of proper control over the movement of waves of illegal immigrants across Europe appear on the front pages of newspapers? I would like to call for more commitment from the European Commission, especially for enterprises and transport companies, also in the form of real support for financing investments that increase the safety of transport workers and compensation for losses incurred in connection with the ongoing immigration crisis. We invest huge amounts of money in infrastructure in the European Union. We must help its users in a situation where their safety and working conditions are threatened by an irresponsible and inconsistent European immigration policy. Our task is to do everything to support the Member States on the external borders of the Union and regain real influence on how many people come to Europe. If our external borders are not sealed, no ad hoc solutions will help and the Schengen area will simply cease to exist. The economic costs of such a scenario, not only for my country, would be enormous. In other words, I would like to call on the Commission to ensure that the law that already exists today is consistently respected and enforced.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1662, "date": "2016-04-14.json", "name": "Matthijs van MILTENBURG", "mepid": "125022", "text": "on behalf of the ALDE Group. - It must be emphasized that the refugee crisis is above all a humanitarian crisis and that human suffering cannot be expressed in figures, but the consequences for the transport sector are also very serious. In response to refugee flows, Member States have introduced unilateral, uncoordinated, temporary border controls. This affects the free movement of people and goods. As a result, Schengen is under great pressure and we have heard the Commissioner say that, according to the European Commission, the end of Schengen could cost the European economy EUR 5-18 billion annually, which is confirmed by a number of different think tanks in Europe. It is estimated that systematic border checks would cost road transport billions alone. Additional costs in the order of 1.7 to 7.5 billion per year! It is clear that a fundamental European approach is needed to solve the refugee problem, with a genuine European Border and Coast Guard, with a single common approach to asylum and migration procedures in all Member States, broadening the possibilities of legal migration, but also - very important - with a return to Schengen as soon as possible without internal border controls. This is desperately needed to better manage the refugee crisis, first of all from a humanitarian point of view, but also in the interest of a functioning transport sector. I call on the Commission to make the impact of the refugee crisis on the transport sector more transparent and to go beyond those few paragraphs in the road map for a return to Schengen. I call on the Commission to assess the economic damage for, among others, road hauliers, shipowners, ports, rail companies, to discuss this regularly with the European Parliament and to report on it, so that it becomes clear that Europe does pay a price for the current fragmentation of the approach to the refugee crisis by the different Member States.", "language": "en", "original_language": "nl", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1663, "date": "2016-04-14.json", "name": "Tania GONZÁLEZ PEÑAS", "mepid": "127330", "text": "on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group. - Mr President, I have to say with regard to this debate that there are many aspects that I applaud and other aspects that seriously concern me. On the one hand, I agree that it is necessary to address the phenomenon of migration from a multidimensional perspective in order to implement effective and sustainable solutions in the medium and long term. For example, it is very important to underline the role of merchant vessels, the role they play in the search and rescue of vessels adrift in European waters. According to data from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the Mediterranean is the world's deadliest maritime migration route and - as we know - these vessels are so fragile and so small that it is difficult to detect them with current systems of satellite technology. In this context, commercial fleets and their crews play a role in locating, assisting and humanitarian management for which they are not always prepared, either logistically or professionally, in addition to risking possible economic and legal sanctions both from their companies and from of the authorities of the States when they arrive at port. For all these reasons, it is necessary to improve the capacities of the Member States to carry out humanitarian search and rescue operations, as well as to make equipment, training and action protocols available to commercial ships. That said, there are many aspects of this approach that concern me. I am concerned that the focus of the debate is limited exclusively to issues related to competitiveness and the proper functioning of the internal market. I am well aware that these issues are very important to us, but do you know what is really alarming when it comes to this debate? What is really alarming is the proliferation and consolidation of refugee trafficking mafias, which capture their victims in stations and offer transport services at prices such as 1,000 euros, for example, per person, transporting them in a truck, when they would have much cheaper options, but they don't know about them because nobody informs them. They are criminal networks that take advantage of the desperate situation of these people, and we cannot look the other way when many of them die because of these means of transport, as was the case of at least fifty people who died by suffocation in a refrigerated truck that was found in Austria. They are completely unprotected and lack information. It's a shame, ladies and gentlemen, this is a shame. There is also much talk about the need to protect the proper functioning of the Schengen area. And I wonder: if we are so concerned about the fluidity of movements in the European Union, if it is so important, why have we accepted an agreement with the United Kingdom that scandalously violates the principle of free movement? Or is it that in this Europe of ours the same problems are sometimes first class and sometimes second class?

Let me tell you, first of all, that this wording bothers me the most. When we count, since June 2015, nine refugees dead near the Channel Tunnel, it is not the rail sector that has been impacted. When, in August 2015, seventy refugees died in a refrigerated truck in Austria, it was not the road transport that was to be pitied. When, in the Mediterranean, there have been 4,000 deaths per year since 2014, it is not maritime transport that is paying the heaviest price. This type of reasoning, which consists of pointing the finger at refugees, I will tell you where it is found: sometimes in speeches, especially from the ENF group! Last week, the rapporteur, Ms Arnautu, from the National Front, presented to the Committee on Transport and Tourism her report on the revision of the regulation on coast guards and border guards, in which she basically told us that , what is regrettable about the refugee crisis is - and I quote it - \"that several hundred commercial vessels were forced, in 2015, to turn aside to participate in rescue operations\". Let's be serious, the problem is not the refugees, it may still be the smugglers, at a pinch - it is the conflict that is bogged down in Syria and elsewhere, and it is above all the incapacity Member States to organize a dignified welcome for all these people. So, to the Commission and to my colleagues here, I make an urgent request: we cannot decently study the impact of the refugee crisis until we have first tried everything to contain this crisis. On my territory, I can tell you, there is a mayor, Damien Carême, mayor of the city of Grande-Synthe, who has set up a humanitarian camp to welcome refugees with dignity, while, moreover, other refugees in other countries, especially in Bulgaria, are tied up, and in Austria, they even decide to build a wall. The European response must be up to par, otherwise it is a shame for the European Union. We all have a responsibility in the words we choose, in the rhetoric we hold, but also in the actions we do and commit.

In addition to the economic crisis that has been going on here for several years and the ever-intensifying competition, freight companies have had to face another problem: the consequences of migration. Due to the increased, frequent, stricter border controls, they are able to deliver fewer goods to the customer in the same time, but at the same time their transportation costs have increased due to the longer travel time. Not to mention unpredictability, time-sensitive shipments, bribing passengers and environmental impacts. For all these reasons, it is very important to emphasize that we cannot allow the four fundamental freedoms and the single internal market to be jeopardized, and the proper functioning of the Schengen system is essential for this. And for that, it is essential that we follow the rules it prescribes. Nor can the fact that truck drivers work in the European road network, with all its challenges and dangers, be neglected. Truck drivers are at risk, facing much greater challenges than before. In their case, a safe work environment has gained new, enhanced meaning and importance. It is therefore important to ensure a safe working environment for professional drivers and the protection of drivers in the transport network, in accordance with Directive 89/391 / EEC on the protection of the health of workers. We must not forget tourism either, as this sector is extremely sensitive to terrorist attacks and the threat of them. If we know that tourism accounts for almost 10% of European GDP, it is clear that the whole economy could be severely affected by losses in tourism. In my opinion, there is a need to create a support mechanism that would make it possible to repair the losses incurred by transport operators, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, and tourism.

And to think that we, the transport, could have been the solution: that we could have established the safe humanitarian corridors that we asked from the beginning, in which transport could precisely have meant a solution to avoid deaths and suffering; that creating, also, a humanitarian airlift from Greece to the countries that pledged to receive the contingents of applicants agreed by the Council, instead of launching them onto the roads and tracks of Europe, would surely have also improved the current solution.

All the worse for them, then they are surprised and cry when there are attacks in Paris and Brussels, but these are other topics. In addition to the many social problems and the growing threat of terrorist attacks, the crisis with illegal immigrants is having a major impact on the European economy, in particular the transport sector. International carriers are extremely concerned that, if the crisis deepens, more and more Member States will tighten border controls, and this will have a negative impact on the functioning of the internal market and lead to millions in losses for the transport sector. According to the European Commission, the losses will be between 5 and 18 billion euros, which will increase the cost of transport services and discourage people from traveling in Europe. In order to preserve Schengen and therefore the functioning of the single internal market, we must strengthen the control of our external borders, such as the Bulgarian border, and we must end this hypocrisy for some countries to be admitted to the Schengen area and others not, because for us Bulgarians it is no longer important to be in this space because it brings us nothing. And not to conclude shameful agreements with Turkey and ask it to protect our borders, as we voted today, when we called for Turkish to become the official language of the European Union - a sensible mistake, but another time.

Yes, merchant ships are deviating from their route to save lives. More than 800 ships saved more than 40,000 people in 2014, mainly in the Mediterranean. We must salute them; they did their duty against all odds and, for their part, respected international law. The UNHCR warns us, however, that more and more ships are changing their route to avoid areas where they might come across migrant boats. They fear, of course, the economic consequences, but especially legal ones, of their military engagement. Thirty thousand dead for the Mediterranean alone since 2000; 3,770 in 2015, an absolute record. Yes, the European continent has become the most deadly in the world for migrants. Italy was able to lead by example in 2014, but the Union only released an additional five million, while the Italian operations had cost 95 million euros. The responsibility of smugglers and traffickers is rightly pointed out. We are freeing up resources, including military ones. These operations are expensive and will have only a limited effect. They only affect lamp workers. The networks of traffickers are constantly reorganizing themselves by making migrants take more and more risks, and at increasingly colossal costs, including within the European Union. This traffic is now their third source of income, after drugs and weapons, and it is often the same people who pull the strings. The more we close the borders, the more we play the game of smugglers. Since 2000, more than 13 billion euros have been used to close borders. With what result? This money would be more useful for saving lives and respecting international law as well as the rights of migrants and refugees. The European Union and its Member States must participate in resolving the global humanitarian crisis unfolding before our eyes. Yes, we must reopen internal borders, implement a large-scale European operation for rescue at sea, open humanitarian corridors for refugees and legal access routes for migrants, so as not to force them to take risks. Yes, if the Member States took their responsibilities by respecting international law and European law, we would not need this surreal debate.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "GUE/NGL", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1675, "date": "2016-04-14.json", "name": "Jiří POSPÍŠIL", "mepid": "125706", "text": "- I would like to thank the Commissioner for her report and the information with which I fully agree. I wrote about the possible threat of Schengen in one article in the Czech Republic and our experts calculated that only for the Czech Republic would the immediate abolition of Schengen for transport would have the impact of losing half a billion euros a year, ie. the figures of 15 to 18 billion as an immediate loss in the first year when internal borders are introduced throughout the EU are, in my opinion, correct. There are a number of other things that would happen if the internal borders were restored, it would also have an impact on commuters. Many people work in a neighboring country and go to work every day. This would have an impact on tourism, especially in the case of, say, short-term day trips. In short, well, the impacts would be huge, the losses would be not only economic, but also, let's say, spiritual, because people would travel less, visit less, etc. What is important and the numbers that should still be heard here are the numbers concerning with the credibility of Schengen as such. Research clearly shows that today, a large number of Schengen Europeans do not believe that a large number of Europeans say they would prefer to rebuild their internal borders. In my opinion, because they feel that the EU and Europe as such are not coping with the refugee crisis. I think, Commissioner, when we feel the importance of Schengen and that we must not lose it, you should take into account the views of the public and, accordingly, hold a debate on what further measures to put on the table and propose in the fight against the refugee crisis. .

The European Union has not been up to the task of tackling this very serious problem. But when I talk about the European Union, I am not talking about the European Commission, because, in fact, the European Commission has tried to come up with a set of solutions to face the refugee crisis. This cannot be undervalued here. The problem is in the behavior of some Member States. In fact, at the moment, what we have seen is the fact that several Member States of the European Union are adopting behaviors that objectively violate the spirit underlying the European project. We see every day that there are governments in several Member States today that promote a discourse of exclusion, an ultra-nationalist discourse, often a discourse even with a xenophobic character. This has very negative consequences. One of them is precisely the one we are dealing with today and which has to do with the suspension of the rules of the Schengen area. Now, Schengen is vital to the European project. One of the pillars of the European project is precisely the principle of free movement. And before we even do an analysis of the resulting negative economic impact, we have to focus on the essential issue, which has to do with the European project. And this European project is currently being called into question by this type of behavior. But, in addition, this also has very negative consequences, which have already been mentioned here, from a strictly economic point of view and from a strictly financial point of view.

Of course, the Commission is very busy addressing the refugee crisis - that is one of its top priorities - and doing everything in its power to act as a preventive measure against terrorism. Today, however, we are talking to each other about the impact of the migration crisis on transport, so let us now focus on that further. The introduction of border controls - it is very clear - must be temporary. This must come to an end by the end of this year, so in eight months' time. In my introduction I referred to the roadmap that the Commission has drawn up and that was presented to you on 4 March last, a roadmap to get Schengen functioning normally again. We have discussed this very extensively and our starting point is - a premise that is also shared in this hemisphere - that Schengen is one of the most important successes of European integration, that we should cherish it and that we will therefore do everything we can to do it. to get Schengen functioning normally again. We know - as is stated in that communication - that the cost of not respecting Schengen, the cost of losing Schengen in many respects, in terms of freedom as well as finances, would be enormous. So our goal is to get back to normal as soon as possible, to lift border controls as soon as possible. In that roadmap, we also set out the conditions that must be met and what Member States must do to make this possible. The Commission will monitor the situation closely, both at the internal and external borders. I assure you we will! Estimates have been made of costs and impact. These come up to an amount between a certain amount and a much higher amount (both way too high), but we will further analyze the data that becomes available to us and continue to analyze new information so that we get a more complete overview of the potential costs for Europe. However high those costs will be, our intention is to bring Schengen back to normal. We know that the costs for the transport sector and for the Member States are very high, that we are all very badly affected - even if, of course, it is not only the transport sector that is affected. However, if we turn our backs on Schengen and let everything run its course, it will also entail very high costs for the entire economy, for the citizens of Europe and for the functioning of cross-border work and other matters. That is why I am once again relying on good mutual cooperation in order to eventually also end this crisis and restore our internal market, our free movement of goods, services, capital and people, certainly in the interest of the transport sector. It goes without saying that all Members of the Commission and, of course, in particular Commissioner Bulc, who is responsible for transport, will continue to play our coordinating role, including between Member States, because that is of course very important.

First of all, I believe that we were right to put this issue on the agenda. Because, in my opinion, this is an important issue for the future of the European Union as far as technical development is concerned. The automotive sector is currently developing rapidly. While advanced driver assistance systems have been gradually introduced and optimized over the past ten years, the industry has just heralded the next step towards partially automated driving. This year, the first vehicle models with partially automated functions such as the self-parking and collision warning system or the traffic jam assistant will come onto the market. The development of the first generation of fully autonomous vehicles is already in full swing. Researchers and developers are now already speaking of 2020 as the starting year for their series use. In the United States of America, field tests with driverless vehicles in regular traffic have been taking place for some time. So we see that the industry has already made great strides. The potential of autonomous driving is not limited to the automotive sector, it can also bring about fundamental changes for other industries such as logistics, agriculture or mining. A rethinking of urban planning, especially in the area of ​​mobility, spatial planning or traffic flow control, will also be possible through autonomous driving. However, while research and industry are in the middle of the advanced development phase of autonomous vehicles and society is already discussing possible fields of application of this new type of technology, unfortunately there are no approaches, concepts or even strategies for handling and use that are at least externally recognizable at EU level autonomous vehicles. However, there are a number of fundamental procedural and safety-related questions that must be dealt with by the European Commission in the form of regulations, not only because they set the course for future-oriented, safe and efficient transport in the EU, But also because we give our European industry investment security through clear guidelines and framework conditions, strengthen it in global competition with other regions, especially the USA and Asia, create new jobs and keep old ones. In order to achieve this, the European Commission has to deal thoroughly with the following questions and find sustainable answers: First of all, there is the question of what is known as liability. Since the technology in autonomous vehicles will take over the most fundamental of all tasks, namely controlling the vehicle, it must be clarified who is liable in accident situations. Has the European Commission already considered how the current liability rules should be adapted? Then there are also open questions about data protection and cybersecurity. The exchange of data between vehicles, but also between vehicle and infrastructure, must lead to an efficient and safe flow of traffic in autonomous driving. How does the European Commission intend to secure data on vehicles and citizens and protect the system infrastructure from cyber attacks? There are also open questions in the area of ​​infrastructure. Can autonomous vehicles be integrated into the existing transport infrastructure?

Dear Commissioner, Autonomous vehicles require special test and inspection procedures. These will but not sufficiently and clearly taken into account by the currently applicable type approval legislation.With this in mind, does the Commission intend to revise relevant rules such as the UNECE rules?In view of all these numerous questions, which my colleagues here in plenary will certainly add, I would like to ask you, Commissioner, whether the European Commission has started to work out a strategy for autonomous driving in the EU.Would you also agree with me that in view of the economic and social importance of this topic, the preparation of a Green Paper on autonomous driving is more than overdue?", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1686, "date": "2016-04-14.json", "name": "Marianne THYSSEN", "mepid": "1832", "text": "Member of the Commission. – Mr President, connected, cooperative and automated driving offer great potential to improve road safety, traffic flows and the overall efficiency and environmental performance of the transport system. There is a need to create more synergies and to enhance cooperation at European level. The Amsterdam Declaration endorsed this morning in the framework of the Transport Informal Council is very clear on this point and sees this as a prerequisite for the elaboration of a European strategy on connected and automated driving. The fact that this Council is happening today in Amsterdam is the reason why my colleague, Violeta Bulc, is not here. She is there, so you have to deal with me this afternoon. The Commission has launched a dialogue with Member States, public authorities and private stakeholders through the Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems Platform – the C-ITS Platform – to the GEAR 2030 and the High-Level Round Table between the telecoms and automotive industries, chaired by Commissioner Oettinger. With a strong spirit of partnership, the Commission is working towards a shared European strategy on connected and automated driving as part of the energy union, research, innovation and competitiveness strategy. Research and innovation are thus also being addressed. Vehicle automation technology has developed very quickly, from increasingly sophisticated driver assistance systems intended to improve road safety, and indeed driving comfort, already on the market, to fully automated vehicles that could participate in normal traffic in the short and medium term. However, safety must never be compromised. I want to be very clear that the process towards automation should ensure that it will provide clear road safety benefits by removing, not adding, risks. The first question referred to the challenges posed by automation. The existing legal framework defining the rules of behaviour for road users will need to be adapted to allow automated driving and to ensure safety for all road users. This includes a review not only of the international conventions on road traffic, in particular the Vienna Road Traffic Convention, but also the Member States’ highway codes. Work in the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe is already under way on the international framework. It is crucial to ensure the highest possible level of security of communications and the protection of data and privacy at all times. These are indeed key elements for raising public acceptance. Several initiatives are taking place on security in the framework of the digital single market strategy in terms of privacy under the new general Data Protection Regulation. There will be one data protection law applicable across the European Union. Data protection has been addressed also in the framework of the so-called C-ITS Platform. Concerning liability, the GEAR 2030 initiative on highly automated vehicles is now taking up the issue with the aim to understand if and what is changing with further levels of automation. Then we have road construction. Road construction will probably be affected if we want to maximise benefits from this new technology. These aspects are being assessed also in the C-ITS Platform, and the results will be fed into the GEAR 2030 initiative. Also, the upgrade of the relevant cellular communication networks is being discussed in the context of the relevant High-Level Round Table on connected and automated driving. Finally, a few remarks regarding testing and inspection procedures and vehicle-type approval. Highly—automated vehicles can, to a large extent, already comply with conventional-type approval requirements, for instance general construction and emissions. Discussions are also ongoing at UNECE level with a view to updating the relevant regulations in this are also.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1687, "date": "2016-04-14.json", "name": "Stanislav POLČÁK", "mepid": "124704", "text": "for the PPE Group. - I have to regret a little that such an important point is not included until Thursday afternoon, but there is nothing we can do about it, we have to come to terms with this. I also regret that Marine Le Pen's group and other very skeptical factions did not come to this point or the point of migration. We probably have to come to terms with that, too. I largely agree with what the author of this question, Mr Ertug, said. The automotive industry is really on the imaginary threshold of a new era. It's like moving from a flying balloon to an airplane, to the cockpit of an airplane. Automotive manufacturers, in conjunction with computer experts, are testing the first generation of fully autonomous vehicles, which should appear in normal operation in the coming years. This is a truly historic turning point. However, as the latest available data shows, the path will not be easy. According to recently released statistics from the state of California - one of the few countries in the world that allows the testing of autonomous cars in its territory - in 15 months of test operation, test drivers reported almost 3,000 cases of failure. E.g. Mercedes-Benz alone had to report 1,051 cases of autonomous driving failure, operating only 2 vehicles in California. These are indeed extremely serious issues, and the aspect of road safety cannot be left out in this context. It is clear that in certain cases it will not be possible to prevent such an accident of an autonomously driven vehicle in normal road traffic, despite all technical progress. Then there is the question that is being asked, and that is the responsibility for the driving of the vehicle itself, but also for the consequences associated with such driving. I would therefore also like to ask the Commission: how should the current liability legislation be specifically amended? I have registered from the Commissioner that she mentioned the need to amend the Vienna Convention on Road Traffic of 1968, and of course I certainly agree with that.", "language": "en", "original_language": "cs", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1688, "date": "2016-04-14.json", "name": "Inés AYALA SENDER", "mepid": "28292", "text": "on behalf of the S & amp; D Group. - Mr President, thank you for the generosity. The automotive industry is clearly in a hurry to reinvent itself. An era of cars with oil, with gasoline, with drivers ends, and we are faced with a new world, the world of digitization, technical development and robots, which little by little try to replace human beings. And it is good if they avoid us - as has been said - tiring or dangerous tasks, but the task of driving, I still believe that it generates many emotions and many vocations. And although it is true that in road safety we have managed to make the driver a culprit, I still believe that you have to be very careful and a lot of caution. In the case of airplanes, it has already happened to us. The airplanes were so automated that when the moment of crisis arrived, the pilot could not recover the controls of an airplane that was automated, but automated not by a higher authority, but by other engineering men who can also incur limitations and errors. Therefore, I believe that it is very important that, in the face of exaggerated optimism, we take into account the impacts of these steps. I believe that everything that can help us and avoid accident victims, of course. Now, if the only objective that we are seeing little by little is to save drivers, machinists, taxi drivers, truckers, etc. (because there is talk of cooperative driving, but sometimes it is simply a reduction of the social rights of drivers), you have to be very careful. And also, in the event that we are not going to drive, finally, the vehicles or drive them from outside (which is another thing, because we talk about autonomous driving as if nobody were going to drive them, but the drones are also driven by someone from outside), the question is in what way and with what risks and with what legal framework. And yet, while the engineers are generating autonomous driving, we find that the contamination has not yet been solved. Perhaps it would also be more important to put more impact on reducing pollution. And as for the trucks or cars in which, as the Commissioner says, you can read or talk, I too would lovingly remember that to see if it is going to turn out that we are going to end up reinventing the road rail. And it only remains for us to remember that we are going for the fourth railway package and we have not managed to harmonize the rules. Therefore, I hope that in the case of automated vehicles we will be able to establish the legislative and agreed and consensual framework that we need before starting to shoot each one on their own, which is a bit of what we are seeing. Because the different pilot projects that we attend are not all interoperable or coherent. I therefore absolutely support what my colleague Mr Ertug has said, the urgent need to present a white paper, a book where all these aspects are dealt with precisely to avoid fragmentation, inconsistencies, social impact. Because, in addition, there is a need to establish that social rights and infrastructure costs and priorities, that is, the economic impact on the public and private, have to be measured very, very sensitively before starting to give an idea that we are going to finish everyone reading and chatting in the car as it takes us, which I think is what we all do on the train.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1689, "date": "2016-04-14.json", "name": "Kosma ZŁOTOWSKI", "mepid": "124884", "text": "on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr Chairman!

How do we best adapt our industrial policy? How do we ensure that these vehicles are safe, both on the road and from cyber—attacks? How do we protect consumer rights while sharing more data? How do we deal with liability? The issues are so complex that we cannot deal with them alone. Our traditional car industry must be part of any dialogue as we create a harmonised legal framework which is much larger than the technical aspects, and we must do this in partnership with all stakeholders. The industry itself, however, must proactively think about issues like privacy, cyber security, data management, road management and new business models. We need an automotive industry that is fully aware that it has to change and update quickly. If it does not, non-EU companies, including non-car companies, will set the standards. The future of connected vehicles, our business growth and our economies as a whole will be based on how we use technologies to improve citizens’ experiences and their lives in general.

It is a small revolution that deserves revolutionary changes. We are in the process of inventing, in this hemicycle, the law of robots. Legislation is therefore essential, with real questions. In the event of an accident, who will be responsible, since it will no longer be the driver? Will it be the builder? The OEMs? Internet players? How to be sure that the manufacturer has done things well upstream so that the automated car meets all the standards in force? It's over, driving schools! We now need a real new traffic code in order to guarantee road safety. But above all, transparency is needed so that passengers, but also employees, are not hostages to the fierce competition between manufacturers and, through them, European states. Because we can see it today in the tests of polluting emissions of vehicles: no manufacturer complies with European standards, and it is the citizens themselves who are penalized. We can see this through the national inquiries made in France or Belgium, following the Volkswagen scandal that occurred last year, and on which our Parliament is conducting a real inquiry. So, I say it calmly, in its communication, the European Commission speaks of a need for international cooperation between States and their builders. I would even go further: we need a European approval agency, as of today, on polluting emissions tests and, tomorrow, on automation. This logically leads to the question, of course, of fuel. How will these vehicles run? Is it a question of giving diesel a second youth? Of course not! This fuel is known to cause thousands of cancers each year, and it's just another scam for consumers. So what good is it? You have to think of a car that really pollutes less. Ditto on the car itself. If the automated car is a way of reviving the competitiveness of the automotive sector to again crush other modes of transport, to revive, all the more, congestion in cities, and if it is so that it is shaped for the city ​​and not for pedestrians, what's the point? On the contrary, let us make the automated car a pillar of sustainable urban mobility by developing, for example, that of carsharing, in particular. Finally, there are other challenges that must be addressed. When will states decide to launch consultations with cities and local communities to review traffic plans? It is all the land use planning that needs to be reviewed. What guarantees will ensure that the automated car, already connected and soon to be intelligent, respects data protection? And, finally, what will become of the millions of Europeans who work as drivers? We made a lot of hay, in particular, as soon as the VTC appeared. Most often, lawmakers remain petrified in the face of the battle between taxis and Uber. But, ultimately, in the end, they will all be faced with a fait accompli. So what will they do? Will they burn their automated cars to prevent their entry into service? Mr. President, it is the car which is in the process of making its revolution. So much the better, we need it.

We are only at the beginning of the use of fully autonomous, driverless vehicles, but it is time to ensure the necessary legal adaptation of the applicable legal framework. Self-driving cars are not only a great opportunity to increase road safety - after all, over 90 percent of all motor vehicle accidents are due to human error. They also contribute to increasing the sustainability of road traffic - by lowering fuel consumption, improving the flow of traffic and reducing traffic jams. And thirdly, they strengthen the European Union as an industrial and research location. Technical solutions are on the market, which is not least shown by the tests on motorways in Germany. Now we have to clarify what happens to data protection. I am thinking of protection against hacker attacks as well as the rights of use for information obtained.

The most important task is to create a legal framework that allows the sustainable use of this new technology and at the same time facilitates further developments. Reconciling different interests and goals presents us with a major challenge, but at the same time, unstoppable technological developments make it urgent to establish a regulatory framework as soon as possible.

I think it would really be worthwhile for the European Commission to produce a book, a summary of issues related to autonomous vehicles, and those that the public sector, the individual states and, ideally, the EU will have to respond to. In principle, I see three areas where the issue of autonomous vehicles concerns us as representatives of individual states and the EU. These are, firstly, the legal issues that have been mentioned here, then the issues of adapting transport infrastructure as the second issue, and the third issue, which is also the issue of cyber security mentioned several times. On legal issues, I think it would be very good for any changes in the law to take place at European level, because, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, it would be very wrong for each Member State to adapt its national legal regimes to the possible introduction of autonomous vehicles. The strongest issue that has been mentioned here and that is related to this is the issue of liability for damage, where it will have to be made clear who is responsible for the damage caused by the operation of such an autonomous vehicle. Manufacturer, user, these are things that will need to be discussed. The issue of infrastructure adaptation is also a topic that should be European. It is not possible for each state to address this issue independently and adapt transport infrastructure in a different way.

The savings in time and comfort could obviously be immense, but it is above all in the area of ​​safety that progress is most expected, since most of the 26,000 annual deaths on European roads are due to human error. How many lives can we save with new technologies? However, many obstacles remain, and many questions remain and need to be resolved. These questions have already been mentioned; I call them back. Who will be responsible in the event of an accident? How to adapt our road and telecommunications infrastructures? How to coordinate the action of the different road users?

Secondly, liability in the event of an accident has been mentioned: is it the passenger’s or the owner’s, who may not be a passenger at that particular time? I think that is a very important question which will have to be looked at. We also have the whole question of costs. Is there any idea about how much these vehicles are likely to cost?

Here we are confronted with new technologies, with developments that are in fact in full development, developments of which we now see the beginning, but certainly not the end. I think it is normal that we ask ourselves a lot of questions and that is precisely why we have to follow this file, these developments, closely. A lot of questions have been asked or a lot of aspects mentioned that we have to take into account: scientific research and innovation, competitiveness, security, liability, the consequences on the labor market, data protection, the protection of privacy, financing. Who is going to pay the costs of the road infrastructure, of the development of the communication infrastructure? Public investment, private investment, public-private partnership, who knows what it will be? Traffic regulations, ensure the protection of the vulnerable road users. Testing, vehicle inspections, driving instructions. The influence on emissions, on our climate development. Those are just a few questions, maybe more to come! I imagine that today's debate is just the first debate in a very long line. I think we are at the start of a long journey that we will hopefully take together to understand all the implications, to also guide these new developments in a positive way, because that will be very much needed. There will be consequences for the transport sector, for society as such, but also for our competitive position. That journey has, of course, already begun, in the sense that the European institutions already set up a platform - I have already referred to it - in 2014, the C-ITS platform, a cooperative platform that works together and that follows everything that happens. The first milestone has already been set, with a note, a final report that was delivered in January 2016. The Commission intends to publish a master plan later this year to further monitor and supervise these developments. There is also a high level group on the automotive industry, to which I already referred in my introduction, \"GEAR 2030\" and this one is also busy developing a road map. Within the framework of GEAR 2030, a wide consultation on autonomous driving has also been started and for all these reasons together and also because the Commission plans to come up with a master plan, I can tell you that there is not immediately a plan this year to come up with a green paper. But there will certainly be a document. That will no doubt be communicated to here too and I think we will sit here many more times, with the ten of us, Mr President, or hopefully sometimes with some more Members of Parliament, to discuss this important file and its development. to follow.
