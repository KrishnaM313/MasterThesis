Unfortunately, since our last debate, the situation has not improved. Europe is still facing challenging times due to the pandemic. The spread of the virus remains worrisome in most Member States, including my own. New variants of concern have emerged, making it necessary to follow strict measures to contain the disease, while the vaccination of our population has not progressed as quickly as we would have wished.  So it’s time to redouble our work – not to lower our ambition or wish away real practical difficulties. At the same time, we must not forget what we have achieved so far. The EU vaccination strategy has been an example of unity and solidarity in action. It was motivated by – and has achieved – real tangible benefits. It has allowed an equitable and fair distribution of vaccines amongst Member States, so that all EU citizens can now have access to the vaccines in an equal fashion.  We have had three COVID-19 vaccines approved in less than a year and are expecting a few more to come in the near future. We have begun vaccination campaigns across all Member States. All these are remarkable milestones following a path of solidarity. And right now, my country knows better than most that European solidarity is more than just words. It’s action. And Portugal is very grateful for the numerous offers of assistance and concrete support it has received from several Member States. We knew that during the first stages of our vaccination campaigns, the availability of the vaccines would be limited. This is why we had to prioritise certain groups, like elderly people and health care workers, in our national vaccination strategies. But the recent news of delays in vaccine deliveries by some producers is a source of concern to which we must react in real time.  Vaccine production is a complex process, especially on this unprecedented scale. The truth is that companies may have overestimated their production capacities. We need to make sure that companies respect the contracts signed and deliver on their commitments. Countries need to know how many vaccines will become available and by when, in order to plan their vaccination campaigns, and we need this data to work. This is crucial.  Recently, the Commission has also put in place an export authorisation mechanism for COVID-19 vaccines, and this will allow us to understand where the vaccines produced in the EU are being distributed. In both cases, transparency is paramount to increase citizens’ trust in this process.  We, as Council Presidency, are willing to contribute to this endeavour. Prime Minister António Costa, together with the President of the Commission, wrote a letter to all Heads of State and Government inviting Member States to remain united and combine efforts with industry to ramp up the supply of vaccines and production capacity in Europe. They also presented some concrete ideas on how to improve our fight against the different variants of the virus. Also, the European Council will meet on 25 February to continue articulating our joint response to COVID-19. The General Affairs Council will prepare this discussion, and we will continue to work intensively at the technical and political level.  This effort should also help us to roll out the COVID-19 vaccines at global level. Solidarity cannot stop at European borders. Fair access to vaccines for low- and middle-income countries is consistent with our values and is in our own interest. We will not be safe until everybody is safe.  We also need to put more effort into communication. Citizens have the right to factual information, and we need to convey such information as clearly and transparently as possible. At the same time, we need to keep monitoring carefully the vaccination campaigns in close collaboration with the EU bodies in order to be able to address other possible challenges at an early stage and take appropriate action. We all know this will be a long process – longer and more complex than we ever expected, be it at the level of public health or as regards the social and economic repercussions of the pandemic. As the President of the Commission put it: it’s a marathon.  Vaccination is a powerful tool in our response to this crisis, but it will take time before a majority of the EU population is vaccinated. We still have to keep working together for the common good, enduring social distancing, wearing face masks and taking all other protective measures that we can until we finally beat this virus. Walking on a thin path between what has worked since the Middle Ages and the impressive technological achievements of the present, we need to stay together. We need to stay united.

In Polen sind bis Anfang Februar 94 % des medizinischen Personals und 80 % der Bewohnerinnen und Bewohner von Altenheimen geimpft worden. In Dänemark sind es in den Altenheimen sogar 93 %. Und in Italien haben wir bis heute mehr als 4 % der Bevölkerung, die eine Impfung erhalten haben. Diese drei Beispiele zeigen, dass die Impfkampagne in Europa vielerorts an Fahrt aufgenommen hat. Insgesamt sind in Europa seit Dezember 26 Millionen Impfdosen ausgeliefert worden. Mehr als 17 Millionen Menschen wurden geimpft. Und wir werden so hart wie nur irgend möglich arbeiten, dass wir unser Ziel erreichen, nämlich, dass wir bis Ende des Sommers 70 % der erwachsenen Bevölkerung in Europa geimpft haben. Dennoch ist es eine Tatsache, dass wir heute beim Kampf gegen das Virus noch nicht da sind, wo wir sein wollen. Wir waren spät dran bei der Zulassung, wir waren zu optimistisch bei der Massenproduktion und vielleicht waren wir uns auch zu sicher, dass das Bestellte tatsächlich pünktlich geliefert wird. Wir müssen uns fragen, warum das so ist und welche Lehren wir daraus ziehen können. Aber lassen Sie mich dennoch zunächst mit drei Punkten beginnen, von deren Richtigkeit ich tief überzeugt bin: Es war richtig und es ist richtig, dass wir Europäerinnen und Europäer den Impfstoff gemeinsam bestellt haben und nun solidarisch teilen. Ich mag mir gar nicht ausmalen, was es bedeutet hätte, wenn einige wenige große Mitgliedstaaten sich Impfstoff gesichert hätten und der Rest leer ausgegangen wäre, was das für unseren Binnenmarkt bedeutet hätte und für die Einheit Europas. Es wäre wirtschaftlicher Unsinn und es wäre das Ende unserer Gemeinschaft. The second point I am deeply convinced of: the same solidarity must also be shown with our partners in our neighbourhood and across the world. This is also a matter of stopping the spread of the virus to reduce the likelihood of mutations. The access to vaccines for low- and middle-income countries is therefore as much about our own interest as it is about solidarity.  This is why we set up COVAX, the facility in which high-income countries can finance the access to vaccines for low- and middle-income countries. As Team Europe, that is the Member States and the European institutions, we have provided EUR 850 million, making us one of the biggest contributors to COVAX, and COVAX start delivering vaccines as of this month. And I am sure that this House will agree that we need more, because our responsibility extends far beyond Europe’s border.  Mesdames et Messieurs les députés, le troisième point que je voudrais soulever concerne notre approche et notre processus. Nous avons fait le choix de ne pas prendre de raccourcis en matière de sécurité ou d’efficacité. Nous assumons ce choix pleinement. Il n’y a pas de compromis à faire lorsqu’il s’agit d’injecter une substance biologiquement active chez une personne en bonne santé, et c’est pourquoi nous nous appuyons sur le processus de contrôle de l’EMA, notre agence européenne des médicaments. Oui, cela veut dire que l’approbation prend trois à quatre semaines supplémentaires. Ce temps supplémentaire est un investissement essentiel pour la confiance et la sécurité. Et oui, il y a également des leçons à tirer de ce processus et nous le faisons déjà. En premier lieu, nous devons améliorer le partage de données des essais cliniques avec l’EMA, c’est pourquoi nous lançons dès maintenant un nouveau réseau européen d’essais cliniques. En parallèle, notre commissaire de la santé, Stella Kyriakides, va travailler sur un cadre réglementaire pour permettre à l’EMA d’examiner les vaccins aussi rapidement que possible. Une autre leçon à tirer concerne la production de masse de vaccins. À juste titre, nous étions tous très concentrés sur le développement du vaccin, mais globalement, nous avons sous-estimé la difficulté liée à la production de masse. Il faut normalement cinq à dix ans pour produire un nouveau vaccin. Nous l’avons fait en dix mois. C’est une grande réussite scientifique. Nous devrions en être fiers. Mais en quelque sorte, la science a dépassé l’industrie. La production des nouveaux vaccins est un processus très complexe. Il n’est simplement pas possible de mettre en place un site de production du jour au lendemain. De plus, ces vaccins intègrent jusqu’à 400 composants et la production implique jusqu’à 100 entreprises. C’est pourquoi nous avons créé une task force pour accroître la production industrielle des vaccins sous l’autorité de Thierry Breton, notre commissaire en charge du marché intérieur. L’objectif est de détecter les problèmes et d’aider à les résoudre. L’industrie doit s’adapter au rythme de la science.  Indeed, industry has to match the groundbreaking pace of science. We fully understand that difficulties will arise in the mass production of vaccines, but Europe has invested billions of euros in capacities in advance and we urge the Member States to plan their vaccine rollout. So now we all need predictability and this is why we introduced the export transparency and authorisation mechanism. To be very clear, we do not intend to restrict companies that are honouring their contracts with the European Union and there is an automatic exemption for exports to the EEA countries, for the Western Balkans and the rest of our neighbourhood, for humanitarian needs and for the 92 low and middle—income countries covered by COVAX. So Europe is always ready to help, but we insist on our fair share.  As far as the mechanism goes, allow me a word on the island of Ireland. The bottom line is that mistakes were made in the process leading up to the decision, and I deeply regret that. But, in the end, we got it right, and I can reassure you that my Commission will do its utmost to protect the peace of Northern Ireland, just as it has done throughout the entire Brexit process.  Honourable Members, the battle against the virus is a marathon and not a sprint. It needs foresight, endurance and stamina. Almost every day we hear news of different variants and how contagious they are. We do not yet have the full picture when it comes to the effectiveness of treatments and vaccines on new strains, but we do know these variants will continue to emerge and we do know that we need to anticipate and prepare immediately.  This is why we are starting our new Health Emergency Response Authority (HERA) project now by launching our preparedness agenda against new variants next week. We need to adapt our regulations to this new challenge. We need rapid sequencing and clinical characterisation of new mutations, and we need systematic sample and data sharing across networks and labs because, to defeat the virus, we need to know as much detail about it as possible.  In parallel, we will tackle a second challenge. As I said, we are dealing with completely new mRNA vaccines never manufactured at scale before. One of the current bottlenecks is, for example, linked to just two synthetic molecules. If we had just 250 grammes more of these molecules, companies say they could produce one million more doses of vaccine. This is why we need more coordination on the supply of key ingredients. We need to improve manufacturing surge capacity and we need to boost cooperation between the public and the private sector. This will be the core task of HERA because we must ensure that, despite future mutants, we will be safe next winter and beyond.  We all know that the information we have on the virus and the vaccines can change by the hour, and this is why we will set up a contact group between the European Parliament and the Commission. I will do my utmost to ensure that you are able to scrutinise all the contracts we have signed because I know that trust needs transparency.  Meine sehr geehrten Damen und Herren Abgeordnete, wir alle geben unser Bestes im Kampf gegen das Virus – in den Familien, in den Städten und Gemeinden, in den Mitgliedstaaten und auf der europäischen Ebene. Und das sollten wir uns gegenseitig nicht absprechen. Wir werden diese Herausforderungen nur bewältigen, wenn wir zusammenhalten. Unser gemeinsamer Feind, das ist das Virus.

No handshakes, no visits to grandparents, no holidays, no meetings with colleagues at work ... only the home office and always with this terrible mask. The vast majority of our citizens understand the measures introduced mainly by the Member States and each region. This is the only way to protect one other. We have to thank citizens for their understanding and especially those who work in the health sector every day. They are the heroes. Everyone wants to escape, and the only chance of doing so is through vaccination. That is the light at the end of the tunnel, and probably the only light we currently have. And that is the reason for the disappointment. That is the reason for the huge expectations that we face when we speak with our citizens. To avoid further frustration among citizens, I think the most important thing is to tell the truth. First of all, demand is much, much greater than production. We need time. The second message is, yes, the EU made all the mistakes; not everything was perfect over the last weeks and month, and in the coming weeks and months there will be time to draw up a report here in Parliament about what can be learned from the developments of the last few weeks.  Another message is to tell people that many of the decisions we took together were the right decisions. The key decisions were right. First, without the European Union, without our fight for more money, for research, there would have been no chance of developing the new types of vaccine. That was right. It was also right not to distinguish between first and second-class Europeans. To keep Europe together was right. It was also right that we as lawmakers established the principle of liability rules for companies, for distributing products in Europe, and these rules must also be respected by pharmaceutical companies. The Brits gave up. We as the EU did not. And fourth, safety first. It will probably take a little bit of time, but we didn’t initiate a fast track procedure with the European Medicines Agency (EMA). We expect our experts to do a proper assessment, and that was right. Dear colleagues, again, not everything has gone perfectly in the last year, but the key decisions were right, together with the governments, together with the Parliament, together with the Commission. I also want to say a personal word to Stella Kyriakides. As our Health Commissioner, she is currently at the centre of the storm, and I want to underline that she, and the whole team, did a great job for Europe. So thank you so much, Stella, for your work.  Meine sehr verehrten Kolleginnen und Kollegen! Neben der Sicherheit müssen wir jetzt Ambitionen an den Tag legen.  Meine Fraktion hat gestern einen Elf-Punkte-Plan vorgelegt, wie wir die Produktion schnell anheben können. Wir brauchen Investitionen in Produktionen, 10-Milliarden-Programm. Wir müssen verhindern, dass sich die Mutanten weiter verbreiten, uns darauf auch vorbereiten. Wir müssen alle Produktionsanlagen mobilisieren, eine große Pharmaallianz schließen, um die Produktion nach oben zu kriegen.  Wir brauchen als Zweites eine Zusammenarbeit der westlichen Welt, einen G7-Gipfel, wo wir mit den Vereinigten Staaten und Großbritannien reden, um den Egoismus, der dort herrscht, zu überwinden, Produktionsketten nicht zu unterbrechen.  Wir brauchen als Drittes jetzt: ja, die Bereitschaft zur Kooperation mit den anderen Staaten, aber auch nicht naiv zu sein als Europäische Union. Ein Exportverbot von in Europa produzierten Impfstoffen muss aus unserer Sicht nach wie vor als Option auf dem Tisch bleiben. Wenn Großbritannien keinen AstraZeneca-Impfstoff nach Europa liefert, warum sollten wir dann den BioNTech-Impfstoff nach Großbritannien liefern?  Zum Weiteren brauchen wir endlich gemeinsame Einreiseregelungen. Vor einem Jahr hat meine Fraktion bereits gefordert, gegenüber China im gesamten Schengen-Raum eine einheitliche Einreiseregelung zu machen. Wir schaffen es auf der Ministerseite – bei den Innenministern – bis heute nicht, dass wir endlich gemeinsame Regelungen für Südamerika oder für Südafrika bekommen. Das ist das Scheitern der Innenminister auf diesem Kontinent, weil das nicht gelingt. Bis heute warten wir auf Entscheidungen in diesem Bereich.  Dänemark und Schweden haben jetzt angekündigt, einen nationalen Impfpass auszustellen – ein Zertifikat für die Bürger bereitzustellen, dass sie geimpft sind. Täglich werden Zehntausende von Europäern geimpft, und wir schaffen es nicht, einen europaweit standardisierten Impfpass zu Verfügung zu stellen, damit wir die Bewegungsfreiheit im Schengen-Raum besser bewerkstelligen können. Auch eines der Themen, das umgehend angepackt werden muss.  Zu guter Letzt: die Wirtschaft, die Arbeitsplätze. Gestern haben wir das grüne Licht für den Recovery and Resilience Fund gegeben. Grünes Licht für den Wiederaufbau Europas. Auf mitgliedstaatlicher Seite haben bisher nur vier Staaten die own resources—Entscheidung gefällt. Die restlichen Staaten sind nicht in der Lage, grünes Licht zu geben, dass die Gelder endlich fließen können. Es liegt also enorm viel vor uns.  Ich habe vorher von den Mitarbeitern im Gesundheitswesen gesprochen, die eine große Verantwortung tragen. Sie sind im Krisenmodus. Wenn sie Rückschläge haben, dann wird nicht intern diskutiert, sondern dann wird angepackt, dann wird weitergearbeitet, dann wird versucht, das Beste zu machen. Und das sollten wir Europäer jetzt auch machen.

Of course we have been fighting COVID-19 for almost a year and we all want to, as soon as possible, return to longed-for normalcy. Precisely because of the seriousness of the situation, I invite all of you to stand for a moment and look at the situation without turmoil, setting aside what can be struggles between one another and also setting aside those partisan interests which are legitimate, of course, in this Parliament, but this is not the time now. This week I've heard of everything: fiasco, disaster, failure... These messages from some, full of criticism and frustration, finally, are in citizenship, in a citizenry that is very frustrating and which is currently expecting a lot from the European Union. Because it seems that at least citizens are clear: that we are not going to get out of this crisis on their own and that it takes the efforts of all to get out of this situation. Let us therefore leave the catastrophic messages and try to see reality as it is because only in this way can we take the necessary actions. Head and responsibility. With the criticisms that are necessary, of course, but also with a constructive spirit and institutional loyalty. Adopting a European vaccine strategy was the right decision. The only one, actually. What we should have done from the beginning. Let's remember the start of the crisis. Let's remember those fights between countries about hoarding respirators or masks. It doesn't look like the save who can be the best solution right now. In the United States, President Biden has proposed, with respect to vaccines, to activate the Defense Production Act, an exceptional measure. And it speaks of a titanic logistical effort to get the vaccine to every corner of the United States. In the European Union we face the same challenge for a larger population than the United States, but with fewer instruments. Yes, fewer instruments, because the European Union has no competence in the area of health and has less perfect economic governance in this regard and more unfinished. And that's why we had to create new instruments on the fly and do it all in record time. We have carried out in record time the implementation of unemployment reinsurance. In record time we have implemented the recovery and resilience plan. And in record time there has been, with everyone's efforts, a vaccine that, under normal circumstances, can take ten years for the president to produce. Nearly a year after the start of this crisis, we are much closer to seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. It has been a collective effort, with many sacrifices and seeking solutions with solidarity. The delay in delivering AstraZeneca vaccines has caused disappointment and mistrust and it is normal for citizens to want to know what is going on. And that is why this Parliament must have the capacity to have a monitoring tool with the European Commission, so that we can have all the information. A follow-up committee to which Commissioner Kyriakides, to which Commissioner Breton, in charge of health and industry respectively, can come to account, which is what they have to do with this Parliament. Because we have invested a lot of public money, EUR 2.7 billion from the European Union and EUR 750 million from the Member States. It's a lot of public money and we need to have an accounting to know what we're doing with those public media. I know that there are other discussions on the table that are also necessary, but what we have to focus on right now is to foster partnerships and consortia between pharmacists from the European Union and third countries to accelerate vaccine production. Let us not fall into European nationalisms either. This is a global problem and requires a global look. The export control mechanism can be used to control where vaccines in the European Union are, but it should never hinder global vaccination agreements. Let's stop for a moment, please. The European Union has purchased 2.3 billion vaccines for a population of 500 million people in the Union. The Union's responsibility goes far beyond our borders. As we vaccinate, we must have a global commitment to all those who also need our solidarity. If the start has been delayed, we are now increasing capacity, and the Commission estimates that supply will grow exponentially. That's what we have to work on right now. The percentage of population vaccinated in the European Union must be increased to also give a message of certainty and tranquility. Let's stop catastrophic that doesn't help at all and let's be able to draw lessons because we're still on time, because it's never too late to learn. And a very important one is that the European Union needs to be equipped with more instruments. Thus, in the face of future challenges, we will be able to react more quickly and effectively. In my group the Commission will always find a demanding but responsible partner to seek solutions and build that Europe of solidarity.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 2, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 6, "date": "2021-02-10.json", "name": "Dacian CIOLOŞ", "mepid": "197631", "text": "  on behalf of the Renew Group. Mr President, Madam President, thank you for being here in the European Parliament. My group has insisted that this debate take place, and I think it is very useful at this stage. I have no doubt that vaccination is the project that will most mark Europeans during this mandate, beyond the recovery plan that was voted on yesterday and which is also in itself a revolution. This vaccine affects every European in what is most precious: his health, that of his loved ones and the return to freedom. This is the first time in history that Europe has such a responsibility to European society in the health field. Boris Johnson's attitude gives an idea of what could have happened in Europe if each Member State had been left to face these challenges alone and the Member States had been put into competition. This European responsibility, which is in fact expected by the citizens, must materialis itself in a Europe of health complementary to what the Member States are doing, so that the European institutions and the Commission have clear responsibilities with regard to health. But fully supporting the collective approach does not mean giving a blank cheque. On the contrary, it is a requirement, because Europe has no right to make mistakes. That is why we are so demanding here in Parliament. Each delay must be explained, justified and accompanied by solutions to remedy it.  One day, we will also have to explain what could have been done better in the contracts that were negotiated with the vaccine producers. But now every new challenge must be anticipated, prepared and accompanied by solutions. I welcome the mission you have entrusted to Thierry Breton alongside Commissioner Kyriakides, to also meet the industrial challenge of mass production alongside that of health. This mission must cover the urgency and the medium term: the structuring of a fully independent, European and operational vaccine sector, because it is conceivable that such challenges may arise again.  Europe needs this capacity not only in terms of research, where progress has been made, but also in industrial production and production. Thanks to our research strike force and production capacity, we have a responsibility as the European Union, not only for the Member States, but also for those around us. In the Balkans, on the African continent and beyond, Europe must be able to bring vaccines as quickly as possible. We must continue the COVAX initiative and further mobilize the international community in cooperation that must be established. We must also rise to the democratic challenge by being open and transparent at every step. I am counting on you, Madam President, to set up this contact group with the European Parliament as soon as possible, as you have announced, and we are also organising ourselves in Parliament, so that at every stage this house will be informed in real time of the difficulties, the new challenges and the solutions implemented.

It is clear that the vaccination campaign was the greatest challenge together with the economic recovery of the European Union for 2020 and 2021 and, as previous speakers have said, the Commission has played a lot of work and a lot of work is being done on this campaign. Whether you wanted to take the stage or not, you promised that joint management would bring benefits and a resolution of the problem as soon as possible, but that was not the case. Today I would have expected you, Mr von der Leyen, to have explained to us in detail what has gone wrong, because it is clear to everyone that something has gone wrong, and to have explained to us in detail what the Commission will do to make up for lost ground. Instead, you began your speech by reminding us of some of the supposed successes of this vaccination campaign, and you also mentioned my country, which was one of the most affected. But these successes are only perceived here, the citizens and governments are not perceiving them. Frankly, the spectacle we have seen in recent weeks of disagreements and disagreements even within the College of Commissioners has certainly not been a recognition of one's mistakes and a start.  I have been here for seven years now and I have understood one thing: in my opinion, the biggest shortcoming of the European Union is the inability to recognise its mistakes and to correct the course in time. Unfortunately, it was done with some rules and with some choices with which we dealt with the eurozone debt crisis in 2010 and today, unfortunately, my impression is that it is also being done on this vaccination campaign.  It is not for me to remind you of the importance, above all, of two aspects. The first is health, which is what we care about most, as my colleagues used to remind us: the faster we implement this campaign, the more lives we will save. The other aspect, secondary but equally important, is that of the economy: we know that those who first vaccinate, the sooner they will emerge from this crisis. The data tell us that compared to our competitors outside the European Union, compared to the United Kingdom, the United States, India, China and Israel, we are currently several weeks behind. A few days ago, some analysts estimated the additional damage from these delays at EUR 90 billion.  I would like to see one thing, Mr von der Leyen: to clearly acknowledge your mistakes, because everyone is wrong, we are not infallible, and that is certainly complex management, and you tell us clearly what concrete steps you want to take. You have set yourself an ambitious objective, which is to vaccinate 70 % of the European population by September, but seeing the state of affairs seems to us to be an unrealistic objective to date.  So, very realistically, tell us clearly what the objectives are, and why an entity such as the European Union, which has so many well-paid professionals and lawyers, is unable to draw up a contract or to be respected by pharmaceutical companies. Because it is clear that there is a problem if a Union, which is a geopolitical power, fails to enforce the contracts it writes from certain multinationals. This is a big problem.  So I expect realism, I expect clear objectives, whatever they may be, and unfortunately we will once again, in my opinion, have to assess the fact that the European Union among the parts of the developed world will still be the last to emerge from this crisis.

Now three have already been authorised in Europe and more are expected. This is indeed a marvellous achievement. However, we must now look at the things that need to be urgently improved and, most importantly, we need to ramp up production – not just by a little, but by a lot! And, yes, that should have been done earlier. And, yes, that costs a lot of money. But continuing in and out of lockdowns for months on end will also come at a tremendous cost. We also need to draw lessons concerning the transparency of the contracts the EU made with those pharma companies. In order to strengthen public trust and allow for democratic control – also of this very Parliament – we need to have full transparency of the contacts. And yes, dear Commission, dear colleagues, we also need to be self—critical. This crisis has painfully demonstrated the value of public research and of good public healthcare systems – areas that have been constantly thrown under the bus in an attempt to save money in recent years. Now we see how lethal such an ideology of austerity can be.  Let’s learn together and invest in our resilience, and in our social fabric of public services, education and digitalisation. But we cannot pay attention to only our own well-being. We have a responsibility in the world. While the rich countries are buying up vaccines and fighting over who gets the doses first, some regions of the world risk being totally left behind and of getting their shots with years of delay. That is a real catastrophe. Nobody is safe until everyone is safe. Vaccines need to be accessible and affordable. We must do everything in our power to scale up production massively and ensure a just, global distribution. This is possible under WTO rules, and I wish the European Commission would be more supportive in using this flexibility. Intellectual property and bureaucratic barriers should not stand in the way of ensuring a more rapid and equal distribution globally. Overcoming the pandemic will unfortunately still take time, and we cannot relax efforts to limit the spread of the virus, especially given the new variants. But reducing cases massively will not happen as long as some liberties are allowed in some EU countries, while forbidden in other countries, like ski resorts or shopping centres. It will also not happen as long as testing and tracing efforts remain highly disproportionate across Member States. Of course, no single approach will work for everyone, but we will not overcome the pandemic while retreating to international egoisms. Yes, the ambition to tackle this crisis together and to deliver the vaccines together, ensuring equal access for all EU citizens, was – and remains – the right recipe.

Europeans have trusted the European Union and the Member States of the European Commission to effectively lead to a vaccination process. Any European who wants this, who has the will, has the right to receive a vaccine in a timely manner. Our future, our health, our economy depend on it – that's all that unites us in the idea of the European Union.  But the question today is: has the European Commission handled this process?  Didn't she fail? You have set Poland as an example, among other things – as an example of success. Yes, I agree that the government is doing a great job of immunisation and could have vaccinated many more Poles, all those who want Polish to take advantage of the possibility of vaccination. There is only one \"but\" – there is not enough vaccines. Yet the European Commission, by signing the agreement also on behalf of Polish, taking over this part of the responsibility for the health of European citizens belonging to the Member States, has also taken on the responsibility of effectively enforcing those agreements.   On February 8, another batch of one of Polish was due to arrive on The New York City. It will arrive on 11 February and not 100% as the agreement envisaged, but 20% less. What's next? What will be the next months and weeks? Today, this is the European Commission's most important task – to effectively enforce those agreements that have been signed so that each Member State receives the amount of vaccines it needs. There is no more important task today. Solidarity matters, but effectiveness also matters. A lot of words, a lot of declarations... The Commissioner spoke here about the future. And well, let groups be formed, let teams be formed – but they are to be effective.  Apart from the ritual tools of indignation or declarations, does the European Commission, in addition to the various resolutions that are adopted, have an effective tool to enforce those agreements that I will emphasise have been signed once again? In this agreement, the European Commission has committed itself to the Member States, towards Europeans, that the right amount of vaccines will go to these countries in a timely manner.

Mr President, Mrs von der Leyen, I am not going to go down four paths. I have a key question for you today: how could the European Commission agree to go to bed like this in front of pharmaceutical companies? In the management of the vaccine strategy, I have the feeling, Mrs von der Leyen, that the leaders of the Big Pharma have made the law for you.  First of all, on negotiations and contracts: it is opacity at all levels. No information on the negotiations, despite the requests of our Parliament. Only three contracts made public thanks to our citizen pressure. And this is what they look like, for those who have not seen it: all the most important information, such as the price, the delivery schedule or even the details of the liability clauses are hidden. For the other contracts, we will have to wait for the labs to deign to publish them. Because yes, they're the ones who decide.  On deliveries, then, delays in a mess and no schedule met. Without any penalty, of course. Because yes, it's the labs that decide.  On patents, same scandal. These vaccines have been developed with billions of euros of public money, but patents remain the exclusive property of \"Big Pharma\". As a result, states cannot produce the much-needed doses on a very large scale. Because yes, it's the labs that decide.  And finally, the icing on the cake, 15 billion profits, 15 billion turnover and 20 to 25% margin for Pfizer, which is also delighted with its success, its blockbuster, I quote them. Sanofi did not find a vaccine, but on the other hand, they found 400 research positions to be eliminated and 4 billion euros of dividends to distribute. The labs are taking out the champagne. Because yes, they're the ones who decide.  What an admission of helplessness, Madame von der Leyen! Is it not up to us here in this chamber to make the law? We are able to impose on our citizens an unprecedented restriction of our freedoms, but we would be unable to set the rules for \"Big Pharma\"? The Commission must be held to account. That is why, on behalf of our left-wing group in the European Parliament, I call for the immediate creation of a commission of inquiry into the Commission's responsibility for this disaster. We have a right to know, because after all, these vaccines were paid for with our money and the equation must be simple: public money, public contracts, patents in the public domain. It's as simple as that. For decades, we have been leaving everything, right down to our health, in the hands of the private sector, and now we are deadlocked. Here we propose a reverse path: to put an end to the omnipotence of laboratories. It is time to drop patents and ensure that no profit is made on the pandemic. This is the only way to be able to quickly vaccinate the entire planet, rich and poor countries, to reassure citizens who doubt, by taking vaccines out of the clutches of multinationals, to hope to relive after a year of mourning, anxiety, isolation, precariousness. This should be your role, Mrs von der Leyen, if you had not abdicated in front of the labs when the population can no longer take it, the insecure are hungry, the young people despair. Let's take back control of the labs, take health out of the market and finally consider vaccines as common goods of humanity, not the cash machine of shareholders.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 11, "date": "2021-02-10.json", "name": "Antoni COMÍN I OLIVERES", "mepid": "202352", "text": "   Mr President, Madam President, the European Union should defend the lifting of the intellectual property rights of vaccines available on the market, as permitted by the agreement of the World Trade Organisation which governs these issues.

The first is that all the capabilities of the pharmaceutical industry in all countries of the world must be mobilized in order to speed up the global immunization process, because the health crisis and the resulting economic crisis are global. It would make no sense to vaccinate only a part of the planet. And compulsory licenses under Article 31 of the AGREEMENT on intellectual property aspects are not enough. But there's a second reason. Manon Aubry talked about it, these vaccines were paid mainly for public funds: $8 trillion of the $14 trillion their overall development cost, and $2,000 by philanthropy. As Ellen T. Hoyn said, it was unwise for our governments to return this public money unconditionally. The suspension of the patent should have been a condition for public funding.

And we are seeing what it is like in Portugal: if you loosen up too quickly and too early, things will get bad. That is why we must all stick to the measures. And we also need to protect more at the borders. Mr President of the Commission, Ursula von der Leyen! Open borders are a noble objective, but we have a dangerous virus mutation here – three in fact – and that is why it is necessary to put more pressure on us to protect Europe as a whole, but also to look more closely at the regions, that we have controls, that the mutations do not spread too quickly. On the subject of vaccinations, I would like to disasincen two myths. It is always said that Europe has ordered too late. But first of all, the responsibility here lies primarily with The most important vaccine from BioNTech at Pfizer. Pfizer has refused to accept the right of any European to sue if the company makes a mistake, as resourceful journalists have written several times. And I would like to see the person who says that I do not want Europeans to have the right to sue a company that makes a serious mistake when it comes to harm. I want someone to sit down here and say, \"I don't care about the law anymore.\" The Commission has not done that, and it cannot be criticised for that, dear friends. And then they say it wasn't enough money. Only the 2.7 billion from the ESI are mentioned. But if you add up the money that the Member States are already spending to pay for the vaccines with the ESI, you get 22 billion.

I am thinking most of all the citizens who are now waiting for their vaccine, and I would therefore like to make three clear demands of the Commission. The Commission must ensure that the agreements are complied with, that the agreements are transparent; it's about trust. The Commission must secure supplies, increase production and speed up member states' efforts to carry out vaccinations, so that we reach our goal. And the Commission must take the collective leadership of our common vaccine strategy so that vaccination is equal and fair.  We must all work together at a difficult time. We must ensure fair access to vaccines throughout the EU, but also globally. \"No one should be left behind,\" so many people say.

We are with you when you recall that in the United Kingdom, fewer British citizens have been vaccinated with two doses than, on average, in the European Union. The European Union's so-called delay with the United Kingdom is simply due to the fact that we have followed the procedures. We have followed the advice of the European Medicines Agency and we are vaccinating with two doses to fully and not partially vaccinate European citizens.

Failing during the financial crisis in 2008, failing during the migration crisis in 2015, failing at the beginning of the health crisis with no anticipation or coordination of the action of the Member States, the European Union promised us that it would catch up on vaccines. The European Commission has centralised the ordering and distribution of vaccines. But all the countries that have organized outside the European Union are doing better today. The British are 12 million vaccinated when France, Spain and Italy are only two million. Germany was careful to buy doses in addition to the European group order. Hungary had the ability to buy vaccines from Russia and China. But many countries, including France, are tied up in the scheme led by the European Commission.  As always, when the European institutions are in check, technocrats seek to identify culprits. Faced with the slow pace of astraZeneca deliveries, Mrs von der Leyen, you have decided to temporarily re-establish the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland to block exports.

Seven years later, at the beginning of the crisis, we are forced to use Russian wide-body aircraft to supply masks by airlift between China and Europe. And now, after expressing doubts about the Sputnik vaccine, we're going to have to beg for it. What about the pitiful performance of High Representative Josep Borrell in Moscow in recent days? He had nothing to offer, so he got nothing. What a mixture of arrogance and ignorance to claim leniency for Navalny and access to the Sputnik vaccine without offering any consideration. Then asking for additional sanctions adds the grotesque to the humiliation. The opacity in the contracts, the inability to enforce them, the delays in deliveries, the ridiculous diplomacy...

We already know what the Commission will say as a statement. They will say that we need a health union and that failure was only because europe has too little power, as usual.  It is tragic that Prime Minister Löfven not only supports this Commission but also wants to give it even more power. The European Commission's negotiating strategy on the purchase of vaccines came too late and was too focused on price instead of the terms of delivery. What is amazing is that, on the one hand, the Commission is critical of the price of the vaccine that can save lives, but, on the other hand, is presenting the biggest budgets in the history of the European Union, which go to a lot of waste. Sweden, which is among the hardest hit by the pandemic, will also provide other EU countries with rescue packages that go to citizens' wages in Spain or bridges in Italy. It is lives we should save, it is not the euro.  The Commission wanted to take action against covid-19 but failed to secure deliveries.

We asked a year ago to fix this and to have a common approach, and we insist on that today. The understatement of the year was of course the remark that companies may have underestimated their capacity to produce. Yes, hiccups are normal, and then together we try to fix it, like with Pfizer, and I think we did. But some companies give the impression that they are acting in bad faith, and there the EPP believes that with regard to pre-financing that was given up front to set up production, we should be able to take that away, take it back if companies don’t deliver. And I know I’m over time, but I want to make one important remark when it comes to ... [...] papier dat heel erg geduldig is. Wat op papier staat, wordt niet altijd geleverd.

To secure European citizens, you have taken responsibility by turning your attention to safe and effective vaccines authorised by the European Medicines Agency, at a time when others were making different safety choices. Thank you for these choices. But today, there is an urgent need to vaccinate, especially the most vulnerable. First of all, we must win the trust of European citizens in the vaccination process and there can be no confidence if there is no transparency. We must have access to the contracts signed between Europe and the Big Pharma - access to all contracts, access to liability clauses. We must be able to play our full role as a defender of the rights of our fellow citizens, and thank you for your proposal to create a contact group between the Commission and Parliament. Then, Madam President, you told us that the vaccine is a global common good and I agree with you. But if that is really the case, we need to be able to produce the necessary vaccines as a whole as a whole. Mobilize all the tools you have at your disposal to force pharmaceutical companies to honour their contracts! It is not conceivable, at the heart of the pandemic and the progression of variants, that we are blocked by the inability of laboratories to produce sufficient vaccines. The scientific miracle of creating these vaccines cannot be sabotaged by logistical chaos. And even though production is complex, the sharing of patents by industry through voluntary licenses to other laboratories is essential.

To want to sell this chaos as a strategy is a mockery of the citizens of the EU.  Unfortunately, this is not a strategy, but an unreasonable incompetence. This failure has severe and concrete consequences: millions of citizens fear more than ever for their health and economic existence. Vaccinations should, according to all policymakers, show the way out of this pandemic – without, of course, any vaccination requirement. They are therefore crucial.  But there is a massive shortage of vaccines in the EU. It is not enough for even the most vulnerable groups. Others, on the other hand – I am just mentioning Israel, the United States, and the United Kingdom – are making considerable progress in vaccinating their populations. These countries provided vaccines early, independently and successfully. Happiness that was denied to the citizens of the EU. The EU, on the other hand, has once again failed: the Brussels Eurocrats ordered too late, too little and completely inadequate.  They have not been able to obtain even the cheapest and presumably weakest vaccine, which is not even approved in Switzerland, but they have excluded the apparently highly effective vaccine from Russia from the outset – presumably out of simple political aversion.  It is no wonder that you, Mrs von der Leyen, are now looking at Britain with disapproval. The British Government has done its duty to order and pay for the vaccines on time, and has proved how to do it without the EU.  We remember that the EU used the Good Friday Agreement for years to put pressure on the British side in the Brexit negotiations. Now she did not hesitate at first to break this for her own benefit. It was only the public pressure that led them to continue to allow vaccine exports through Northern Ireland in the first place. This is a declaration of bankruptcy. The hastily enacted export ban is nothing more than a helpless attempt to somehow conceal one's own total failure. The EU Commission, let us be honest, never had a strategy. And she still doesn't have it.  Mrs von der Leyen, as German Minister of Defence you have sent soldiers with broomsticks into the manoeuvre. Even then, they did not have the decency to draw personal conclusions.  Here from Brussels, the consequences of its incompetence are becoming increasingly fatal: it is costing lives. It is destroying the economic existence of millions of citizens on a large scale, as a result of the lack of vaccines.  Stop blaming everyone else. Stand by your responsibility.

From the outing of the outing, the European institutions were clear that whatever it took to deal with it had to be done, but being together. It was imperative to move away from health nationalisms if we wanted to win this battle for the virus in the shortest time possible. The Commission, with Parliament's support, was therefore right to lead the strategy to accelerate the research, manufacture and deployment of safe and effective vaccines, with the public and private sectors collaborating.  It also succeeded in the implementation of a centralized purchase, with equal and equitable access for all Europeans. And in European solidarity, participating in COVAX to support developing countries, to win this fight across the globe.  It is now up to us to get it right and meet the stated goal of 70% of Europeans being vaccinated and immunized by the end of summer. And so we have to get ahead of the future. To do this we need absolute transparency and compliance with contracts by the pharmaceutical industry. We must monitor the supply chain and ensure that the entire pharmaceutical industry in Europe with the capacity to produce vaccines and also its supplements reddoble production. We need to use vaccines more efficiently, and I'm talking about dosages. We also need to fund permanent funding for research against virus variants. And increase mass tests to stop these new outbreaks, also at our borders. To protect our freedoms we must improve and homogenise processes and that is why we must also require each Member State to require transparent national vaccination plans, infrastructures for mass vaccination, contingency plans and that they comply with the transmission of data to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.

We would have liked to have seen him on the pitch earlier, and one has to ask yourself – and I would like an answer to that – why it has not happened. On the whole, one has to ask: what could the Commission have done differently?

There's good news and bad news right now. The good news is that vaccines have actually been developed to combat corona, get us out of the shutdowns and into freedom. The bad news is that it is the European Union that is responsible for getting us the vaccines we so desperately need. While they are vaccinated in the UK, in the US and in Israel, Europe is at a terown. There is otherwise no limit to how much the EU system has mocked the British or shaken the heads of the Americans in recent years. But now the EU system is losing to the very same people in this house who have been completely counted under the floorboards. The Eu's role in this matter is straightforward. I think a lot of people in here will remember Comical Ali. The former Iraqi Information Minister, who during the Iraq War boasted to all the media how strong and how victorious the Iraqi army was, even if the reality was a total collapse. When it comes to vaccine strategy, I think the President of the Commission reminds me a little of Comical Ali. They have the self-praise in common, but unfortunately they also collapsed. Because in the European Union we are at a standstill. In the European Union, we have far too few vaccines and we have started too late. This means more sick and more dead and needlessly harsh and pro-economic restrictions and shutdowns across the continent. On the day we started vaccinations, we should even hear from the President of the Commission that vaccinations were the symbol of unity and a European success story.

The European Union has already approved for the use of three vaccines without gambling with the health of its citizens, respecting more rigorous safety standards than anywhere else in the world.

We would all like vaccinations to progress faster, but that is why we must look to the future. To this end, I particularly welcome the transparency mechanism presented by the Commission. We need to know if someone is trying to export vaccines outside Europe while delivery difficulties persist in the Member States. Furthermore, in the event of a need, an export ban cannot be excluded as a last resort if public health reasons so require, and world trade organisation rules allow it.

First of all, we need to assess the work of the Commission in implementing the COVID—19 vaccination plans together with other issues on the economic side and foreign policy. We must then assess the responsibility of the President of the European Commission when it comes to dealing with these issues. As of Monday morning, for example, 3.7 out of 100 people have been vaccinated in Germany, 3.6 out of 100 in Belgium and 3.1 out of 100 people in France. Let us now compare that to the country that left the EU, the UK, with a rate of 17.6 per 100 people. That is five times more than the EU average. In the US the figure is 11.7 and in Iceland 5.1 people per 100 inhabitants have been vaccinated. In Israel, which is number one in the world, 63 people per 100 people have been vaccinated. The EU has often wanted to see itself as a powerful federation compared to other world powers, however, given this incompetence and confusion, it is an overregulated organism imbued with bureaucracy that is absolutely unable to deal with crises. I’ve often heard how countries are unable to deal with crisis-resolution on their own, and that is why we must all rely on the EU. The fact that the European Commission has been given a mandate to pursue vaccines will cause even greater economic damage to the Member States. However, in order to solve the economic crisis, the European Commission’s ingenious solution is to taking a huge joint debt, the real reason for which is the desire to move toward taxes across the EU. In this case, the question arises as to whether the European Commission is enjoying the ongoing crisis, as it is an excuse to offer a solution to the Member States, which is the granting of even greater powers to the EU. Is it not just a deliberately infected panic where people are being frightened by a virus that is killing everyone, even though we know today that the number of deaths is marginal compared to the total number of people infected? It is no secret that the European Parliament and the Commission are largely socialist formations, embodying an ideology in which the central government must guarantee unnatural equality and where the nation states should have nothing to moan about. To top it all off, the European Commission is also unable to cope with foreign policy, as evidenced by the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy going to Moscow, making a fool of himself, and allowing the Russian foreign minister to mock him, after which the President of European Commission fails to make any comments. However, the Member States are being told that we are united!

That's why I still think that getting a vaccine together was a good idea. But it is clear that it could have been implemented even better.  Where's it stuck? If the problem is the human factor, it is simply solved. But if the problem arose because of the limitations of the structures of the European Union, then it requires systemic solutions.  It must be asked whether the Commission is sufficiently equipped with professional people and the power to lead procurement? Did the Council's decision-making system contribute to the delay? Should the EMA have approved vaccines faster? The last question has a clear answer - when you vaccinate half a billion people, with vaccines being developed in record time shortcuts and gambling are not an option. A serious defect of one of the approved vaccines would have catastrophic consequences, not only as far as the current situation is concerned, but on citizens' general trust in science, vaccination and democracy.

Last year, the euphoria was great at the end of the year. In record time, we have succeeded in producing not one but several vaccines. But as far as mass production is concerned, the reality has caught up with us in recent weeks, because vaccines are not as easy to produce and bottle as mineral water or beer.  The production and transport of millions of vaccines is a highly complex process, a highly complex undertaking and production capacities naturally depend on many different factors, including external ones. This has been mentioned.  I think the fight against COVID-19 is far from won and we must now focus on what is to be done next. I think it is right , Madam President, you pointed out – that we must fight the mutants, which is very, very central. And I think it is also very important that we develop a therapeutic strategy, that we consider how we can better support the disease progression, the severe disease progression of COVID-19 patients with medicines. I would ask the Commission to draw up a strategy here.

First of all, perhaps a bit of a retrospective at the beginning. Forward-looking policy is not necessarily a gift from our Member States. When, three years ago, in a very different discussion, I raised the issue of pandemics, cooperation between laboratories, specialisation in drug production, the production of new medicines, vaccines and antidotes, the Member States replied that this was out of the question, that this was a Member State competence. I believe that we must stop this egocentrism and not always start acting in the crisis and then start with the typical bashing game: the Member States are to blame, the Commission is to blame, and we also have a President and a Commissioner, whom we can then scold. We are not perfect. We are making mistakes in this crisis and we are learning from this crisis. But what we need to learn is to act more quickly geostrategically, to make the production and production of vaccines, but also of medicines again in our own countries, in the European Union itself, and to provide us with strategic supplies. We must also ensure that there is not only a fundamental mistrust of pharmaceutical companies. But they must also invest in the future again. There would be no vaccine today without the European Research Council, because it has accordingly supported the production or scientific activity in the field of mRNA vaccines, when the pharmaceutical giants did not want to do so. We should not insult each other in the crisis. And one final sentence, please, Madam President, that is particularly close to my heart: dear Stella Kyriakides, I very much regret the incitement campaign against you in my country.

We need to achieve resilience at European level. Returning to normal requires defeating Covid-19 also in our neighbours, whether in the UK, Ukraine or North Africa. Separately, no European Union country would have such a negotiating position, a price preference, and many countries would not have access to vaccines in such a short period of time.  The Union's pharmaceutical strategy is about regaining drug sovereignty. The response to this unprecedented Covid-19 crisis must therefore be to develop the Union's internal capacity, not to further deepen its dependence on others. Contracts must be kept. The European Union cannot therefore pay credibility for the mistakes of companies. The threats of hundreds of thousands more victims in Europe therefore justify, for example, an ultimatum to take over patent rights.

It is necessary to catch up so that we do not repeat the same mistakes. It is also necessary to ensure that vaccines are sufficient that 70% of our population will be vaccinated in the second half of 2021. No delay on the part of companies can be accepted anymore and it is necessary to move on to global alliances with partners and allies of the United States in order to ensure the materials and their inadequacy necessary to manufacture vaccines. We also need to have uniform rules for moving within and outside the European Union. The vaccination certificate proposed by the Prime Minister of Greece, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, remains on the table as a reliable tool, which will make it easier for citizens who have been vaccinated to travel without additional tests and tests but will not exclude anyone else who wants to travel safely. Finally, I would remind you that my country, Greece, is back in lockdown. No aid can replace economic activity.

While in Europe we are expected to have 70% of our population vaccinated this summer, the rest of the 145 COVAX participating countries could cover only 3.3% of their population, depending on the distribution we have received.

I want to start from where President von der Leyen left off.  We are doing our best to fight the virus. Across the Union and across the world it is now abundantly clear that we will only meet this challenge if we all stick together. We are all fighting to defeat a common enemy: COVID. The vaccines against this pandemic are the key to unlocking the door out of this crisis. We will continue to work day and night to ensure that these vaccines are brought to our citizens and by the end of the summer we want 70% of adult Europeans to be vaccinated. We want to ensure that this happens in a fair and equitable way, in a way which ensures that this strategic public good is distributed as quickly as possible to all — to all our Member States, fairly and equally, regardless of size, always with their full agreement and in full transparency.  A total of 26 million vaccine doses have been delivered in Europe since December, and more than 17 million people have been vaccinated in every corner of Europe. The pace of vaccinations can, and should, increase and we are doing our best to ensure that this happens in the coming weeks.  Let us recall the three fundamental points which are at the very basis of the debate today. Firstly, that it was right that we Europeans procured the vaccine together in solidarity. Secondly, that we have a moral duty to show the same solidarity to partners in our neighbourhood and across the world. And thirdly, that we are already drawing on the lessons of what we can improve — the regulatory environment, the industrial ecosystem, the operational environment and the predictability our Member States should have to roll out vaccinations. We have drawn these lessons and we are already acting on them.  Now let me turn to some of your questions. Firstly, on transparency. I have stated several times in this House that, with the EU vaccine strategy, we have always strived for as much transparency as possible every single step of the way. We owe it to our institutions and our citizens to be transparent and accountable in our decisions, and this is the only way we can build trust in this critical area.  In order to enhance our cooperation even further, and as mentioned by the President, we propose the creation of a contact group on vaccines. This will allow us to regularly exchange views on the most pressing issues and, most importantly, to work together on finding solutions.  I welcome the fact that following our request, three of our contracts, as you know, have been made publicly available. Tomorrow the Johnson &amp; Johnson contract will be available in a reading room. We will persist with other companies in order to obtain their agreement to make our contracts available to the Members of the Parliament and public at large as quickly as possible.  When it comes to vaccine production and deliveries, there are indeed many lessons to be learned from this process, and it’s perfectly natural for everyone to expect a rapid and seamless roll-out of vaccines. This is precisely why we had spread our investments across a broad portfolio of vaccine candidates and why we fixed the number of doses and delivery schedules in our agreements. I can assure you that we acted as fast as we could with, and on behalf of, all 27 Member States when it comes to securing doses and investing in production capacity with companies in looking at safety.  This was never about only prices or being difficult. It was about ensuring that our citizens would have access to the safest and most effective vaccines, that we would have strong provisions on liability, and that we had all the safety procedures in place. And all these are vital. We did expect that there would be hurdles along the way, including unexpected ones. We can for sure go back and find things that we could have done differently, even better, but now our focus is on ensuring that vaccines reach our citizens and the rest of the world as quickly as possible, working with companies to eliminate bottlenecks in production and also looking at adjusting and stepping up vaccine production for the new variants.  What we need now is an immediate response to the urgent threat of coronavirus variants and what we need going forward is the capacity at EU level to produce vaccines independently. As of next week, we will launch a biodefence preparedness programme, our first action under the new Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority (HERA). We will launch a public-private collaboration to develop and manufacture vaccines at scale to respond to the threat of new variants more forcefully. We know that preparedness is everything, but preparedness requires foresight, both in the current crisis and for any future ones.  Honourable Members, we fully share your sense of urgency. We’re on the same side and there are many pressing issues at play. You have raised many of them today and there will undoubtedly be more challenges ahead. The emergence of new variants only adds to this emergency and the sense of urgency. President von der Leyen said that this is a marathon, and it is. And we need to show the same level of determination, resilience and unity. This is why we need to cooperate closely with this House to find sustainable solutions to these crucial issues, because we are in this together.

He also reminded us that it was essential to take bold and courageous measures to meet common challenges. Solidarity, coordination, cooperation should continue to guide our response to Covid-19. That is what the citizens are asking of us and that is what we must commit ourselves to.  This Parliament has set a good example today with the adoption of the Recovery and Resilience Mechanism. It doesn't take much imagination to conceive of the chaos we could be in without a common strategy on vaccination. We would be competing with each other for scarce resources, without security and without equity. We would not have taken advantage of the scale of pan-European scientific power. Our voice and our ability to action would be much smaller.  Together we are stronger. And many members of this Parliament have said so here today, coming from various political families, showing well the need for interinstitutional solidarity to find the best solutions and, at the same time, to achieve what has been requested here: more transparency and monitoring in this process.  As much as there may be less positive points, we must all recognise that this European solidarity, with regard to the vaccination strategy, has been a determining factor in increasing the capacity of the member states' national health systems in responding to the pandemic.  We therefore support the Commission's efforts. We support your efforts, Madam President. Thank you for your continued determination. We will continue to support these efforts with a firm commitment that only then can we have more and better solutions in common. That's our duty. That's what the citizens ask of us. It is a question of working with ambition, realistically, effectively, to increase the production of vaccines, to better manage the issue of borders, to improve the level of research in the face of the different variants of the virus and, eventually, to bring new treatments as well.

What happened on the other side of the Atlantic must inform our debate in Europe, as our democratic societies are not immune to the harmful influence of hate speech, disinformation, fake news and incitement to violence.  These events have also shed light on the increased importance of online platforms and social media companies in shaping public debate. They have highlighted the growing interconnection that exists between digital transformation and democracy, which is one of the priorities of the Portuguese Presidency. It is unquestionable that social media companies have the status of public squares, which means they should have responsibilities when it comes to enhancing citizens’ participation and ensuring freedom of expression. Nevertheless, freedom of expression is not absolute. It should be balanced with the goal of combating illegal hate speech, incitement to violence and radicalisation, both online and offline. What is illegal? What is illegal offline must be illegal online. Online platforms have repeatedly been criticised for the lack of transparency in the use of algorithms, on content moderation and for targeting users on the basis of a vast amount of personal data generated from online activity. The digital space has also become a breeding ground for conspiracies and fake news. Disinformation spreads faster than any virus. Education, media and digital literacy are the best vaccines against that.  We expect online platforms to play their part in this common fight, but it is up to the democratic institutions – our laws, our courts – to set the rules of the game, to define what is illegal and what is not, what must be removed and what should not be. Without democratic scrutiny and a level playing field, there is a risk to users’ rights, information flows and public participation.  The protection of fundamental rights requires transparent and consistent rules for all of us, including social media outlets. The recently proposed European Democracy Action Plan, the Digital Services Act and the Digital Markets Act are important steps forward and will make the digital environment more transparent and actors like social media companies more accountable. The Council has already started the discussions on these important instruments. These initiatives must also be considered in conjunction with the upcoming Media and Audiovisual Action Plan, which will be the subject of the Council conclusions that we intend to adopt during our Presidency.  In addition, we are expecting, for the third quarter of the year, a Commission legislative proposal to ensure greater transparency in the area of sponsored content in a public context, complementing the Digital Services Act. The Council is ready to cooperate with this Parliament to ensure adoption sufficiently ahead of the 2024 European elections. Moreover, the Presidency will host the Digital Assembly in Lisbon in June, where the concepts of digital democracy and digital rights will be discussed.  The Presidency intends to consolidate the idea that Europe is a reference in the digital era and that our values and way of doing business are a competitive advantage. We want to place this idea at the heart of the European Digital Strategy for the next digital decade. The Presidency will also hold a high—level conference on the future of journalism and its interconnection with artificial intelligence, with a special focus on the robotisation of news production.  The current times have brought into sharp relief the unavoidable reality that what is happening online shapes our lives, beliefs and choices. It deeply influences what we buy or who we vote for, who we listen to, and even our opinion on vaccines. In its recent conclusions, the Council stressed the need to foster a well—functioning digital public sphere, greater accountability and improved transparency in addressing disinformation. Countering this scourge is crucial to preserve open political debate and the effective participation of citizens. We need to prevent social media functioning as an echo chamber which suppresses different points of view, and we need to make sure our citizens are equipped to manage the flood of information they are exposed to every day. In times such as this, believing in unreliable information may be lethal. We welcome, therefore, the work on the Rapid Alert System and other monitoring instruments. We encourage support for media and digital literacy, media pluralism, media independence and fact checking.  Let me reassure you that the Presidency is committed to working with the European Parliament, the Commission and the European External Action Service on these crucial issues in order to promote and protect our fundamental rights and our democracy.

I know we don’t have much time, so I will try to be brief rather than exhaustive in my introductory remarks. Social media has transformed the way we communicate with each other, debate on political issues or do campaigning. There are a lot of new opportunities, but also a lot of problems. With the recent attack on the Capitol, we’ve got a tangible yet tragic proof that many people have simply lost trust in democratic institutions. Going online only exacerbated many of the existing problems and cleavages in our societies. The US events are the moment of reckoning, also because they reminded us of the power Twitter, Facebook and other technological corporations possess. The fact that they can permanently remove an account of a sitting president based on vague criteria and unclear oversight is really worrying.  Even though, I believe President Trump’s irresponsible incitement to violence deserved action, it is high time to reign in the unchecked power of the digital corporations. Whatever we do, we must uphold the principle of freedom of speech. I do not want to create the ministry of or arbiter of truth. This is the main principle. So what can we do? First, we need tougher regulation, more enforceable obligations and to increase the responsibility of digital players. We have recently proposed the Digital Services Act, that will increase accountability of online platforms and clarify the rules for taking down illegal content, including hate speech and incitement to violence. This is a ground-breaking proposal, and will also give us the tools for stronger monitoring and enforcement of the obligations of online platforms. We need these rules urgently and we are ready to work together with you and the Member States to quickly adopt this law. What can we do already now, while waiting for the Digital Services Act to become law? We can equip ourselves already now with better tools to fight disinformation and harmful content. The European Democracy Action Plan is our map of what we should do next in this respect. We can already now strike a new pact against disinformation with better accountability of algorithms and no arbitrary decisions by big online platforms. We can and should have more transparency of their policies and access to relevant data. In the Digital Services Act we moved away from assessing harmful content and focused on the manipulative techniques of online distribution. We need to go more in detail on this – paid promotion and paid likes, reactions from fake accounts, bots can be particularly dangerous for democracy, notably during elections. This is why I will propose new regulation on online political advertising.  And freedom of speech is not the same as freedom of reach. Regulation alone will not, and in my view should not, address all the details of digital life. When I talked to Mark Zuckerberg and other CEOs of the Big Tech, we discussed solutions that go beyond regulation because we must not sacrifice freedom of expression, which requires open space, be it online or offline.  They cannot judge and evaluate every piece of content posted on them. This is why we need to reshape the thinking of tech companies and tech workers. Architects follow not only law but also ethical codes to ensure that the buildings they design are safe for people. Coders and IT experts should have a similar approach when designing their algorithms, something I rarely hear from the tech executives. And third, we cannot focus on social media platforms alone. We need to make our education fit for digital reality. We all have to become more digitally literate, understand the basics of what is happening online and why we are seeing certain content. This will allow us to navigate safely online.  As a person coming, as many of you do, from an ex—totalitarian country, in my case communist Czechoslovakia, I have tasted life without democracy and freedom of speech. I believe we need to bring order to the digital expression of democracy and to end the digital Wild West. What is illegal offline must be illegal online, but we also have to work on restoring trust among citizens. Facts belong to everyone. Opinions belong to an individual. And this distinction has been damaged and can only be repaired if there is trust in science, in authorities and society. We all have a very important role to play in this as well.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 133, "date": "2021-02-10.json", "name": "Magdalena ADAMOWICZ", "mepid": "197490", "text": "  On behalf of the PPE Group. – Madam President, i voted in favour of the report by Mrs Schwab Commissioner, i would like to thank you very much for Dear! The war for media freedom has been going on in Poland for several hours. The war over whether Polish citizens can know the truth or whether power is to decide what this truth is supposed to be. By lying that it is about more taxes, power is really about greater obedience to citizens. Because power, through the media, obeys the citizens it wants to cultivate. As in Hungary. As in Russia. What should we do when the authorities of a Member State of the European Union deprive their citizens of the right to reliable information? Again, Parliament is to say: does our Brussels agreement not have permission to do so? Again, he just has to talk? Snag your foot and scream? There is a limit to which helplessness becomes humiliation. The humiliation of those who, alone, defend freedom and democracy. As the Roman maxim says, \"Vim vi repellere licet\" – forcibly repel force. A force adequate to the threat. I therefore call on the entire European Union to act accordingly. That is why I call on all the free media in the world to show solidarity with the Polish free media. Because if it happened to us, it can meet you as well. Here I finish.

After the riots in Capitol Hill, the ultimate price of allowing disinformation and hatred to spread unchecked online is clear for all of us. Finding a balance between limiting harmful content while maintaining freedom of speech might be a challenging task, but it is doable and it must be addressed now.  I look forward to this debate, particularly as we now have a concrete opportunity to address these issues through new draft legislation, including the Digital Services Act, which will establish new rules, including on advertising, transparency, illegal content removal and data access. Continuing to improve the Commission’s code of conduct on disinformation is a necessary step.  But we also need to extend our offline safeguards to the online world by limiting the use of targeted advertising and the profiling of users. I welcome the Commission’s initiative on online political advertising.  We also need to explore ways to promote media literacy skills to increase users’ knowledge.

The idols of our children are born on social media, we can be bullied or abused on social media, elections are lost or won on social media. Looking at the years ahead and the decisions facing us, I want to make three points.  First, there is no online and offline world. There is only one world, one in which we must protect our citizens’ rights and our democracies in equal measure, both online and offline. The Digital Services Act (DSA) is a good step in this direction, and I commend the Commission for the level of ambition in the proposal.  Second, social media has become a political tool for some, a tactical battlefield for others. Politicians, informal communities, structured organisations, and even states themselves, all embrace social media as the weapon of choice. But social media platforms are private companies so they alone do not have the incentive, the means or the legitimacy to take on politicians or state actors. They require democratic oversight and assistance for that, just as we require from them cooperation and compliance. So we are not adversaries, us and the platforms. We need to find together a burden-sharing equilibrium that guarantees both the common good and technological progress.  My third point is that social media is global and geopolitical, so we need to use our entire diplomatic arsenal to protect our citizens’ rights and our way of life online. We need to work with the United States and other like-minded partners to define the rules of the future based on our shared values. And we need to use our dissuasion tools to address appropriately states such as Russia who use social media to sabotage our democracies and our common European project, or states such as China who work to build an alternative digital future without playing by the same rules or without relating to the same values.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 136, "date": "2021-02-10.json", "name": "Annalisa TARDINO", "mepid": "197806", "text": "  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, large platforms and social media undoubtedly offer great opportunities, useful to society, all the more so in today's situation in which physical distances have extended, but which must move within clear rules.

Why is the opposite happening? Why are we seeing disinformation and hate speech thriving, fuelling extremism and violence, as we have all seen on Capitol Hill? The answer is easy. Because this information is circulating on giant private platforms whose only goal is maximising profit. And we are the raw material. Companies like Google and Facebook track every single step we take online and offline, and put micro-profiles and models that allow them to predict our behaviour. Those predictions are then sold to advertisers. This is where the revenue of those companies comes from: from us, from our behaviour. And the same micro-profiles allow the companies to keep us very effectively on their platforms, appealing to strong feelings like fear and hate and anger, which trigger us to interact longer, to share more, to generate more revenue. Hence the hate, hence the disinformation. And now some people think that we can solve the problem these companies have created by asking them to arbitrarily censor this harmful content themselves.

Their monopoly, their algorithms, their conditions of use, the inability of public authorities to control moderation are problems that structure the democratic impasse in which we are.

They even see free media as their enemies and not as a fundamental aspect of a free society. One of the more effective tactics of spreading disinformation has proved a partisan usage of the newly formed media, which serve exclusively to promote party ideology. Unfortunately, such practices are used by a growing number of politicians who slurr and spread untruths about their political opponents, including in Slovenia, the Slovenian Prime Minister. Different views and beliefs are, of course, something completely normal. When constructive dialogue is replaced by lies and offensive or even hateful rhetoric, our democracy is truly in danger.

Dear colleagues, It is now commonplace for internet giants to delete opinions that they do not like ideologically at the touch of a button. Blocking an American president, regardless of his person or image, is completely unacceptable and violates democratic principles. Today, large social platforms are no longer simply social networks that make it easier to connect with your friends, but also online platforms that affect all aspects of life: business, public services, art, culture, public discourse and thus politics. Developments in recent months have clearly shown that the leaders of the tech giants have become political actors restricting freedom of expression, where appropriate.  In the absence of rules, they abuse their position: they delete, moderate, censor as they please. Much of the political expression is now on the web, so it is necessary to ensure that freedom of expression is always on the Internet. Tech giants can't be arbiers of publicity.

Social media today is far more than just virtual yearbooks or isolated chat services. Their distribution and use has turned them into public spaces. Posts on social media turn into news on TV, newspapers and radio, and the news media share their stories on social platforms, where young people in particular get the majority of their news. Here, citizens influence politicians, and politicians. There is no doubt that social media plays a major role in the democratic conversation, and that is why we must insist on democratic rules of the game.  Regulating virtual public space is a complicated task. I believe that we must have three principles for further work, legality, transparency and redress. What is legally offline must also be legal online. That must be our first principle. It must not be the taste of social media that restricts freedom of expression. Secondly, there must be transparency in the decisions of the platforms. As a legislator, we need to be able to gain insight into the algorithms that promote or inhibit posts and the decisions that underlie removing posts. Finally, there must be remedies so that social media users can have their case tried if their content is removed.

Unfortunately, the dangers of social media (not to mention criminal activity) are just as great, and the damage to democracy is catastrophic. Indeed, social media is also a forum for hatred of all kinds, for total misinformation and for conspiracy theories, and all this most often with complete impunity. The need to legislate is necessary. However, our governments are too slow. One can criticize the closure of Donald Trump's Twitter account by the platform, but was the solution to leave it open?

Tackling disinformation in the age of social media and online platforms must be a coordinated effort involving all relevant actors from institutions to social platforms, from news media to individual users. The figures in the European Commission's latest reports on the removed content of digital platforms say the following: as of January 2020, Google has removed or blocked more than 90 million coronavirus-related ads in the EU for violating advertising policies, including disinformation about medicines. In Croatia, 12,390 Google ads were blocked, 10 million in Germany, 9 million in Austria. During November, Facebook and Instagram platforms in the EU: 35,000 posts removed due to disinformation that can lead to imminent physical harm, content relating to fraudulent preventive measures or medicines.  There is a fine line between the freedom of speech that we stand for and that we support and the dissemination of harmful content that can have far-reaching implications for our health, security, stability of our societies, but also on disrupting democratic processes. We have made a big step forward by adopting a package on digital services.

Like it or not, platforms are recognizing their responsibility for content, even when they are wrong and when they are exceeded, and this is a good starting point for regulation, including repair routes. We need to provide platforms with legal tools so that they can carry out what we ask them to do: collaboration and compliance with obligations to detect, notify and eliminate illegal content, from terrorism and sexual abuse of minors to misinformation and hate speech. But freedom of expression has to be respected and defended as a whole, and I think it is appropriate to remember it so that the claim of freedom of expression is not hijacked by the extremisms that are also present in this House, because these extremisms, while demanding respect for them, harass uncomfortable journalists, point them out, impede their access to press conferences , organize discredit campaigns against the media or directly promote boycotts to damage their dissemination.

For me it is extremely important to hear the opinions of this House because this is the first broad debate about if, and how, to regulate the Internet if I may simplify that. And I take several main messages.  First, what I heard from the vast majority of you is: it’s time to get to work. If we are not ambitious to become the rule-makers we will continue to be the rule-takers, the rules which have been created in Silicon Valley and which are imposed on our territory in the EU. So it’s time to get to work with a sense of urgency and I very much count on the European Parliament and your approach to adopt the legislation which the Commission proposed soon enough. Also because we see a lot of impatience on the side of some Member States who want to go their own way. They want to have their own rules for the Internet and I think that it was quite clear also from this debate that we want to have a pan-European smart solution without any fragmentation by Member States.  The second main message which I got is that we are searching and working on the ideologically-neutral solution that the rules we are going to adopt should not be left or right, and that we will seek the solution which will protect the freedom of speech as the primary principle. So these are the main messages I took from this very important debate.  Coming back to the rule-makers, what we are doing is the continuation of the effort of the EU to be the rule-maker with global effect. We already managed to do that with the GDPR where we said that individual people must have the right to have their identity, their privacy, under control. And now we are coming with a set of, I hope, consistent rules which are also consistent with the GDPR and its philosophy. We are coming with the Digital Services Act, the Digital Markets Act, the European Democracy Action Plan, and by all that we want to prove that the EU has a very healthy instinct when it comes to the risks which we see on the Internet and which can cause big harm to our societies.  What I heard from many of you was that the digital big tech grabbed too much power and too little responsibility. I would add I agree with that. The platforms captured a lot of public space. I sometimes say that they privatised the public space, and this is a public space without any public scrutiny whatsoever. So this is also our task: to demand more transparency and more accountability, because what’s happening online is heavily influencing real life.  I think it was Mr Tudorache who said that there is no difference between online and offline, that it’s one world. I tend to agree with that. On the other hand, it’s quite easy to blame the Internet and platforms for all our troubles. I think that we should really take a lesson from what happened in the US at the beginning of January. The platforms for the transmitters of the messages of the former President Trump who was inciting violence, whipping up the crowd who then invaded the Capitol, and there were victims, there were dead people. So I think this is also a very strong goal on all of us who have influence on public opinion and on the reaction of our society to be more responsible and to be aware that social media can be a weapon, a dangerous weapon in our hands.  I am not calling for self-censoring for politicians. I am calling for more responsibility and awareness of the consequences when we use these social platforms and social media. I would like to recommend that you read Madeleine Albright’s book Fascism: A Warning. She speaks about social media as a weapon when it is used by bad people, when it appears in bad hands.  Let me react to several comments regarding disinformation in the time of COVID. I’m sure you know that the Commission has an agreement with big tech to do more against disinformation. So it’s not true that they have just started now, and I appreciate the recent announcement of Facebook that they want to do more against disinformation relating to vaccination. The agreement is simple. I wanted them to enable more space for information from authorities, from health authorities, from those who are responsible for communication and for providing the people with trustworthy and evidence-based information. For the health sector I think that is a very clear message: if you do not occupy the space it will be occupied by disinformation. The Ministers of Health are aware of that and they do their best. I have to praise them for everything they are doing in this very difficult moment and crisis, and they are doing their best to occupy the space with reliable information. The thing is that the people have to trust the information provided by the health authorities.  The fight against disinformation also contains what we offer or what we propose. It contains fact-checking. Honourable Members, let me do this now. I have to react to Mr Haider who said that the EU has not invested anything into the development and production of vaccination. This is fake news, and I think that if something like that is said, it’s also our obligation to come with the facts and deny that. I also want to react because we speak here about the freedom of speech. I want to react to those who were mentioning the situation in Poland. I think we all have seen the black screens. The black screens are quite telling. I think they are screaming. Today it’s a question of protest of the media in Poland, expressed in a black screen. Tomorrow black screens might become a sad everyday reality. We also need to protect the freedom of speech by supporting independent media, not by suppressing them with additional financial burdens.  This doesn’t apply only to Poland. We have recommended many times to the Member States that they should support also financially media who are also the frontrunners in the COVID crisis, media which were already before the COVID crisis under big financial distress because the business model has changed brutally. The money from advertisers is being shifted to the online sphere which we keep speaking about today, and so we need to guarantee that the media can do their job because they have a very important role in our democratic societies.  So coming back to the law which we are now analysing. I have to say that we always advise the Member States to support media, as I said, but coming to the law, we are aware of the draft law and we need to look into it in more detail. We expect Member States to ensure that their fiscal or other policies will not affect the commitment to ensuring a free independent and diverse media ecosystem. I have to add that about the legislative process, which is ongoing in Poland, that it is important to consult such legislation also with the media sector, and I understand from the recent information from Poland that this is foreseen.  I am sorry, I probably was longer than I wanted to be, but I really wanted to react to many of your very important opinions, which I had to take.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 3, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 205, "date": "2021-02-10.json", "name": "Nicola BEER", "mepid": "197437", "text": "  It’s an important topic so we are very happy that you really discussed it with us.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 206, "date": "2021-02-10.json", "name": "Ana Paula Zacarias", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Parliament for this valuable contribution to this debate and also to thank the Commissioner for her answers and, at the same time, to ensure that the Council remains committed to continuous work to protect and promote the fundamental rights of our citizens.

The variety of information and the plurality of voices are an integral part of our democratic systems, but let us not forget that safeguarding them also means ensuring protection against violence and hatred, the protection of minors, consumer protection.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the commissioner for her excellent work and for the work she has done. Unfortunately, we have not yet made the progress we would have liked in the fight against coronavirus. This means that we will have to live with the economic upheavals for a while yet. This, in turn, means that many companies will still be in a difficult, very difficult situation for a while to come and will have to make massive use of their capital reserves. As legislators – and this is one of our highest duties here – we must set the course for this to be possible. Public support measures are one side. For capital market-financed companies in particular, however, we must also ensure the best possible financing conditions on the markets. With the targeted changes to MiFID, we are doing just that by making it a little easier for professional market participants to operate in the markets. At the same time, we have made it easier to provide stock analysis for small listed companies, making them more attractive to investors. Finally, we have also drawn some conclusions from the crisis for private investors, so that the investment advice process works even if the client cannot physically sit or stand with his advisor. These are certainly only small adjusting screws, but they are many small adjusting screws, but they can make a big difference in sum and will thus also support the economic recovery. And let me be very clear: anyone who wants to support the economic recovery cannot vote against the Capital Markets Recovery Package, and it cannot vote against the adjustments in MiFID. That is why I have always been very clear: I do not understand why our dear colleagues in the Social Democrats have already made it clear that they want to vote against it today. In the negotiations, I have tried to significantly improve the financing of small and medium-sized enterprises. This is now being criticised for not being done. Who was against it? It was the Social Democrats, the Greens, the Communists against. If you had been involved! Don't make press releases, but join in! Then it would have been better. The same applies to the question of advice: we do not give up anything for the private investor at all! But no one can explain to me why a professional investor, a pension fund or a bank needs exactly the same documents as a private investor! The fact that we are reducing costs here helps everyone in the end. What can we have against it? And then – we have just had a nice debate on the subject of fake news – fake news is really being spread. And this is the issue of commodity derivatives. No one in this House wants food to be speculated on. But what we desperately need is that the underdeveloped markets in the electricity sector – derivatives on electricity supplies, price hedging on electricity supplies – can finally develop. Our system does not fit in there, and only at this point do we change, and that is clearly regulated. And that is why I really ask you to read what we have said! But what irritates me most is that I have to read here in a press release from the Socialists and Democrats that this would be a conservative MiFID story. Compare what the Commission has proposed with what the Council and Parliament have now adopted together. It is the Commission proposal on which we have essentially agreed, which we have adapted and changed together with the Commission in a few small places. That is not my private matter! What are you actually writing here? That is why I really ask you to reconsider your position. We made a further interruption in the trialogue negotiations because there were wishes of the Social Democrats. In the end, you agreed. And now you say no. Ladies and gentlemen, this is about taking responsibility – taking responsibility for our ability to make a contribution to the financing of small, targeted, tailor-made adjustments to the capital markets, too. I say it again: you were against it. It is a question of ensuring that we reduce bureaucratic costs. They were against it. It is about developing the underdeveloped power plants in such a way that a green deal can even work, so that a cooperative that operates a wind farm or a solar plant can use capital market hedging with the big corporations at all. They were against it. That is why I am disappointed. I hope that there will nevertheless be a majority in this House in order to be able to make these tailor-made, targeted, really good changes, so that the capital markets can contribute to companies making a contribution to ensuring that the economic recovery can take place as quickly as possible. We, as the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, are of course in favour of this – everyone else is invited to follow this good successful path.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 212, "date": "2021-02-10.json", "name": "Ondřej KOVAŘÍK", "mepid": "118949", "text": "   rapporteur. – Madam President, the focus of this plenary session has been on boosting the public finances for economic recovery. We adopted the Recovery and Resilience Facility, and rightly so, but at the same time, we must not neglect the mobilisation of private capital.  The pandemic is extremely challenging both for investors and companies. They need financial injections through investments, they need access to finance but, above all, they need simple and straightforward procedures with minimal red tape, without, of course, compromising investors’ protection. The Capital Markets Recovery Package is integral to the economic recovery of the EU following the COVID-19 pandemic. By introducing targeted changes to some capital market rules, it encourages greater investments in the economy and helps ensure quick re-capitalisation of companies. It will also increase the capacity of banks to finance that recovery.  The two pieces of this package we are voting on this week will ensure that Europe is in the best place possible to help our markets, financial institutions and businesses recover from this crisis, and here I would like to join the call of the previous rapporteur and invite all of you to support this package. I am proud of the outcome of our negotiations on the Prospectus Regulation, and here I would like to thank both the Council and the Commission for their cooperation for a very quick and productive negotiation process. The prospectus might be a little bit cryptic thing for non-economists but in short it’s a document providing all necessary information about a company you are about to invest in. Removing temporarily extra costs and administration for companies allows them to access the finance that they need more quickly. And the Recovery Prospectus does just that. The adjustments that we have made will help companies to raise capital through shares instead of going deeper into debt. They will facilitate fundraising by banks, which will have a vital role to play in the recovery of the real economy. Specifically, we have introduced a new, lightweight, Recovery Prospectus. This will be a temporary prospectus that can be used by those companies who have already listed on the markets. The Recovery Prospectus will be available for secondary issuances, to issuers of shares, until the end of 2022, and will be limited to 30 pages in length, compared to the current market average of 400 pages. As you can imagine, this will significantly cut costs by hundreds of thousands of euros for those wishing to raise capital, and this is around half of the current cost of producing a secondary issuance prospectus. While the businesses will have fewer costs and less red tape to deal with, we have ensured that investor protection has remained at the forefront of the negotiations. For example, issuers will have to disclose what their level of capital is compared to their indebtedness, as well as a working capital statement. They will also have to publicly outline what will be done with the money invested in their company.  If investors are to invest in a company in these turbulent times, it is only right that they also know how much the current situation with the pandemic has affected the company they are considering investing in. Therefore, in the Recovery Prospectus, issuers will have to lay out clearly how COVID-19 has affected their businesses.  Overall, I am convinced that we have struck the right balance between a streamlined prospectus and ensuring investor protection, while transparency is maintained at the highest level.  Commissioner, colleagues, businesses in Europe have suffered enormously due to the current situation. Significant uncertainty remains, not least for the service sector. The temporary changes we introduced in the Prospectus Regulation will provide financial security to businesses across Europe. The Capital Markets Recovery Package will give breathing space to the financial sector. This will also allow financial institutions to provide for businesses to keep them afloat. Let’s continue to reflect on the simplification of legislation also for the future in the post-pandemic context. A good balance between regulation, safeguards and the freedom to innovate should guide us in our review of capital markets legislation.  I am sure you will agree that we must do all we can to help businesses, especially SMEs, to weather the storm and come through the pandemic with the ability to grow again. They could then become powerhouses that will support Europe as we embark on the digital and green transitions.  The Recovery Package as a whole is only a short-term solution. During the next few years, we must work to ensure a resilient and future-proof framework for our financial markets. In Europe, there is a lot of potential for the Capital Markets Union. We only need willingness to break down the barriers that have hindered cross-border access to finance until now.

I want to begin by thanking our rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs for their efforts, and to look first at the prospective regulation. It’s been said already by the previous two speakers that the COVID-19 pandemic has hit EU firms harder, and over a longer time period, than we had initially anticipated, especially small and medium—sized companies. Many of our companies find themselves in a very difficult situation and really do need new investment to keep afloat. The proposed EU Recovery Prospectus is one way to enable EU companies to raise new equity capital on public markets quickly and without excessive bureaucracy. This short prospectus will be easy to produce for companies, easy to understand for investors and easy to scrutinise for national regulators. That means that it will help companies to raise capital more easily, helping them to stay solvent, recapitalise their business and strengthen their resilience in the recovery. Thanks to your efforts, we’ve achieved a format for the new Recovery Prospectus that eases the administrative burden on companies while giving investors enough information to allow them to make an informed decision. Now turning to the reform of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (MiFID II). Let me explain why this reform is just as important in my view.  The new rules on small cap research will enhance the visibility of small and medium—sized companies for investors, so it will help these companies to raise capital on public markets. On the derivatives reform, the amendments are essentially about green energy, and how to make it easier to finance a new generation of renewable energy projects. Providers of renewable energy rely on a secure income stream and this is what the derivatives markets for energy achieve. To be effective, derivatives markets need to be liquid. If we maintain the current low position limit at 25% per market participant, the nascent energy exchanges will never take off. In smaller Member States, exchanges have only two or three active market participants.  There is also a clear link between these amendments on the derivatives market and the pandemic. During this COVID-19 crisis, energy prices have been volatile because of a more erratic pattern of energy demand. It is essential to protect income for renewable energy suppliers, particularly when demand is so volatile. As highlighted in a recent communication on fostering the openness, strength and resilience of the EU’s economic and financial system, we need to support the development of euro—denominated derivative markets, so that the EU will be globally competitive. Finally, during the COVID-19 crisis, more people are using online financial services; fewer are visiting local bank branches. This switch from paper—based information to electronic format will benefit retail clients, who will receive the relevant information faster. This will also enable investment firms to use their resources more efficiently, and this will also align our financial legislation with the objectives of the Green Deal and Digital Agenda.  Other changes will only apply to business—to—business relationships and will not have any impact on retail investors. While I believe that the MiFID II amendment represents a real improvement, I want to acknowledge this evening the concerns expressed by some of you on these amendments. Some of you have mentioned that there was not a proper impact assessment accompanying this proposal. Last year, when the crisis hit, we wanted to respond in a timely way, but we did so with a very solid look at the pros and cons of the proposed way forward. The main costs and benefits resulting from the amendments, including on the derivatives markets, are analysed in a separate staff working document. Some of you also suggested that the reform would undermine the rules protecting investors, and that more clarity was needed on product governance rules and the real costs linked to investment products.  One objective of the Capital Markets Union Action Plan is to make the EU an even safer place for individuals to save and invest for the long-term and their retirement. In this context, we are working on a retail investment strategy.  We will set out a coherent and consistent approach to all investor protection issues related to MiFID II and other horizontal legislation, and I look forward to working closely with all of you on these issues. To conclude, I would like to stress that the Capital Markets Recovery Package includes targeted measures to speed up the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and help the financial ecosystem to recover as soon as possible. We have done this in a timely and efficient manner given the significance of the crisis. Voting in favour of the Recovery Prospectus and the modifications to the MiFID II rules will give a positive signal that the EU institutions can act quickly and decisively in times of need.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 2, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 215, "date": "2021-02-10.json", "name": "Isabel BENJUMEA BENJUMEA", "mepid": "197679", "text": "  PPE Group. – Madam President, Commissioner, rapporteurs, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to share with you two facts which I think can make us reflect. It is two facts that show a terrible weakness in the fabric of European SMEs, which highlight the great dependence of European SMEs on bank debt, rather than having the luck and opportunity to have greater investors to bet on their equity and free them from that very heavy burden of bank debt. In the European Union, in the first half of 2020, bank loans to SMEs totalled EUR 573 billion compared to venture capital investment, whether venture capital, private equity, business angel crowd,funding, which reached only EUR 14.1 billion. I would like to ask all those who are thinking of voting against these two amendments to the pamphlet and MiFID II whom they believe they are protecting or who they want to benefit. I have been an entrepreneur for eight years of my life and assured them that the greatest luck an entrepreneur can have is a shareholder, an investor, someone who bets on the project one is working for every day.

Firstly, the exact link between the proposed changes and the COVID pandemic is rather weak and we risk watering down the legislative framework without a proper political and technical evaluation. Clearly, we cannot use this health crisis to set a deregulating agenda of the financial sector.  Secondly, we struggle to believe that issuers’ ability to raise capital is massively improved by stopping to disclose losses to professional investors, by suspending best execution reports, or by deleting quantitative elements from the ancillary tests. Thirdly, by reducing clarity on product governance rules and the real costs linked to investment products, this quick-fix completely fails to protect investors against all sorts of misselling. Such a step is never justified, and even less so in times of crisis. The S&amp;D Group wants to support SMEs by facilitating the raising of capital and at the same time safeguarding the transparency framework for retail and institutional investors. Please listen to consumer organisations, think-tanks and ESMA, for example, before making your decisions. The best way to do this reform is through the overall review of MiFID/MiFIR later this year.  To my appreciated and experienced EPP colleague, I would like to say I would like to take seriously your words that the EPP is not promoting a deregulation agenda.

Without abandoning them, we ought, however, to be able to adjust flexibly to crisis situations like the one we now face with COVID-19. There is an urgent need to mobilise private capital, not least at SME level, in order to counter the hits that have crippled too many companies. Quick temporary fixes that lighten regulatory burdens on how companies finance their operations without undermining investor protection make sense. The setting-up of an EU Recovery Prospectus until December 2022, in the framework of the capital markets’ recovery package, is one such quick fix.  It should incentivise issuers and investors and help to inject new liquidity in businesses, for drawing up an investment prospectus can be expensive, which might deter issuers from seeking to raise new funds. By lowering this expense, the EU Recovery Prospectus makes new investment less onerous. Provided issuers of shares already are admitted to trading on a regulated market, or investing in a growth with market continuously for at least the last 18 months, the condensed disclosure requirements in the prospectus should now reduce launch costs and make the document easier to read. Correspondingly, limited to the recovery phase, an offer of such securities is, under certain conditions, not subject to the obligation of publishing a prospectus. The threshold has been doubled to  EUR 150 million to allow more offers to be exempted.  The EU Recovery Prospectus will carry minimum essential information for secondary issuance of shares.

It must explicitly inform potential investors of how the businesses concerned by the issuance have been affected by COVID-19.

Curious, or perhaps not, is the fact that stock markets have a higher turnover and transactions, also increased volatility during the pandemic, which is why, at the very least, the need for capital markets to recover will be questionable.

This is supported by the capital market recovery package we are discussing. I hope the left side of the room understands that. We can't stick to the rigid rules we've had so far. We need to reduce the administrative burden and make it easier for capital market investments to work. We need to pay particular attention to retail customers who have less knowledge and therefore need more protection and information when investing.  The Capital Markets Union would allow businesses to obtain fresh resources in a cross-border manner and could therefore play a central role in economic recovery. All the more so as it is increasingly difficult to ensure the competitiveness of European capital markets compared to much larger and more efficient US or fast-growing Capital Markets in China.

It’s been a robust debate, which I think is really important. What I see and what you have spoken of today is a pandemic, a health crisis, a very difficult economic situation and businesses that are struggling to survive. And let me be very clear. The people who will benefit from the Capital Markets Recovery Package are small companies, renewable energy producers and retail investors.  Mr Ferber and colleagues are debating – it’s excellent to hear it from this podium! But let me continue.  Our proposals to amend MiFID and PROSPECTUS will make it easier for capital markets to support European businesses so that they can recover from the crisis by raising essential equity capital. They will also facilitate the involvement of investors in the capital markets, while preserving our high levels of investor protection. As I’ve already said, this package will also be a positive signal to the financial markets in general and companies in particular. This package shows that the EU can adapt quickly to changing circumstances to support the real economy. The proposed measures are important and I hope they will be adopted and take effect as soon as possible.  But these amendments are not the end of the road. In particular, I’m ready, with my services, to engage with all of you on our Retail Investment Strategy, where we will take a holistic view of concerns on investor protection raised by the application of MiFID and other sectoral legislation. We will also closely cooperate with Parliament on a broader review of MiFIR to enhance market transparency.  I’d like to refer to some of the comments that were made. As I said, I enjoy a robust debate. This is a vital issue. We know that our capital markets are not fully developed in Europe, we know that banks cannot be the only source of funding for our SMEs and our businesses, and therefore we need to work together to strengthen our capital markets.  And yes, you are right to refer to crises of the past. I recall 2008, and many of us know what happened to families and businesses because of that, but in fact in today’s crisis, because we regulated the banks effectively, we now see that the banks and the capital markets can be part of the solution, continuing to lend to businesses. I therefore think that anyone who might suggest that this Commission, or me as Commissioner for Financial Stability, is on a mission to deregulate, please note that this is not the case. If anything, my experience of the past and my work in this Parliament previously make me more determined to have effective legislation and regulation which protects investors and provides us with a strong capital market. So can I say very clearly there will be no deregulation on my watch.  I know that I won’t persuade many of you to vote in favour of this, but I hope that you understand the sincerity of my contribution to this debate. You know we will come forward very soon and look again at MiFID, so there will be an opportunity for us to work together. As we look forward, I hope we can bring our sides together because we need a better coordinated approach on these issues through the recovery, because if we don’t have that, our companies will struggle. We will not be able to recreate employment in sectors where it is absolutely essential.  So, despite the diverse views and the deep divisions, I take from all of you a desire to work better together, to strengthen our resolve around capital markets, and to protect our SMEs and our workers, and I stand ready to do the same with you and cooperate fully.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 234, "date": "2021-02-10.json", "name": "Fabio Massimo CASTALDO", "mepid": "124812", "text": "   The joint debate is closed.

The 25th anniversary of the Beijing Platform for Action was an opportunity to take stock of the progress achieved, to reconfirm the commitments undertaken, and to identify new challenges, reminding us that all Member States have a clear obligation to eliminate discrimination against women, and ensure that they fully enjoy all human rights. Much progress has been made over the past few decades to the benefit of women and girls in the European Union and across the world. However, many challenges remain, and we must step up and step up gender equality policies. Unfortunately, the pandemic has aggravated some of these challenges. We need therefore to make an assessment of the impact of COVID-19 on gender equality – in particular on labour market participation, incomes, and reconciliation of work, personal and family life. The Council has recently also focused on the issue of care work. During the current pandemic, more than ever, it is time we recognise and value the importance of unpaid care work, giving credit to those who perform it and keep our societies running. Other challenges that need to be addressed comprise gender discrimination, especially against more vulnerable groups of women, threats against sexual and reproductive health and rights, violence against women, and issues arising from digitalisation, including cyber—violence. Equally important is to tackle the practices, prejudices and customs within society, including those carried out by private persons and organisations that hinder the fulfilment of women’s human rights. The most notable ongoing policy development in the Union regarding women’s rights, and in particular violence against women, is in relation to the Istanbul Convention. Although the proceedings on the EU ratification of the Convention are temporarily suspended, pending the European Court of Justice opinion, calls have been made at Council level for ratification by Member States that have not yet done so. Such ratification will precede adoption by the EU. In this regard, the Portuguese Presidency will host in April a conference in Lisbon to mark the 10th anniversary of the Convention.  Coming back to women and the labour market, the Presidency will also work to unblock the Directive on gender balance on company boards, and stands ready to start negotiations on binding pay transparency measures, on the basis of the forthcoming Commission proposal. We also need to keep abreast of technological developments, and make sure that women and girls can seize the opportunities offered by digitalisation.  Finally, we must ensure gender equality mainstreaming across the implementation of the European Pillar of Social Rights. With that in mind, the upcoming informal Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council (EPSCO) meeting will address the issue of gender equality in social Europe. Mr President, honourable Members, Commissioner, gender equality is also at the heart of our international engagement. The Council is finalising an ambitious EU position paper in preparation for the 26th session of the UN Commission on the Status of Women.  This will take place in New York next March. The priority theme for this year is women’s full and effective participation and decision—making in public life, as well as the elimination of violence for achieving gender equality and the empowering of women and girls. This topic is very timely in the COVID context, not least against the backdrop of the shadow pandemic of violence against women during lockdowns, but also with a view to ensuring that women are in the forefront of developing solutions during the pandemic and their recovery phase. The rights of women and girls, as well as gender equality needs to be addressed in a cross—cutting manner in all the EU external action, on the basis of the EU consensus on development, and the rights—based approach to development. We must recognise that, in many parts of the world, girls and women continue to be systematically left behind and discriminated against. In this context, the Portuguese Presidency welcomes the Third Gender Action Plan presented by the Commission and the High Representative at the end of last year. We look forward to working with the Member States, the Commission, and the European External Action Service (EEAS) as well as with the European Parliament to implement and advance this ambitious and utterly necessary agenda. The same is true for CSDP missions and operations, where women are still under—represented at most levels. We hope that the EEAS will develop a dedicated strategy and action plan to provide the systemic mainstreaming of human rights and gender aspects, promoting a better representation of women in CSDP missions. In conclusion, much has been done and much more remains to be done. In numbers and relevant sectors, we need to look ahead, and we need to use the relevant elements of the Beijing Platform for Action.

This anniversary provides us with an excellent opportunity to discuss the situation of gender equality and empowerment of women and girls in this particular time. It is important to reflect on where we are and where we are heading to. The Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action was adopted 25 years ago. It is the most inspiring global blueprint of gender equality and it still guides us today. The Beijing Conference was a fundamental step in the global commitment that we have jointly embraced since. Progress has been made in these years but girls and women still face many hurdles and challenges that remain unaddressed. Across the world, including in some of our own Member States, we see a serious threat for, and backlash on, women’s rights. This backlash manifests itself in various forms and settings, like for instance in the opposition we have seen in the EU to adhere to legal frameworks to combat violence against women. This opposition is sometimes based on the mere fact that the word ‘gender’ is used.  This directly endangers the monitoring of the EU’s commitments under the Beijing Platform for Action, as well as the work the EU does in terms of gender equality. It leads to a situation where no consensus can be found among Member States on Council conclusions that aim to report on the EU’s progress on the Beijing Platform for Action. We should all mobilise our forces to counter this very worrying trend and not let this impede our international commitments under the Beijing Platform for Action. Every year during the meeting of the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) at the UN General Assembly, we reaffirm the commitments agreed in the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action and the engagement to embrace the new challenges ahead. The United Nations Secretary-General called for a pushback against the pushback. Power remains a crucial element empowering women and girls, calls for equal rights for girls and women as boys and men. We need to make these equal rights a reality for all. This year’s CSW session deals with full and effective participation of women in public and political life. It highlights the importance of women and girls as agents of change and as decision-makers and leaders on all issues and at all levels. This is crucial for adequately translating their needs and skills into policies to achieve gender equality and a more peaceful, secure, just and sustainable world.  To reach this we need to help all enablers that allow for women’s and girls’ meaningful participation in public and political life. We also need to eradicate gender-based violence, including online violence, that risks to silence women, and we started our work on EU-wide legislation addressing this. In fact, last Monday we launched a public consultation on this topic. This is a key priority for us, including as part of the Generation Equality Forum, where the EU is a co-leader on gender-based violence.  In order to tackle gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls, the Commission adopted two key policy strategies: the Gender Equality Strategy 2020-2025 for our internal action and the EU Gender Action Plan III for our external action. The crisis we are experiencing has amplified their relevance and urgency to advance and push further the Beijing commitments and make a real change in the life of women and girls. The widening of socio-economic inequalities for women in particular, the spike in domestic violence and the digital gender gap are all at the centre of our areas of engagement, both internally and externally.  The EU is committed to lead by example. This is firmly positioned at the core of the EU policy on gender equality and women’s empowerment. We do this by establishing the requirement of a gender-responsive leadership for all EU leaders and managers in the Gender Action Plan III.  Gender mainstreaming is one of the core principles of both the Gender Equality Strategy and the Gender Action Plan III that we presented last year. This is a crucial principle to advance on gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls. It is central to the philosophy of the 12 Beijing critical areas of concern. It underlines the importance of mainstreaming agenda perspective throughout all the Sustainable Development Goals of Agenda 2030 and its key principle not to leave anyone behind. It is also a crucial principle in the implementation of the Women Peace and Security Agenda, aiming for gender equality, peace and security.  We need to advance not in words but in deeds, including through our financial commitments. The EU long-term budget 2021-2027, together with Next Generation EU, with a stimulus package of EUR 1.8 trillion, will ensure financing for the promotion of gender equality.

To date, none of the Countries of the European Union has achieved the objectives set out in the Beijing Declaration. Although all Member States have ratified the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (which, by the way, it came into force more than forty years ago), persisting and even greater inequalities are unfortunately a painful reality. Colleagues, gender inequality is a multifaceted phenomenon. It not only covers all aspects of the labour market, starting with lower women's wages for the same work and precarious work, which in itself leads to a large pension gap between women and men, which increases the risk of poverty and exclusion, especially for older women and single mothers. Gender inequality is not just an economic phenomenon, it is both violence against women and sexual exploitation of women and girls. And this year we will commemorate the tenth anniversary of the Istanbul Convention. However, it is a shame, we must admit that, to this day, some Member States have not yet ratified the Istanbul Convention. I therefore really want to call on the Member States, both the Council and the Commission, to take all measures necessary to ratify the Istanbul Convention so that we can send a clear message that protection against violence is a priority for the European Union. The COVID-19 pandemic has shown very clearly what gender inequality really means. Covid's socio-economic impact is a disproportionate burden for women, as this pandemic has had the greatest impact on women-dominated sectors and occupations such as health, social services, education, retail workers, cashiers, cleaners, women with independent small businesses. And there is a very serious risk that this pandemic will only exacerbate the already wide-off inequalities and change the trend of progress.

Twenty-five years later, let us look at how it works and how it has affected the situation of women in the European Union. More than half a million women in the Union have experienced genital mutilation. We also still have a problem with a large pay gap when it comes to women's pay. Fortunately, in Poland, which is so often mentioned here, this gap is one of the smallest. Yes, the wage gap in Poland is one of the smallest in the European Union.  That's when it comes to women's rights. In the European Union, on the other hand, young girls are still forced to marry adult men, which is a de facto paedophile practice.

The question then is whether, during my time and the Beijing Declaration, we have achieved equality between men and women, have we ensured that women's rights are human rights? The individual answer is that we do not. A newborn girl is still less likely to attend school, to get an education and to become financially independent. In the EU, men still earn 16% more than women, and their pension savings are bigger, and it scares me that in 2021 we still have to debate whether a woman has the right to have an abortion today in an EU country – it simply does not work!

The Generation Equality Forum will be an opportunity to tackle those challenges with a new generation of women seeing the next phase of this crusade.  Women have long fought this fight.

Central to me: the economic independence of women. Those who are financially independent can shape their own lives better.
