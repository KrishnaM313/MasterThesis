Thirty years ago, on December 16, 1989, the Romanian Revolution began in Timisoara. This was the first step towards the return of Romania and Romanians to Europe, after decades of enforced isolation based on artificial divisions between east and west. The Romanian revolution was the final act of the popular anti-communist movements in Central and Eastern Europe and the bloodiest: more than a thousand people paid the price of life in those days.  That winter in 1989, Romanians fought for freedom, fundamental rights, rule of law and democracy. These values form the foundation of our Europe as we know it today, beyond differences in language, race or tradition. They brought us together, from north to south, from east to west, and the perpetuation of these values, of fundamental rights, of the rule of law must continue to be an engine of European unity.  The violence with which the communist regime tried to suppress Romanians' aspirations for freedom and democracy, as well as the hardships of the transitional period, seem today to light years compared to 1989, for Romania - part of the European Union. I remember as a personal experience - I was 21 years old, I was in my last year of college at the time of the revolution - those days in December will remain forever in my soul and in the collective memory of the Romanian people. I then experienced the transition to democracy, years of transition that led or culminated in my country's accession to the European Union. We know, however, that nothing is perennial. We must ensure that no one else knows totalitarian regimes, shortages and isolation, and that is why we must look to the future and apply these principles, primarily in relation to the countries in the immediate vicinity.  There's still a way to go. Our journey to full convergence with the core of the European Union is in full swing. We continue to monitor the state of the rule of law...  But Romania is resourceful. The economy continues growing healthily, the country excels in developing skills, notably in new technologies and the digital economy. I am sure we will continue in the years to come. The recently-adopted European Green Deal has set an ambition to leave nobody behind. As Transport Commissioner, it will be my task to ensure our mobility systems, which are the foundation of our economy and our daily lives, the main accessible and provide development opportunities for all across Europe.

More than a thousand people died for freedom and thousands more were injured. The thousands of human sacrifices of December 1989 are added to the hundreds of thousands of Romanians of all ethnicities and denominations in Romania, who since the establishment of communism in Romania in 1946 fought and campaigned for the defence of freedom, democracy and fundamental human rights.  Many of them fought with guns in their hands as partisans in the mountains, others were jailed by the Communists and died in unsanitary prisons, while others took the path of exile. Thousands more Romanians were shot at the Romanian border when they tried to escape westward from the great prison where the Communists transformed Romania.  Because it refused to institutionally serve the Communist Party, the Greek Catholic Church in Romania was outlawed in 1948, and its bishops, along with hundreds of priests and thousands of believers, were thrown into the prison, where many died.  Along with Greek Catholic priests, Orthodox priests, Protestant and neo-Protestant pastors, even people without a particular confession and different ethnicities, were placed in communist prisons because they refused to serve the Communist Party or opposed communist ideology. They are joined by millions of Romanian families to whom the Communist State confiscated their land and any other property they had, destroying their sources of subsistence.

A few hundred people then dared to oppose the totalitarian regime. They were joined in the hours and days that followed hundreds, then thousands, of people and the revolution spread to Bucharest, Brasov, Cluj, Arad and the whole country.  In Timisoara, the first shots were fired. Those people had no illusions that they would be forgiven by the regime, they knew they were risking their lives, and yet they took to the streets, chose freedom, had the courage to denounce dictatorship, oppression, lack of freedom, economic deprivation, in one of the toughest communist regimes in the world. Today, in the European Parliament, we pay tribute to the courage of these people. Their courage is what made it possible for Romania to return to the values of democracy, pluralism, the rule of law, freedom. It is what has brought us back to the map of free, democratic and united Europe.  In those days, ordinary people became heroes. Many, too many of them never came home alive. A mother recounted how on December 22, after sit in the street for a day and a night in Bucharest, her son returned home with his shirt covered in blood because a friend of his had been protesting with had died in his arms. The man left for work on the 22nd afternoon and the mother found him on the 26th, coming home in the coffin.  Children who, after 30 years, are now the age of the parents they lost then. Last year, when the names of the heroes were flown on the fence of the Royal Palace, in Bucharest's Revolution Square, such a child, who was already an adult, came and wrote, along with his father's name, \"I love you, Daddy\".  Those children ask themselves day by day what is the meaning of their parents' sacrifice.

And for this reason I want to quote the words of a great Romanian Christian intellectual and artist, Camilian Demetrescu: \"We were resigned to living forever outside our land in this West that could not or did not want to understand that communist utopia was already condemned by history, all that remained was the disconcerting hypothesis of the miracle.

Through the Romanian Revolution, the doors were opened for millions of Romanians, to say what they were thinking, and gained their freedom of expression, to read what they wanted, to see, for the first time, their relatives, family members who had gone abroad and which perhaps some of them could not see at all until then.

A large part of these victims were from Timisoara, the city where the Revolution began, exactly 30 years ago. It is, and now, incredibly, their courage to stand up to the communist regime, knowing that they could be alone, and yet they could not conceive that the authorities would shoot unarmed people, women, children. The tragedy was that they started shooting. Even so, the Timisorians resisted. It may seem too dramatic to say that they remained in the street under the fire of bullets, and this is the clearest picture you can have when you think of the Romanian Revolution of 1989.  The people who stood there, in the square, in the streets, saw their friends fall next to them and they could choose to leave, to save themselves, but they didn't.

Let us not forget that people stood in front of the tanks because they no longer wanted to endure terror, humiliation, the orwellian methods of the dreaded Securitate, the Communist secret service. Along with the Diocese of the Hungarian Reformed Pastor, he initially objected to Ceaușescu's crazy plan to destroy the village. They risked their lives, their families, fought for freedom for the sake of their national and religious communities. This revolution and the freedom it has gained are equally valuable to Romanians and Hungarians. We must bow our heads to the courage of László Tőkés and every single person who dared to resist. The revolution that began with Timisoara, which moved the whole of Romania as one, tore down communism and created freedom in Romania. Although the crimes against humanity committed in the revolution remained untenable, they have remained unpunished to this day.

This is why what happened in December 1989 in Romania was not only a feeling of Romanians, but also of Europeans who showed, and at that time, their solidarity and attachment to the Romanian people and, obviously, like the Romanians, waited to find out the truth about these events.  But since then it has been three decades and year after year the Romanian people are waiting for an answer on what happened in December 1989. They are waiting for an end in which all the culprits are tried and convicted according to the facts, complicities and culpability of each of them. There is still, in Romanian society, a fear that this expectation can continue as long as no one and nothing will succeed in pushing justice in Romania to establish the truth and until then the main actors or witnesses will physically disappear and even the descendants and close to the fallen, and this file will remain in a drawer with the resolution \"unknown author\". Because yes, the truth is clear and simple described in the Revolution file, it says exactly who and how it acted, at whose behest it acted, knowing, in many cases, the perpetrator of each crime. Colleagues, Romania also needs the truth. Romania cannot heal and even completely detach itself from the past as long as the culprits of December 1989 are not officially known. Sooner or later, the truth always comes out, but sometimes it's too late. This time, we don't want it to be too late again. This is the aim of this resolution in the European Parliament, that December 1989 should not become a moment of oblivion, but a moment of memory, of freedom, and for this we need truth as soon and forever as possible.

His determination to publicly denounce human rights violations and to oppose the plan to systematize the villages preceded the outbreak of the Revolution.

No temporal authority can remove its status as a symbol of the Revolution or diminish its collective gratitude. Colleagues, much remains to be done in the Revolution file. It is extremely sad that no Romanian, apart from the Ceaușescus, was found guilty of supporting communist terror. Unfortunately, Romania has not adopted a lustre law. Former collaborators have access to central government positions. In an abusive way, the restitution of property seized by the communist regime has dragged on for years.

There were 700 hundred people queuing for hours to attend the hearing. That queue is the best proof that Romanians still want justice.

We must anticipate the problems of the future and decide in the present with the speed and intelligence that this era of innovation requires. VAT is an important source of tax revenue for all Member States and for the Union, which has its own source of revenue here. Harmonising rules and bringing tax policies closer to VAT is to protect the integrity of the internal market and a free movement of goods and services based on fair tax rules. Combating fraud and tax evasion is a priority to strengthen citizens' confidence in democratic institutions and public administrations across Europe. VAT is based on communication by operators of a given value chain and therefore based on trust. While it is true that the overwhelming majority of these agents are reliable and fulfil their obligations, unfortunately VAT fraud remains a problem. The difference between the VAT estimated to be collected and the vat actually collected in 2017 was EUR 137.5 billion. And this means a loss of EUR 267 for every European citizen. VAT fraud in e-commerce in the Union represents EUR 5 billion annually, equivalent to the product of all e-commerce of the Portuguese in a year. The reports we are discussing today are the manifestation of this Parliament's willingness to go further in combating this fraud that harms us all. At the same time, we have created a central European system for the collection and exchange of payment data and we have strengthened the obligations of payment services to collect, retain and communicate such data. With our amendments we want to signal our willingness to put more ambition and affirm this Parliament's commitment to a more effective fight against VAT fraud. Let me therefore highlight a few key aspects: The increased retention period ensures that authorities have more time to identify possible fraud. Determining a minimum amount, which activates the payment service's reporting obligation in a single transaction, reduces the space to bypass the system we are approving. With the express reference to the obligations before the European Data Protection Supervisor we point out that no due diligence of public authorities or payment services violates the fundamental right of Europeans to the privacy and protection of their personal data. Advocating the use of new technologies in payment systems, we call for modernisation and stress the need to simplify procedures for businesses and citizens. Ladies and gentlemen, what we are talking about here today is truly justice, it is to ensure that everyone, regardless of country or their digital skills, pays their share. Financial technology is changing every day the way we consume, negotiate and pay for the services we hire. And we need to adapt our legislation to the new realities of the digital world. VAT fraud knows no borders and can only be combated with increasing cooperation between national authorities and European institutions. It is in our hands to ensure greater fairness, ensuring fairer and flawless taxation, levelling the conditions in a fight, even today unequal, between those who seek to evade their obligations and those who defend tax justice.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 49, "date": "2019-12-16.json", "name": "Lídia PEREIRA", "mepid": "197738", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, I am very proud to stand in front of this assembly for the first time as the Commissioner for economy. I look forward to the important work ahead of us, and the fight against tax fraud is high on our respective agendas. I would like to thank the rapporteur, Lídia Pereira, and the members of Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON) for their excellent work on the two proposals we are discussing.  VAT fraud is a major issue affecting all Member States and citizens alike, and it is important that measures aimed at attacking VAT fraud can be subject to a democratic debate in this plenary. The present proposal should be examined in line with the VAT and e—commerce package that was adopted by the Council in December 2017, and will enter into application in January 2021. The proposal provides tax authorities with a powerful tool that will allow them to detect and fight VAT fraud in the e-commerce sector. European action is absolutely necessary.  In 2015, as the rapporteur remembers, EUR 5 billion of VAT was lost in the European Union solely on imports of goods. Similar numbers have been reported with regard to supplies of services. This problem is also likely to keep growing in future, considering the growth rate of e-commerce in Europe.  The Commission has proposed to create an obligation for payment service providers established in the Union to transmit data on the beneficiary of cross-border payments they execute. This obligation was designed to limit administrative burdens in that regard. The requested information is already available and used by payment service providers to process transactions. Although this proposal constitutes a big step forward in the fight against VAT fraud, there is still much to do. This year’s Commission study on the VAT gap shows that the Member States were in general losing EUR 137 billion in 2017, and these numbers are obviously still too high.  Because of this, I intend to make the fight against tax fraud a top priority of my mandate. Of course the fight against tax fraud goes hand in hand with improving tax compliance. This is why these two aspects will be part of a new action plan I will present next year. EU business must be able to access the EU market without constraints and unfair competition by those that are not compliant.

Fair taxation is an essential condition for this. The fight against cross-border tax fraud is therefore one of the most important tasks of the European Union, and therefore for us Members of Parliament. We cannot continue to avoid taxation across Europe because of all sorts of loopholes, a lack of cooperation between Member States or cynicism and cynical collation of some Member States. As a Hungarian MEMBER, I come from a country with the highest VAT rate in the entire European Union and even the whole world: 27 percent. This also means that my country is one of the favourite destinations and hunting grounds for VAT fraudsters. As a Hungarian, I know exactly what it is like when public money migrates to fraudsters. Tax evasion is not the prank of some international craftsman, as it causes €137 billion in damage across Europe. Tax evasion is therefore a crime that seriously threatens the functioning of education, health, social care and public services in general, undermines social justice, our common Europe without borders and, of course, destroys European democracy and risks the peace of everyday life. It is therefore very important that we were able to prepare the drafts on cross-border VAT fraud together and put them on Parliament's table. As we promised, together with you, we have worked together to make sure that these taxes are not only paid by those living on wages, by family businesses, but also by achieving that no one can cheat or arreat their privileged position. These proposals strengthen cooperation and exchange of information between Member States, ensure the long-term recording of data and thus ensure effective action against cross-border tax fraud.

Commissioner, I think you would also have huge support in this House. You mentioned that the numbers of the value added tax gap are slowly and gradually decreasing but, according to the Commission estimates and indications, it should still be around EUR 130 billion in 2018 and that is indeed still quite a high number. As was also mentioned by other colleagues, the VAT carousel frauds, whereby criminals abuse the EU cross—border trading system, contribute EUR 50 billion on average per year in lost revenue for Member States’ tax authorities. The legislation we are debating here today will help drastically reduce the revenues lost to VAT fraud in our financial systems. Their losses are damaging not only to the governments. They are also felt throughout the economic chain and therefore damage the vast majority of legitimate businesses, particularly small and medium-sized companies in the European Union. I therefore fully support the efforts to address the deficiencies in VAT regimes in Europe. From the European Parliament perspective, we have emphasised the importance of legislation being appropriate for the modern age. This is something we will need to monitor on a continuous basis to ensure that our rules are fit for purpose and achieve the goal of increasing the efficiency of VAT collection and combating fraud. We must not forget the time and money it takes, especially for smaller companies, to collect and report their appropriate VAT information to authorities. Therefore, for our group it is important that the new rules do not add an undue administrative burden which may hamper the efforts of smaller businesses to grow, particularly across borders within the single market. European legislation in this area needs to be future-oriented with a clear focus on ensuring it can be applied as business models evolve in the coming years. I therefore appreciate that the Parliament has specifically pointed to the digital arena in this report as our commercial environment becomes ever more digital. I would also encourage VAT authorities to consider the development of artificial-intelligence-based solutions to tackle fraud. Specifically, artificial intelligence could be used to create a risk model that would help identify anomalies in the system. In this way, the AI could minimise hours spent  by officials in compiling such information. By increasing efficiency, we can target carousel frauds in particular in a more effective manner.  Let me conclude by thanking the rapporteur and colleagues for their cooperation on these two files. We have drafted two reports that reflect Parliament’s priorities, particularly as regards the administrative cooperation and payment service providers. I believe that these are the right steps needed in the area of tax collection, which enhance cross-border cooperation on the one hand and help fight tax fraud on the other.

According to the Commission, €135 billion less than expected VAT revenues would cost each citizen €267 a year. Let's read correctly: the citizen? I think it is more the Commission and the Member States who are talking about it. The EU has the highest consumption taxes in the world. On average, EU citizens pay more than twice as much as others elsewhere. Compared to Japan or Canada, we pay three to four times. The EU is also at the forefront of personal taxes and social security contributions. Nowhere does the state have its hands as deep in as many pockets as in Europe. One should therefore expect an all-round luxury care for citizens from the cradle to the grave – the best kindergartens, schools, universities and hospitals and the highest pensions. Indeed, pensions are falling, real wages are stagnating, debt is rising, and the economy is stagnating. Why? The EU and governments should finally be honest: they need more and more money to live out their multicultural LBGT and world-saving fantasies. That is why the EU wants to undermine the principle of unanimity on taxes and calls for more supervision and more powerful prosecutors.

More and better Europe is needed and, in order to do this, laws and regulations and money are needed. I would also like to cautery the absence of the Council.

VAT fraud has also been found in the provision of services, although this is undoubtedly more difficult to quantify.  Member States alone do not have the information necessary to ensure the correct and effective application of VAT rules. Data exchange is not always possible because of legal limitations, which makes administrative cooperation inefficient in combating tax fraud in e-commerce. We need new tools to combat fraud in cross-border transactions in e-commerce. Information sharing, agility in decision-making and simplification of the norm are crucial to combating fraud effectively. For this reason, we support the proposal to create a central electronic payment storage system, and the obligation on the part of Member States to collect and transmit information from payment service providers. For this, it is necessary to simplify, it is necessary to harmonize the data collection process and its format. In this way, we will be more effective and may prevent payment providers from being required to submit the same information in different format in each Member State. This will undoubtedly be an effective tool for the fight against fraud and will be an efficient action that will allow payment service providers to save time and resources, removing barriers to further implementing a true digital single market.

It seems necessary to construct better laws, better tools so that we can create a situation where companies that want to grow do not suffer from this legislation, nor consumers who want to benefit from the market. Clarity in the protection and collection of personal data is also a challenge – this is, of course, where cooperation with the European Data Protection Supervisor is necessary.

When it comes to tax fraud in Croatia, we cannot help but touch Agrokor, one major group that fell into insolvency proceedings two years ago, which is the largest such in Southeast Europe.  It is a group of about seventy companies with about 60,000 employees, and in this example it turned out to be true everything I have said since my entry into politics, which is that there are double standards in Croatia, that there is no rule of law and that there is no social justice in Croatia. It turns out that if you know the right people, you can do whatever you want without anyone being able to do anything to you.  Let's start with the order. There are about 600 large taxpayers in Croatia. In the 20-odd years in 146 firms, of those 600, no tax surveillance has ever been carried out. There's never been a tax inspector. Many of these companies are from the Agrokor Group. In 252 companies there has never been corporate tax surveillance, in 378 companies there has never been income and contribution control, and finally, which is today's topic, in 170 of these 600 companies there has never been VAT control, although under tax laws the priority of the Croatian state is tax surveillance in large companies. That didn't happen in practice.  Mr. Todorić, who owned Agrokor, benefited him in every way for years, so reports were falsified, all of which were tolerated for decades. He was issuing vouchers, exchanges without cover, and that's where the double standard proved. On the other hand, to small taxpayers, especially those ineparable, the inspection came regularly, carried out terror against them. All this clearly shows that these measures are not enough and that Croatia will remain the Wild West and Eldorado for tax non-payment.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "NI", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Non-Inscrits"}, {"id": 63, "date": "2019-12-16.json", "name": "Ivan ŠTEFANEC", "mepid": "124929", "text": "   – Madam President, I believe that the fight against tax fraud should be one of the main tasks of the competent authorities and institutions of the European Union. In addition to comfort and savings, a globalised market, new financial instruments and digitalisation bring new opportunities for various criminals. Fraud is becoming increasingly sophisticated, and states themselves have fewer and fewer options to detect them. We know that in 2017, total value added tax evasion amounted to a wholly eur 137 billion. This means that every tenth euro that was to be ended, to be chosen by individual states, ended up in the pockets of the mafia. That is the money that all citizens have lost. The seriousness of this issue is also underlined by the fact that it was the tax crimes that led to the deaths of journalists Daphne Caruana Galizia and Ján Kuciak with their partner. We live in an era when information becomes the most valuable commodity. It is therefore essential that national authorities share as much data as possible and are able to evaluate objectively and possibly use it in criminal proceedings. It is necessary to put in place mechanisms to prevent leaks using so-called cryptocurrencies. It is also common practice for fraudsters to start fictitious firms in different Member States of the Union and subsequent complex business transactions between them. In doing so, they take advantage of differences in legislation and poor mutual communication between the authorities. We can eliminate these vulnerabilities. I believe that the new European Commission will identify them and, in cooperation with the European Parliament, we will be able to reduce the amount we lose from tax fraud to a minimum. We need to do everything we can to simplify the tax system and help expose those who abuse it.

Over the last month, the Council has recommended the names of Fabio Panetta and Isabel Schnabel and on both candidates the European Central Bank has expressed its positive opinion. The curricula vitae sent to us by the President of the European Council clearly show how both candidates are persons of recognised standing and professional experience in monetary or banking matters, as required by Article 238 of the Treaty. Fabio Panetta has spent his professional career of over 30 years as a central banker. He has served in important positions at national, European and international level, and he is currently the senior Deputy Governor of the Bank of Italy. Isabel Schnabel is a distinguished scholar of one of the most prestigious European universities and for five years she has been a member of the Council of Economic Advisers of Germany.  The ECON Committee submitted to the two candidates a written questionnaire of over 50 questions and subsequently organised a public hearing. The vast support received by Fabio Panetta and Isabel Schnabel, 90% and 70% respectively, demonstrates the very wide appreciation of the ECON Committee for these two excellent candidates.  However, the two reports do not simply express our support for Fabio Panetta and Isabel Schnabel; they recall and renew battles that the European Parliament has been fighting for some time.  First and foremost, the battle for a selection and appointing procedure that involved the Parliament more. Of course, we appreciated that after our requests the President of the Eurogroup, Mário Centeno, by publicly announcing which nominations had been received for each position, has made the selection process more transparent than in the past. However, we reiterate our request that the Council, before each of its recommendations, submits to the Parliament a list of at least two names where at least one man and one woman are present.  Only in this way will it be possible to guarantee equal opportunities for men and women in the selection procedures for top positions in our institutions, and therefore to favour gender balance in management bodies. We already have achieved some important results in this regard. In the last six months, half of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank was renewed, and two out of the three new members are women. One third of the Executive Board will be composed by women, and let us not forget that one of them has been appointed as the President of the ECB.  However, this is not enough. A few months ago, European newspapers published a photo of the ECB Governing Council, that is the other management body of the ECB, and there was only one woman in that picture – Madame Lagarde herself.  Of course this is not due to the nomination process we are discussing; this is due to the fact that the non-executive part of the ECB Governing Council is composed by all the governors of the national central banks of the euro area, and all of them happen to be men.  This makes it clear that our aim for a gender-balanced representation in European bodies can be reached only if this process takes place everywhere in national institutions first. For this reason, we call on the Council to forward our message to all Member States.  To conclude, I just want to say that our support for these two excellent candidates, and our responsibility in guaranteeing the correct and regular functioning of the ECB, while safeguarding interinstitutional cooperation, shall not diminish our battles which we will continue fighting with determination in the future.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 74, "date": "2019-12-16.json", "name": "Irene TINAGLI", "mepid": "197591", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, honourable Members of the Parliament, honourable Irene Tinagli, we all know how relevant the role of the European Central Bank is to our economy. The Bank has played a crucial role in managing the recent crisis. Monetary policy has successfully used the instruments at its disposal to stimulate the economy, and as a result, it has averted a serious threat of deflation. I’m glad to see a discussion on your agenda on these two appointments, specifically for two reasons. Firstly, for reasons of democratic accountability. The Treaties enshrine the independence of the European Central Bank, and this is a principle that the Commission defends wholeheartedly, but independence and accountability are two sides of the same coin. Secondly, as you can see from the composition of the College and the cabinets of Commissioners, this Commission is committed to the promotion of gender equality. It is my conviction that public institutions, such as the Commission and the ECB, have a particular responsibility in this respect. I therefore support the Parliament’s endeavour for gender balance in all European bodies, which was underlined by the honourable Ms Tinagli right now. As you were very right to point out in your resolution earlier this year, all of us working in the economic field need to move to do more on this front. However, we need to be careful to facilitate the functioning of the ECB in these important times, not least when the institution is not to blame for faults in the nomination process. It should also be highlighted that the ECB itself has stepped up its efforts on that front in recent years. I know you will make sure that it continues to strive for gender equality under the leadership of President Lagarde. After all, the positions expressed by this Parliament have already yielded results, following the appointment of Madame Lagarde and the election of Ursula von der Leyen as President of the Commission, women finally fill two of the most crucial positions in the EU.

The Executive Board of the European Central Bank is undergoing a personnel shake-up this year. With Christine Lagarde, Isabelle Schnabel and Fabio Panetta, there are new faces on the Governing Council, and if I add mr Lane to this list, there are four new members of the Executive Board within a very short space of time. This is certainly also a good reason to question some of the old methods and priorities of the European Central Bank.  In this respect, the review of the Central Bank's monetary policy strategy, which was last carried out in 2003, is the right step. However, I believe that in these reviews we should also reduce the desires somewhat, because the mandate of the European Central Bank is not being reviewed, the mandate is derived from the Treaties. And if you want to change the mandate, you have to get involved in the Treaties. It is not the ECB's job to give itself a new mandate. What is possible, however, is to reconsider what price stability means in the 21st century. The Chief Economist of the European Central Bank recently described the structural factors affecting our economy: demographic change, the shift to a service society, and increased demand for safe investment products. All these factors are pushing down interest rates. However, if this analysis is correct, then the ECB must also take the next step. In other words, if the equilibrium interest rate falls in the long term, the monetary policy of the European Central Bank should also adjust. There is no point in dogmatically sticking to the 2% inflation target if we themselves forecast lower growth rates in the medium and long term. In this respect, the ECB should urgently review this part of its policy so that savings also generate a lasting profit.

And it is a change that also coincides with the election of the new president of the institution and therefore opens a new period; a new period in which I believe that the activity of the European Central Bank needs to be reviewed. I agree that the Bank's mandate is clearly in the Treaties, but the way in which that mandate translates into the specific objectives and the instruments for implementing that monetary policy is obviously part of the debate. The ECB's current monetary policy strategy was agreed as early as 2003, more than fifteen years ago, and many things have happened since then: the natural interest rate on money has fallen in response to demographic changes and the challenges of digitization, and therefore the ability to implement monetary policies is greatly constrained by this permanent fall in the natural interest rate. That is why we need to seek other objectives, within the mandate, but other objectives. We need to look at whether we can incorporate asset prices, or whether we need to set that inflation target not so much in price growth, but at the price level itself. And we also need to review the instruments in a digital world that opens up a new ground for monetary policy.

The European Central Bank has been the only institution that has acted with the interest of resolving the crisis — the latest crisis — on behalf of all Europeans. Unfortunately, judging by the news coming to us from certain States, this fact does not seem to be so clear in public opinion. Some complain that the ECB does too much, and they may be right, but what they don't say is that if the European Central Bank is doing a lot, it is because monetary policy is being the only tool being used against the crisis and states are not doing their part. Monetary policy cannot be the only instrument for combating a recession. The European Union needs effective countercyclical mechanisms to complement its action, such as common European unemployment insurance or a budget for the euro area — and the budget has to be the right size, not what the Eurogroup seems to be agreeing on.  We want and believe in an independent European Central Bank, an institution that tells the truth, however uncomfortable, and the truth is that Member States must do more. We are therefore pleased that the two candidates on which we are speaking today have accepted, before the Committee on Economic Affairs of this Parliament, to make the European Central Bank an institution committed to the reforms necessary to strengthen the euro area.  On the other hand, complaints about the ECB are not only because it has already been forced to use both its monetary policy, but are also explained by mis-communication. We have to combat misinformation and monetary populism. We cannot allow sensational media from some countries to say that the ECB steals money from savers and pensioners. We need the European Union to have a clear account of this. We must be able to defend our institutions and explain to our citizens why the decisions of the European Central Bank were and are right. This is not an exclusive task of the European Central Bank. We too, from the European Parliament, need to be more active in condemning the lies of populists and explaining our decisions. But not only do we have to explain the political decisions: also the techniques. We need to explain to citizens the ideas that motivate us to make the decisions we make. The European Central Bank's action must be credible, and it depends on everyone's effort that our single currency, one of our greatest successes, has a prosperous future.  This communication challenge is the challenge that future members of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Isabel Schnabel and Fabio Panetta will also have ahead of them. From Renew Europe we know that they understand the situation and we believe they are trained to help solve it. That's why we're voting for your appointments. We believe they are trained to make the right decisions and that they are both trained to help explain these decisions.  As the chairwoman of our committee has said, we would also like to highlight a problem in these appointments and in this procedure, which has to do with the problem of gender parity. Citizens cannot feel represented by a Governing Council in which half of citizenship is not represented, as only twenty-four members are women. Faced with this situation, the European Parliament, through a resolution adopted in March this year, demanded that States submit two names to fill each vacancy: a man and a woman. Among them, Parliament would choose the most qualified. If you don't put women's names on the table, it's impossible for us to achieve gender equality. States must do more in their competitive field. All governors of national central banks are men. I'm a professor of economics. I have dedicated myself to this twenty-five years and I can assure you that there are many highly trained women in my profession, and I find it very difficult to understand why it is so difficult to find them. That must change.

However, we must take this opportunity to point out how this happened. For many years, this Parliament has been arguing for us to have more gender balance in the EU's central financial positions, and to this day we have not succeeded. One has to add for the sake of honesty: not even with ourselves. What has happened here, however, is that Parliament has said very clearly that we always want balanced lists in the future, so that we can then decide on the basis of qualifications and the inclusion of the two sexes here. And the Council has again not accepted this, it has not been able to do so, because top positions are still being made the subject of national estates, where it is said that it is now a matter of an Italian, then a German, then a Frenchman, then someone from a small country. But you don't get the most qualified candidates, nor do you get a reasonable gender balance. That is why we need an interinstitutional agreement from the Council of the Member States on how we can strike a reasonable balance here in the future, without damaging the individual candidates. And the Commission is called upon to help here to obtain such an interinstitutional agreement on the filling of top positions in the European institutions in the financial field. However, one must also ask ourselves whether this is only about personnel and individual positions. Would it really have been the case if a woman had sat before the ECB that she had already set the monetary policy strategy for years when a man comes? Mario Draghi has done nothing else by, in fact, ensnating the low interest rate policy for the future. That is why I think it is right that the new leader has said that we are revising the monetary policy strategy. And this is the right opportunity, within the framework of the contractual tasks, both to promote the greening of the ECB's monetary policy and supervisory policy and to take more attention to the side effects of low interest rates policy. After all, the risk of corresponding asset price bubbles is real, and it is also true that both the candidates we are now appointing and Christine Lagarde have made it clear that only with a common fiscal policy, with the completion of economic and monetary union and the banking union can interest rate policy change.

We have been living for years in a period of ultra-loose monetary policy and the expansion of the money supply. If you look at the results of this policy, you can see that the Monetary Policy of the European Central Bank is hitting a path of inequality through Europe. Not all companies are shareholders' companies. Many companies in Europe are also companies of savers, and these savings are melting away, and in addition, the banks whose business model is being threatened by this policy are trying to solve their difficulties by turning the screw on savers' fees. The fact is that the independence of the European Central Bank is a great asset. That is why I am also appealing to the newly elected personalities, whom we also support in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, to be a voice in favour of these arguments on the Executive Board of the European Central Bank. It would perhaps still make sense to start a debate on whether the 2% inflation target is actually still up-to-date and whether it really needs to be achieved at all costs.

Because of the lack of action by the Member States, it had to be the ECB, with these measures, that kept the single currency safe. It cannot be hinted that these measures have been outside the law— as some do — not least because those who have wanted to pleite and bring to the Luxembourg Court some of these measures have done so and the Court has validated each and every one of the measures taken by the ECB so far. But it is clear that we need to look at the risks that some of these measures have had in terms of the bubble, for example, produced in the housing market or also other effects that have destabilized the financial market. And it is also necessary to review, as the European Central Bank will do in the coming months, the whole monetary policy to adapt it to new phenomena such as – and that is very important for this group as well – its effects on climate change, knowing that the Bank's asset purchase programmes have been buying coal-linked assets for many and many months and that must end , among many other things.

Secular stagnation, unrealistic - or not - of a target of 2% annual inflation, the proliferation of electronic currencies or virtual currencies, the subject of the 'helicopter currency' which could lead central banks to encroach not only on fiscal policies, but also on the social policies of the Member States: all these issues are totally new because we are in a new monetary and economic world.

Experts in political science, who would remind us that the currency - a fundamental instrument of sovereignty - is still a political instrument - an instrument of trust and stability of societies?

He is right, but that shows that a single currency does not work when completely different economic schools of thought meet. How one can cheer these nominations at the same time, given this realization that there are different basic economic structures, remains, of course, the secret of the EPP and the German CDU. It goes without saying that Fabio Panetta represents the interests of Italy and the shareholder and owner company. He is fantastically trained for this and has the necessary academic prerequisites. But why Then Germany proposes Mrs Schnabel, who also represents the interests of the owner economies and works against the German savers, even criticizes the criticism of the wrong policy, that remains the secret of the German Federal Government.

Researchers from Berkeley and the University of Copenhagen estimated that in 2016, 40% of big companies’ profits were shifted to tax havens every year. For many countries, this means losing huge portions of tax revenues that could be used to address increasing needs in education, health care, public services and pensions, not to mention investments in physical and digital infrastructures, in research and development: all things that benefit people and firms of all sizes, small and large ones alike. Everybody should contribute to this. But while citizens, consumers and small and medium businesses do pay their share, with effective tax rates that may go up to 40% or even more sometimes, many large multinationals do not, and this is not acceptable anymore. These situations not only create problems of social justice, but also relevant market distortions and unfair competition. We talk a lot about building a level playing field, but what we have today on tax matters is not level at all. Yes, we want to reward efficiency, we want to reward innovation, but that should take place within a fiscal framework that applies the same tax rules to everyone. That is why we welcome the commitment of 135 countries that are negotiating, at the OECD level, a reform to address these challenges. On behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON), today I present a resolution and oral questions on these reforms, and we urge the Commission and Member States to act and agree on a joint and ambitious EU position in these negotiations. I thank the Commissioner for being here today to answer our questions. The first one: how does the Commission intend to ensure a common EU position in the current international discussions on tax challenges posed by the digitalisation of the economy? And the second: how does the Commission intend to ensure that the ongoing international discussions around Pillar One are coherent and consistent with EU proposals in this field? And third: how is the Commission preparing the implementation of the outcome of such international deals? And, in the event of a regrettable absence of an international solution, when, and in what form, will the Commission act to ensure a coordinated EU reply? Parliament expects an active role of the Commission. Europe can play a fundamental role in shaping this debate only if we are united, only if we speak with one voice. With this initiative, Parliament intends to express its position on two main points. The first one: we should reform the allocation of taxing rights, going beyond the concept of physical presence in order to include all large firms with an active engagement and interaction with customers and users – also by digital means. The second: we encourage a minimum rate to be set at a fair and sufficient level to discourage profit-shifting and prevent damaging tax competition. Indeed, according to the corporate tax statistics by OECD, there are countries where the corporate tax rate is basically zero, and we can’t accept that anymore. So let me conclude, dear Commissioner and dear colleagues, by saying that it’s time to modernise our tax rules to ensure that big companies pay their fair share of taxes where the value is created and where the economic activity is taking place. We should not ring-fence the digital economy, but we should look at all multinationals that are increasingly finding ways to elude taxes. The current international fiscal regime creates competitive distortions among players; it deprives countries from their sovereign decision to tax corporate profits to finance public services; and most importantly, it increases inequalities and puts most of this fiscal burden on less mobile taxpayers, workers and consumers. This is simply not fair. Our citizens demand tax justice, and it is time to give them an answer.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 98, "date": "2019-12-16.json", "name": "Irene TINAGLI", "mepid": "197591", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, honourable Members of the Parliament, thank you, honourable Tinagli, for putting the reform of the international corporate taxation framework on the agenda of this session. The questions you raised also show how important this issue is for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON) and the Special Committee on Financial Crimes, Tax Evasion and Tax Avoidance (TAX3), and for your honourable person. I am also grateful for all the work you have done so far. Whatever the shape of the solutions, the Commission is defending an EU perspective I would like to detail. It is important to continue working in parallel on the twin challenges of modernising international corporate tax rules. One: to tax digital activities, carried out without a physical presence. This concerns the reallocation of taxing rights, the so-called Pillar 1. Two: to address new forms of excessive tax competition under what is called Pillar 2. To address those challenges and reach an ambitious global agreement, we then need to find a global solution that effectively captures digital business models, notably those operating in jurisdictions without a physical presence, and to put a floor on excessive international tax competition and close remaining BEPS loopholes. In addition, while working on a global solution at international level, our aim is to negotiate the best possible outcome for Member States and for the EU. I also want to ensure that the specificities of the Single Market are respected in any solution that arises from the international discussions. We always work for Europeans, in the interest of European businesses and for the sake of European citizens. That is why we aim at achieving these objectives without additional complexities for businesses. It is essential that any new rules be simple and easy to administer and provide additional resources to be redistributed to the benefit of our citizens. Indeed, it is important to understand the economic impact of the options proposed under both pillars, so that Member States can take an informed decision. The preliminary results of our economic analysis on revenues are, until now, encouraging. They suggest that the EU as a whole could benefit under Pillar 1 and that all Member States would benefit from Pillar 2. The Commission has now asked Member States to provide their country-by-country reporting data to be able to further refine the economic analysis. To conclude, if a global agreement is reached on both pillars, the EU will need to decide how it should be implemented at EU level. If no or limited agreement is reached internationally by 2020, it is crystal clear that the strong rationale for EU action at EU level will remain and that the Commission will act on this basis.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 99, "date": "2019-12-16.json", "name": "Markus FERBER", "mepid": "1917", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has said. First of all, thank you very much, Commissioner, for this clear commitment, for the clear commitment you have just made. I think it is very important that we find a solution, a clarification, for many of the things that we had to find out together in three special committees and in a committee of inquiry during the last parliamentary term. The best solution, of course, is the international one, because tax problems do not stop at the borders of the European Union, but – especially when we are talking about the digital economy – we are dealing with international challenges, and we must also address them together internationally.  That is why I very much welcome the fact that the Member States are taking action here, but also other jurisdictions. I would refer in particular to the United States of America, which has an important role to play here, particularly in the field of the digital economy. We need to get away from the idea of a physical plant, with machines, factories, employees, physical inputs, and physically tangible outputs in the digital economy. It is almost a matter of where you settle, there are other criteria. Unfortunately, it is far too often tax law that ultimately is crucial to where a company is set up. That is precisely why these things need to be addressed. But I also say quite clearly: those who leave must keep their own stable clean. I would like to point out that we also have competition in the European Union at the expense of the partners – dubious competition to the detriment of the partners in the European Union. We must also address our problems clearly and clearly in the European Union. I really call on the Commission to move forward with courage. Not only the Competition Commissioner, by addressing the whole thing as aid issues, but also you, as the new Commissioner responsible, to address these tax issues.

And we did not discuss what that policy should be in response to decisions from other central banks, nor did we discuss what needed to be done in the face of the exit or inflow of capital flows, or about the level of reserve we had in our boxes. And we did not discuss this because we have managed to exercise European sovereignty in the exercise of monetary policy. Something that nation states did not have in the 1990s, when the European monetary system went bankrupted, when central banks and states, in the exercise of supposed formal sovereignty, were unable to direct their monetary policy.  And that's what we have with fiscal policy today. Because today, the tax bases are more mobile than ever; today, large multinationals, large digital companies move profits from one jurisdiction to another, use transfer prices, take advantage of all the nooks and crannies of national laws so as not to pay taxes, and therefore States do not have formal sovereignty in the exercise of fiscal policy, even if they do have it in the rules. And that's what we're talking about: how to replicate our success with monetary policy in fiscal policy. And for this we need not a coordination anymore, but a minimum taxable basis — minimum, I say — in corporation tax. We need to have a common fiscality framework in capital movements. We need common rules and leadership on the part of the European Commission, controlled by this Parliament, to return to citizens the certainty that their affairs, that their problems, are led by someone, and are not in the hands of that nebula that markets are.

I live in a building of 24 houses; probably what Netflix enters in my building would have been enough to pay all corporation tax in Spain.  Unfortunately, they are not isolated cases, rather on the contrary, they are examples of how large multinationals avoid paying taxes in european Union countries. How, Mr Gentiloni, are we going to ask our citizens and small businesses to pay their taxes, if we allow those who earn the most not to comply? How are we going to fund our welfare states, if those who make the most money do not contribute to keeping it proportionate? How can we defend the free market, if the rules are not the same for everyone? This, ladies and gentlemen, is one of the biggest challenges facing the European Union. Our citizens look at us and expect us to find a just solution. We cannot ignore that globalization and digitization have changed the world. However, as Mr Ferber said, we continue to face the challenges of the 21st century with 19th-century rules. We can't wait any longer. Taxation must adapt to this new reality. The Resolution seeks to set rules for collection to be much more linked to revenue generation, so that there is fair competition in these markets, between companies and between States. This initiative should be adopted globally. A separate country cannot do anything to combat tax avoidance, carried out on a large scale by certain multinationals. That is why we need to cooperate and for cooperation to go beyond the European Union. And, as Mrs Tinagli said, it is not just a question of talking about the taxation of digital companies. This is happening far beyond, in all these multinationals. That is why our first objective is to achieve a comprehensive solution within the OECD framework. We believe it is the right forum, but, as you said, Commissioner - and I thank you for your commitment here to us - if the OECD at the end of 2020 is unable to act, we must act here. And I assure you of our commitment to that performance. We are going to try to make sure that, if the OECD does not act, the European Union will at least end this very unfair situation.

In this respect, I am annoyed when I see the European Commission's figures that, despite all the efforts made to achieve international tax cooperation in Europe and internationally, the effective corporate tax rate fell below 20% for the first time last year and the penultimate year. And we all know that these low tax rates do not come from the fact that small businesses no longer pay taxes, but that it is mainly large transnationally organised companies that manage to get a lean foothold here. We must not underestimate the destructive effects of this tax inequality. This damages the idea of a social market economy, which has the core idea that everyone in a market is subject to equally similar rules, so that there is fair competition. It also damages the idea of the European internal market, because a European internal market, in which in some countries no company taxes are levied and in others decent, cannot guarantee fair competition. This is a problem that is based on the legitimacy of our European economic cooperation. Let us be honest: the citizens have long believed that we are overwhelmed with these problems. We have been talking about this for decades and we are not getting to grips with the problem, and that is due to the legitimacy of democratic institutions, including the European Commission, the Council, but also of Parliament, even though the European Parliament has always made it clear the loudest that we want a different policy here. We should therefore be honest and say what we have achieved: we have managed to restrict banking secrecy internationally, so that at least private individuals can no longer easily manage the money they have earned elsewhere in Switzerland. But we haven't made it for companies. In the case of companies, we still see millions of letterbox companies where there is no economic substance and yet no taxes are paid. It is good that this is now being negotiated at OECD level, but it is not enough to take further small steps here. What we have decided under the Juncker Commission – the Anti-Tax Avoidance Directive I and II within the global scope of the BEPS agreement – has so many loopholes that it is simply worth the paper on which it is printed. Property purchases are still structured in such a way that profits are simply drawn into zero-tax countries and then our fine rules are undermined against the interest rate barrier. That is why it is so important that we finally establish common minimum tax rates that clearly state where there is a downward limit. It is sad that Christian Democrats – and I have to say some Liberals too – still have problems in clearly committing themselves to these minimum tax rates. And so do we need tax transparency. The Austrian Parliament has just lifted the opposition of the Christian Democrats there.

It is untenable that companies such as Google, Facebook, Netflix, etc. do not or barely pay tax when they make very serious revenue. We are on the right track in seeking an international solution to their taxation, in a framework wider than the Union. Indeed, the OECD is an excellent platform for this, which has put forward a two-pillar proposal. I can fully identify with the first one, which would give more taxing rights than at present to the State where the companies' customers are located. On the other proposal, which would introduce a minimum tax, however, I have a serious problem. As far as I know, no impact assessment has been carried out in this respect, so there is no answer as to whether, if OECD countries introduce that minimum tax, businesses in these countries will not transfer their headquarters outside the OECD. Undertakings are quite right to optimise their economic activity and there are fears that they will go where they have to bear less of a burden. Such a measure would therefore impair our economic environment, i.e. our own competitiveness, and fatten third countries, especially tax havens. Moreover, in addition to the increased tax obligations, we would also impose heavy administrative burdens on businesses, so this is the wrong direction. The OECD should first carry out an impact assessment and then formulate a new proposal.  Finally, one final note. Unfortunately, the text of the decision included the need to move towards a majority vote and higher harmonisation in tax policy within the Union. This, as I said earlier, would reduce the possibility of fair competition in an international context, even within the Union, and would result in companies going outside the Union.

Commissioner Gentiloni, Madam President and Rapporteur Tinagli, is indeed an extremely important discussion that we are having today. I would like to put the issue perhaps a little differently than it has been put up so far, but coming to the same conclusion, which is that this resolution must be supported. What we are discussing in this house at this hour of the evening is not to treat multinationals as enemies of peoples. It is not about launching a war against multinational companies. There is, however, a growing perception at both European and OECD level that there are indeed significant amounts of tax revenue that are lost because of its behaviour in moving profits from one country to another. Obviously, there is the opinion of civil society and the population in several countries, in the OECD and especially in the European Union, which are becoming increasingly vocal on this subject in view of the problem. What we need to emphasise, however, and it is very important, is that here we have an obvious problem of ethics and behaviour of multinational firms, but we also have a problem of competition and lack of coordination between Member States. After all, multinationals use this framework that we have and that is not effective.  At the same time, it is a problem at the level of each Member State as regards the quality of the tax administration and the competence that that tax administration has to be able to have a unitary regime. The two proposals, the two pillars - fairer allocation of tax rights and, respectively, a global proposal to avoid tax erosion by setting a minimum tax - only work within a multilateral framework and the European Union can indeed set an example. I repeat, it is not a question of going to war in order to tax multinationals more, it is about finding fiscal fairness, a regime whereby we can ensure that small and medium-sized enterprises are not disadvantaged and, at the same time, avoid this race of differentiated taxation and different administration between Member States.

However, this proposal goes far beyond this and has the potential to update corporate tax rules and make them fit for the 21st century. We cannot govern economic relations in globalisation with the rules that we have from the 20th century. Today, transfers between subsidiaries of the same companies are taxed as if they were transfers between two independent companies. This is today at the origin of the sophisticated schemes used by multinationals for tax avoidance. One of the solutions, highly accepted among the economics and academic community, is to tax companies as global entities. The OECD has started to recognise that, as did the Commission almost ten years ago with the first proposal for a common consolidated corporate tax base. The first proposal was blocked, as was the second one of 2016. We are still waiting for news from the Council on that. We need international negotiations to reach a deal by the end of 2020, Commissioner. All EU Member States should set aside their differences and speak with one single voice. We need an ambitious deal, not the lowest common denominator – a deal which ensures that companies are taxed where they have the economic activity, meaning where they make sales, have employees and assets, where they have their clients and where they sign online contracts.

The biggest problem here – the elephant in the room, so to speak – is the current US position, which puts the project for real reform on very shaky ground. The two pillars of this proposal, if agreed on in the future, will represent a fundamental shift in the global tax system towards a much fairer and more sustainable system. I’ve been warning my own government for years that it needs to end its dangerous addiction to corporate tax avoidance by Silicon Valley-based companies.

In this context, tax regulations such as the current one, which was conceived with business models with a physical presence in mind, are far removed from reality. Now there are many digital companies that have customers and generate value—as is well known—economic value, in countries where they are not present. But in addition, many of these earn their income from intangible assets.

In short, it is urgent to adapt competition rules; in this case we are talking about tax legislation, tax legislation, but it is not going to be the only time that we talk about one aspect of the principles of competition, because there are many other aspects that are linked to the same situation of digitization and globalization, and we will have the opportunity, sure, to discuss them throughout this legislature.

It is not a question of seeing them as enemies, it is just a matter of saying that they too must contribute in a fair proportion to the effort of our societies to finance our infrastructure, our social systems, etc. At European level, we lose $1 trillion every year because of this tax optimisation, this tax evasion. That $1 trillion would be more than useful to us to fund something called the ecological transition, which is a real emergency. That is why, among other things, the OECD has launched this BEPS 2.0, which aims to do two very simple things, struck by common sense.

This is a precious lifetime that people make available responsibly for the common good.  Responsibility must also apply to large international corporations. Many large companies do not pay the taxes required by law and use the tax loopholes. But this must also be said quite honestly: why do these tax loopholes exist in the first place? It is also up to us in politics to close them down. We need a new way of taxing the profits of multinational companies fairly and not just sharing the tax burden on small shoulders. Europe is missing billions of euros as a result of tax evasion, and that is exactly what we need to change. This is also the task of a German Presidency in 2020 to work to ensure that the EU takes great steps forward here. We now have the opportunity to bring corporate taxation up to the level of the 21st century. We now need positive joint changes instead of disputes, solo actions or sanctions.  We need great answers to big questions, especially together with the United States. We need an effective minimum tax rate in the EU and we need an agreement by the end of 2020 in the OECD negotiations. If we do not succeed in this, then the EU should go ahead and come up with a proposal on EU legislation for fair taxation of the digitised economy, for tax justice, in which tax responsibility is shared fairly on many shoulders, so that with this money we can make Europe more ecological and social.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, it is an honour for me to take the floor here as rapporteur for this important dossier. I am very pleased with the response in the INTA Committee and the unanimous vote on the report I presented and in which I recommended the granting of a third macro-financial aid of EUR 500 million to the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. In order to arrive at this assessment, it was necessary to analyse the economic and social situation in Jordan carefully and to take note of jordan's commendable efforts to take in refugees and the fight against Islamic terrorism and to make good the previous loans contracted with the European Union on time. In fact, the evaluations carried out on the implementation of the previous macro-financial aid programmes granted to Jordan show that the funds granted, made available in the form of long-term low-interest loans, have helped to preserve the macroeconomic stability of the country and have mainly had a positive social impact. The programmes have also been implemented efficiently and in close coordination with the Jordanian authorities. In the face of weak growth and declining investment, on 11 July 2019, the Jordanian authorities requested additional funds from the European Union to meet the country's increased needs for external and budgetary funding, partly linked to the unstable conditions in the region, among which there are large numbers of Syrian refugees in Jordan. On 6 September 2019, the Commission adopted a proposal for a third aid programme up to a maximum of EUR 500 million. I believe that, given Jordan's efforts in relation to the migration crisis and the fight against terrorism, and noting the undeniable developments regarding the level of protection of human rights and democracy, this third loan represents added value for the European Union, helping a neighbourhood country of increasing geopolitical importance to manage pressing economic and social problems.  As we all sadly know, the Syrian conflict has led to negative economic repercussions in Jordan due to the disruption of regional trade, the reduction in tourism revenues, the deterioration in investor confidence and the decrease in capital inflows in the region. The pressure on Jordan's public services, particularly in the areas of health, access to essential goods and education, has been difficult to support in the country, but the commendable effort must be acknowledged in ensuring a decent reception for refugees who are mostly living in urban areas and for whom, despite the many difficulties, access to affordable public health care and the labour market is currently guaranteed. Furthermore, I believe it is important to consider Jordan's efforts in the fight against Islamic terrorism, which are priorities of the European Union and its Member States. Jordan is a strategic partner of the European Union in cooperation on trafficking in human beings and trafficking in firearms, as well as on the exchange of personal data between Europol and the competent Jordanian authorities to combat terrorism. The Kingdom of Jordan then continues to make progress in affirming democratic principles, promoting peaceful religious coexistence and supporting freedom of religion and belief, as well as making significant social and human progress on women's rights and the protection of children. Last but not least, thanks to the progressive liberalisation of each other's markets, the presence of a stable foreign partner is also a guarantee for EU companies that they have better opportunities for trade, entrepreneurship and investment in Jordan. I repeat here that it is essential to ensure that the financial assistance granted is actually aimed at encouraging the development of the country's business investment and projects. It is also necessary to ensure, with all the instruments at our disposal, adequate control of the funds on the ground, in order to ensure that the loan disbursed is used correctly and transparently. Having said that, I believe it is necessary to show the European Union's support for a country such as Jordan with this aid, and I hope that the loan can be made available as soon as possible.  Consequently, I hope that tomorrow's vote will allow financial aid to be granted to the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 127, "date": "2019-12-16.json", "name": "Othmar KARAS", "mepid": "4246", "text": "  Thank you, rapporteur.

I would also like to thank the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Foreign Affairs for their support.  It is worth recalling where Jordan is coming from. Since 2011 the Jordanian economy has been significantly affected by regional unrest, notably in neighbouring Iraq and Syria, which led to unforeseen economic shocks even if some of its structural weakness and lack of competitiveness predates 2011. This regional unrest has taken a heavy toll on growth, external receipts, and has strained public finances. The Syrian conflict has also impacted Jordan by causing a large inflow of around 1.3 million Syrians into the country. This large inflow of Syrian refugees increased pressure on Jordan’s fiscal position, public services and infrastructures.  In these difficult circumstances Jordan has so far managed to preserve macroeconomic stability, thanks to a broadly appropriate policy response and international support. With this in mind, and upon  the request of the Jordanian authorities, the Commission adopted on 6 September a proposal for a new programme of macro-financial assistance to Jordan in the amount of EUR 500 million in loans. Building on the two previous macrofinancial assistance programmes successfully implemented, the new financial assistance will help Jordan to enhance the sustainability of its debt thanks to attractive terms of the loans, as well as to promote further structural reforms necessary to strengthen growth and the resilience of the economy. The programme is part of a wider international effort to support Jordan. Of course this assistance will be conditional on a set of structural reform measures to be agreed in a memorandum of understanding, and also on the existing and successful reviews of the IMF programme. The programme is a concrete expression of the EU’s sustained commitment to supporting Jordan, which faces an adverse and complex economic situation in a region marked by a persistently challenging and volatile environment.  The European Parliament’s support for this proposal will send a clear and encouraging signal that the European Union lives up to its commitments and continues standing by Jordan and all the people living in that country.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "PPE", "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 129, "date": "2019-12-16.json", "name": "David McALLISTER", "mepid": "124806", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done.

We have just heard from both the rapporteur and the Commissioner – Jordan is facing enormous challenges: the growth rate is falling, public debt is increasing and the unemployment rate is rising, especially among young people. Many external circumstances have contributed to this development. As a neighbour of Syria and iraq, Jordan is directly affected by the terrible armed conflicts in the region. According to Jordanian data – Commissioner Gentiloni has just confirmed this figure – there are currently around 1.3 million – 1.3 million! - Syrians in Jordan. Despite the enormous burden on the state and society, the country's handling of this difficult situation is exemplary. That is why it is so important that we, as the European Union, agree unanimously with Jordan's request for MACRO-financial assistance of EUR 500 million. I myself will be in Jordan on 4 and 5 January.

Jordan is one of the most serious countries in the region, economically speaking. Its currency is preserved and the country is actively working to develop its tourism activity. Luisa Regimenti mentions, with relevance, the strong economic growth that Amman had enjoyed until then. I would add that, as a staunch defender of Eastern Christians, the King of Jordan has had an exemplary attitude towards Jordanian Christians. The country must therefore benefit from a concerted international solution for the benefit of Iraqi Christians and Mandeans, who have fled the Islamic State organization and must now find a place to rebuild their lives. This \"package\" of 500 million euros of loans, we will grant it to Jordan, because this country carries the burden of an international crisis that no one wants to solve.

Almost two million people die of cancer annually in Europe, namely the European Union, and as many as 40% of these deaths, unfortunately, could have been prevented if adequate measures had been taken. On the other hand, we know that healthcare is the primary competence of the Member States, and this is defined in Article 168 TSR. treaty on the functioning of the European Union. On the other hand, this provision must not be an excuse for the European Union to do nothing to fight cancer. Today, the European Union has many instruments, both financial and regulatory, to tackle this problem. From better implementation of the Directive on cross-border health services, through investments in scientific research related to health through horizon, to cohesion policy through which one can invest in health infrastructure and in labour capital, i.e. the health workforce. In other words, today the European Union has the instruments to fight cancer. We have a political atmosphere and will on the part of the Commission and Parliament in this and let's make an effort so that we can really make a result.

The purpose of this mechanism was conceived as a system of analysis, verification of justice in Romania and Bulgaria to ensure that these two countries, once integrated into the European Union, reach the same standard of democracy and rule of law as the other European countries.  Regrettably, however, in the case of Romania, we see that, in recent years, this Cooperation and Verification Mechanism is not only no longer technical and has been turned into a purely political report, but the report on Romania in recent years contains a number of errors that have also generated a negative reaction from the Romanian magistrates.  In addition to these factual, quantitative, qualitative errors that exist in this report, the latest written report on Romania, generated by the European Commission, denies provisions of the Romanian Constitution and the decisions of the Romanian Constitutional Court.
