On Monday of this week 60 years ago, an uprising began that lasted for weeks and cost an infinite number of victims. The Hungarian people rose up against foreign rule and a dictatorship that was unbeatable in brutality and ruthlessness. The heroic struggle of the Hungarians against the Soviet occupiers has not been forgotten. The example set by the Hungarians in 1956 was not without consequences. The heroic struggle of the Hungarians was an encouragement for many, many people - not only in Hungary but also in other Warsaw Pact countries - to stand up against the Soviet dictatorship. The Hungarian uprising was not the first, but it was one of the most important. In the end, the Hungarians' struggle for freedom was successful, albeit after decades of oppression. Without the courage of 1956, the courage of the late 1980s and the courage to open the border with Austria through Hungary in 1989 would have been inconceivable. What united the Hungarians in 1956 and 1989 was the desire to return to Europe as a people. When Gyula Horn cut the border fence in 1989, he was asked: You have now chosen between the West German and the East German state? His answer was: No, we chose Europe. In this sense, the struggle for liberation from oppression in all Eastern European countries - inspired by the courageous struggle of the Hungarians - has always been a struggle for Europe too. I had the opportunity this morning to talk to Donald Tusk, who himself was imprisoned in the 1980s as a resistance fighter against such a regime and therefore - out of personal concern - has a special solidarity with the Hungarian people.As the Parliament of the European Union, I believe that on this day we will send our greetings of solidarity to Hungary and remind you that many, many men and women who fought against the Soviet dictatorship had to flee and as Hungarians who fought for freedom,Were accepted as refugees in other countries.With this in mind, I hope that on your behalf I have expressed solidarity with Hungary.(Loud applause)", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1, "date": "2016-10-26.json", "name": "Martin SCHULZ", "mepid": "1911", "text": "As announced on Monday, I referred the Advisory Committee on the Members' Code of Conduct about the dispute that had taken place between two Members of our House, Mr Steven Woolfe and Mr Mike Hookem.

Ms. Ratti has worked in the European Parliament since 1979. Ms. Ratti started out in the European Parliament as personal assistant to Altiero Spinelli, after whom one of our most important buildings in Brussels is named today. In my opinion, Ms. Ratti, starting as Mr. Spinelli's assistant, personally accompanied the integration of the European Union very intensively. Today she is Deputy Secretary General of our House, for whom she did a great job, but not just administratively. As a personality, she has also contributed a great deal to the success of the European idea.

On migration: for the first time for more than a year the European Council was not a crisis meeting. The flows to the Greek islands are down by 98% compared to this time last year. However, irregular flows on the central Mediterranean route, that is to say from Africa to Italy, remain far too high and actually have not changed for the last two years. That is why we focused most of our discussion on cooperation with Africa.  Leaders heard a first assessment from the High Representative on efforts to control the flows in the central Mediterranean, in partnership with key countries. Good groundwork has been laid with Senegal, Mali, Niger, Nigeria and Ethiopia on the so-called Migration Compact. Leaders will assess first with us in December in terms of our goal, which is to prevent illegal migration to Italy and to the rest of Europe and to ensure effective returns of irregular migrants.  Leaders also discussed getting back to Schengen. The goal continues to be lifting temporary border controls over time. However, it has to be accompanied by further reinforcement of the external borders. The Commission will continue assessing the situation and come forward with its recommendations on this basis.  The question of a reform of the common European asylum system was also discussed, including how to apply the principles of solidarity and responsibility in the future. We agreed to consider concrete proposals by the Slovak Presidency on this sensitive issue in December.  We also had a discussion about Russia. Leaders shared individual experiences of several countries, ranging from disinformation campaigns, cyber attacks, interference in political processes in the EU and elsewhere, to airspace violations and the fanning of community conflict in Ukraine, the Balkans and further afield. Also, the developments in the MH17 investigation raise troubling questions.  Overall, we had a sober assessment of this reality, and no illusions. Increasing tensions with Russia is not our aim. We are simply reacting to steps taken by Russia, which is working with considerable energy and focus to weaken and divide the EU. Our long-term objective remains to find a modus vivendi. This means sticking to our values and interests, but also keeping the door open to dialogue. We all agree that European unity in approaching Russia is our greatest strength, and so we will stand united.  We also discussed Syria. We condemned attacks by the Syrian regime and its allies, notably Russia, on civilians in Aleppo. The EU is calling for an end to the atrocities and an immediate cessation of hostilities. We asked the High Representative to pursue further diplomatic and humanitarian efforts. If these atrocities continue, all available options will be considered. The Syrian people need an immediate and permanent ceasefire and a reopening of humanitarian aid corridors.  The last issue we discussed was trade. Our citizens are increasingly concerned about whether the trade deals we negotiate are in their best interests and I am afraid that we will not be able to continue to negotiate free trade agreements if we do not prove that we are very serious about protecting European consumers, workers and companies.  When we discussed this, we drew a big red line between protection and protectionism. In this spirit, leaders committed to reaching an urgent agreement on the modernisation of all the EU’s trade defence instruments. I know that this Parliament is ready to support this. We have now tasked our trade ministers with breaking the deadlock.  When it comes to CETA, the EU is still not ready to sign the agreement with Canada, but talks continue in Belgium this morning. I thank all those who have helped facilitate these talks, especially Martin Schultz and Jean-Claude Juncker. You have shown a genuine leadership and responsibility. Thank you very much for your help.  But at the end of the day, only the Belgians can decide on Belgium’s position. I am impressed by the determination and engagement they have shown during the last hours. I still hope that Belgium will prove that it is a consensus-building champion and that we will be able to finalise this agreement soon.  Here, I must also express my gratitude to the Canadian side for their cooperation and perseverance. If we cannot make the case for free trade with a country like Canada, the most European country outside Europe, and a close friend and ally, there are obvious consequences for Europe’s global position. But it is too early to go there yet. As we speak, the summit tomorrow is still possible.  On the Ukraine Association Agreement and DCFTA: the Dutch Prime Minister informed the European Council about the difficulties in ratifying the agreement. Prime Minister Rutte promised to use the next few days to try to work out a solution with the Dutch Parliament to address these difficulties. Whatever the outcome of the debate in the Netherlands is going to be, it is clear that we need to find a way ahead that is also agreeable to the other 27 Member States, and to Ukraine.  Let me also report that we were glad to welcome Prime Minister May at the European Council. She confirmed that the United Kingdom will invoke Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty before the end of March next year. Consistent with our policy of no negotiations without notification, we did not discuss Brexit. However, given Prime Minister May’s confirmation that Article 50 will be triggered, let me recall the EU—27 position of 29 June. We want as close relations as possible with the UK. There must be a balance between rights and obligations and the UK can continue enjoying access to the single market, but it requires accepting all four freedoms.  To conclude, let me recall the meeting of the 27 EU leaders that was held in September in Bratislava. We met informally to discuss the future of Europe in light of the UK referendum on Brexit. As also reflected in the Bratislava roadmap, the Summit set out a number of actions to address the main concerns of Europeans: migration, security, both internal and external, and economic anxieties. It is now for Member States and the EU institutions to implement the roadmap and, as a matter of fact, we have already started to do so.  On 5 October, the EU ratified the Paris Agreement on climate change. Then next day, the European Border and Coast Guard was launched in record time. Here, I want to thank this Parliament for its excellent and swift cooperation. Last week, Bulgarian Prime Minister Borissov thanked his colleagues for their support in helping to protect the borders with Turkey, as decided in Bratislava.

Such was not the case. Other topics were discussed. Progress has been made, particularly in the area of ​​migration, although there is still a long way to go and strewn with pitfalls. To strengthen the control of our common borders, we have created, with you and in record time, a European body of coast guards and border guards. It is now in place. It will have to quickly have all the personnel and all the necessary equipment so that it can, thanks to the rapid intervention reserve, act with all the speed required. December is the deadline to put in place all the planned systems. I am also counting on the speed of the co-legislators to adopt, by the end of the year, our proposal to create a system of entry into the territory of the European Union and of exit which will help to better control irregular migration. To combat irregular migration, dismantle smuggling networks, save human lives and provide refugees with legal routes of entry into Europe, we are also working with our neighbors, including Turkey. The first results are there. In the six months preceding the entry into force of the European Union-Turkey declaration, the total number of migrants arriving in Greece from Turkey was 739,000 people. In the six months following the implementation of this agreement, this figure rose to 18,000, a difference of 721,000 migrants. According to figures from the International Organization for Migration, between April and October 2015, 582 migrants were killed or went missing between Turkey and Greece. Between April and October 2016, this number is increased to 48 people. There are still 48 deaths or disappearances too many, but there is progress. These are only the first results, tangible but fragile, and we must consolidate them. To do this, we must continue to help Greece respond quickly to requests for additional staff from European agencies present there, in particular to ensure the protection of unaccompanied minors, speed up the relocation of refugees from Greece and continue resettlement from Greece. Turkey to Europe. We are also working with our African partners. As President Tusk has just said, we note progress in the implementation of migration pacts with countries of origin or transit, such as Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Mali or Ethiopia. These are the programs that are underway. However, here again, this new cooperation should be consolidated, extended to other countries and the rapid launch of the external investment plan which is essential to fight against the causes of migration. Europeans need to invest in Europe and they will have to do it quickly. We also need to reform the European asylum system, including the Dublin mechanism, in order to have, as the Commission has proposed, a truly European and united system. Ich würde, sehr verehrter Herr President, gerne zu Ceta ein paar Worte sagen. Ich bin guter Hoffnung, dass es im Laufe des heutigen Tages zu einer Einigung zwischen der belgischen Regierung und der wallonischen Regierung und anderen Landesteileregierungen kommt. Ob dies es uns ermöglichen wird, den Vertrag mit Kanada morgen zu unterschreiben, ist mir noch nicht ersichtlich. Dem wäre auch nicht die große Wichtigkeit zuzumessen, die diesem Termin eigentlich zugemessen wird. Wichtig ist, dass es heute zu einer Einigung in Belgien kommt, damit das Königreich seine Bereitschaft bekunden kann, den Vertrag zu unterzeichnen. Wann dies passiert, ist weniger wichtig, als dass es passiert. Ceta ist ein wichtiges Handelsabkommen, wie alle Handelsabkommen wichtig sind. Aber in dem Zusammenhang - aber nicht nur in dem Zusammenhang - kommt es auch sehr darauf an, dass wir als Europäer nicht nur auf freien Handel, Sondern auch auf fairen Handel pochen. Wir sind für freien Handel, aber diesen freien Handel kann man nicht um jeden Preisherbeizwingen wollen. Wir als Europäische Union müssen uns darüber verständigen, dass unsere Handelsschutzinstrumentarien sich nach oben bewegen werden. Qualitativ hochwertige Handelsschutzinstrumentarien sind notwendig. Ich habe mir in Vorbereitung des Europäischen Rates die Zahlen angeschaut, was die Amerikaner machen, was die USA machen und was die Europäer und die Europäische Union machen. Und ich stelle fest, dass niemand die Vereinigten Staaten dafür kritisiert, dass sie auf bestimmte Stahlerzeugnisse, die aus China kommen, 265% an Antidumping-Zöllen verhängen. In der Produktsparte, um die es hier geht, bringen es die Europäer auf genau 20% Handelsschutzmaßnahmen. So kann man nicht gegen die Überkapazität, die es in China gibt, kämpfen. Die Stahlüberproduktion Chinas entspricht dem Doppelten der gesamten Stahlproduktion in der Europäischen Union. Und deshalb müssen wir dafür sorgen, dass wir uns nicht länger die Hände binden lassen, wenn es um die Regel des niedrigeren Zolls geht - lesser duty rule. Die Amerikaner verteidigen ihre Industrie und vornehmlich ihre Stahlindustrie. Wir müssen dies auch tun. (Beifall) Im Rat sehen das nicht alle so. Die Mitgliedstaaten teilen sich in zwei Gruppen auf: dreizehn dafür oder dagegen, zwölf dafür oder dagegen. Ich werde keine Ruhe geben, bis der Rat mit qualifizierter Mehrheit diesen Handelsschutzmaßnahmen, die wir qualitativ nach oben steigern müssen, zustimmt. Es geht um die Zukunft der europäischen Industrie und nicht nur der Stahlindustrie. Hinzu kommt, dass diese Debatte, die wir untereinander und mit unseren Partnern in der Welt führen müssen, einfacher wäre, wenn wir uns stärker darum bemühen würden, die europäische Wirtschaft wettbewerbsfähiger zu machen. Vieles wäre einfacher, wenn wir wettbewerbsfähiger wären. Aber diese Regeln des niedrigen Zolls müssen wir offensiv angehen. I had intended to describe the results of the European Investment Plan, but you have seen all the figures. Up to now we have mobilized EUR 138 billion of new instruments across 27 Member States and almost 300,000 small firms will have new loans. We are pursuing the aim of reaching EUR 315 billion from now to the year after next. We have proposed as a Commission to double the financial amount of the investments and we have proposed to the Council to double the duration of the plan. The European Council will come back to this issue in December and I really do hope that, on the basis of all the external and internal assessments that will be provided, that the European Council will take a decision along the lines of the Commission’s proposal. Herr President! Ich würde gerne ein letztes Wort zu den Schwierigkeiten sagen, die es in puncto Ratifizierung des Abkommens mit der Ukraine durch die Niederlande gibt. Ich würde von dieser Stelle aus gerne einen Appell an die niederländische Politik richten, genau des Umfangs dieses Problems sich sehr bewusst zu werden. Es wäre gut, wenn man in den Niederlanden auch eine innenpolitische Einigung in der Frageherbeiführen könnte.

I looked in the European Treaty to see what the task of the European Council is. The task of the European Council is to define the strategic direction of the European Union and to provide orientation for this continent. If I then look back at the articles and the headings of the last few days, it does not go together at all, because after this European Council we have more confusion, more confusion than orientation. This is disappointing. I'll go through the topics. First point - trade policy: what is the challenge? We have millions of people - especially young people - out of work on this continent. If we want to create jobs, then we need growth, and given the demographic development, we will not get growth internally, but only with more trade. The USA has already concluded an Asia agreement on trade issues, other regions of the world are overtaking us. That's the challenge. And what is the answer? The answer is that we have a mess at Ceta, that the Canadian Minister of Commerce, in exasperation, almost gives up and wants to leave and makes it clear that we are unable to deliver. And I have to make it clear where that comes from. That is not something for which we are responsible here in the European Parliament. The fact is that in the last European Council in July, the states said with an overwhelming majority - almost unanimously - that we have to make a mixed agreement and not a pure EU-only agreement. And that's why you have to say, dear colleagues: this is failure. What do we learn from it? For the future, it must be clear: European issues must be accounted for in the European Parliament and nowhere else. (Applause) We also learn from this that we must finally stand up for Ceta. I would also like to make an appeal to the socialists. Because if I see the appearance of the Austrian Chancellor at Ceta, for example, then I would like us all to stand up for Ceta now and argue and convince and not criticize ourselves and then agree in the end. And last but not least, at Ceta it is important to take your worries seriously. That is why, Mr President of the Commission, we expressly support the initiatives for more defense: we want fair and good world trade. The second is Russia. The challenge is clear there too: Putin uses the military and war as a legitimate political tool. Hundreds of thousands in Aleppo are suffering from it. The answer should actually be unity and strength here too. But it was a weak answer that the European Council gave. Options were even given away unnecessarily that were actually in hand. What do we learn from it? Putin is sitting at the table in Brussels. Its propaganda, its economic interests - gas deliveries, energy policy - also affect the highest levels of government in the European Union. I think that's a shame. The only language Putin would understand, given his behavior over the past months and years, is the position of strength. And that's why I would expect more strength from the European Council. The only positive thing I have to say was probably the statement from Theresa May. Why? Because she shows now to the European public what it means to leave the European Union. People see all over Europe how big the economic damage in Great Britain is already. The people see that Scotland is thinking about leaving Great Britain. The Scottish Prime Minister is rethinking a new referendum in Great Britain, and we have in the leading party - the Tory party - an ongoing battle between Hammond and Johnson, and nobody knows the outcome. The country is split, and Theresa May shows to the whole European Union that it is better to reform the European Union and not to destroy the European Union.People more and more recognize what populism means, ladies and gentlemen, because even here in the European Parliament we saw in the last Strasbourg week what populism means.UKIP showed us the true face - one UKIP member punching another UKIP member to hospital and still, ladies and gentlemen ...

The Commission has put forward very, very good proposals on the defense instruments, which are important for the citizens to defend ourselves in a globalized world. We in the European Parliament are in a position to implement these proposals tomorrow and give good answers for the citizens, and in the European Council, among the Member States, we have a split, a blockade. And the same picture with regard to migration: the Commission - Dimitris Avramopoulos is here - has put forward good proposals on how we should answer the migration questions for Europe. We in the European Parliament have clear majorities for this, and in the European Council the citizens have only seen arguments among themselves for months. Europe is not failing - that is important to me and my group - unfortunately the national egoism that is leading Europe into a block is failing these days. Europe needs unity, determination and leadership. That would be the EPP's wish.

I am becoming convinced that some members of the European Council have not well memorized the joke of the cyclist President Romano Prodi who said: \"to ride a bicycle you have to pedal, if you don't pedal you fall to the ground\". This is Europe: to go forward you have to pedal. If the European Council does not pedal or pedal slowly, you will fall to the ground. And so it is happening. It also happened in the last Council. On Syria, our urgent request from Parliament for access to humanitarian aid has not yet been fulfilled. It is reasonable that sanctions have not been put in place, but we need to find a way, an instrument to stop that massacre. The efforts made by those countries that are defending the external border of the European Union and are welcoming thousands and thousands of refugees and migrants are well recognized. Well the institution of the Coast Guard to which President Juncker referred to which we, as Parliament, have given an important hand. However, the silence of the Council on economic issues should not be. In December, from Bratislava to Brussels, from Brussels to December the Council undertakes to discuss, to discuss the extension of the European investment plan, which I undertake to discuss. We want the commitment to approve the extension and strengthening of the European investment plan. It does not even go on the issue of relocations: this double standard of the right does not convince me, the Walloons are accused of stopping CETA and nothing is said to Orbán, who insists on no relocation. The position of the Walloons is a position of requesting clarification and I join the voices asking that in these hours we can reach those clarifications that can lead to the most progressive commercial treaty that we have been able to sign. There is no ideological position negative on CETA by the Walloons, there is a positive and constructive request for clarification, we are working in this direction, President Juncker, President Schulz worked on it and it is right to continue to work constantly so that we arrive at a positive solution . On immigration, I add, that we must put an end to \"save whoever can\", this story of the border, of border controls between Austria and Slovenia does not help Europe to find a common response to this challenge . And, I conclude, this Parliament must not be the Parliament of the brawl, it must raise its voice, but not among us on issues of goat wool, it must raise its voice to say \"stop Aleppo, the Aleppo massacre\", it must raise your voice to have fair trade, it must raise its voice to stop industrial crises, it must raise its voice to have a more expansive economic policy, it must raise its voice to give an answer to young people and women, it must raise its voice to give dignity to the European institutions and to the decision-making process, must raise their voices to give a smile to those children who hope for a better future!

Powerless to move or commit to decisions on some of the key issues facing the West and the EU right now, at a time when voters in all EU countries are asking questions of their political leaders. The EU has been defined in the past week by weakness and indecision. Why? We should ask ourselves: why is it so difficult to unite on these key issues? Why does a trade agreement like CETA fail at the last hurdle? The ECR Group is asking if the EU cannot even reach an agreement with a country such as Canada – a country with similar environmental and labour standards – what hope do we have of telling the rest of the world that the EU is open for business? Why could the 28 leaders not make progress? Because there is a fundamental disconnect between EU leaders and the people they represent. With greater centralisation, individuals and communities feel weaker. Here we use the language of compromise, coalitions, and semesters, but people outside want to know: will they have more money in their pay packet? Will they be able to pay their bills? Will the business they work for grow and create jobs? All too often these simple questions go unanswered. If leaders fail to address these concerns, fail to listen to the warnings, fail to make the case for decisions taken, then do not be surprised if voters in many of our countries turn to extremist parties offering simplistic solutions.  I realise that our countries have different histories, and perhaps different interests, when dealing with Russia. But responding to Russia’s current actions is something which should unite us, rather than divide us. When we see continued violations by Russia in Ukraine and Georgia, when we see the bombing of Aleppo and its people, when we see Russia biting at the heels of the EU’s external border, then the whole West should be uniting together in wanting to use what power we have. The EU only has soft power. But surely soft power should be better than no power. Economic sanctions are beginning to have an effect on Russia – but not nearly enough. Yet even at this point, leaders could not agree to go further. Now we see one EU country, Spain, offering to refuel that same Russian fleet that is likely to inflict more atrocities on the civilians of Aleppo. What kind of signal does that send about our resolve? At this rate we are facing a future of the lowest common denominator politics. We needed a summit of action, a summit of clarity, we needed a summit of decisiveness. Yet again, this is not what we got. It is time to open our eyes and see what is happening around us. Just as each action has its consequences, inaction also has consequences. Prime Minister Trudeau walking away from a Canada-EU trade deal which would have helped create jobs and growth. Putin walking into other countries unchecked and uninhibited. If this is the result of our inaction, do not be surprised if our electorate eventually punishes us. To counter the simple message of extremism, to regain the confidence of the people who vote for us, we need solutions, we need action, and we need a new direction, to break the gridlock that we currently face.

First, on CETA: the ALDE Group wants CETA to be salvaged, and if more time is needed then more time is needed. It is not the date, but the result, that matters. However, we cannot unpick the work that has been done, because trade is essential for our prosperity, and the credibility of the European Union – as has been said by others – has been severely damaged. The winners of this episode are not the Walloon farmers or the Walloon entrepreneurs; the winners are China, Russia and other countries, because they will get to set the standards, not Europe. Some parties in this House are actually welcoming the veto by Wallonia because they are against CETA, but that is a very dangerous kind of opportunism. Welcoming a veto when it suits your purpose will boomerang, because tomorrow a veto will be used against your priorities. The CETA episode exposes a much bigger problem, as I said: the weakness of the Council.  The EU cannot continue like this. If we look at the list of topics on the table, we have: sanctions against Russia – blocked; the Ukraine Agreement – jeopardised; CETA – blocked; refugee relocation – blown out of the water; the decision on Article 50 with the EU – kept dangling for nine months, and now one of the countries is threatening to veto the budget. We cannot continue like this. The EU is like a three-engine plane with one engine completely broken down. It is still flying, as the other two engines are still working, but it cannot stay on course until the Council engine is fixed.  Mr Tusk, please ensure that the European Union will not undergo the same fate as Poland in the 18th Century, when the Polish Parliament was completely paralysed by the ‘liberum veto’, allowing every single nobleman in the parliament to block a decision. As a result, Poland did not become greater; it became irrelevant. The Council has to take responsibility for the European Union as a whole and it has to do so soon, because not only will our own citizens tire of the inability of the EU to respond to the big challenges of today, but Europe is rapidly making itself irrelevant as a global actor. That has an impact and it has already been mentioned. The victims of the same inability to take decisions are the people in Syria. If the EU fails to decide on sanctions against Mr Putin, we lose any leverage we may have to force him to stop the bombing. We need a political transition urgently, and that means that we have to be able to put pressure on Mr Putin. Victims are equally the refugees, and I am actually a bit surprised to hear both the Council and the Commission be quite jubilant about the successful refugee policies, when the United Nations just yesterday said that 2016 is the deadliest year so far. More people have drowned in the Mediterranean than any year before. How can you say this is a success? How is it that the Council can still look at itself in the eye in the mirror and say this is a success? Mr Tusk, the Council – the Member State leaders – have a duty to end the paralysis, a duty towards the EU citizens and a duty towards the world.

The attacks and bombings of the Syrian regime and Russia in eastern Aleppo are rightly condemned. But there are no good and bad bombs. Equally barbaric and destructive are the bombs dropped by jihadists and insurgents in western Aleppo, which hit and even closed humanitarian corridors. Equally barbaric are the American bombs that kill civilians in Syria and Iraq. So stop turning a blind eye when your allies are waging war. How long will you keep silent when the Saudis kill innocent children and civilians in Yemen? gun violence and border forgery in the Middle East. Unfortunately, under the responsibility of the European Council, the European Union continues to hypocrisy, implementing the unacceptable agreement it made with Turkey, an agreement that violates international law and sets the conditions for the refugee trade. Instead of the Council and the Commission criticizing the Turkish government, which is constantly slipping into authoritarianism, for the daily violation of human rights and freedoms, for the invasion of Syria, for the intended Kurdish genocide, for the silencing of journalists and the war which he carries out against every minority, rewards it. It has recognized it as a safe country and promises rewards to keep refugees away from its borders. In fact, today, you want to release the visa, without Turkey fulfilling its obligations to all Member States. It is unacceptable Union to implement two measures and two weights. It is the result of these policies that has led to the worsening of the refugee crisis we are experiencing today. Unfortunately, the Commission and the European Council insist on increasing the border guards, strengthening Frontex, building new border fences, in the direction of a fortress Europe. It is with your own actions that the Balkan corridor was closed, but all you have achieved is to drown the refugees on the shores of Libya and off Lampedusa and not in the Aegean. These policies are not a response to the humanitarian crisis. They only succeed in reinforcing xenophobia and racism. What is needed is to develop a refugee policy based on solidarity and humanity, to create legal and safe routes for refugees and migrants, and a permanently binding and fair refugee relocation system. It is equally important to stop wars and foreign intervention in the wider Middle East and to really support the African states. And finally, as far as CETA is concerned: the people said \"no\" and with their struggles marginalized the TTIP agreement. What has been confirmed in recent days is that the Council and the Commission want to bring TTIP back through the back door through CETA.

Some here would like to see only the sign of a withdrawal into identity. Yet this anger first resonates as a cry of alarm in the face of policies that are increasingly moving away from the general interest. It is quite a symbol when the epicenter of the dispute is located in Wallonia, a welcoming land and one of the most pro-European and most united regions of the Union. All this concerns a free trade agreement with Canada, which was the main course - the expression is not stolen - of the European Council last week. This is not a coincidence: it has been three years in French-speaking Belgium, free trade agreements have become the number one subject of unprecedented citizen mobilization. Under this pressure, the French-speaking elected representatives of Belgium seized the CETA and dissected it as few have done in Europe. All this led in May 2015, at the initiative of the Greens, to a well-argued resolution, expressing very serious reservations with regard to a CETA designed to assert the supremacy of a chimerical right to profit over all other rights. as well as the power of companies, their shareholders and their leaders over the power of democracy. Far from being Europe's spoilsport, Wallonia has today become the representative of all the citizens who reject a trade policy in the service of multinationals. No, contrary to what some would have us believe, Wallonia is not isolated, quite the contrary. It should be remembered that 1,500 European cities and towns declared themselves outside TTIP and CETA, that 3,400,000 petitioners reject the arbitration project between investors and states, that a majority of Austrians, Germans, French and Slovenes are against CETA? Faced with this, the response of the Commission and the European governments was a four-beat waltz. There was first the denial by the lack of response to the letter from the Minister-President of Wallonia, who expressed the reservations of his Parliament. Then there was the condescension on the theme: \"If you do not agree with us, it is because you did not understand, we will explain it to you again\". Then there was the intimidation: Wallonia has two days to decide, Mr Tusk. Finally, there was the tinkering with a jumble of statements of dubious legal value that added confusion to opacity. The pressure put to lift the blockade of CETA by the Walloons contrasts sharply with the silence of the same vis-à-vis the blocking of certain Member States, some of which are much less populated than Wallonia - allow me to tell you - on, for example, the fight against tax evasion or financial regulation. Even more disgusting is the stark contrast in the decisions of the European Council last week, Mr Tusk. Between the frenzied free-trade bias and a migration policy whose key words have become repression and keeping at a distance. Thus, for the Heads of State or Government of the European Union, goods, services and finances must be able to circulate freely, but especially not human beings. A few weeks ago, before the failed Bratislava summit, you said, Mr Tusk: \"European citizens want to know whether the political elites are capable of regaining control of events and processes which overtake them, disorient them and, sometimes terrify them \". A few days later, in your State of the Union speech, Mr Juncker, you said you wanted a Europe that protects, preserves our European way of life and empowers our citizens. Gentlemen, therefore join actions with words; take this opportunity that Francophones in Belgium offer to the Commission and European governments; Remove from CETA all the mechanisms, foremost among them the arbitral tribunals, which aim to lock in the power of our democracies; assert their right to freely decide which activities will be entrusted to the public service and which will be entrusted to the market; finally, remove all doubts about the compatibility of this treaty with European law by referring to the Court of Justice of the European Union. Will it take time? Yes, it is the time of democracy. You know, for centuries we have traded with Canada without CETA. So do those few extra months matter? The Walloon surge must be the occasion, dear colleagues, not to put a stop to the trade policy of the Union, but to re-examine it, because most of our fellow citizens are not opposed to trade . In the 21st century, the objective of trade treaties cannot be the maximization of flows, because this is incompatible with environmental constraint. It cannot be profit maximization for a few, because that is not the role of politics. Their primary objective must be the dissemination of the strictest social, environmental, health, fiscal and democratic standards. It is these standards that set the binding framework within which trade can develop. Trade policy can no longer be decided in secret. On the contrary, mandates must be decided in full transparency and negotiations carried out under the permanent watch of elected officials. It is under these conditions, and I conclude, Mr President, that this trade policy will regain the confidence of our citizens. The Walloon no to CETA is a yes to a citizens' Europe.

It is the same treatment that David Cameron got when he came to announce the referendum, although at least this time the French President did not leave the table to go to the bathroom. When Mr Juncker was asked by a British journalist how the negotiations were going, he said, ‘Pffft’ – well, I can’t really do Gallic shrugs very well – and the impression is that you are simply too busy to even discuss Brexit or to take it seriously.  Basically, you are hoping that we will change our minds – Mr Tusk alluded to that a couple of months ago. I know there has been a long tradition here, whether it’s with Denmark, France, Ireland or the Netherlands, that when there is a democratic referendum you try to either ignore it or overturn it. Today again, we heard Mr Juncker urging the Dutch Government to ignore the referendum result on the Ukraine. Frankly, the whole thing is a disgrace. It is even worse that it is supported by quislings in the British Parliament – people like Nick Clegg and Ed Miliband, who are desperate to keep Britain inside this awful single market. Well, I am sorry but it simply isn’t going to happen. There are 17.4 million people who could not have been clearer. We voted to say that we want our country back, and in the end that is what is going to happen.  I have to confess, though, that Mrs May’s position in her five minutes was somewhat curious. For her to be arguing that Britain must have a full vote and a full say in all EU affairs up until the time we leave is a very mixed message, and I have already seen this morning that some here take it as a sign of weakness. We need to get on with it. Every single day that goes by is a lost opportunity. The proposed trade agreement with Canada having been vetoed by Walloons after seven years of negotiations absolutely proves to you that, in a modern 21st century global economy, the European Union is simply not fit for purpose. I want us to get on with it, because this club is very expensive. We are paying in net GBP 30 million every day. Some will argue it’s a bit less, some will argue it’s a bit more. Either way, it is too much. We are helping to finance this monthly travelling circus to Strasbourg and, worst of all, I have now discovered that in your staff regulations up to 5% of employees every year are allowed to retire five years early and receive full pay and entitlements for five years for doing absolutely nothing. Nowhere else in the world would allow this sort of thing to go on. So I want us to get on with it. Interestingly, I met a large number of Scandinavian businesses the other day. They are worried. They are anxious. And why? Because they know that the United Kingdom is the eurozone’s biggest export market in the world, and they want to crack on. They know that the EU has trade deals with several countries in the world which involve no free movement of people, and their logic is: if we can do a deal like that with Mexico, why on earth wouldn’t we do it with our most important trading global partner? That is common sense coming from European businesses and common sense coming from most people in the United Kingdom. The only obstacle appears to be the high priests of Euro—federalism in this room today. If you think that by delaying or stopping Brexit you are going to help your own businesses and your own industries, you are wrong. It is in the mutual interest of all of us to get on with this and conclude a sensible, straightforward tariff—free deal.

Once again, my dear colleagues, you are quite confused by a principle which you had misled for your exclusive use: democracy.

However, the treaty that you negotiated in great secrecy with Canada and which was supposed to come into force before it was even approved - which, you will admit, is quite scandalous - is not in the best interests Peoples. It would surely benefit a few wealthy multinationals but not the vast majority of citizens. An independent American study by Tufts University thus assesses its consequences: destruction of 45,000 jobs in France and 200,000 in Europe, fall in wages, reduction in the scope of public policies, fall in growth, rise in public deficits ... Don't say that the Walloons are blocking others. It's wrong! The reality is that they are just the only ones who could speak up. The rejection of CETA is largely in the majority, not because people are ill-informed, but because, on the contrary, they have opened their eyes to the disaster caused in Europe by ultraliberal free trade policies.

What did the overthrow of socialism and its conquests bring: unemployment, poverty, exploitation, wars, refugees, that is, capitalism. This is what history records today. That is why people pay dearly for the fierce competition of monopolies that is reflected in your European councils. That is why the European Union and the United States have set fire to a new war in Mosul over energy control, which is causing new waves of refugees trapped in miserable conditions, by your joint decision. The fight against the imperialist war and the immediate decongestion of the hotspots, the reception centers in the Greek islands, is urgent to allow the transfer of refugees and immigrants to their final destination countries. Concerning Walloon's involvement in CETA: this concerns who will have the upper hand in enforcing the standards that serve its profits to the detriment of its competitors. It is a controversy over the distribution of booty, which concerns new anti-labor measures, concessions of social services to monopolies, to act unhindered by crushing popular rights at work, health, education, protection of the environment. That is why CETA is approved by the SYRIZA-ANEL government. The people must fight to reject calls for a better or more transparent agreement and to fight for the withdrawal of CETA and TTIP and any other reactionary agreement, aiming to overthrow the real adversary - their monopolies, their unions and the very their exploitative system.

Europe is at risk - everyone has said that now - and it is at risk because we are unable to prove that we are solving the problems. At the moment this is clearly due to the inability to act in the Council - that's right - because national egoisms are decisive there. This is because most heads of state in the Council allow themselves to be determined by populist sentiments. I have to say that I can no longer hear that people always talk about European values ​​and when it comes down to it, for example in Syria and Russia, the flag is not shown. The Europeans not only have to talk about the fact that this is bad and terrible, but you also have to prove action. Otherwise it is not credible. Or: You can't talk about solidarity all day, and with Ceta it fails because of a small regional parliament. We can't do it with refugees because some states only think of themselves, and with others the leaders are unwilling to comply with existing rules. If Europe is not in a position to enforce what has been agreed, to implement it and to ensure that everyone adheres to it, then the shop can be closed. Sorry, that annoys me more and more that we let it get away with the fact that one Member State is currently saying: “No, we are not taking refugees”, or another is saying: “No, I promised 1.8%, but I'm doing it now I'm happy 2.3% ”, and nobody acts! If this continues, Europe will no longer be taken seriously, to put it bluntly. That is partly up to us, at the moment more with the Council, but partly also up to us, that we don’t complain here, but try to get the parts that we can fix. I am grateful that the President of the Commission has shown today that we must also deal with the issue of industry, that industry must be protected.

Let me make one point where I very much agree with the Council. The point is that we agree that what is happening in the city of Aleppo is a crime by the Syrian government against its own people. It is unacceptable that this is still supported by Russia or that it is actively accompanied and done. If, however, the European Council has decided to first concentrate all its attention on humanitarian measures that should bring urgent aid to the people in Aleppo and Syria, then I think that is right. The suffering of the Syrian civilian population must stop. This is what we want, and Russia should be about it too. But not only Russia, but also all other groups fighting there.

The Austrian Prime Minister should at least mention that his parliament voted against ISDS.

Last Friday in Geneva – and I am convinced you are fully aware of this – the UN Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, described the bombardment and siege of Aleppo as ‘crimes of historic proportions’. He referred to the lifeless bodies of small children trapped under streets of rubble. He called on the UN to speak as one single voice. I would ask the Council to do the same and say that the collective failure of the international community to protect civilians and to halt this bloodshed should haunt every one of us. Yes colleagues, I also believe it is unforgivable today to witness such a horror and to do so little – probably only speaking. Yes, no one could contest the complexity of the Syrian War – the past errors and the current ones, the many actors who are to be blamed. No one could contest our strong commitment in fighting Daesh and other UN Security Council-recognised terrorist groups. But no one can contest either the deliberate bombing of civilians, hospitals and humanitarian professionals in Aleppo by Russia. And no, the fact that there are potential extremist groups infiltrated is not an excuse for any one of us.

We have known for many years that in December this year there would be a change in our relation to China, and it was said not only by this House that we must react. I am surprised the debate is taking place only now.  Finally, on Russia, I guess even a few hours after the Council meeting we can see that we made a mistake, and that our policy does not work. It is costing lives and it is not getting us any closer to a solution. I do not want to remind you of the situation in Ukraine, which is tragic.

And it is necessary to make this very clear, because there was never a commercial agreement that had standards of social and environmental defense as good, as bold, as bold as CETA. I didn’t see anyone standing up here about the Vietnam agreement and in Vietnam there are problems with children and women and with working hours, there are problems with the environment, and nobody has any problems, but in Canada, where we we got an agreement that, at the moment, is a model for all the major trading partners in the world, we are here to undo that agreement. Therefore, I also draw attention to the agreement with Ukraine and our Dutch friends, because it is important to reinforce sanctions against Russia and there I am against the Portuguese Government, which now wants to end the sanctions against Russia, but what we what we can do to pressure Russia is to have a free trade agreement with Ukraine.

I encourage you to continue the Security and Defense Policy Summit in December and continue to Rome.

The point is that we in the European Union are increasingly only looking from our own lower level and not from above to see what effect this has on the whole.

But I can give you just as many points on other subjects. We need more awareness and an attitude that the effect is viewed as a whole and not the effect of the individual.

First of all, the migration issue: I share the concerns of all those who have raised their worries about what is happening in the southern Mediterranean. It is a tragedy that so many people are still drowning in spite of the tremendous efforts of the Italian authorities to save as many people as possible.  We need to have a comprehensive approach about this. Let me be very clear: better border protection is part of the answer, but it is not a panacea for the migration crisis. If we believe we can hide behind border and fences and rid ourselves of collective solidarity in this issue, we are being delusional. Delusional! Just imagine that in the next generation or two, the population of Africa will be anywhere between three and six billion people. How do you think the Mediterranean will ever be wide enough, or fences ever high enough to stop these people from coming to Europe if we do not have a policy that will offer them perspective in their own nations and their own continents, in their own cities and villages. So do not believe in the delusion of borders as the only solution to this problem and do not believe in the illusion that you can rid yourself of collective European solidarity in tackling this huge crisis. If you think you can rid yourself of the solidarity, others will rid themselves also of solidarity and that will be the end of the European Union. So I believe strongly in a collective approach and a comprehensive approach that addresses all the issues linked to the migration crisis.  On CETA let me just say one thing: if you believe, at the beginning of what I would call the 4th industrial revolution, that you can protect yourselves from not entering into agreements with parts of the world where they share our values, you are delusional.  Look at what is happening in the world’s economy, look how fast the world’s economy is changing. We need to have comprehensive agreements with those parts of the world which share our values, which want social protection like we do, which want environmental protection like we do. It is only together that we will face the forces of globalisation in a way that will guarantee the rights our citizens demand and I really call upon the Walloon Parliament to study carefully.  Mr Lambert said that it is the only parliament that has actually read the Treaty – well, I will leave that to his own judgment. I fear I do not agree with that assessment. But, if they read the explanations and the assurances that we have given, the clear indications on social protection, on environmental protection, on assurances that disputes will be dealt with by judges in a way that is in accordance with our legal criteria; if they have studied this perhaps they can come to a conclusion of this matter. It is clear to me – let me end on this point – that it is not an isolated matter that people worry about trade agreements. It is not an isolated matter that people sometimes think that building fences is an answer to our problem. It is an element in a world that is changing so fast that people fear that they have lost control of their destinies. Only by offering answers at a European level, so citizens feel that we can help them in a system in regaining control of our collective destiny, will we find solutions for global problems.

I have just a few comments. First, on CETA: many in this House have suggested that we should simply ignore the views of national parliaments on trade agreements and that the debate in Belgium and Wallonia’s resistance do not result from the belief that the competences of EU institutions regarding trade policy are too limited. Today people would prefer the state and national parliaments to have a bigger influence on the course of things – not smaller. Is it any easier to govern Europe thanks to this? No, of course it isn’t, but no one will change the fact that the EU is still the union of the states and not the institutions. When it comes to Russia, I have just one remark. The fears and concerns, for example on private arbitration, must be addressed, and they are being addressed and explained only now. I trust that after today’s talks in Belgium, the climate around CETA and maybe also around the next free trade agreements will change for the better. When it comes to Russia, I would like to say two things. First, we must keep unity in our relations with Russia. The building of EU unity is a difficult, not to say unaesthetic, process, but there is no alternative. If we want to be effective vis—à-vis Russia, we must stay united as the EU. (Applause) Second, at the European Council I backed those who were pushing for a stronger position on Russia’s role in Syria. The letter written by Verhofstadt, Harms and Weber was a real support for me. Thank you for your initiative. I want to say to those in this room who were the harshest critics of the European Council for not taking a sufficiently univocal position that they can help by doing the work both in their political families and in Member States. When it comes to migration, I have just one remark. I am absolutely aware that the situation in Greece remains critical. It is clear that it is too early to talk about success, but please just imagine what the situation on the Greek islands would look like if not for the decrease in the number of irregular migrants by 98% – not 9%, not 8%, but 98% – which we managed to achieve. This is the beginning of the process but this is the only way, also for the central Mediterranean route. This is why I am also starting to discuss the positive aspects of our activity.

So there was a lot of speculation over whether the French police were going to come into this building and arrest me. But the President of Parliament at the time said: no, that is not the case because the European Parliament, rather like the United Nations in New York, is an organisation whose buildings are extraterritorial.

First of all, matters involving Members of this House are governed by the House's Rules of Procedure. The rules of procedure of this House provide that Members of Parliament must adhere to minimum standards. According to our rules of procedure, one of the minimum standards is mutual respect. (Applause) The following incident has now occurred in the last plenary session here in this House: After leaving the Chamber, MEP Woolfe collapsed on one of the bridges in front of the Chamber and needed immediate medical assistance, including from Colleagues from this Chamber, who are doctors, was guaranteed; they helped him. Mr Woolfe was then hospitalized here in Strasbourg. The medical examination there revealed that the collapse was the result of an assault on his head. In plain language: the man was hit on the head. We then asked Mr Woolfe. Mr Woolfe described the matter to us from his point of view. I then passed the matter on to our so-called Advisory Committee on the Members' Code of Conduct. After hearing those involved, the Advisory Committee recommended that I refer the matter to the French Public Prosecutor's Office. I did this. Why? This is extra-territorial, but this extra-territorial area does not protect people from criminal prosecution when they commit crimes. That would be even better, and that also shows a strange understanding that you have.

There were also many voices to ignore the opinion of the Walloon parliament and to sign the agreement despite its opposition, as the remaining 27 countries consider it to be in favor. I disagree with either this criticism or the proposed solution. MEPs who demand a Europe of nations, \"less Europe\", need to understand that the consequence is perturbations in decision making, such as those under CETA. The direction of \"Europe of nations\" means the policy of the \"lowest common denominator\" criticized today and the need to equip the Council with instruments to facilitate negotiations. Secondly, I believe that the Council's decision to take into account the Walloon veto is right: this is the simple consequence of an earlier mixed-agreement decision. If other states or MPs consider the Walloons' decision harmful, they should persuade them to change their minds rather than pressure the President of the Council to ignore the rules of the game. The Council took the right decisions on the migration crisis, including on the conclusion of an agreement with Turkey and on increasing the protection of the EU's external borders.

The Commission adopted a letter of amendment on October 17th this year. In addition to the traditional update of the budgeted needs for agricultural spending and fisheries, this letter of amendment includes essential elements of the mid-term revision of the multiannual financial framework 2014-2020. This letter of amendment testifies to the fundamental networking between the 2017 budget and the revision of the multiannual financial framework. The European Parliament expects the Council to be able to speak on this letter of amendment at the latest by the beginning of the council. The European Parliament is determined to adopt the procedure for the 2017 budget and the revision of the multiannual financial framework by the end of the year. This requires a uniform negotiation. The European Parliament expects the Council to be accommodating in this regard.

The first thing we should look at is having a far bigger emergency fund: look at what has happened since we discussed the last MFF –the way migration has taken off and the funding required for that: nobody anticipated it a number of years ago. The same is true in agriculture: it is crisis after crisis, so we need a bigger emergency fund for that.

Urges to increase resources, reform the system of own resources, assess the new flexibility conditions of the new MFF, criticize the Council, ask to withdraw the \"rebates\" (discounts on contributions from more than 10 Member States to the European budget), give the possibility of reusing non-used resources and unity of the Union budget against intergovernmental funds.

For this reason, I voted in favor of the necessary mobilization of the European Globalization Adjustment Fund, which was created for similar situations. The Estonian economy has been shaken by developments in the global oil market and alternative and cheaper imports of products from outside the European Union. Estonia has met all the necessary criteria for support from this fund. I therefore voted to provide redundant workers with assistance of around EUR 1.1 million. More specifically, it will provide individual assistance and support in connection with further studies, training, counseling and contributions to transport and accommodation in self-development.

At the same time, several companies in Estonia were forced to lay off a total of 1,550 employees. These are mainly the consequences of the recent turmoil in the world oil market, but the situation is also linked to the general deterioration of Europe's position in international fertilizer trade and competition from non-European regions producing low-cost gas. The Union has recently been exposed to strong competition from China and has gradually lost its leading position in the global sale of chemicals, as this position is occupied by China. For these reasons, I agree with the release of more than EUR 1.1 million for the 800 redundant workers who will be involved in these measures.

It is fundamental to promote web accessibility for the greatest number of people.

By replacing a 15-year-old directive, we finally go beyond the contradictions of the Commission which with the xylella affair is showing many gaps in the management of emergencies. Yes, because, after having imposed simply impracticable measures to combat the bacterium, the Commission, through the voice of Commissioner Andriukaitis, has implemented an infringement procedure against Italy, denying it the possibility of carrying out an environmental impact assessment. The reason is that this would entail a delay with respect to the obligation to act immediately and therefore to eradicate hectares of olive groves, even secular ones. Environment Commissioner Vella, however, does not think so exactly. Responding to my question, he stresses that the plans for the eradication of harmful organisms to plants of agricultural interest must be subject to environmental assessment, thus not excluding emergencies. But in addition to this purely political quarrel, we should move on parallel tracks and therefore on the technical and scientific level, but we have on the one hand Italy, which for months has provided only information on the pathogen and on potential vectors, and on the other France, which was unable to provide evidence of any kind on its infected plants and which, after discovering that it was using a wrong test, unable to identify the xylella pauca strain, accuses Italy of contagion and also discovers , that in its territory a sub-species has already generated different strains, giving rise to well-founded suspicions of a long presence of xylella in French soil. I repeat, then, what I have been saying for months: let us standardize scientific research at EU level. Is the problem European? Here, then as such it should be treated. It is only a matter of time and more new outbreaks will be discovered.

Plant health is essential for plant production, forests, natural habitats and planted areas, natural ecosystems, ecosystem services and biodiversity in the Union. Plant health is threatened by species harmful to plants and plant products, the introduction of which into the territory of the European Union is currently at greater risk due to the globalization of trade and climate change. In order to combat that threat, it is necessary to adopt measures to identify and reduce to an acceptable level the phytosanitary risks posed by those pests. It has long been recognized that such measures are necessary. Criteria should therefore be laid down to identify the pests for which measures need to be adopted in order to prevent their introduction into and spread throughout the EU. Such pests are called quarantine pests in the European Union.

The Union must increase funding opportunities, in particular for SMEs, by making banks healthier and strengthening their ability to lend to the real economy.

It is estimated that 660,000 people die each year from heart and cardiovascular disease in the European Union, and industrial trans fats have been identified as the single most harmful ingredient. The Commission has an obligation to legally limit their share of food production, as the common market makes national measures insufficiently effective. Even large food manufacturers have realized this and are reducing the proportion of trans fatty acids in their products themselves.

The financial impact of the trans fat ban has been shown to be minimal in the countries that have implemented it, due to low enforcement and monitoring costs. The reporting labeling strategy would only affect certain foods, but not those that are not packaged or those served in restaurants. We also request that the Commission carry out a thorough impact assessment to assess the costs and benefits of different thresholds and specifically take into account the effects on SMEs.

Furthermore, Parliament emphasizes that many EU citizens, especially the most vulnerable, lack information on trans fatty acid trans isomers and their effects on health, which can hamper consumers' informed choice of products.

A similar conclusion was reached in a report published by the European Commission in December 2015: the most effective means of prevention may be a legal restriction on the content of industrial trans fats. Hungary was one of the first to regulate the highest acceptable level of trans fatty acids in foods in 2014, after Denmark and Austria.

Additionally, as TFAs tend to be used in cheaper foods, people with lower socioeconomic status are more exposed to foods with a high TFA content, which increases the risk of widening health inequalities.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1262, "date": "2016-10-26.json", "name": "Steeve BRIOIS", "mepid": "124757", "text": "in writing.- This motion for a resolution aims to limit the content of trans fatty acids in foods.Indeed, the latter induce risks for human health, in particular with regard to cardiovascular diseases, gallstones and diabetes.In addition, the report underlines the insufficiency of Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011 of 25 October 2011 concerning information to consumers on foodstuffs, in particular concerning the immediate identification of the trans fatty acid content, by readingof its labeling.I voted in favor of this text, which aims to protect the public from the risks associated with the consumption of foods with levels of trans fatty acids well above the maximum recommended standards.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "ENF", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1263, "date": "2016-10-26.json", "name": "Alain CADEC", "mepid": "96849", "text": "in writing. - Trans fatty acids are types of unsaturated fatty acids naturally present in foods derived from ruminants (milk, meat, etc.), in certain plants and products of plant origin and artificially in partially hydrogenated vegetable oils.

A similar conclusion was reached in a report published by the European Commission in December 2015: the most effective means of prevention could be a legal restriction on the content of industrial trans fats. Hungary was one of the first to regulate the highest acceptable level of trans fatty acids in foods in 2014, after Denmark and Austria. The regulation does not allow the placing on the market of foods with a trans fat content of more than 2 grams per 100 grams of total fat content.

Mandatory labeling, voluntary commitments by industry alone, do not provide sufficient protection for consumers. A similar conclusion was reached in a report published by the European Commission in December 2015: the most effective means of prevention could be a legal restriction on the content of industrial trans fats. Hungary was one of the first to regulate the highest acceptable level of trans fatty acids in foods in 2014, after Denmark and Austria. The regulation does not allow the placing on the market of foods with a trans fat content of more than 2 grams per 100 grams of total fat content. The Hungarian example has since been followed by Latvia. In the short term following the introduction of binding legislation, the proportion of foods containing trans fats above the legal limit has fallen significantly in the countries concerned, with significant public health benefits.

To that extent, this motion for a resolution is extremely pertinent and will represent a significant evolution in terms of promoting a healthier lifestyle, by impelling the community executive to adopt legislation that regulates the content and imposes the labeling of this type of acids in food products. .", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1376, "date": "2016-10-26.json", "name": "Tokia SAÏFI", "mepid": "4345", "text": "in writing.- I voted in favor of this resolution which calls for setting a limit for trans fatty acids for industrial foodstuffs.Heavy use of these trans fatty acids in industrially produced foods increases the risk of developing serious health problems.It is urgent that the European Union act, because these trans fatty acids, which come from industrial production, constitute a real danger for the health of European citizens, in particular by taking measures to correct the current labeling system which is currently under way.'is found to be ineffective.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 2, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1377, "date": "2016-10-26.json", "name": "Lola SÁNCHEZ CALDENTEY", "mepid": "125035", "text": "written. - At the end of 2015, the European Commission presented a report on the health problem posed by trans fats in food, but did not present the corresponding draft legislation.

A similar conclusion was reached in a report published by the European Commission in December 2015: the most effective means of prevention could be a legal restriction on the content of industrial trans fats. Hungary was one of the first to regulate the highest acceptable level of trans fatty acids in foods in 2014, after Denmark and Austria. The regulation does not allow the placing on the market of foods with a trans fat content of more than 2 grams per 100 grams of total fat content. The Hungarian example has since been followed by Latvia. In the short term following the introduction of binding legislation, the proportion of foods containing trans fats above the legal limit has fallen significantly in the countries concerned, with significant public health benefits.

While saturated fats in moderate quantities are essential for our body, trans fats should be completely eliminated from the diet. The intake of these fats is, in fact, associated with a significant increase in the risk of contracting cardiovascular disease, infertility, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes and obesity. TFAs are used in many industrial preparations such as confectionery and ice cream and are mostly used in cheaper foods, with the consequence that people with lower socio-economic status are more exposed to TFA intake.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Madam Vice-President of the Commission! First of all, I would like to take the opportunity to express my joy at being able to speak in this House again after two and a half years, albeit in a different, new role. This is my first time doing this in this new role. This has been done by my predecessor, Mr Vítor Caldeira, for the last eight years, who also helped prepare this annual report under his chairmanship. I would therefore also like to take this opportunity to thank him most sincerely for the work he has done and, of course, also my colleague, Lazaros Lazarou, who is the rapporteur in the Court and who, as rapporteur, was in charge of preparing this subject. But now to my lecture. Many citizens of the European Union are currently turning their backs on the Europe project. Why is this so? Because to some extent the European institutions have lost the trust of many EU citizens. The European Union will face the major challenge of regaining this confidence. The Court of Auditors will also have an important role to play in this. It is clear that we need further reforms. Whatever the form of these reforms, however, they must be based on stable financial foundations. According to the Court of Auditors, four elements are particularly important. Firstly, the European Union must keep accounts properly. How can people trust us if they are not convinced that we are taking good care of their money and keeping proper records and accountability? The 2015 EU annual accounts give a true and fair picture. However, the amounts to be paid this year and in the years to come are still very high. And the commission hasn't made a cash flow forecast for the next seven to ten years. Such a forecast would help rebuild confidence. I would also like to say, however, that the Commission's medium-term payment forecast is a first step in the right direction. Second, the European Union needs to ensure that its financial rules are properly followed. Although the inflows and outflows of the current European budget are precisely recorded, too many errors are still being made in the use of funds, especially in the Member States. According to our statistical calculations, the estimated error rate for 2015 is 3.8%. On the whole, it is as high as in previous years and continues to be above the materiality threshold of 2%. While the Commission has taken steps to improve its risk assessment and increase the impact of the corrective actions, we believe there is still room for improvement. It would be far better for European taxpayers if the Commission and Member States spent the money properly in the first place, rather than the laborious and time-consuming process of recovering it after errors were discovered. We can also reduce the error rate by improving the design of spending rules. Citizens cannot trust a system that they do not understand themselves. Legal foundations that are simple and clear, procedural regulations that are understandable lead to fewer errors. The more complex, the more mistakes - this is a principle that has been proven to be true every time it is checked. Now to the third element of sound financial governance. Our citizens rightly expect the European Union to ensure that funds are used as effectively as possible. They must feel that the European Union can offer them added value. Were at the European projects in the 2015 budget year have the funds used optimally? Were the project goals realistic from the start? Was the associated cost reasonable? Was the program or project more expensive or cheaper than it would have been if it had been carried out by another level of administration or government? These questions are difficult to answer until there are adequate reporting arrangements in place. There needs to be real incentives to get the most out of resources, not just to meet spending targets without breaking any rules. Even if all funds are correctly reported and all regulations are observed, this does not mean that EU-funded projects always and everywhere achieve a good cost-benefit ratio. If people cannot be sure that a system will be of use to them, neither can we ask them to trust that system. You need to see results and know the means by which they were achieved. This relationship, the value that is achieved through the use of resources - I would even say the added value - needs to be made much clearer. Trust also requires transparency and reliability as the fourth element of sound financial governance. The increased use of financial instruments that are not funded directly from the EU budget or that are not fully subject to our scrutiny increases the risks to transparency, accountability and coordination of European Union policies and actions. In terms of assurance, our audits not only provide independent assurance, but also result in recommendations for improving EU financial management. Incidentally, most of our recommendations are accepted and implemented by the Commission. In conclusion, to get back to the point: If we want to create an EU financial system that has the unreserved trust of the citizens, there is still a lot to do and to move. I call on all of us to do this.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1421, "date": "2016-10-26.json", "name": "Kristalina Georgieva", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission. – Mr President, I would like to start by joining President Lehne in acknowledging the work of his predecessor, President Caldeira, and the gratitude of the Commission for this work and then add our warm welcome to a partnership with the Court under your leadership. We have here the two rapporteurs, the rapporteur for Parliament, Mr Zeller, and the rapporteur for the Court, Mr Lazarou. Thank you for all the work you have done. I will start from where President Lehne ended, that we have work to do. We recognise that our responsibility to our taxpayers is, day-in-day-out, to make sure that their sacrifice, their money, is well spent. Also to say that we are committed and we are working very hard towards that objective to do better. The evidence, I believe, is in front of us. First, we had the Court of Auditors for the ninth year in a row giving a clean opinion on the EU accounts. We will of course continue to work hard to sustain that record. Secondly, while I agree with President Lehne that the error rate is still above the materiality threshold of 2%, for the first time in a long while it is under 4%, at 3.8%. It does not mean that we have succeeded, but it means that we are mobilising the Commission and Member States to do the right thing. Just for the record, it was 4.4% last year. Not a big difference, I agree, but it demonstrates an effort on the side of the Commission. There is also a positive story on the administrative expenditures, and it is an error rate of 0.8%, way under the materiality threshold of 2%. The Court found no errors in the transactions that have been examined on the revenue side of the budget. Again, it does not mean that we can relax, but it means that the Commission staff is doing a good job and deserves recognition for that. Next, the question is what we do next, and there our concentration in the Commission is to continue to bring down the risks of errors by focusing on a number of actions that I would like to highlight here. First, concentrate on where we have persistently high error rates – why? Understand the reasons and tackle these reasons. Second, apply good practice. When something works, like for example simplified cost options, spread them as far as we can go. Third, further efforts on simplification. The Court has told us so many times simple rules are easier to follow. In that context, just to recall that we have made a proposal for the midterm review and revision of the budget to also include revision of the Financial Regulation: the omnibus regulation that allows us to go further on this road to simplification. Of course, all these are actions that aim to prevent errors from going up and their actions to educate us. So prevention, which, as you said last time when you made a presentation, is much better than cure, is being pursued. But there has to be more, and where we go more is on the side of corrections. Corrections have been a very powerful tool, not only to claw back money that is not spent according to the rules but also to encourage compliance with the rules, because when you know if you do not follow the rules you will lose your money, you are incentivised to follow the rules. Last year we collected EUR 3.9 billion. This is the highest we have had. We also last year have done for the first time a careful examination of what we call ‘amount at risk at closure’. When all is being done in terms of corrective action, what percentage of the funding is at risk? I am very pleased to report that, when all is done, the amount at risk at closure for 2015 is somewhere between 0.8% and 1.3%. Of course, we know that this is not the error rate measure, but I believe it is important to look at the end after implementation of multi-year programmes carefully. Finally, value for money. Value for money, as President Lehne said, is not just to follow the rules. We have to walk on two legs – follow the rules and focus on results. What is it that we get? A road built with zero error that goes to nowhere is 100% waste of money. This is why we are complementing our work on compliance with what we call ‘budget focus on results’. I will conclude by saying that we also believe in what the Court has been asking us to do to improve reporting. This year we have introduced the first integrated financial reporting package – much easier to follow. You actually can give a brochure to people, who can read and understand what on earth we have done: where the money comes from, where the money goes, how we control it. We will continue in that direction, counting on the Court to push us forward.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1422, "date": "2016-10-26.json", "name": "Joachim ZELLER", "mepid": "96762", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, dear President of the Court of Auditors, dear Klaus-Heiner Lehne, dear Lazarou, dear Vice-President! Dear Mr Lehne, first of all, thank you very much - in addition to congratulating you on your election as President of the Court of Auditors, of course - for the cooperation that has been shown so far, both with the members of the Commission and with the members of the Court of Auditors at the start of the budget discharge procedure for the Commission for 2015. The Court of Auditors has presented an opulent work of around 300 pages, which the audit report for the 2015 financial year includes. Together with the many special reports that the Court of Auditors regularly sends us, this is a very good basis for our further work. I mean, not only in the Committee on Budgetary Control, but I also recommend these documents to my colleagues in the specialized committees, because they are just as affected by them. It cannot just be the job of the Court of Auditors to establish the numbers. The European Court of Auditors found an error rate of 3.8% for the past financial year - a decrease compared to 2014. That is correct, but - the President of the Court of Auditors also pointed out - the materiality threshold of 2% has not been reached. However, it is more important for me to emphasize that the error rate determined every year is not synonymous with fraud or - as voices critical of the EU like to proclaim - with a waste of taxpayers' money. Of course, we keep seeing cases of poor project execution and even fraud, which, moreover, are, without exception, prosecuted by the anti-fraud authority OLAF. In most cases, however, we encounter formal errors, incorrect tenders or the billing of ineligible costs. I don't want to downplay the importance of such mistakes. However, the Court of Auditors has once again found that a large number of these errors could have been prevented if the Member State authorities had used the information available to them in good time. We should also make this fact clear to our citizens. Instead of having to repeat our recommendations and criticism from year to year, we should also focus together on effective error prevention. Unfortunately my two minutes have already been exceeded. But we still have a few weeks of work ahead of us, and we will be able to discuss all the other points that I have noted here.

This is that a long, seven-to-ten-year, cash flow forecast is needed. The Commission was requested to prepare this, but still has not done it. Short-term cash flow forecasting by the Commission, to ensure that that the immediate payment obligations of the EU can be met, is not enough.  Finally, as you can see, amounts to be paid in the current and future years remain at a high level. The Commission made a high level of commitments in 2015, consisting in part of appropriations brought forward from 2014. Amounts to be funded from the future budget rose to EUR 339 billion.

The report itself makes important observations regarding the sharing of money from European funds, to which citizens of all 28 Member States contribute, and should therefore be vital. At first sight, the report's conclusions in terms of legality, regularity and error are not significantly different from those of previous years. But I still perceive one difference very strongly. It is a trend to take into account, in addition to the factual correctness in drawing European funds, also the added value of individual projects and investments. In this spirit, I also drafted my report on last year's performance of the European Commission for 2014, and I appreciate that this effort is intertwined in small steps into other activities of all European institutions. This time, in the Court's report, this results-oriented approach was widely used in Horizon 2020, the largest of its kind in the world. This program concerns the field of science and research, where results are expected almost automatically, as support is directed to high-quality and high-level projects. In future reports from the European Court of Auditors on the Commission's management, I can imagine that budget chapters will not only be assessed in terms of error rates, but will also take into account or use integrated and comprehensive result indicators. Evaluating the effectiveness of projects, taking into account results and performance, is a new way forward. The priorities to be funded from the European budget change significantly over time, as do the conditions around us. And using the budget must respond to them. Drawing needs to be more flexible, focused on European added value, undoubtedly simpler and even more results-oriented, and not just on paper. If our common goal is, in particular, the added value of every euro invested, we must change the established rules (drawing and controls) and set new ones, corresponding to the real needs of 21st century Europe.

I think we all realize that that is bad for the image and that we need to find ways to deal with it.

I hope we can work well together. The figures in the debate have already been mentioned. An error rate of 3.8 percent, much too high. I agree with what Mr De Jong says about this. But a second element is that the Court's report also states for the umpteenth time that the corrections could have been much greater than the Member States, for all those cases where there is shared management between the Member States and the Commission, made use of the information available to them. Without those corrections, it would have been 4.4 percent, but if they had used all that information, that figure could have gone down from 3.8 percent. Hence the need for action. I think that one of the elements is naming and shaming Member States that go wrong, that are not doing their job. This is discussed in detail in the Court's report. We also see a lot of examples and I think that's a good thing. Second element, Mrs Georgieva has emphasized it very explicitly: spending money, correctly and on time, that is one thing, but getting value for money, getting value for money, that is another matter. I am very pleased, Mr Lehne, that you and your colleagues and all your staff are also paying particular attention to this in this report by the Court of Auditors. Are the objectives realistic, were the costs reasonable, was there sufficient output? Finally, a third matter. We see an increasing use of financial instruments. The Court cannot audit those instruments. That means that it entails a danger, a danger of cheating and carelessness.

That is comedy. This is reality. The reality is that the Court of Auditors, for the 21st year in a row, has issued an adverse opinion on the legality and regularity of the payments underlying the accounts of the European Union, which of course would be a very serious thing indeed in accountancy circles. If any business found that they had an adverse opinion on anything to do with their accounts at all, it would be treated very seriously indeed by the authorities if that happened time and time again. The reality is that the error in the European Union budget is still at a level of 3.8% of the budget, which is far above – almost double – the 2% materiality threshold. That is just, of course, the errors that we know about. The reality is that we are not at a point where value for money is being properly assessed. I think Commissioner Georgieva is absolutely right when she says that if there were a road to nowhere but it had zero error, that would not make it value for money. I think what we have seen from this Court of Auditors report is example after example: whether it is the EUR 3 500 on the panoramic spyglass, the EUR 10 000 donation to a church, the EUR 4 000 mountain bike, the building materials in Slovakia that were charged for at six times the going rate, or the EUR 100 000 on dry stone walls with no link to EU expenditure. The reality is that there are a lot of things that are going on here which certainly do not in any way, shape or form provide value for money. I would say normally that a report like this would put the European Union on notice to improve or to risk losing support. I do believe that is what the Commission is genuinely trying to do, but this has happened over and over again now. We are on year 21. I think this kind of thing is not the only reason for Brexit – far from it – but it is part of the package and, if this carries on, the UK will not be the only country heading out of the exit door. ‘Groundhog Day’ is romantic comedy.

If the level of error is not an indication of fraud, inefficiency or waste, what does it reveal? The Court says that this is an incorrect estimate of the payments because the amounts paid were not used according to the rules. How is it possible? Even if the errors are less important from one year to the next, the fact remains that 5.5 billion euros escape rigorous control and monitoring. It's not nothing. If it is not a human problem or an accounting problem, it is therefore a problem of operation and general architecture. Of all the institutions, the Court of Auditors is the one that functions the best, but it is clear that not all the institutions can say the same. We must therefore rethink the general architecture and get out of an institutional and accounting scheme that no citizen of Europe understands any more and that the institutions - and you show the proof - themselves find it difficult to apply. The confidence of the people is inversely proportional to the opacity of our operating rules and to their lack of transparency. Subsidiarity, freedom and transparency should lead Europe to move forward with its nations and around its nations, without trying to impose everything and complicate everything with opaque rules.

It is also a fact that the Union's bureaucracy, which is difficult to see, obviously also contributes to the loss of confidence. Part of this bureaucracy is budget management, which may be difficult to review. The European Court of Auditors reports that in 2015, the Union's total budget expenditure was € 145 billion. This means that every European citizen spends 78 cents a day on the Union. We can decide whether it is a lot or a little.

First of all, I would like to thank you once again for the congratulations, which have been expressed by many, and also for the words of praise. Allow me to make a few comments for clarification, including on what has been said. I believe that if you look back at the development of EU finances over a period of 20 years, then an enormous amount has been achieved through the cooperation between the Court of Auditors, Parliament and the Commission. When we talk about an error rate of 3.8% today, that is still too much objectively. But compared to the conditions that prevailed towards the end of the 90s, this is a huge, a huge step forward, if I can say so clearly at this point. That is a joint effort that has been achieved here. It is still a long way from where we have to go, but it is already tremendous progress that has been achieved over the last 20 years. It is also correct, Mr Zeller mentioned, that the number of cases of fraud we uncovered - but when I speak of uncovered, that does not mean that these are finally resolved cases, but that there was only sufficient initial suspicion during the audits that we did for this exam year - exactly twelve - the number12 - was. The cases have, of course, been passed on to OLAF directly and I assume that OLAF will investigate these issues intensively and, where the facts of fraud become established, will also draw the appropriate conclusions from them. EUR 5.5 billion - it cannot be said - has not been wasted. EUR 5.5 billion was not spent according to the rules. That's a huge difference. It is nowhere near the same. We have complex and complicated regulations in this European Union - everyone knows that. All of you sitting here are involved in deciding on these rules. Mistakes happen - too many, no question about it. But mistakes also happen because of the complexity of these rules. But that does not mean that the money that was then spent was actually spent pointlessly. They were just issued incorrectly. Our audit as part of the annual report now focuses on the review of so-called compliance. We are forced to do this according to the contract, we have to do it according to the contract, to check the legality and the mathematical accuracy. Such errors are discovered and they are then taken into account in the error rate and in our reporting. I think that this is once again a very necessary and clear clarification. However, we are of the opinion - and I already said that in the speech, and I believe that is also evident from the report - that it is also the task of the Court of Auditors not to deal solely with the issue of compliance, but also with the question of performance, and that the aspect of performance is becoming increasingly important. The Vice-President of the Commission pointed this out, and many of our special reports also show that it does not help if a road or a port or airport is built correctly, but the building actually makes no sense. This is something that has to be taken into account and addressed to a far greater extent in the context of the examinations so that such things no longer happen in the future, but that the funds are not only spent correctly but also sensibly. That is why a particular focus of the audits and the Commission's activities must also focus on this aspect. On the subject of transparency: that has been mentioned several times, that is really one of the central points. I fully understand the political needs in view of the enormously rigid European budget, which has basically been laid out relatively inflexibly for seven years, so that when new challenges arise, politicians suddenly have to decide to find new sources of finance, new ideas and new instruments with which to approach these challenges. But we must never lose sight of the fact that this constant creation of new financial instruments does not contribute to clarity, that this of course also entails risks, that it does not contribute to transparency. So we must not lose sight of the fact that at some point in the future - I hope in the not too distant future - we will have to bring everything back together under one roof so that transparency is ultimately maintained. I don't need to say anything more about the topic of added value. We actually want to include more qualitative elements in the evaluation and we also expect the Commission to take these qualitative elements into greater account. For the sake of simplicity, this has been raised by Mr Liberadzki, Mr Ashworth and Mr Valli: this is a very crucial point. I'll say that again here: simple rules are better. But if they are too simple i.e. That is, if they no longer allow control in terms of meaningfulness and performance, they also make no sense. That is, the simplification of the rules has to go hand in hand with a stronger examination of efficiency and what really comes out of it in the end. This is a key requirement for simplification. Both must happen and happen in one step. Mr. Zdechovský and Mr. Marinescu pointed out that there have been positive developments in the past, and rightly so. Regarding Mr Pirinski's comment and what Mrs von Storch said, I would just like to point out that we will be delivering our position on both the mid-term review of the multiannual financial framework (MFF) and the EFSI in the next few days and weeks . I don't want to say anything about that now, you can read it when it's finished. Regarding Ms. Schmidt's comment: The selection of samples is an internationally recognized method; they are chosen at random. I believe there is no doubt about that on the part of experts and specialists. I am very grateful to Mr Šoltes for emphasizing the role of the Court once again. He himself has relevant experience through his professional experience and work in this area. It really is like this: It is our job to put our finger in the wound, to identify risks as early as possible, to describe problems, but always with the aim of ultimately drawing conclusions from them and improving the situation. And again, when I look back into the past: At the moment the steps are of course slower and harder. But when I look back into the past, I do believe that clearly positive changes can be identified over a medium-term - also long-term - period. I think, for the sake of honesty, it is also part of saying this here.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1458, "date": "2016-10-26.json", "name": "Ioan Mircea PAŞCU", "mepid": "33984", "text": "The debate was closed.Written declarations (Rule 162)", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1459, "date": "2016-10-26.json", "name": "Julia PITERA", "mepid": "124898", "text": "in writing. - The European Court of Auditors is responsible for auditing the finances of the European Union.

For many weeks this girl, working in Libya, in order to reach the agreed sum, was forced to be sexually abused and exploited until she was finally able to get on this boat to reach the island of Lampedusa.

In September 2013, Parliament adopted a report on the situation of these unaccompanied minors. More than three years ago, as rapporteur, I proposed and called for the adoption of a real strategy, real measures and minimum common standards, the need for which I stressed in order to protect these children properly. Almost nothing has been done since. At the time, there were 13,000 unaccompanied minors and we were already denouncing the urgency of the situation. Today, 96,000 unaccompanied children have arrived in Europe and, naturally, we have no more strategy and no more adapted responses. Realize, Commissioner, that the images of these lonely and frightened children who are the prey of networks participate in the risk of collective disaster which threatens our Europe. I want to highlight three points. First, Commissioner, we need a comprehensive strategy for unaccompanied children. However, in the European agenda on migration, the word \"children\" appears only once to indicate that the action plan is being followed up. I'm asking you where this follow-up is. Second point, relocation. I appeal here to the Member States of the Union which have committed to relocating 160,000 refugees from Italy or Greece. We all know that this is clearly not the priority of states since today only 6,000 people have been relocated since last year. Among them, only 75 unaccompanied minors were relocated. It's a shame! I don't even understand how this can be possible. Third, Dublin. We cannot ignore the current revision of the Dublin regulation, an unfortunate revision not in itself, but by the elements which are envisaged therein.

Last year, our group visited refugees in several countries. Most of them were almost always children. Most of them have never seen the inside of the school or for years. They live in camps, on streets, in demolished houses, in slums, but also in deportation prisons like in Turkey. The IOM estimates that 15,000 children have been lost between 2014 and July 2016. Lost - that is missing, dead, drowned in the Mediterranean, died of thirst in the Jordanian desert, lost on the Balkan route, sold to Da’esh, sausage by organ dealers in Kosovo. There is no protection, no help whatsoever for children on the run. And if they are unaccompanied, then they are completely on their own. That is true for 100,000 children in 2015. And the fact that there are no legal routes to Europe exposes these children to existential threats to life and limb. The EU, which always boasted so full of the Nobel Peace Prize, fails miserably here. And no matter how you feel about refugee policy, how you think about it, it doesn't matter: You can't let these children down. We have a humanitarian duty to help these children. We, as the United Left Group, demand the creation of a humanitarian corridor that allows children to enter the EU legally. No child belongs in a deportation prison, no child may simply be deported. We demand that these children have a legal right to rapid family reunification. We require that unaccompanied children receive free legal assistance. We demand that refugee children be given equal rights to children in the Member States in all rights. In conclusion, I will say: these children cannot wait, especially since winter is just around the corner.

There are more and more children coming to Europe, and they are younger and younger: 80 000 only this year, out of which 70 000, according to UNHCR, are accompanied minors. Behind every number there is a tragedy. There is a heart-breaking story. Children are now trafficked, abused, exploited and exposed to terrible suffering. It is happening in Europe today. We have an emergency of more than tens of thousands of children that are going missing. They are running away from reception centres and becoming victims of organised crime. The police, the judiciary, law enforcement authorities have to prioritise children. We need better rules for cross-border cooperation, better cooperation with Europol, better interoperability of the databases, and yes, welcome to the Commission proposal to reduce the age of fingerprinting from 14 to 6, because it is a way to bring the children and to keep the children into the protection system. And that is our duty: to make sure they enter the protection system and to build the trust, to make sure that they remain in the protection system, not by detaining them. Arbitrary detention of children should not have a place in Europe. Still we do not have zero tolerance for impunity for abuse of children in Europe, and it is about time that we build this policy. Children should be identified, registered and given the right to ask for asylum. Member States should accelerate the procedures for granting asylum for children. Fast-tracking, relocation and resettlement programmes should be giving priority to children. I want to conclude by saying that I met, in Sweden, Afghan children, in an organisation they have themselves built, helping each other. Let us start to change the rhetoric.

We saw some of the first children brought from Calais to the UK only in the last few days, where they were greeted by the press saying: ‘My God, these do not look like children’. So you think, well, how do you expect a child who spent two years walking from Afghanistan to get to the border of France to look? Not exactly like the 13-year-olds, for example, that we might see in our own classrooms and our own streets.  What we have seen at Calais, and I think we have seen in a number of other places, has been a deliberate foot-dragging by the authorities, even to work with the Dublin system to reunite those with families. We see a lack of dedicated staff for dealing with under-18s. We see children who are identified by NGOs such as Safe Passage, who are then lost by the authorities because they have really got no system to deal with them. We see a lack of support to local authorities who are willing to accept unaccompanied minors, to provide them with school places and foster care. We see a lack of support for family members who may, for example, be not in a good situation to take on their young family members themselves.  How do you feel as a 24-year-old living alone when you are suddenly asked to look after your 14-year old brother that you last saw 10 years ago? We know that there are significant issues around guardianship and child protection. We have known that for years in this House. We know it for children from Europe themselves, as well as for those coming in. So is the Commission satisfied that the new asylum proposals provide a genuine framework for looking after those children from the moment of their arrival to determination of status and beyond?

Le vostre parole parlano al nostro cuore e ora vi comunicherò quello che penso. Thank you for scheduling this very timely debate, because it is really very timely. Let me assure you that the protection of children in the context of migration and the current refugee crisis is central to our overall migration policy, both for their short-term as well as their long-term needs. The Commission, as you will remember, announced in its communication of 10 February 2016 a comprehensive approach to the protection of all children in migration, including unaccompanied minors. These actions are geared towards strengthening child protection systems in the Member States and are now being implemented. The Commission will also evaluate and report by the end of this year on the implementation of the 2010-2014 Action Plan on Unaccompanied Minors. All our efforts are concerted to address the complex and urgent issues that need to be resolved to ensure the adequate protection of migrant children arriving in Europe. Member States must ensure that they are capable of respecting the rights and meeting the needs of children in migration and addressing several gaps. These gaps include: providing adequate reception conditions, including psycho-social care; prevention of children going missing, and ensuring adequate responses in case they do; effective guardianship; access to information; access to legal counsel and assistance and other procedural safeguards and procedures, such as Dublin transfers and family reunification; and the use of arbitrary administrative detention and inappropriate detention conditions. Let me remind you that detention is never the objective, but can only be a last resort. The Commission is acting to address all these gaps. The recent legislative proposals to reform the Common European Asylum System include stronger provisions on the protection, care and procedural safeguards for children. These new proposals aim at strengthening the protection of children, including those who are unaccompanied. They address key areas such as ensuring adequate reception conditions, ensuring access to specialised services and education for migrant children, ensuring psycho—social support for victims of trauma, and speeding up family reunification procedures. Nevertheless, more needs to be done to ensure that alternatives to detention are available and used, and to ensure the expansion of family-based care, such as foster care, for unaccompanied children. With regard to family reunification, our Dublin proposal provides for clear and precise rules and will enhance the efficiency of the system significantly without compromising any essential safeguards. The procedures will be shorter, and current shifts of responsibility between Member States will no longer be possible. It also broadens the concept of ‘family members’ to include the applicant’s siblings. One of the main gaps has been on effective guardianship, where we have seen long delays in appointment and guardians being assigned unworkable caseloads of up to 1 000 children. Our asylum reform proposals address this issue. I count on your support and that of the Member States to agree on these reforms, so we can ensure these safeguards in reality as soon as possible. In addition, the recent Action Plan on Integration Actions addresses education for children in migration. For children in reception centres our asylum reform proposals aim at further strengthening a child’s right to access to education, including if they are in detention. Under the Emergency Support Instrument, targeted funding is allocated to additional education activities for children. Outside the European Union, EU funding has been made available to programmes for vulnerable Syrian refugees and host community children and adolescents. According to the Council decisions on relocation, applications made by unaccompanied children and vulnerable persons shall be prioritised. Despite this, so far very few unaccompanied children have been relocated from Greece and very few Member States have made places available for them. To date, no children have been relocated from Italy. In our recent report we have also raised this issue. As you know, the Commission is monitoring the situation in Greece and Italy very closely and is in continuous dialogue with Member States, urging them to make pledges to relocate unaccompanied children. Finally, to foster a discussion between those working in asylum and migration and those working in child protection, the Commission is dedicating the 10th European Forum on the Rights of the Child on 29 November 2016 to the protection of children in migration, where there will also be a dedicated side meeting on the guardianship of unaccompanied children. As I said at the beginning, protecting the most sensitive and the most vulnerable in this refugee crisis – and those are indeed children – is of paramount importance to the Commission. It is one of our priorities. But it needs many more stakeholders and actors involved to make this happen. The Commission counts on the European Parliament as its partner on this. I would like to close by saying that this is not an issue that should in fact be debated. It is an issue that should simply be addressed, urgently and jointly.

I am convinced that we can have a situation where we are humane with those in need of protection, but firm with those who are not eligible. This careful balance must be the basis of any policy and I am happy to debate this at any time. But when it comes to children, politicians do not have the luxury of time.  The anguish of parents who pack a little plastic bag and send their children, often alone, on rickety boats, to Europe, knowing the dangers – but who do it anyway because even a small chance of a better life for their child is better than the certainty that awaits them if they stay behind – is almost unimaginable. The truth is that often those children who survive the journey find themselves in no man’s land, alone, vulnerable and easily exploited. The statistics are heart-breaking; thousands of children have gone missing, but only 46 unaccompanied minors have been relocated – forty-six. Yes, we need to make sure that no one abuses loopholes in our system; and yes, we need to ensure that proper age determination is carried out; but states cannot turn their backs.  We need our responses to improve, and we are calling for a series of measures to protect children, including quicker processing times, improving guardianship and access to education, ending arbitrary detention, and getting children reunited with their families. We can do better, and we must do better, because it is true that, as one famous poet put it, no one puts their child in a boat unless the water is safer than the land.

The first category is the one that needs real help, since they leave their country against their will, with measures that will ensure care and human living. Their education should be in the language of their country of origin and following its educational system as much as possible. In addition, we must make every effort to end the situation that forced them to become refugees, so that they can return to their countries an hour earlier. In the second category of minors, and provided that their migration has been done through legal channels, it is the responsibility of the parent, who chose to drag his child in this adventure, to take care of his well-being. Immigration of minors should not be allowed, as changing the country of residence is a very serious choice that no one should impose. Minor illegal immigrants must be provided with a humane and dignified life until they are repatriated to their countries of origin as soon as possible so that they can be reunited with their families.

From what the Commissioner has said here, I think that the Commission should place more emphasis on the fight against organized crime, where children are the victims of organized crime. It has been lost several times here, thousands of children have been lost, unfortunately sad statistics, and more needs to be done to make the European institutions, the judiciary and individual Member States more combating this extremely dangerous crime, so that EU interior ministers can talk more about this. their advice so that this topic does not fit. The topic of the asylum procedure was also mentioned here. I personally believe that children need to have specific conditions. In short and well, the return policy of children to their countries of origin is, in my view, very ethically difficult, especially if the child spends several months or years in Europe and should suddenly be returned. The European Commission should, rather than debate the centralized asylum procedure, address how to enable children who have been in Europe for some time to stay in Europe, how to integrate them into European society and to educate them. I think this is the most appropriate and best we can do for them.

Beyond the issues of relocation and identification procedure, which must be ethical and compassionate, we must ensure access to education and put in place mechanisms to support and heal children who are very often experiencing immense suffering and trauma, often resulting in serious mental health issues. This must be done by taking into account the special needs of children with disabilities and young women and girls. I also want to highlight the role of non-formal and informal learning, including sport, volunteering, arts and culture, which by providing safe spaces for intercultural dialogue and exchange not only facilitate the social inclusion of refugee children into their new communities, but also address stereotypes, prejudices and discrimination in the host countries.

The military campaign to retake Mosul is a critical step in defeating Daesh as a military force and bringing an end to Daesh rule, which has had such disastrous consequences for the people of the region and continues to pose a threat to all of us. The crimes and the atrocities committed by Daesh, including the killings of innocent civilians in and around Mosul over the past days, are a reminder, if a reminder was needed, of the complete depravity of this organisation. Whilst over the past days there has been progress in the military campaign, we need to be aware that this is an extremely complex operation which will need endurance, perseverance and pressures. There are bound to be setbacks. Many fears and concerns have been expressed about the conduct and consequences of the campaign. These are real and valid concerns, and they require all of us to watch the events on the ground closely. At the same time, there are two reasons that give me cause for cautious optimism, at least in this opening phase of the campaign, which I would like to share with you. The first is that the military campaign is based on comprehensive planning and coordination between the Federal Government, the Government of the Kurdistan region and the global coalition. This has led to improved political ties between Baghdad and Erbil. It has seen the Iraqi army enter Kurdish territories for the first time in 25 years with the full agreement of the Kurdistan region. This was unimaginable even a few months ago. The second reason is that we are confident that the Federal Government, under Prime Minister Al-Abadi, has taken on board the message concerning the need to protect civilians and for the Iraqi army to enter Mosul as a liberator, not as an occupying force. Not only that, it is now the Iraqi Government which is the most vocal advocate of the protection of civilians with government instructions to its forces and to the United Nations and the humanitarian community, reflecting their approach. This helps to explain why the Shia militia, with the Pershmerga, have been ordered to keep out of the campaign for the city centre. It is the national institutions of the Iraqi army and the federal police, backed by Sunni tribes, that will fight for the city. Again, a year ago this seemed an unlikely scenario but, as I said, we need to keep a watchful eye. You are all aware of the humanitarian situation and concerns about massive displacement. The way hostilities are conducted will have a huge impact on the safety of the citizens of Mosul, on the perception of the campaign, on civilian infrastructure and on returns and reconciliation. We also need to bear in mind that the behaviour of both Daesh and the militias is inherently unpredictable and will need to be managed as the campaign develops. Currently, the European Union is ensuring the delivery of principal life-saving humanitarian assistance for all civilians most in need, whoever and wherever they are. This is our top priority. To date we have allocated EUR 134 million to respond to the needs of Iraqi internally displaced persons. Equipment is pre-positioned and humanitarian contingency planning has been done jointly with the Iraqi Government and the United Nations. We are also ready to respond to stabilisation challenges that post-Daesh Mosul poses. Stabilisation after the military campaign is as important as the military campaign itself. One area in which the European Union is very proactive is the removal of improvised explosive devices, which is a precondition for the return of the internally displaced people. I am confident that Daesh will be defeated on the battlefield, but we can only defeat extremist ideology by addressing root causes which have given terrorist groups a foothold. In Iraq non-inclusive policies have allowed Daesh to flourish. Therefore, we need to help Iraq in rebuilding an inclusive, peaceful, multi-ethnic and multi-religious society trustful of its state institutions. Inclusiveness, national reconciliation and the rule of law are essential. On regional dynamics, Iraq’s relations with its neighbours are crucial. We are strongly in favour of dialogue between all countries of the region. This is essential as we focus on the primary task of fighting and defeating Daesh in an effective way. Looking ahead, it is our collective moral responsibility to remain a strong partner of Iraq during these difficult moments. Iraq needs all the help we can give at this critical moment for the country’s stability. If we do not do our utmost to help now and ensure that Mosul is both liberated and then stabilised, we will have a much worse situation to deal with, which will have knock-on effects for all the neighbours. The Council has therefore been looking at what more the European Union can do in Iraq. I call on the Parliament to continue to support all the strands of EU actions, to tackle in a comprehensive manner the multiple causes and consequences of the crisis.

Today we all share the anxiety when it comes to the humanitarian situation in northern Iraq and the risk for extensive loss of lives. In these difficult times we have a responsibility to assist fellow human beings and support a peaceful transition. For centuries Mosul has been a multi-ethnic city which has surrounding areas like the Nineveh Plain. But let us be clear: without international commitment and a European strategy, sectarian conflicts might replace the ethno-religious coexistence and put an end to 1 700 years of Christian presence in the region. In order to restore human rights and property rights, the resolution we are about to debate supports the idea of establishing an autonomous Nineveh Plain province within the framework of the Iraqi constitution. Furthermore, the resolution emphasises the need for security arrangements and military support to regional defence forces. This is imperative in order to make it possible for refugees and IDPs to return to their ancestral homelands.

And, once again, our gratitude to all. The fight for Mosul shows a quick territorial win for the Iraqi-led coalition forces. Mosul is more than a symbol. It is a decisive step in our effort to defeat Daesh. This being said, this is foreseen to be a long-lasting operation and our absolute priority is to protect the civilians. We have to ensure that they will not remain trapped in Mosul under heavy gunfire and bomb attacks, and they are not used as human shields by Daesh. We have to ensure that the military on all fronts will open humanitarian corridors for the citizens and IDPs that flee the fighting. Therefore my Group calls on all parties to abide by international humanitarian law, to respect principles of proportionality and distinction, and to take all precautions to minimise casualties and to ensure that civilians and civilian infrastructure will be protected, like schools and hospitals, and then they will not be bombed. The evidence of the war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by Daesh should be preserved as a fundamental priority in order to ensure accountability for the perpetrators. With Mosul the Daesh scourge could be largely vanished in Iraq, but Daesh is just a symptom of a larger problem in the Middle East. Until there is a political accommodation between Shia and Sunnis in Iraq and in the region we will not achieve peace in Syria and the terrorism will remain. Finally, it is important to take this opportunity to express our full support for the sovereignty, territorial integrity of Iraq. And then the dramatic need, after Daesh, of a strategy which will involve further humanitarian aid, the re-establishment of the governance, basic services such as healthcare, electricity and education, but also guarantee for the safe return and reintegration of refugees and IDPs, the protection of vulnerable minorities, and the political participation of all religious minorities.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1504, "date": "2016-10-26.json", "name": "Charles TANNOCK", "mepid": "4521", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Group. – Madam President, ten days ago the complex military operation finally began to liberate Mosul. Whilst we should welcome the ultimate removal of the evil scourge of ISIS from a city of 1 million people and the demise of its regime, we should not forget that there will be a heavy price to be paid in human terms. The barbarity of ISIS’s war crimes is already clear, as reports emerge of civilians being used as human shields and brutal beheadings carried out, including of boys, to create a culture of fear and repression amongst the population. As well as many IDPs we must also be prepared for the movement of ISIS fighters. As Mosul falls there is a credible risk that as many as 5 000 jihadists will escape the city and make their way to other Islamist hotspots across the globe, notably Libya, Somalia and Yemen. We will also see some reach Europe, unfortunately. The battle for Mosul is seeing a powerful alliance come together, from the air support offered by the US and EU Member States to the Iraqi security forces and Shia militias on the ground.  As the European Parliament’s Chair of the Friends of Kurdistan, I wish today to salute the particularly brave courage of the Peshmerga forces of the KRG who have, and continue to play, a vital role in the fight against ISIS in the Middle East.

What we have all been waiting for a very long time, ie. the liberation of Mosul and all the civilians who are there has now begun.

The civilian population in Mosul is facing a humanitarian catastrophe and we must be ready to help. Some from Mosul have managed to escape to the immediate area, but also to Rojava in Syria. From Mosul there are no safe ways out and people do not even dare to go out on the street, let alone leave the city. The day they come, it can be up to 1 million people. Aid organizations on the ground testify that today they have the capacity to receive perhaps 60,000 in camps and at most 200,000. Therefore, increased efforts are required from the international community for humanitarian aid and assistance to the area. The aid must also reach those who manage to get to Rojava, where it is testified that the aid does not reach due to Turkey's unwillingness to open the border for relief shipments.

Finally, we would like to say, were it not for the fact that the disagreement that hitherto prevented it remains to this day and paints a gloomy picture of the future of the entire Middle East. To the political and military influence of Tehran on the Iraqi government and to the shared aspirations of the brave Kurds for self-determination is added the unacceptable position of the Turkish government that has deployed troops on Iraqi soil without the Baghdad agreement, thus violating its sovereignty. Erdogan's cryptic declarations concerning the borders of Turkey fixed in Sèvres to be reviewed, combined with the desire not to be a spectator in the reconquest, suggest a dangerous expansionist will that we cannot ignore. As we are doing with this resolution, which in fact not only does not condemn, but does not even mention these very serious facts. Staying on the subject of silence, the American one weighs heavily in view of the presidential elections. A quick conquest of Mosul is undoubtedly an important victory that can be announced at the end of the campaign, but it cannot be achieved at any cost and if the price is to create an easy corridor towards Syria for the jihadists with the aim of further destabilizing it and aggravate the situation of civilians, we, that price, can not accept it. The choices of political players cannot, as too often happens, forget the suffering of civilians. Our role as European champions of humanitarian aid is not enough if it is not accompanied by a clear vision of the destinies of the liberated territories. We support the creation with an inclusive process of new autonomous provinces for the Nineveh Plain, in Tal Afar, Sinjar and wherever it is necessary to guarantee security and democracy to minorities in their ancestral territories. However, we will not accept that Mosul's ashes and oil become the object of a shameful bargaining at the table on the skin of its citizens, because Mosul will eventually fall, and I think soon, too great a disproportion of forces.

We must make it a top priority to protect these populations in battle, especially vulnerable communities such as Christians, who overwhelmingly have fled their land.

The fate of civilian populations is all the more worrying as the UN has received reports of the atrocities that Daesh fighters are committing. In fact, they use civilians as human shields.

In the future this government must focus on good governance, power sharing, the reconciliation process and job creation. This is one of the main lessons of 2003 Iraq.

That Daexe will be defeated, it is a certainty! But we can no longer be sure that the defeat of Daexe will automatically start a time of peace in this martyred country. Some of the forces that today fight the Jihadists fought among themselves not so long ago. There are wounds and rivalries only temporarily suspended.

The country will only achieve peace and prosperity if it respects and preserves this diversity, creating conditions for the political participation of the diverse religious minorities and social currents.

But this will have only one credibility - in view of the great suffering Yazidis, Christians and others have had, as fought, tortured and killed by their neighbors at the beginning of ISIS 's operations - if the Iraqi state gets a sensible state structure . The Shiite government in Baghdad must know that this must be an organization where the Kurds in Ebril, as well as the other communities such as the Christians and the Sunnis, can find security through the organization of the state and do not run the risk of fear when they return to their homes, their villages, that they will soon be victims of another attack.

They were only allowed to take with them the clothes they wore on their bodies. All the remaining 25,000 Christians left the city and then for the first time in history Mosul was left without Christians.

This document was signed on 2 October between Afghanistan and the European Union. It should be seen not only in the context of EU—Afghan relations but, more importantly, in the context of the European Union’s new partnership framework with third countries under the European Agenda on Migration. This initiative falls under the package of efforts to address the ongoing migratory crisis and was welcomed by the last European Council. More than a year ago we adopted, as you will remember, the European Union’s Agenda on Migration which this House has welcomed. The EU Agenda on Migration set out our common strategy on the basis of this principle. A common challenge demands a common European response. It demands a comprehensive policy, which includes both short and long—term solutions and a coordinated approach of our internal and external policies in order to address all aspects of this phenomenon. Preventing irregular migration is one of the issues that demands a long-term policy and engagement with key third countries. Our engagement, therefore, with Afghanistan, along with other key countries of origin, is part of this comprehensive approach. It is in this spirit that the European Union and Afghanistan have decided to bring their cooperation to the next level. Let me stress the overall picture. Europe faced an unprecedentedly large number of irregular migrants of Afghan origin in 2015 and during 2016 Afghans continue to represent the second largest group of irregular migrants to the European Union. A large number of them will most likely be eligible for international protection either because they belong to specific categories of persons or because they originate from certain areas of the country. I do not have to repeat that every asylum seeker goes through a due and fair process, respecting her or his rights according to EU laws. Those who are not eligible for international protection will have to be returned. This is exactly the issue which needs to be addressed with the Afghan authorities. The Afghan authorities do not contest the international law principle of readmitting their nationals found in an irregular position. They are, however, concerned about the impact of their return on those who return and on their receiving communities as well. This issue has to be adequately and proactively managed. Their concern, which the European Union shares, is moreover amplified by the fact that other neighbouring countries, notably Pakistan and Iran, are already returning thousands of irregular Afghan migrants back to Afghanistan. These returns are happening without an accompanying measure in favour of those who return and of the communities that will receive and reintegrate them. Until 2 October the European Union did not have any cooperation framework with Afghanistan. This situation had created mistrust with limited possibilities for dialogue and cooperation, but also uncertainty for the migrants. The only ones profiting from the lack of a cooperation framework were the criminal organisations dealing with migrant smuggling. Now we have this framework for dialogue and cooperation to discuss the issues of return, readmission and reintegration of the irregular migrants in a comprehensive, balanced and sustainable manner. This will also help to address the concerns of the Afghan authorities I mentioned before. I would now like to give you an overview of what the Joint Way Forward is, what it is not, and what its key elements are. Let me start by reminding you that the Joint Way Forward does not refer to persons having been granted international protection status in the European Union or whose international protection request is still being examined. It only covers irregular migrants – persons who either have not requested asylum or whose asylum claim has been rejected and they have no right to stay in the European Union. In all cases the principle of non-refoulement will be preserved and respected. Secondly, the Joint Way Forward is not a legally binding international agreement. It does not set out new obligations. It represents rather a joint declaration in which are described the various initiatives which the European Union and Afghanistan, in accordance with their authority and internal procedures, intend to implement in order to organise the return, readmission and reintegration of the irregular migrants, while preventing further irregular migration flows. This declaration will enhance the mutual trust between the two parties. It proves that both the European Union and Afghanistan are committed to address the irregular migration phenomenon in a comprehensive, balanced and human manner. Thirdly, I would like to underline that the Joint Way Forward in fact goes much further than the return of irregular migrants. Not only does it describe how Member States and Afghan authorities will organise an orderly return of the irregular migrants, but it encompasses several other initiatives helping to give to this challenge a sustainable solution in a spirit of partnership. For instance, it also covers measures aimed at preventing further departures of irregular migrants, such as campaigns to sensitise the population to the risk of irregular migration and capacity building to fight against migrant smuggling. It also underlines that, in line with EU legislation, the EU side will give the necessary consideration to humanitarian aspects to ensure that vulnerable groups of migrants receive adequate protection, assistance and care throughout the whole process. In this context, the Joint Way Forward stresses the intention of the European Union to support the country as much as possible with the challenging task of sustainable reintegration of those who return. As mentioned earlier, Afghanistan is facing unprecedented migration challenges. It is in this spirit that the Commission is developing an important multi-country programme to assist returning migrants, members of third communities and the local authorities. The interventions foreseen under this programme will include vocational training and skills development, strengthening of local communities and the improvement of migration management systems and policies. This programme comes in addition to the existing bilateral development cooperation which addresses some of the root causes of irregular migration, for example as concerns the availability of basic services or economic opportunities. It represents just one aspect of the much broader financial and technical support which the European Union and its Member States have been giving and, as reiterated at the Brussels Conference on 5 October, will continue to give to Afghanistan to promote its overall stabilisation and development. The Joint Way Forward represents the beginning of a dialogue and cooperation for the European Union and the Member States with the Afghan authorities. Nothing should be taken for granted. Patient work and mutual respect in a spirit of partnership will ensure the effective success of the initiatives described in the Joint Way Forward. From the Commission’s side I can ensure you of our full commitment to make the Joint Way Forward a success story with a positive outcome for the European Union, for Afghanistan and, in particular, for the Afghan migrants involved. I can conclude by reassuring you that I am committed to come and inform you on the state of play of the Joint Way Forward whenever you request it in the future.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1550, "date": "2016-10-26.json", "name": "Jaromír ŠTĚTINA", "mepid": "124702", "text": "for the PPE Group. - In October 2001, US planes began bombing Afghanistan. The same year, US ground troops entered the country. In 2002, there was a sudden turnaround in Afghanistan's demographics. Within a few months, about 5 million people had returned home, fleeing the Soviet occupation and the ensuing Mujahideen war with the Taliban. They returned mainly from Iran and Pakistan. The return of the refugees was spontaneous, no one organized or ordered their return. Five million people realized that the US intervention ended a twenty-five-year series of devastating wars. After foreign troops began to leave Afghanistan in 2013, the flow of refugees turned again. People began to leave Afghanistan. After Syrians, Afghans have thus become the strongest refugee group seeking to join the EU and seek asylum in the EU. I would like to draw your attention, ladies and gentlemen, to one fundamental fact that the EU should address. During the American presence and the presence of international ISAF troops, tens of thousands of Afghan citizens cooperated with these armed forces. Due to the withdrawal of international forces, these people are often laid off and lose their jobs. They and their families are often referred to by the Taliban as \"traitors to the faith and the nation,\" and their lives are directly threatened. These people, ladies and gentlemen, have been our direct allies in the armed struggle against the Islamists, and we cannot leave them to their fate.

They represent the second largest migrant group by nationality of the 327 000 registered arrivals for 2016 to date. The need for concluding a readmission agreement between Afghanistan and the EU is therefore paramount.  There are many in this House who are ideologically opposed to the very notion of readmission agreements and will oppose the Joint Way Forward regardless of its terms. The terms in this case are fair and contain a number of provisions that cover the issues of unaccompanied minors, the elderly, the disabled and the vulnerable. Furthermore, the agreement goes beyond merely concluding procedures for readmission and includes elements for assisting with the reintegration of those people who wish to return home.  Following the unprecedented numbers of people that have arrived on the EU shores over the past two years it is vital that our Member State governments and the EU demonstrate that they are able to find solutions to what many of our citizens discern to be the number one issue of political concern at the doorstep. Failure to do so will further propel the rise of the populist and the far-right parties and endanger the very nature and entire basis for the EU project.  Maintaining the confidence and viability of international treaties such as the 1951 Geneva UN Convention on Refugees will only be possible if we stick to its terms and properly implement them.

It showed that political and financial commitment by the international community remain strong. The Afghan Government has committed to implementing a serious reforms programme. Self-reliant Afghanistan has to be grounded on good governance, rule of law, economic development and, most importantly, on security. In this regard, I deplore strongly the killing of 30 peaceful civilians in the Ghor province by bandits affiliated to ISIS. This is the very sad news of this morning.  I particularly welcome the signing of the Joint Way Forward. It is an extremely important agreement; important for both sides involved as it sets a clear framework for managing migration readmission. Having said this, I would like to regret strongly the lack of transparency in closing the deal on this and the fact that Parliament was not involved in its drafting at an earlier stage. Thus, I call on the High Representative and the Commission from now onwards to at least keep this House informed on progress regarding the agreement’s implementation.  Coming back to EU-Afghan relations, they must be based on reciprocity. The EU needs to respect its financial pledges and ensure its support for returnees, so they can find jobs and become valuable members of their communities. Afghanistan must uphold its obligations by facilitating readmission and the reintegration of its own citizens who do not fulfil the asylum application requirements. It is necessary that Afghanistan, the EU and the international community elaborate jointly on this momentum of the Brussels conference and do everything in their capacity to support the rebuilding of the state of Afghanistan and Afghanis’ hope for a better future.

In fact, all it does is make the nation poorer as those with the skills to rebuild head for Europe instead. That is why I am calling for all migrants not under threat from direct large-scale conflicts to be declared as economic migrants and returned to their home countries.

They were all very useful and to the point. I also take due note of all your remarks and recommendations. I would like to conclude by inviting this House one more time to look at the Joint Way Forward in a positive light. To look at it as a tool which, although having only the modest status of a mere joint declaration, can contribute to starting a dialogue and cooperation between the European Union and Afghanistan on migration issues. It will serve as a bridge of a provisional nature, allowing the two sides to meet and discuss, to start practical work and to build their mutual trust in addressing common challenges. I took note of what Ms Björk said before. Any decision regarding the possible return of children is based on an individual assessment of the best interest of the child, according to the provisions of the relevant EU legislation. I remind you of the Return Directive. The IOM has established referral and support systems. The unaccompanied minors who will be returned to Afghanistan will be assisted in the framework of the EU-funded reintegration project by the Afghan authorities and IOM Kabul, which has already put in place an effective referral and support system. In 2016 only a very low percentage of voluntary returnees from Europe were unaccompanied minors. As I have already stressed, the non-legally-binding nature of the Joint Way Forward gives us no guarantee that its provisions will be effectively implemented by the Afghan authorities. The situation of the country remains difficult at all levels, and yes, we have to exhaust all means in order to bring back peace and stability in the region. It remains one of the priorities of the European Union. But the poverty, instability, the insecurity and now also the emergency created by the massive return of migrants from Pakistan and Iran will make implementation challenging. This being said, we believe that the European Union and the Member States should do their best to support the Afghan authorities to cooperate on the basis of the Joint Way Forward. Should this cooperation work, it would represent an effective game-changer, not only because it would help solve one of the key challenges for Europe, namely the return of irregular migrants and the prevention of further arrivals of irregular migrants, but, most importantly, because it would have a positive impact on Afghan society by enhancing its capacity to provide assistance to the returnees and their receiving communities, and by supporting those deciding not to emigrate from the country to build up brighter opportunities for themselves at home. From the Commission side I will conclude by reiterating one more time our full commitment to make the Joint Way Forward a success story, but also to come and inform you about its implementation whenever you so request in the future.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1573, "date": "2016-10-26.json", "name": "Rainer WIELAND", "mepid": "2323", "text": "The debate is closed.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1574, "date": "2016-10-26.json", "name": "Rainer WIELAND", "mepid": "2323", "text": "The next item on the agenda is the debate on the statement by the Vice-President of the Commission and High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy on the situation in Belarus (2016/2934 (RSP)).Commissioner Creţu, speaking for the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, opened the debate.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1575, "date": "2016-10-26.json", "name": "Corina CREȚU", "mepid": "33997", "text": "   on behalf of the Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. – Mr President, the European Commission very much appreciates the European Parliament’s long-standing interest and our cooperation on this important neighbouring country. The High Representative’s intervention to you on Belarus dates from September last year and we had just witnessed the release of the remaining political prisoners and were hoping to engage in a longer-term strategy focused on building links between the European Union and Belarus and on supporting reforms for the people of Belarus, which are badly needed. One year on, there have been a number of noteworthy developments on the EU-Belarusian scene. In recognition of the political prisoners’ release and of a number of positive steps taken by Belarus over the last years, the EU lifted most of the restrictive measures against Belarus in February of this year. An important factor which contributed to this decision was Belarus’ constructive stance on this crisis in and around Ukraine which persists today. In the Council conclusion on Belarus adopted in February, the European Union and Member States expressed their concern about the human rights situation and particularly also about the continued application of capital punishment. At the same time, we agreed that there was an opportunity for our relationship – for EU-Belarus relations – to develop on a more positive agenda and that progress in a variety of fields can better be achieved through enhanced channels of communication. Since then, cooperation in areas of common interest has been stepped up. In April the Commission adopted a delegated act which made Belarus eligible for EIB lending. This will bolster support for the Belarusian private sector. An agreement was signed between OLAF and Belarus in July on customs cooperation, in particular in fighting the illicit trade in cigarettes, and the sectoral dialogue on customs and related topics is still foreseen to be launched by the end of the year. A trade dialogue was launched this month, on 13 October, between the European Commission DG for Trade and Belarus in view of improving trade, discussing Belarus’ access to the WTO and addressing existing barriers in international trade. A mobility partnership was signed also this month, also on 13 October, in view on enhancing cooperation on migration, asylum and border management. This will contribute in tackling the migration challenges, protection of refugees, prevention and combating trafficking in human beings. The European Union stepped up its financial support for 2016 to EUR 29 million – more than a doubling of the budget initially planned for 2016. Assistance is focused on regional and private sector development, support for migration and asylum management, and support for students. We are also intensifying our cooperation in the area of energy. As part of a re-engagement with Belarus, the Commission is considering relaunching the formal EU-Belarus energy dialogue in the near future. Nuclear safety issues have always been an overall EU concern, especially when new facilities are being constructed on the border with the EU, and are a key component of the exchanges on energy with Belarus. The Council’s conclusions adopted on 15 February 2016 reiterate the importance of ensuring nuclear safety beyond the borders of the European Union, and call on Belarus to cooperate constructively with the relevant international authorities in this regard. In this context, the high-level visit of the competent Commission services to Belarus took place on 19 and 20 September 2016. In addition, we have continued our strong assistance for civil society and for the promotion of people-to-people contacts. Civil society organisations received between 2011 and 2015 over EUR 50 million in programmes which strengthen their capacity and further a number of social, economic and human rights issues. Hundreds of exchanges are on-going in the areas of education, culture, science and technology and generally youth exchanges. On the human rights front, we have witnessed more openness by the Belarusian authorities to engage. EU Special Representative Mr Lambrinidis visited Minsk in March this year, where we had a meeting with President Lukashenko and participated in a conference on the death penalty. In June, the Belarusians hosted for the first time a European Union-Belarus human rights dialogue, for a part of which they also invited civil society representatives. At the same time we are fully aware that there have been no concrete or structural changes in Belarus democracy and the human rights situation. The application of capital punishment remains an issue which overshadows our relations with the country. This year alone we have learned about one execution, four confirmed death sentences and two new ones. Needless to say, this issue remains high on our agenda, and we will continue engaging with Belarus on this. Both the presidential election of October 2015 and the parliamentary election of last month were criticised by the OSCE for falling short of democratic standards and for not addressing a number of key OSCE and Council of Europe Venice Commission recommendations. Nevertheless we welcome the entry into parliament of the first non-establishment voices for the first time in 12 years, and we hope they can bring fresh air and new ideas into a chamber that during the last tenure introduced less than five new legislative initiatives. As indicated in our statement of 20 September, the European Union calls on Belarus to undertake comprehensive electoral reforms. The next elections are not so far away. Municipal elections will take place in 2018, and real progress on this and a number of other human rights-related topics will remain key for achieving the full potential of EU-Belarus relations. Therefore the EU’s policy towards Belarus remains for the time being one of critical engagement. We are not yet ready to launch negotiations with the Belarusian Government on a legal framework agreement, even if it remains a mid- to long-term goal. Our efforts will continue to focus on increasing engagement with all sectors of Belarus society and developing relations, including in the framework of the Eastern Partnership.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1576, "date": "2016-10-26.json", "name": "Bogdan Andrzej ZDROJEWSKI", "mepid": "124893", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr Chairman!

They undoubtedly exist, only now if you want to throw students out of the university for their political views, they are simply judged negatively. The resolution we are proposing is a balanced resolution.

It was not a democratic election. There was no transparency.

I am convinced that in order for a shift towards a more open and democratic climate in Belarus to be possible, there must be a functioning civil society. People must be able to organize in trade unions in order to have better conditions in their workplaces and be members of political parties. Freedom of expression must be respected and we must have free pressure.

Lukashenko has been tied hand and foot to Moscow since he came to power 22 years ago. And yet Belarus is reluctantly trying to normalize its relations with the West. Especially now that big brother Russia is no longer able to fully support the economy financially.

The so-called elections in September: yet another fake. The OSCE recommendations: entirely ignored, as many times before. None of the rights of former political prisoners reinstated.

So much for the facts, which alone do not adequately describe the country's complex and contradicting development processes.

I think it is good that the European Union is emerging from the policy of isolation and is intensifying dialogue with Belarus. We should develop this dialogue so that it is not only based on conversation, but also on joint ventures, projects in the field of economy, science and civil society. The economic situation in Belarus is quite tragic at the moment. Paradoxically, this is a very good moment to change, because Belarus has little to lose and can introduce significant and more radical changes in its economy and politics, and the European Union, which is one of the lenders and also a guarantor of loans from third countries for Belarus, is a donor money has a real tool to play a strengthening role in this process. How? First of all, by very scrupulous control of the funds spent, but also by additional requirements. After all, we can require that the money that goes to the development of medium and small enterprises in Belarus and such projects be partially spent by the business developing in Belarus for the benefit of civil society. We can require these companies to develop corporate social responsibility, to develop or join the social economy, popularizing the Belarusian language, and so on.

And also, our aim is to ensure that the highest possible safety standards are followed. The European Commission in particular is financing experts who are assisting the Belarussian national regulator during the construction of the nuclear power plant and through working with Belarus in the area of nuclear stress tests.

We all closely follow the developments in Turkey, a candidate country and key partner for the European Union. Our commitment to further developing and broadening our ongoing partnership and cooperation with Turkey remains strong. This is demonstrated by our continued solid engagement, including a recent visit to Turkey by High Representative Federica Mogherini and Commissioners Hahn, Avramopoulos, Stylianides and Šefčovič to Turkey and numerous meetings with Turkish authorities. The recent period has been a testing time for Turkey. The attempted coup of 15 July risked sending the country back in time to a darker era of its history. It would have been a dramatic blow to Turkey’s democracy and would have destabilised the whole region even further. On that night the people and the institutions of Turkey, including all political partners and parties, came together and stood up to defend their democracy. This is something we cannot forget or downplay. In this delicate moment for the country’s history, the Turkish institutions must recommit strongly to the same values that the Turkish people defended on the night of 15 July. Although the state is naturally entitled to take swift and decisive action in response to such a threat, any allegation of wrongdoing should be established by transparent procedures in all individual cases and ensure the right to respect for private and family life. Freedom of expression is one of the essential foundations of the European Union. We have repeatedly stressed that Turkey, as a candidate country, needs to aspire to the highest possible democratic standards and practices, including freedom of the media. This is our second debate on the situation of journalists in Turkey under this legislature. When we look at the situation of journalists and media freedom more generally, it has been deteriorating significantly, not just since 15 July but over the last couple of years. It is very worrying that, following the introduction of the state of emergency, the situation of media freedom in Turkey has been exacerbated even further. Arrest warrants have been issued against a large number of journalists, and many media outlets have been closed. There have been cases of foreign journalists facing difficulties in exercising their profession in Turkey, such as deportation, refusal of entry and refusal to renew their press accreditation. Turkish authorities need to restore safeguards to ensure freedom of expression, including pluralism of the media, and to take measures to limit intimidation and pressure exerted on journalists and media outlets. Turkey is encouraged to take measures, including the adoption of guidelines and training for the judiciary, to curtail the use of defamation and related criminal code articles as a means of putting pressure on critics. We urge that Turkish authorities refrain from blocking access to internet content and from takedowns. All these issues of concern are central for the European Union, and we very much encourage cooperation with the Council of Europe in this regard. Free, diverse and independent media is essential in any democratic society. Without freedom of expression and freedom of the media, an informed, active and engaged people is impossible. It is the strength of a democratic society to be able to respond to anti-democratic acts by strictly adhering to the standards, and this is absolutely critical for our relations. The curtailment of freedom of speech in Turkey is not limited only to journalists. On 20 May the Turkish parliament adopted a constitutional amendment on lifting the parliamentary immunity of a number of members of parliament. Prosecutors began to summon members of parliament to testify, and this raises further concerns about the respect for the rule of law and fundamental freedoms, in particular the freedom of expression. It is precisely this same issue that needs to be addressed under one of the seven outstanding benchmarks in the framework of the visa liberalisation dialogue related to anti-terror legislation. Let us be very clear: this benchmark is not about asking Turkey to reduce its capacity to fight terrorism. This benchmark is about making sure that the anti-terror legislation and its application are aligned with the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights – in short, that it cannot be used to jail journalists who only did their job and to curtail freedom of expression. The European Union believes that it is important to continue to address these important matters as a key element of a dialogue between the European Union and Turkey, a candidate country but also a key partner of the European Union.

Commissioner, thank you very much for these very clear words. I am delighted to hear that from the Commission and it is high time we made it this clear. Journalists have never had it easy in Turkey, but it has never been as bad as it is today. According to the ranking of Reporters Without Borders, Turkey is currently in 151st place out of 180 worldwide in terms of freedom of the press. There has long been no freedom of expression or freedom of the press. Since the attempted coup, there has been a real witch hunt, including on journalists, but also on many other professional groups: on business people, on professors. Only that is not the topic today. 2,300 media workers have been laid off and more journalists are now detained in Turkey than in China, Iran and Egypt combined. Detention conditions are unacceptable and there is mistreatment, Human Rights Watch reports. Those affected have no access to lawyers, no access to the rule of law. Since the attempted coup, 45 newspapers, 16 television stations, 23 radio stations, 3 news agencies and 15 magazine editorial offices have been closed and expropriated. This particularly affected opposition media, but also others: it particularly affected Kurdish channels and also an Alevi. Any criticism of President Erdoğan, his family, party, government or state institutions is prohibited. De facto, there has long been an opinion dictatorship and a presidential dictatorship. A single man rules the legislature, administration, justice, media, education and civil society. There is a climate of fear in Turkey. But, as you rightly said, Commissioner: a free and pluralistic press is a core element of any democracy, just like due legal proceedings, the presumption of innocence and an independent judiciary.

In her hand was an iPhone. President Erdoğan was addressing the nation through FaceTime. Media plurality played a crucial role in preventing the coup plotters from succeeding in their attempt to illegally take over democratic institutions in Turkey that night. Let that not be forgotten. In the last years, media freedom in Turkey has been under great pressure, but the level of the crackdown the Turkish journalists are facing under the current state of emergency is unprecedented.  Not only were 150 media outlets closed and 2 300 journalists fired in the last two months, but 99 journalists and writers were also jailed, with no charges presented against most of them. This brings the number of media workers detained on charges, believed to be related to their work, to at least 130. This is the highest number of jailed journalists in Europe. That is not a cool list to be heading, especially not for an EU candidate country. In the European Parliament, we attach great importance to press freedom. One of this year’s candidates for the Sakharov Prize is Turkish journalist Can Dündar.   One year ago, we also had a debate about the freedom of media when the ‘Zaman’ newspaper was closed down. In the joint resolution that we will vote on tomorrow, all political groups are united in their call on the Turkish Government to immediately release these journalists; distinguished journalist of proven integrity, including former editor-in-chief Ahmed Altan, columnist Şahin Alpay, and well-known novelist Aslı Erdoğan, are being punished without due process through a long period of pre-trial detention. These people did not participate in the coup and the long period of pre-trial detention serves no public good. It seems the journalists are being punished purely for the opinions that they held, rather than for any incitement to violence or actual violence. The events of last night show that the curtailment of free speech in Turkey is not limited to journalists only. The co-mayors of Diyarbakır, Gültan Kışanak and Fırat Anlı, were detained yesterday. If democratically elected politicians are no longer allowed to freely express their opinion, then who can? To conclude, we understand that Turkey is going through a difficult time and people are traumatised by the deteriorating security situation, both inside the country and surrounding it. However, these threats can only be curtailed by strengthening democracy; by strengthening the rule of law, and by getting back to a normal situation.

The so-called fight against terrorism goes a long way when a government sees a children's program as a threat to national security; then all proportions are lost. Even before the failed coup, journalists were outlaws in Turkey. Now the last critical voices are being stifled. 130 journalists are in prison. In the competent committee of the Turkish parliament, the court of justice confirms that new special forces are moving into prisons to torture them. I would like to explicitly mention the names of Inan Kizilkaya and Bilir Kaya, the editors of the Gündem newspaper, imprisoned in Silivri. Inan and Bilir confirm that they are being tortured and isolated. As a person and as a former journalist, I am horrified. Our Commissioners and the President of Parliament expressed their concern, their great concern, their utmost concern, but it has not made much of an impression on Erdogan. It is now too late: without free, independent media there is no democracy. Unfortunately, it has come to that in candidate country Turkey.

And as someone who has always defended accession, even against the current of public opinion, these are painful times.  Painful because those who attempted the coup did no service to Turkey’s democratic future whatsoever. They have rightfully been strongly condemned. Painful, because the aftermath of the coup attempt has led to mass arrests that have taken place and have led to the centre of European societies and opinion, traditionally the most in favour of good relations with Turkey and of accession, to turn away from Turkey’s European future. I find that people simply do not see it happening anymore.  Press freedom and the position of journalists are a key reason for the political middle in Europe to worry and to fear that Turkey has taken a turn, not to return – a path of no return. This House, thankfully, has consistently voiced its concern and condemnation of the cracks in the rule of law, the lack of separation of powers and the violations of human rights and, particularly, press freedom and Internet freedom. And even though the post—coup environment has exacerbated the pressure and has seen the emergency measures being adopted, the banning of books, the arrest of journalists and the restrictions of press freedom and the stifling of oppositional voices has been systematic.  The Gülen movement, now accused of plotting the coup but previously a key ally of the Erdoğan government, was instrumental in creating an environment of fear, together with AK Party politicians. A climate in which critics were silenced, trials were unfair and the gap between the letter of the law and its actual implementation grew and grew.  As I said in the beginning, Turkey is and will remain an essential partner for us and we must act in the interests of all its people. Despite the low point that we see and that, frankly, is very disappointing, despite the bleeding of hearts, both in Europe and in Turkey, of those who hoped that Turkey would move towards the EU, we have to continue as Europeans to focus on what is really important in our path forward and focus on the rule of law and human rights, and, particularly, not be silent because we want the migration deal only.

There must be prosecutions, but prosecutions must be based on the rule of law in democratic states. For democracy, one of the things which matters most is independence; freedom of the media; pluralism of opinion. The situation for journalists, as Kati mentioned, was already awful in Turkey before the coup, but it has worsened a lot since the coup.  So what Turkey needs – rule of law and democracy – cannot happen if more and more journalists are jailed. It is very good to know that people like Can Dündar tried to help democratic development in Turkey. It is very good to know that famous writers, like the Altan brothers, are now paying in jail because they advocated liberal ideas, liberal democracy for Turkey.

Thousands of academics, lawyers and businessmen cannot possibly be terrorists, and I call on the Turkish authorities to stop the witch-hunt on journalists, release those imprisoned and restore freedom of speech. Over the past weeks I have been meeting many people from Turkish civil society and the opposition. They feel let down. They feel that Europe has turned its back on them. They see the EU as an anchor of democracy, preventing a drift towards autocracy. They urge us to show empathy and solidarity. They urge us to help them restore the rule of law. So let us stop the blame game. Inflammatory rhetoric does not help. It is clear that the EU has underestimated the trauma for the people in Turkey when we realise the extent of the Gülen infiltration in the state institutions. We have a responsibility to better understand the complexity of what is going on in Turkey before jumping to conclusions. Europe should engage in a constructive dialogue with Turkey on all issues of common concern. It is in our mutual interest. The Commission is doing it; let’s support them. The EU should therefore get ready to open Chapter 23 and 24 on justice and fundamental rights. When the day of a peaceful settlement with Cyprus comes, we must be ready.

I recently read a sad but very well-described quote from a Turkish journalist: \"In the past, journalists met in cafes, today they meet in prisons and courtrooms.\" Ladies and gentlemen, human rights and their observance are part of the culture to which Turkey has committed itself, but the steps it is now taking are far from them.

I thank all the honourable Members for their interventions. As I said at the beginning, this is not a new situation but it is a worrying situation. This is the second debate that we have had during this mandate about the freedom of the media in Turkey and what is happening now is totally unacceptable.  As I said at the beginning, free, diverse and independent media is essential in any democratic society. Without freedom of expression and freedom of the media an informed, active and engaged society is impossible. As you have underlined here, this is not only about the punishment of the journalists.  I was very happy to see many former journalists in this House, as I was one in my previous life, but I also think that it is the duty of all of us as politicians to fight, not only for the journalists but also for the elected people, the Members of Parliament, for the professors, the universities and for the mayors. So I think it is very important to address this issue. As I said at the beginning, I can assure you that the Commission addresses the issues raised here with the Turkish authorities at every engagement and continuously expresses concerns about the significant shortcomings affecting human rights in Turkey. We urge Turkey urgently to act to defuse a tense political climate which creates an environment restricting freedom of speech. These circumstances make continued engagement and a constructive dialogue with Turkey more critical than ever.  In any case the Commission continues to believe that the accession process is the best framework for advancing reforms in Turkey. Advancing the preparatory work towards opening Chapters 23 and 24, on fundamental rights, justice, freedom and security, would be important as it will provide Turkey with a comprehensive roadmap for enforcing these essential areas, including press freedom. Parliament adds, of course, a significant contribution to the debate on Turkey and we very much value this opportunity for an exchange of views.  Finally, I have also noted and welcome the presence here tonight of a Turkish journalist, Can Dündar, a prominent voice in the Turkish debate, and I would like to add his name in honour of the others who are in jail or who have suffered or been assassinated. So in this matter we, the Commission and Parliament, are working hand in hand. I would like just to inform you that the Commission will issue a country report early in November. Until now it has been called a progress report, but it is obvious that we cannot speak about a progress report in the case of Turkey. All your opinions will of course be taken into consideration when the Commission issues this country report.

The Vice-President/High Representative is in the Dominican Republic at a very important conference for Latin America. I will begin my remarks by saying that first of all, the risk of terrorists releasing nuclear or radiological materials needs to be taken into account in our overall efforts to prevent terrorist attacks. Responsibility for ensuring nuclear security lies with national governments, but international cooperation in this area is and will remain crucial. The EU is strongly committed to ensuring the highest level of nuclear security, both in Europe and worldwide. I have said before, during our debate on Belarus, what we are doing, and we are very much concerned about what is happening in this field. The commitment of the EU to nuclear security and the progress achieved in recent years are described in detail in a joint staff working document issued on 9 March 2016 entitled ‘EU efforts to strengthen nuclear security’. Allow me now to briefly highlight some of the EU policies and actions.  As regards the legislative framework, the Euratom Treaty continues to be the basis of the EU’s activity on nuclear issues. Through Euratom, the EU operates an effective regional nuclear safeguard system, which includes nuclear material accountancy, verification through onsite inspections, regular reporting, and technical and scientific support for the EU Member States. All this in close cooperation, of course, with the International Atomic Energy Agency.  The EU can claim major credit for promoting the entry into force, in May this year, of the crucial 2005 amendment to the Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material. All 28 EU Member States, as well as Euratom, have ratified the amendment and the European External Action Service has conducted diplomatic outreach on behalf of its entry into force. The European Union will continue to help states to fully implement the provisions of the amended Convention and the Atomic Energy Agency to promote universal adherence to it. In the area of combatting illicit trafficking of nuclear and radiological materials, the EU has supported the effective implementation worldwide of UN Security Council Resolution 1540 through financing and capacity building. We have established a network of chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear centres of excellence, which today counts 54 partner countries in eight regions of the world, with about 50 projects funded and around 300 people trained. It is funded under the Instrument contributing to Stability and Peace, in accordance with the EU CBRN Action Plan of 2010. The EU supports the central role of the International Atomic Energy [agency], and international cooperation for improving the level of nuclear security worldwide, and is looking forward to the International Conference on Nuclear Security being organised from 5 to 9 December 2016 in Vienna. Turning now to nuclear non-proliferation, the new EU global strategy, unveiled in June this year, confirmed that the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems remains a growing threat to Europe and the wider world. The European Union will strongly support the expanding membership, universalisation, full implementation and the enforcement of multilateral disarmament, non-proliferation and arms control treaties and regimes. We will use every means at our disposal to assist in resolving the proliferation crisis as we successfully did on the Iranian nuclear programme. More specifically, I would like to mention two major treaties, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, as well as a couple of regional issues.  The European Union and its Member States agree on the importance of upholding and strengthening the authority and integrity of the NPT which has contributed to international peace, security and stability for more than 40 years. We call for the implementation of all obligations and commitments assumed under the Treaty or undertaken during the previous review conferences. The European Union has been and remains a strong supporter of the CTBT and its organisation and is working towards the entry into force of the Treaty. Of course, all 28 Member States have ratified this Treaty, and together with all the Member States in this 20th anniversary year of the Treaty’s opening for signature, the European Union is conducting a number of actions promoting the Treaty and its organisation, based on an action plan adopted at the beginning of the year.  The European Union welcomes the recent UN Security Council Resolution 2310 which urges all states that have either not signed or ratified this Treaty to do so without further delay as it is an important step forward towards the entry into force of the Treaty.  I warmly welcome the act that in June this year Parliament’s Committee on Foreign Affairs (AFET) held an exchange of views on this Treaty, with the participation of the Executive Secretary Mr Zerbo and of course High Representative Mogherini.  Finally, turning to some regional proliferation issues, the European Union has played a key role in the negotiations leading to the nuclear deal with Iran, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, and we have already issued three reports confirming that Iran is sticking to its nuclear commitments. High Representative Mogherini, as coordinator of the Joint Commission, is playing a key role in the implementation of the deal. The EU condemns in the strongest possible terms all the nuclear and ballistic tests conducted by North Korea. Achieving complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula in a peaceful manner is essential for maintaining peace and stability on the Korean peninsula and in North-East Asia at large. Thank you for your attention, and I am looking forward to our debate.

It is insane, suicidal and barbaric to use nuclear weapons, whether only to threaten or to achieve geopolitical goals. I give two examples: a few years ago, Russia deployed missile systems that could carry nuclear warheads in Kaliningrad - very close to or on the very border of the European Union. The statements of leading Russian politicians that Russia has the right to deploy and store nuclear weapons on the territory of Crimea are also worrying. Equally worrying is the new Russian doctrine of 2014, which allows the use of nuclear weapons against countries that do not have them, as well as Russia's decision to terminate the Russian-American agreement on the utilization of plutonium and link it to inadmissible requests. One month ago, North Korea conducted another nuclear test in gross violation of UN resolutions and is thought to be able to mount warheads on its missiles. North Korea must honor its international obligations by returning to the negotiating table and ending its nuclear program immediately. Increasing the security of nuclear weapons positioned in non-nuclear states, such as Turkey, in the immediate vicinity of military action in Syria, must also be our immediate priority. One of the most dangerous scenarios is the fall of nuclear weapons into the hands of terrorist groups or non-state actors.

There are no excuses and it is not worthwhile to find escapes to try to justify the unjustifiable. Anyone who does not support this resolution will have much to explain to European citizens who care about the future of humanity. The resolution focuses on three points: first, an appeal to ban all nuclear weapons and to constructive participation by the European Union in the international conference proposed by the UN Open Working Group, approved by the General Assembly by a large majority, to negotiate the legally binding instrument for multilateral nuclear disarmament. Second, to assign a mandate to the High Representative with the power to contribute to these same negotiations, in line with the approved global strategy. It was Mrs. Mogherini herself who suggested it here, in this House. A European Parliament resolution could untie the gag that some Member States want to impose on it in this area, which also involves combating one of the most frightening forms of terrorist threat, as Mrs Crețu also underlined.

The global security environment has deteriorated considerably, bringing about different threats. This brings us to an era where more and more states see nuclear weapons as an active deterrent, and we are faced with a situation where, instead of reducing the number of nuclear weapons in the world, we see their re-emergence. In addition to states actively developing their nuclear weapons, for example North Korea and others like Russia, boasting around making statements on the importance of nuclear deterrence, bringing Iskander short-range missiles to Kaliningrad and conducting exercises and overflights flights involving nuclear-capable systems, there is also a threat of terrorism. The fear that terrorists will get a hold on either a nuclear weapon or materials is real, and all countries must be vigilant to make sure that this will not happen. In order to decrease the possibility of a huge nuclear disaster in this world of serious contradictions, we have to reduce the number of nuclear weapons, with the aim of eliminating them altogether. This cannot be done by any nuclear state alone but needs to be a concerted effort. We must come to an understanding that, in order to reduce the amount of nuclear weapons, all nuclear states must do that. There are different possibilities for achieving a world free of nuclear weapons. The ratification and implementation of the international legal instruments regarding nuclear security must be broadened. The CTBT treaty should be ratified by states that have not yet done so. The Non-Proliferation Treaty needs to be further strengthened. To effectively counter nuclear terrorism we need international cooperation, including the sharing of information between states.

The European Union will also actively participate in export control regimes, strengthen common rules governing Member States’ export policies on military equipment and technologies, including dual use, and support export control authorities in the third countries and technical bodies that sustain the international regimes.  EU Member States remain committed to the pursuit of nuclear disarmament, in accordance with Article 6 of the Non—Proliferation Treaty. All Non—Proliferation Treaty States parties are committed to pursuing policies that are fully compatible with the Treaty and the objective of achieving a world without nuclear weapons.

It is not a coincidence that the destructive power of such a weapon is described thus: ‘It can destroy a surface as big as Texas or France’. That’s why we have major credibility problems in relation with countries like Russia, which are expected to be pillars of the international efforts for the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. We do not have the reassurance that we are heading towards a more peaceful world any more. In a world where terrorism became a global threat and where we can see states, apparently solid, falling into chaos in just months, the presence of nuclear weapons and the risk of them ending up with forces willing to use them is unacceptable. For this reason, I consider that mentioning the need of reaching an agreement on establishing a nuclear-weapons-free-zone in the Middle East is a must.

The difficulties repeatedly encountered in the discharge procedures to that date, which were due to a lack of cooperation from the Council, led to a refusal to grant discharge to the Secretary-General of the Council. Parliament, in relation to the financial years 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013, postponed its decision on granting the Secretary-General of the Council discharge in relation to the financial year 2014.  The Council continues to be silent in relation to the remarks made by Parliament in its discharge resolution of 28 April on the trend from previous years of increasing underspending and carryovers of commitments, the high underspending rate and the very high number of appropriations, as well as major transfers within budget lines. These problems could be avoided with better budgetary programming. Moreover, the Council has still not adopted a code of conduct, which is indispensable to the transparency, accountability and integrity of the institution. Whistle-blowing rules should be implemented by the Council by introducing them into the code of conduct without further delay. The Council definitely should disclose the relevant documents and put in place a clear reporting system that will enable the public to follow the legislative procedures in an open and transparent manner. The Council definitely has to increase transparency and integrity with regard to the negotiations.  Lack of transparency with regard to the legislative process of negotiations, Member States’ positions and meetings with the Council, trilogues and conciliation meetings above all undermines the right of citizens of the Union to information and transparency and it is becoming a cause of concern reflecting, as it does, a certain democratic deficit within the Union institutions.  The Council should join the European Union Transparency Register to ensure transparency and accountability of the institution. Moreover, the Council should provide information on its process of administrative modernisation. Has the Council already introduced the process of organisation aimed at using modern management methods to be efficient? We call for the information on the process and we would like to see the anticipated impact on the Council’s budget. We also call on the Council to develop detailed anti-corruption guidelines and independent policies within its structures.

In the spring, we postponed the budget discharge because the Court of Auditors issued a qualified opinion. As you know, the two joint ventures no longer exist at the moment, they are united into one, in ECSEL, which will continue the activity. The reason for the Court of Auditors was that, due to the different regulations of these two joint ventures, it is not possible to calculate an error rate that is valid in terms of European Union rules, because the error rate is calculated according to national rules. In my opinion, this argument was not the best to consider. Therefore, we postponed the granting of the discharge, instead we asked the national courts of accounts to certify whether the activity of the two joint ventures was financially correct or not. And such official documents have been received from all the courts of accounts in the states that have worked with these two joint ventures, so we can now grant this budget discharge without any emotion, because there are documents that prove that the activity it was financially correct. At E for Energy it is a different situation. The ITER International Organization presented an action plan for the next period, an action plan which was rejected by the Commission and an evaluation by an external expert was requested. That is why we have postponed the budget discharge - to see the result of this evaluation. This evaluation was carried out, the result was positive, the action plan was very little corrected, it was approved by the Council of the ITER International Organization and, in this way, we could also propose the granting of the discharge for the domestic agency of the European Union. international organization.

The divergence between our two institutions on how to organise the discharge in relation to the Council’s budget is not new. However, I believe that there are a number of recent developments which, at least in the medium term, would allow us to move forward. According to Article 319 of the Treaty, ‘the European Parliament, acting on a recommendation from the Council, shall give a discharge to the Commission in respect of the implementation of the budget’. The Treaty and the Financial Regulation enumerate the documents to be examined during the discharge procedure. The Council has always rigorously respected these provisions. The Treaty procedure is specific to the EU institutional system. Nevertheless, in keeping with procedures in Member States, discharge is not given between the different arms of a budgetary authority. The Parliament has over the years developed a political practice of voting separate discharge resolutions for individual institutions and organs. In 2010 the Council proposed a memorandum of understanding between the two institutions in order to organise our cooperation. This standing invitation to a discussion has not been taken up by Parliament so far. Let me turn to the more positive and encouraging recent developments. This year we have made a big step towards increased transparency of the financially-relevant activities of all EU institutions. Since June, the annual activity reports of all authorising officers by delegation are publicly available on each institution’s website, including, of course, the Council. This is the result of last year’s agreement between Parliament and the Council to amend the financial regulation. Everybody now has access to core documents, which analyse the activities on which the institutions spend money. That is why the Council was a bit surprised to see, in your draft resolution, the reference to Parliament not having received the Council’s annual activity report. I guess that this is probably left over from previous years. A number of other suggestions formulated in Parliament’s draft resolution have also already become reality, for example the existence of rules concerning whistleblowing, integrity and ethics of officials in the General Secretariat of the Council. I would like to underline that, in the spirit of the proposed memorandum of understanding between our institutions that I mentioned before, the Council is open to dialogue with Parliament on concrete issues. I hear that in the area of building policy there have already been some contacts in the past. Let us work together on these positive experiences. Allow me a word on budget scrutiny. Your report says that the expenditure of the Council must be scrutinised in the same way as other institutions, and on occasion, statements made by some Members of the European Parliament have created the impression that the Council budget would escape all control. This is not true. It is as if the Treaty procedure, the Court of Auditors’ scrutiny and all the other documents and reports I mentioned before, did not exist. This is not helpful. It is even misleading. European citizens expect us to ensure the regularity, legality and efficiency of EU finances, and in this we either succeed together or we fail together. Citizens are not interested in quarrels between the EU institutions. I am confident that we are going in the right direction. As far as the implementation of the Council budget 2014 is concerned, the Court of Auditors has once again confirmed that no significant weaknesses were detected. The Council’s accounts did not give rise to any observations. I think it is important to have that in mind in this debate and when you cast your vote.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1676, "date": "2016-10-26.json", "name": "Corina CREȚU", "mepid": "33997", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, let me first thank the rapporteurs, Mr Czarnecki and Mr Marinescu, for their reports.  The Commission takes note of the proposal submitted by the Committee on Budgetary Control to the plenary to grant discharge to the joint technology initiative and embedded computing system ARTEMIS Joint Undertaking. the joint technology initiative on nan electronics ENIAC Joint Undertaking, the international thermonuclear experimental reactor Fusion for Energy Joint Undertaking and to refuse discharge to the European Council and Council for the financial year 2014.  As for the discharge to the European Council and Council, the Commission notes with regret this dispute between the two arms of the budgetary authorities, which has lasted for seven years now, thus preventing a suitable solution from being reached. The Commission can only encourage them to cooperate with a view to ironing out all their difficulties and to work towards a smooth functioning of the discharge procedure in full respect of the relevant provisions in the Treaty and in related secondary law.  The Commission is happy to note that Parliament’s Committee on Budgetary Control agrees that the ECSEL Joint Undertaking, which is the successor of ARTEMIS and ENIAC, as Mr Marinescu just said, has in a satisfactory manner implemented actions to address the remarks of the budgetary authorities and therefore proposes to grant discharge for the year 2014.  The Commission reiterates that in the ECSEL Joint Undertaking a structural solution is found for verification and ex post audit of any new expenditure related to Horizon 2020. In fact, Parliament already granted discharge to ECSEL on 28 April 2016. The Commission will, as a member of the Governing Board of ECSEL, continue to closely monitor the actions undertaken by the Joint Undertaking, inter alia to gain sufficient data on the quality of the control systems in place by the Member States and on the individual transactions. The Commission will also continue to share its experience in audit matters. Finally, the Commission reiterates that the public-private partnership, using a tripartite model that pools Member State and EU funding with industrial investments, as implemented in ARTEMIS and ENIAC and now in ECSEL, gives Europe a competitive edge in the domain of electronic components and systems.  The Commission also welcomes the proposal to grant discharge to the Joint Undertaking Fusion for Energy. ITER is a major international scientific collaboration in the energy field, in which the European Union has assumed a strategic leading role. Looking back at developments since 2006, when the ITER organisation was set up to jointly implement this project at international level, it should be recognised that ITER has faced many challenges, in particular in terms of technology, ITER being the first of a kind, project management, and risk of schedule slippage and cost increase. But, these challenges aside, ITER is one of the most promising solutions to future energy demand that can contribute to addressing global warming and climate change.  It is for this very significant reason that the international partners, with the major thrust of the European Union, have spared no efforts to change the way the project has been managed and implemented. During recent years radical changes have been jointly decided and successfully applied to stabilise the project and address the concerns on delays and cost overruns. A new management has been put in place in the ITER organisation and in Fusion for Energy and coordinated action plans have been endorsed to ensure a closer corporation.  Progress is now evident on the site, in particular in the construction of buildings under European responsibility. In addition and following the initiative of the European Union, this progress is now reviewed against a set of identified milestones for the activities with clear deadlines. A robust risk management system is also in place to reduce risk and address possible problems.  One of the partners’ main efforts has been the revision of the project’s schedule and its associated costs in June 2016. This revision set up solid and reliable grounds to complete the ITER construction successfully and enable the European Union to respect the budget for the construction phase of ITER until 2020, EUR 6.6 billion in 2008 values.  The improvements brought to the project are now reversing the project’s past trend. They enable ITER to remain one of the major international energy research projects and allow the European Union to keep its support and leadership of this project. These improvements, in particular since 2015, have also been confirmed by a different independent review in mid-2016. At European level Fusion for Energy is now also in a better shape to deliver the EU contribution to the project.  Let me add that through its contracts and grants European industry is fully involved in designing, building and delivering thousands of first of a kind technological components and carrying out research projects in support of the construction of this unique device. Already in its current construction phase ITER is therefore creating jobs and growth for European industry. With your favourable vote on the discharge you will enable the Joint Undertaking to continue providing, on behalf of Europe, a key contribution to the success of ITER. I thank you for your support and look forward to the continued dialogue between the Commission and Parliament to make ITER a success and a win for securing a sustainable energy source for the future.

What everyone else has done, including the Commission and the European Parliament itself.

The European Parliament is the only institution that is directly elected by citizens, and therefore we have a crucial role in this business. It is almost needless to say that granting discharge is one of the most, if not the most, important duty of this Parliament. But there are a few aspects of the discharge process where we urgently lack progress. First, the long-standing practice of Parliament’s right to check the use of money and to grant discharge separately to all institutions and bodies needs to be respected. The fact that the Council is stubbornly sticking to its interpretation of the procedure is a slap in tax payers’ faces, and undermines the reputation of the Union. We need to find a solution to this, and I think we will.  Secondly, in addition to an effective discharge process, Parliament has a right and duty to follow up previous years’ recommendations and their implementation; here also we need effective cooperation from all institutions and bodies. Thirdly, in order to increase democratic accountability and safeguard the reputation of the Union we need to strengthen the role of the Parliament in the discharge process. All institutions and bodies need to acknowledge their responsibility, and if not, there have to be consequences. It is like raising your kids; they will learn the ways that you let them learn.

The issue of the Council of the European Union and the European Council is the most urgent to be dealt with. The Council ought to be transparent and fully accountable to Union citizens for the funds entrusted to it by taking part fully and in good faith in the annual discharge procedure, just as other Union institutions do. Article 15 TFEU stipulates that each institution, body, office or agency is to ensure that its proceedings are transparent. In this regard, the effective supervision of the Union’s budget implementation requires cooperation between Parliament and the Council through a working arrangement. Here we have to clearly say that only three out of some 20 questions submitted to the Council by the Members of the Committee on Budgetary Control in relation to financial year 2014 within the discharge exercise, which means that there is still no proper cooperation and no correct dialogue. The expenditure of the Council must be scrutinised in the same way as the other institutions until the fundamental elements of such scrutiny have been laid down in its discharge resolutions of the past years. We, the Members of the European Parliament, are using here our competences laid down by the Treaties. Parliament’s prerogative to grant discharge is introduced by Articles 316, 317 and 319 of the Treaty, in line with current interpretation and practice, namely to grant discharge of each budget heading dually in order to maintain transparency and democratic compatibility towards Union taxpayers. Also, under Rule 94 of Parliament’s Rules of Procedure, the provisions governing the procedure for granting discharge to the Commission in respect of the implementation of the budget shall likewise apply to the procedure for granting discharge to persons responsible for the implementation of the budgets of other institutions and bodies of the European Union, such as the Council as regards its activity as executive. This is nothing new. Finally, we have to strongly say that the lack of cooperation between the European Council and the Council with the discharge authority constitutes a serious failure to comply with the obligation laid down by the Treaties, and we believe that the relevant stakeholders need to take the necessary steps to address this issue without further delay. It is also a negative sign to the citizens of the Union.
