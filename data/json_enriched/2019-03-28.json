Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank my fellow shadow rapporteurs from the committee very much for their valuable cooperation and for enriching my report and voting for it by a very large majority in the CULT Committee. The new 'Creative Europe' programme is part of a completely changed context compared to seven years ago, both for the digital revolution and for the need to respond to a major crisis of identity and belonging to Europe and its project. I consider it a great achievement of this parliamentary term to be our strong initiative to finally achieve a European framework of cultural policies, starting with the Year of Cultural Heritage, the strengthening of cultural and creative enterprises, the strategy of international cultural relations and intercultural dialogue, which are now fully included in the new culture agenda. A framework that also sees the creative and audiovisual sector finally inserted into a digital economy, into a digital ecosystem, in which the audiovisual media services directive and the one approved on Tuesday on copyright will determine new rules and also greater financial resources for the sector. As rapporteur, I am satisfied with the new elements in the text, starting with the doubling of the budget from 1.4 to 2.8 proposed to Parliament, and I hope that our indication will be defended by the future Parliament and accepted by the Council of Ministers and that there will therefore be no turning back. We have enriched the three sections of the programme – culture, media and cross-sectoral – with important innovations, starting with a new general objective, alongside that of cooperation and competitiveness, that is, the recognition of the intrinsic value of culture and the central role of artists and cultural professionals. We have reintroduced the article on European added value, also encouraging a narrative of common European roots, unity and diversity, and we have provided for structured action, including with European centres of excellence, to finally define qualitative and quantitative indicators of the impact of cultural policies. I am also delighted that my proposal, made as a former rapporteur for the previous 'Creative Europe' programme, to include a new European and international mobility programme for artists and cultural workers has been taken on board. The sector dedicated to culture is now finally strengthened and divided into four specific areas, which will become dedicated financial lines: music, cultural heritage, architecture, publishing and design. The media sector will support transnational actions to strengthen the skills of curricula in the audiovisual and digital fields, independent production, European co-productions, European cinema and video on-demand (VOD) networks, sales abroad, promotion of new production models and public involvement. We pay special attention to fiction, documentaries, children's films and animation, as well as interactive works including quality narrative video games and multimedia content. It is interesting to note that the programme will support the enhancement of artistic but also artisanal talents and, above all, for the first time a specific reference to the promotion of the recognition of the role of women in the cultural and artistic field is included. There are still too few on the boards of cultural institutions. We have introduced a new line on media literacy, an important action against fake news in support of the quality of journalism and, in addition to the co-financing grants for projects, we have developed important synergies, both with the new InvestEU programme, while maintaining the specificity and conditions of the current existing guarantee instrument for the sector, and with the regional development funds and the new external action financial instrument. Above all, however, we want the programme to be more accessible and to involve young people more. Let me give just two final examples: the new line of support - which I wanted to include and, which all my fellow Members have supported, and I am very happy about - to university radio and media networks that tell Europe to young people, in memory of Antonio Megalizzi and Bartek Orent-Niedzielski, the two young Europhonica journalists barbarically killed in the Strasbourg attack last December. And the second example: we have provided for an object of direct support, alongside the important European Film Academy in Berlin, the European Union Youth Orchestra, founded forty years ago by maestro Claudio Abbado and Lionel Bryer.

It’s a pleasure for me to be here to replace Commissioner Navracsics for this important plenary debate. Promoting cultural and linguistic diversity in Europe and boosting our cultural and creative sectors to ensure they remain world class are essential elements of the European project. Creative Europe has played a major role in this, which is why we want to build on and strengthen this programme after 2020. We want more Europeans to be able to enjoy the wealth of our diverse cultures, benefiting from their undisputed power to embody our common values and promote our shared European identity. I know that the rapporteur, Ms Costa, and her shadow rapporteurs fully support these goals. My sincere thanks go to you, Ms Costa, for the high—quality work you have done on this proposal and the excellent working relations we have enjoyed with you. To live up to our ambition, the Commission’s intention is to continue linking up professionals from different European countries through cooperation projects, partnerships and networks; to keep on connecting Europe’s beautiful audiovisual works with large international audiences; and to continue investing in cross—sectoral innovation. We will do all this because we believe it is the best way to enlarge the horizons of both creators and audiences, while at the same time developing good solutions to cultural issues of common concern across borders. But we also want to support our cultural and creative sectors in adapting to new challenges and making the most of opportunities that are opening up in times of rapid change. This is why we have proposed some new features: a new international window; individual mobility for artists and cultural operators; support for specific cultural sectors, such as music books and publishing; architectural and cultural heritage; a stronger focus on Europe’s audiovisual talents, especially women; encouraging creative spaces for script writing; initiatives to enhance promotion and marketing for European books in Europe and beyond; new innovative cross—sectoral actions, encompassing new technologies such as virtual reality and artificial intelligence for content creation, distribution and promotion; and also a scheme to promote a diverse and pluralistic media environment in Europe, including through media literacy. Dear Members of Parliament, I am pleased that you welcome these novelties and, more generally, that you agree on the ambition, the architecture and the objectives we propose. As you know, the Commission and also the Council Presidency were keen to reach a partial first-reading agreement before the end of this legislature. This would have sent a clear signal to the European citizens about the importance we attach to this programme and to the cultural diversity and richness that makes Europe unique and defines our identities. It would also have helped us to put everything in place to be able to start implementing the new programme in time before it starts in 2021. The Commission therefore regrets that this programme is among the few where negotiations will not have started before the elections. We are very much looking forward to the future negotiations and our continued excellent cooperation. I am confident that we can find a swift agreement on the issues where our institutions hold slightly diverging views, as we all agree on the importance and the general thrust of the programme. The European Parliament and the Committee on Culture and Education (CULT) in particular have always been an ally for the Commission when it came to working together for the benefit of our cultural and creative professions and professionals in Europe.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "PPE"}, {"id": 3, "date": "2019-03-28.json", "name": "John HOWARTH", "mepid": "188636", "text": "  rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Budgets. – Madam President, I’m pleased to say that the Committee on Budgets recognised the Creative Europe programme as an important investment budget, acknowledged the importance of the creative industries, and substantially increased the MMF envelope over the Commission’s original proposal.

I hope that the representatives of the Member States will uphold this budgetary decision while working on the shape of the future budget for 2021-2027, as our objectives are very ambitious.  As before, the MEDIA sub-programme will support the development, distribution and promotion of European films and television programmes. In the coming years, investment in the international production and distribution of European works and innovative ways of telling stories, including works based on virtual reality, will be increased. An online catalogue of European films will be created to increase the accessibility and visibility of European works.  The CULTURE sub-programme, in turn, aims to support the promotion of the European cultural and creative sectors. It is within this sub-programme that projects, networks and collaborative platforms will be created, bringing together talented artists from all over Europe and facilitating international cooperation between creators. A new element of this component will be to support the music sector. This is a huge success for the 'Music for Europe' pilot project, which will be included in this programme.  As a former journalist, I am pleased that the novelty of the cross-sectoral section is the financing of the media and investigative journalism sector.

They are the true backbone of Europe's cultural diversity, capable of innovating, undertaking and narrating the stories and traditions of local territories. The European Union must concentrate its efforts and resources on them. I am therefore particularly pleased that my proposals have been approved to include specific support for small independent audiovisual productions, as well as for young emerging music artists, who will have access to specific funding.

More than a billion euros has been spent on the current creative Europe programme, and in return I must note the creative sector overwhelmingly backed EU membership during the UK referendum. We certainly had our artists for Brexit who did not, but those at the commanding heights of our cultural institutions were generally in favour of staying in. Fortunately, the Great British public had other ideas and did not follow the direction of those we refer to somewhat sarcastically as the great and the good.  Now there’s no doubt that the creative sector is an area in which Europe has a competitive advantage. Were you to ask people the world over which continent has the richest cultural heritage, it is difficult to imagine Europe not coming top. We’ve had most of the greatest painters, classical composers, writers and architects the world has ever seen. It’s also true that down the ages many writers, artists and musicians have depended on wealthy patrons to further their careers. The Royal Court of the Habsburg Empire was a noted sponsor of art and music, for instance, so it’s perhaps no surprise to find the court of the Juncker empire following suit. The danger is, though, that yes, indeed he who pays the piper calls the tune.  The various strands of creative Europe naturally place a high value on funding activities that elevate the European collective identity above national identities. In this, the attention, I think, is to promote the creation of a European demos which trumps national affinities, and such a demos is certainly required to make sense of the EU’s mania for ever-closer union, but there’s little sign of its emergence. The danger is that subsidised culture becomes dull culture, lured towards safe and politically correct choices that won’t rock the boat with the sponsor.  In the case of the Habsburgs, it was the uninspiring Salieri who retained the lucrative position of court composer, and not the genius Mozart. I’m sure in the years ahead the next creative Europe programme will help some talented creatives with their careers.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Thyssen, I would like to respond immediately to what the Commissioner said at the beginning, saying that I appreciate her contribution to our report and the great cooperation we have had. We believe that, precisely because this new programme is so ambitious – and we share this ambition – and proposes so many new lines of funding, expenditure and action, it is absolutely necessary to accompany the negotiations with knowledge and the ability to assess the resources available. That is why we believe that it was important to have a first reading, to approve it today in Parliament, to close a text which will be the basis for the forthcoming negotiations. However, without understanding what resources will be available, the negotiations would risk being somewhat in the dark and would also reduce the possibility of developing all the actions envisaged. Since this is an underfunded programme, with a project success rate of 15% in culture and an average of 40%, we risk fuelling expectations without having the resources. We therefore believe that the next Council and the next Parliament must absolutely ensure this coherence. As far as resources are concerned, I give very brief answers. I am not going to say all my colleagues, but I thank them very much for having spoken, also in a very kind way towards me, but I think we have done a wonderful job together. First of all: resources. Some people say that there are too many of them, someone who is too few: it is interesting. There are certainly too few of them, but I would like to say that we have done something, because there is now a stronger and more certain synergy with other programmes: I am talking about the Structural Funds, I am talking about the policy of international cooperation, also with the seal of excellence, and then we finally have greater capacity also on the investment front, with the European guarantee provided for by InvestEU. The other notation is that we wanted to hold together – we know that this is a great challenge – freedom and cultural diversity, not by replacing them, but by promoting them and also by supporting a European cultural area, of confrontation, dialogue and partnerships. We also wanted to strengthen , and above all – and I say this with reference to my fellow Member's statement that he is no longer there and who perhaps has not read the text – a third objective, alongside cooperation and competitiveness, which does not refer to a commercial approach, but rather to the intrinsic value of artists' culture, art and society. So, I reject this kind of comment. We therefore hold together the cultural and artistic part, the design of a shared cultural area and also, of course, the cultural, artistic and audiovisual industry, which must also be strengthened through the copyright directive, which we mentioned earlier. I will conclude by saying that we really do have this great responsibility, which has been recognised by many colleagues, in particular that of having made this programme an instrument, which today has greater centrality, but is not a solitary instrument, but is part of a cultural strategy – the development of which in recent years has been attributed to the CULT Committee – which today sees greater centrality of culture and the cultural dimension in all European policies. This is the great novelty with which, I hope, the new Parliament, the new Council and the new Commission will be confronted and on which, I hope, no backward steps will be taken.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 24, "date": "2019-03-28.json", "name": "Sylvie GUILLAUME", "mepid": "96952", "text": "  The debate is closed.

Erasmus+ is a symbol of European integration, a symbol of Europe that cares for young people, a Europe that cares about citizens and is a true European success story.  Since 1987, more than 9 million students, students, apprentices, teachers, youth workers, adults and athletes have participated in the programme. The programme is breaking records year after year, several projects are funded each year, participation is increasing.  It seems that around 4 million Europeans will take part in various forms of erasmus participation during this period. For the period 2021-2027, as many as 12 million participants are predicted. These figures sound nice, but we know that between 2014 and 2020, Erasmus will only be able to support 3.7% of young people in Europe.  So there is a huge demand in Erasmus, and there is always too little money. Mobility, both, and for many other projects. If students were to receive higher scholarships, many more would apply for exchanges. If more resources were available, we would not have to reject so many good, quality youth projects.  That is why, for the period 2021-2027, that is to say, for the next financial budget, the perspective, I have proposed a threefold increase in funding, from €15 billion to €45 billion.  If we want to triple the number of participants, if we want to add three major new initiatives and if we want to make the programme more accessible, then doubling the funds proposed by the European Commission will not be enough.  In preparing the report on the new Erasmus, I wanted, above all, to strengthen and improve traditional activities or sub-programmes, including mobility and various projects. At the same time, I wanted to secure three major new initiatives, the Find out the European Union initiative, the Network of European Universities and the Centres of Professional Excellence, which will be part of the post-2021 programme.  Compared to the Commission's proposal, we have proposed a significant increase in funding for vocational education, schools, sport and adults in Parliament. Let me also list some of the innovations that we have supported and upgraded in Parliament.  The new Erasmus will provide more opportunities for smaller projects and smaller organisations that have so far had difficulties accessing the programme. The new Erasmus will provide more opportunities for learning foreign languages, mobility of schoolchildren and teachers in schools, mobility of pre-school educators and more opportunities for mobility and adult projects. Mobility will also be a novelty for sports coaches and for individual athletes.  As the report shows, one of my main priorities was to make the programme more easy for users in the next cycle and to be inclusive, accessible and fair for all groups of young and older people, regardless of economic situation and other circumstances, e.g. disability.  For those who have difficulty accessing the programme, people with fewer opportunities, we have proposed a series of specific measures. On the one hand, better information and, on the other hand, financial support, if necessary.  In the report, we have put more emphasis on the importance of European added value, which does not mean, of course, that all activities must be transnational.  We have also called for a greater role for Parliament so that not only the European Commission will set and decide on the annual priorities.  In addition to financial mobility, the new Erasmus will also enable virtual and mixed cooperation, which we naturally support. At the same time, we want transparency to keep separate records for physical, i.e. real mobility, and virtual mobility activities. We do not want the numbers to be inflated by how many people in Europe are mobile, when many would in fact be sitting at home at home at home. Finally, let me express my sincere thanks to the shadow rapporteurs for their constructive cooperation. Our negotiations have not been easy, but the end result is so much better.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sl", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 28, "date": "2019-03-28.json", "name": "Marianne THYSSEN", "mepid": "1832", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, I am pleased to join you today for this debate on the future Erasmus programme. I think we all agree that Erasmus is the European Union’s most iconic programme and one of its biggest success stories. Erasmus is a true expression of what the European Union stands for and what it can do for our people. It has changed the lives of millions of Europeans and changed them for the better.  With this in mind, the Commission has tabled an ambitious proposal for a new Erasmus programme. We propose to double the budget and build on the success of the current programme. At the same time, we propose to add some promising new elements. Let me first of all thank the rapporteur, Mr Zver, and his shadow rapporteurs, as well as all the Members of the Committee on Culture and Education (CULT) and, of course, of the other committees that give an opinion, and all those who have contributed to this report. The Commission is fully aware that the programme and its participants from universities, FET colleges, apprentices and high schools, are just as dear to you as they are to us. I would therefore like to take this occasion to wholeheartedly thank you for your enthusiasm and for your support for the Commission’s proposal.  The Commission is also happy to see that our two institutions have largely converging positions on most features of the future programmes. We share the Parliament’s objectives to make the programme even more inclusive, to make it simpler for our beneficiaries and to further exploit the potential for synergies with other sources of EU funding. Fundamentally, we want Erasmus to reach more people and especially people from diverse socio—economic backgrounds. We want Erasmus to become more open to smaller organisations, notably by cutting the paperwork. We also want to boost mobility for school pupils, learners in vocational education and training, and for youth exchanges. This will strongly diversify the profile of Erasmus participants. I know that this House takes a lot of interest in synergies and complementarities between EU funding programmes, and I can assure you that Erasmus will benefit from this. For example, the future European Social Fund Plus could top up individual mobility grants to support people with fewer opportunities or skill up the results of successful Erasmus projects. For this to become a reality, we need to involve all actors, including at national and regional level. What matters most is that we put funding to its best and most efficient use. The future Erasmus programme will also be instrumental in creating a genuine European education area by 2025, where learners can move freely across borders and between disciplines, and where education and training systems are inclusive, innovative and geared towards lifelong learning. I appreciate that you support the Commission in this effort. In order to help turn this vision into reality, the future Erasmus programme will support ambitious new initiatives, such as the European Universities Initiative or the Centres of Vocational Excellence. They have the potential to become new flagships of the programme, together with the new DiscoverEU initiative. The idea for DiscoverEU, namely to offer 18-year-old young people a ticket to travel Europe, has enormous potential, especially if it is reinforced with a strong learning dimension, as you rightly request.  It’s now important that we negotiate the new programme quickly so that it will soon be a reality. The Commission therefore regrets that the Parliament is not willing to start negotiations for Erasmus before the elections, while the Commission and the Presidency would have been keen to do so. We would consider it a pity if this well-known and successful programme risked delays in kicking off due to a late start of the negotiations. The Commission believes that this report provides a good basis to reach an agreement between the institutions swiftly. I am convinced that the European Parliament will again be a powerful ally in creating a strong and vibrant new Erasmus programme. Rest assured that the Commission will be an honest broker in this process.

Madam President, I in turn would like to congratulate the Commission on its initiative. Erasmus is a programme that speaks to Europeans, it is obviously a great success. It is the one that contributes to the best investment we can make, that is to enable young people to give themselves the means to understand the world, probably to have access to a professional capacity, and it is also to train talent for the competitiveness of companies. So, Commissioner, I will make three observations, three wishes, on behalf of the Committee on Budgets. First, it is to increase the appropriations. And if the discussion with the Council is having a hard time starting, it is because we do not know the Council's position. Doubling the appropriations compared to the 2014-2020 MFF is not enough and we could have appropriations below the Erasmus credits of 2020 in 2021. So we have to increase the appropriations. The second concern is to simplify procedures. And finally: democratize Erasmus. Today, for long mobility, the one that is profitable because there is an immersion, it is mainly the students who benefit. What we want is for professional learners, apprentices and professional trainees to benefit from Erasmus scholarships and have long mobility. Member States should also be suggested to use cohesion funds, the Regional Development Fund and the European Social Fund to set up centres of excellence.

This is, I believe, the purpose of the Erasmus+ programme and that is the secret to its success so far. However, in order to continue at the same level, I still believe that the programme needs more funding. We, both in the Committee on Employment and in the Committee on Culture, have proposed a tripling, and I hope that the Council will also come and support this. I also believe that there is a need to improve communication between beneficiaries, the European Commission and national bodies. Last but not least, in the digital age there is a need for simplification, increased accessibility and reduced bureaucracy. And we must not forget that Erasmus+ must become more inclusive, it must also ensure access for the disadvantaged and those with disabilities, and it must clearly ensure equality between women and men.

It has the potential to reach a large number of young people, influence their future careers and also their ideas about Europe. This is important today, when people are closing down and when various disinformation campaigns are spreading.  We have promised to do our utmost to increase the budget of this programme.

Madam President, I would like to thank the president for her My long-term goal is to enable every young person to have an Erasmus experience without compromising on quality and length. The real tripling of funding, which Parliament is calling for, is an absolutely necessary step towards moving closer to this objective. We do not accept that the principle of \"mass instead of class\" applies, that stays may be shortened and replaced by virtual encounters. That would be the consequence of the Commission's proposal to triple the number of participants by doubling the number of participants.  By focusing more on vocational education and training, adult education and schooling, we are enabling more young people to have better access to the programme. Student exchanges remain at the heart of the programme and will not suffer from these innovations.  We also call for a return to the wider use of lump sums. The application procedures must finally become simpler and more comprehensible. Proposals that are longer than ten pages must finally be part of history.  With all due respect for the way money is handled, we are not asking for billions of dollars in research money, but want to continue their education in exchange with young people from other countries. This must finally be taken into account when applying for and billing.  Finally, we call for an ambitious inclusion strategy that can really implement the participation of all young Europeans in a way that is free of discrimination and barrier-free. Also, participation in an Erasmus programme, in an Erasmus measure, must not depend on the parents' wallets.  My appeal today goes to the Council: give yourself a jolt and join Parliament's call for a tripling of the funds! You cannot always talk about the importance of Erasmus and then be unwilling to open your wallet. After all, it is about bringing people together in Europe and paving the way for Europe's youth to find the future. That should be worth EUR 41 billion to us.

With regard to this Regulation, these are some of our concrete proposals for the parliamentary report: increasing funding to triple the current budget; increase the number of participants and increase the participation of people from disadvantaged backgrounds; promote the european university network initiative aimed at building a European education area.  Our aim is to propose transnational partnerships that will constitute the European universities of the future, promoting European values and identity and revolutionizing the quality and competitiveness of our higher education.  The programme also integrates an important international dimension, pursuing a dual objective: on the one hand, facilitating young people to travel and international mobility, promoting teaching and research; and, on the other hand, support dialogue between countries and promote cultural relations between the Union and third countries, creating projects for the development and modernization of educational mechanisms in partner countries.  For all these reasons, we consider the Erasmus+ programme to be a winning programme of the European Union; the Erasmus programme is the most successful initiative in the field of education: more than 10 million people have participated in this programme since its launch in 1987.

I believe the new programme will be simpler, more open to all individuals from all education sectors and phases, and will help tackle many of the problems we face.  And finally, if we leave the EU, the loss of Erasmus to Wales would be a huge blow. That is why I am pleased that this report allows for the continued participation of third countries.

Madam President, strengthening the sense of belonging to Europe among citizens is the purported objective that the Commission is attaching to the Erasmus programme, which has become Erasmus or which wants to become Erasmus again, it is no longer clear. This would be all the more urgent, of course, in the wake of Brexit. These are just wishful thinking.  Of course, Erasmus mobility, through the discovery of other spaces, cultures and languages, is a wonderful opportunity to see what we have in common and what sets us apart. Unfortunately, nothing is done to deepen these discoveries during mobility. Indeed, mobility beyond Europe is increasingly encouraged. It is difficult to see, for example, how the fact that Tunisia is the number one destination outside Europe among the French reinforces European identity. Moreover, the Commission, rather than encouraging national agencies to introduce local heritage to mobility beneficiaries, prefers to offer interrail passes to those who have just turned 18, i.e. those who are going to vote for the first time. It does not seek to encourage the discovery of other cultures, which is more like a long stay than crossing the continent by train. I think everyone agrees on that. But simply, we want to influence the citizens' vote.  Finally, this report is certainly interested in language learning, but still does not make it compulsory to learn the language of the host country. Instead, it facilitates digital learning and no doubt it will be English that will be chosen.  In short, for the Commission, our identity is to be found elsewhere and only migrants, who are offered language courses, have the right to take root.

If we managed to get a passport from the Communist authorities, we hitchhiked with a backpack on European highways. We absorbed those famous places that worked so much on our imagination: monuments, museums, landscapes. We knocked on the gates of European universities to study at Western European universities, often facing refusal or the need for fees that we could not afford.  Today, Europe is an opening for students seeking knowledge. This is a European investment in the future of our continent. I therefore believe that 'Erasmus+' will be the focus of the Heads of State who will decide on the size of the budget for this programme.

Erasmus has become indeed an iconic brand, symbolising the added value of the European integration project for our citizens. It contributes greatly to achieving the objectives of the first principle of the European Pillar, which is about access to education, training and lifelong learning. We agree with you that the programme can be and should be more accessible and inclusive, and this is why co-funding from other funds, such as ESF+, will be possible, also by doubling the budget we intend to triple the number of people participating in a learning experience abroad. Honourable Members of Parliament, this is not a trick. By boosting traditional mobility, by adding new and more flexible mobility formats, by optimising the grant levels, and by providing targeted financial incentives, we estimate that we can reach 12 million people from different backgrounds.  Thank you for this rich discussion and for your support in achieving this goal, also in the name of my colleague, Tibor Navracsics. I’m certain that together we will make this programme bigger and even better than it is today, and that it has the budget to meet this ambition.

Dear colleagues, thank you for this debate, in which many of you have pointed out that Erasmus+ is, however, building a European identity. Some opposed it.  However, I would like to point out that Erasmus+ also supports the creation of a personal identity, regional, including national, and that this is not ruled out by European identity.  In the budget, Erasmus is part of the chapter 'Investing in people'. I believe that investing in Erasmus is also investing in the future of Europe, and i therefore call again, in the end, on the European Commission and the Member States to support a three-fold increase in the budget in the trialogue.  Member States often hesitate when it comes to increase funding for European programmes, especially when it comes to so-called soft policies such as education or youth policies.  However, let me recall that last year the European Council placed the Erasmus+ programme among the four main priorities for the post-2020 period, in addition to security, defence and migration. I therefore call on the Member States not to forget this commitment.  I am aware that negotiations with the Commission and the Council will not be easy, it is by far the largest increase in funding for any programme. However, I am grateful to all the political groups that have supported this joint effort, and I therefore believe that the European Parliament negotiator will have a strong mandate.  Ideally, we should complete the trialogue by the end of 2019, or at least in the first half of 2020, thus allowing for a smooth transition from the current to the future long-term budget.

In 2017, the Commission has retained the actual structure of the programme, but has also included some key conclusions from the mid-term review and parliament's resolution of 2 February 2017. The reports on the new Erasmus+ proposal make it clear that the new programme will place particular emphasis on wider access and strengthening social inclusion. Firstly, only the Member States and the Commission are required to step up their efforts and to allow for adjustments to grants. Parliament therefore attaches more importance to inclusion measures by including a separate inclusion section in the legal text and by requiring Member States to develop an inclusion strategy based on certain possible parameters within the framework established by the Commission.

In principle, this file really is about putting the money where your mouth is. That’s basically what we’re doing with this file. I just want to remind all my colleagues who were always celebrating the Paris Agreement about how important it is that we – as Europe – are leading by example.  It is also very important where we put our money. Where are the investments going? How do we ensure that our investments become Paris-proof? We are talking about shifting trillions of euros of investments here, and if we do that in the right way, we can help the financial sector and our industry to move to a green economy, which is the future. This is also being debated. We are debating at the Council level our zero—emission economy, a climate-neutral economy. If we want to get there, we need the right incentives; we need the right investments. We also need the right definitions, and that is exactly what is at stake here today. First of all, the taxonomy will describe and determine what a green investment is. Parliament is making some good proposals on really defining what a green investment is in order to prevent greenwashing. That is very important, because there are many green products on the market, but quite often we do not know exactly what their environmental impact is, what their green impact is. By adopting this taxonomy, we will put transparent standards on what green financing means, and that is very important to have. Of course, there are still some amendments on the table to make very clear what, in our mind, should not be considered a green investment. I will also ask my colleagues, are you really going to accept that later on an investment in coal can still be called green? While we are discussing the phasing out of coal in every country, any investment in coal cannot be seen as a green investment. This is just simple logic, and I hope that Parliament will follow that logic. We also have some other discussions to follow, because green investment is still a niche; it’s still a small part of the investments. The big part of the investments are not claiming to be green, but are still being done. Therefore, we deliberately opened up the discussion on defining when an activity is non—green. There has been a lot of lobbying out there really talking a lot of nonsense, as if we were forbidding activities; as if we were not giving a chance for industry to green. What we are doing is to show for every investment what the environmental impact is. If you have a downgrading of your impact, of course that should be highlighted, just like you highlight when you have a very positive green impact. It is not forbidding; it is not blacklisting; it is just providing transparency to the market. Hopefully, that will have an impact on the market, so that our finances will go from brown investments to more green investments. That is exactly what we need if we want to be Paris-proof. The last point that is on the table: if we talk about sustainable finance, it should not only be green, it should also be social. We are putting some proposals for minimum safeguards, but we know that it is very difficult for many people to accept. When we are talking about sustainable finance, you cannot avoid discussing what the social implications of sustainable finance are, and that too is on the table today.

EUR 30 trillion! That is millions of millions. That means that our pensions are threatened in the longer run if change is not made. It means that our economy is at risk and threat of a crises when change is going to come. And it means that our environment is under threat because we are investing in the wrong end of the economy. But then again, the good news is that EUR 30 trillion is a lot of money and as we have a clear indication what kind of investments are environmentally—friendly, sustainable and not causing significant harm in other fields, then we have plenty of money to turn the wheel and support environmentally—sustainable economies and investments. We need only EUR 180 billion every year to invest in combating climate change. So, we do have the money, but it is in the wrong place. The question is about transferring that money from economically and environmentally risky investments to more sustainable investments.  There, we need a harmonised indicator so we really can compare industries to industries within a sector and between sectors. We need to define – and this is what this legislation is all about – the environmental requirements and, in the future, as a backstop, the social requirements that we consider to be sustainable. What that means is that in the case of palm oil, for example, you can’t focus on one issue like climate change and say this is a good investment if it causes significant harm in other fields of the environment like biodiversity in Indonesia and orang-utans. We know this to be the case with palm oil. And you couldn’t build a solar panel unit in a nature conservation area and claim it is green. And no, I don’t think that you could produce solar panels or any other green niceties with child labour. So the reference to significant environmental harm or other harm and the backstop makes consistent sense of how we understand and define sustainability.  The financial sector is already much more advanced than setting green indicators and reporting mechanisms. For the majority of politicians in Member States – and let’s see what the figures are here, in the European Parliament – the issue is that now when we do not have a harmonised taxonomy they lose comparability, and the information they have does not have as big an impact as it should. But we, as politicians, shouldn’t perform worse than the markets are doing already. That brings us to some of the specific issues here in the file. First, coal. Frankly, with climate change, could you really call a coal investment a green investment? Put that question to yourselves. Second question, could you really call investments that follow only basic national legislation a green investment? My interpretation is that if you do not break the law you are not a criminal, but it does not mean that your activity would be green. So yes, there need to be some better standards that normal activity to be labelled green and sold as green investments.  It is important that we get it right this time, because investors do need transparency, predictability and long-term guidance from this regulation.

I would like to thank you for your strong will and ambition, ensuring that the European Parliament could form its views quickly and effectively, which has led to this vote today. As you know, this file has raised some heated discussions between the committees, but this is why I welcome even more a strong commitment from the European Parliament to adopt this text. It will improve the ability of the financial sector to take part in the fight against climate change. It will deepen the single market for green financial services, and it will protect EU consumers from greenwashed financial products.  You already know that in order to boost sustainable investment, we need a shared understanding of what sustainability entails. This is why creating an EU taxonomy is a cornerstone for our strategy. It fills an important gap because it establishes a common understanding of which economic activities can help reach climate and other environmental objectives.  We heard time and again at the conference on a global approach to sustainable finance last Thursday, at which high-level representatives from many countries outside the EU, including China, Japan, India, Morocco and Hong Kong, were present, that in order to scale up sustainable investment, we need to start by having a common taxonomy. The high-level representatives are looking to the EU for that. Once complete, this taxonomy will help us develop labels for sustainable financial products or funds. It will support disclosure and reporting by financial institutions and companies on climate and environmental activities or risks and it will support standardisation, which is also necessary and called for by many jurisdictions.  For example, if asset managers and institutional investors disclose how they have used the taxonomy in the design of their green products, this will help end investors compare products on how green they are. The taxonomy will also be one of the key elements in the upcoming EU green bond standard. Finally, since financial markets are global, the EU will promote international convergence and alignment of those crucial tools to the extent possible. In practice, the taxonomy and its applications will have many advantages for companies and investors. Companies and project promoters will be better able to raise private capital to finance their sustainable activities. European companies will have a clear standard of what qualifies as sustainable for the purposes of raising finance. Polluting sectors will be encouraged to move onto more sustainable pathways by including activities that contribute to a reduction of emissions. The taxonomy will help them attract capital to finance this transition and financial companies looking to finance sustainable projects often say that there are too few investable projects and it’s too hard to search them out. The taxonomy will clarify this and help investors identify bankable and viable green projects, and it will also protect consumers from greenwashed products by providing clarity to end investors who are interested in sustainable investment, but currently have little information about what is sold to them.  I believe that our European sustainable finance strategy can be a game changer, both for us and for other jurisdictions. By harmonising the way we classify sustainable investments, we can and will continue to be a front runner on sustainable finance globally.  We will start with climate impact and then look at sustainability more broadly with a step-by-step approach. Honourable Members, right now we are at an historic juncture. We have one decade to mitigate the worst impact of climate change on our citizens, businesses and planet as a whole. Climate-focused policies are no longer optional but necessary, and we are refocusing our policies in this way across many sectors.

Mr President, sustainable investing: indeed, many banks and financial institutions are already working on it and consumers are always looking for more environmentally friendly financial products, but often they no longer see the forest among the trees. That is why this framework that we are going to adopt here today is important. The legislation we are about to adopt creates a clear framework for which investments can be described as sustainable, as environmentally friendly, climate-friendly. And this can only be achieved if we make a clear contribution to environmental and climate objectives without at the same time causing harm.  We all know that very large investments will have to be made in the coming years in order to get into a climate-friendly environment: in the steel sector, in chemistry, in cement, you name it. Also in renewable energy, energy efficiency. With this legislation, investments in clean and sustainable technology receive clear and justified support. This is indeed an important step forward that can and will bring about a revolution in the financial world. You, Mr. Vice-President, have rightly spoken of a gamechanger. I think that's obvious. Not all ambitions, Mr Eickhout, are in this text, but sometimes it is also true that it is good not to overload the boat, because that sometimes brings misery.

They are increasingly interested in the impact of the production of the goods they buy on the environment, on the climate or on animal welfare. These important motivations are sometimes used by rogue producers, so harmonised methods for determining what investments are sustainable can bring tangible benefits and curb unfair practices.  However, I believe that the subject needs to be approached with some caution so that this framework for determining sustainable investments can work in practice. First of all, there is no point in determining which investments are bad for the environment. We have a lot of regulations in the European Union that limit the environmental harm of economic activity. If someone does not break these rules, there is no reason to punish him. Rather, let us reward good practices.  Morethily, there is no point in adding a social assessment at this stage. I am most in favour of social justice and the protection of workers, but for the time being it is better to limit myself to an environmental assessment, and only after experience has been gained to see whether it will be possible to assess the impact on workers' rights later on.

After more than a year of negotiations, I am convinced that today there is a majority in favour of a progressive and balanced text, one that gives us a question and an answer to the question: what is sustainability? An answer that the financial world urgently needs to make sustainable products. Financial products that will soon be on sale for you, for me and for every other European.

Yes, moving investment towards ecological transition and sustainability is critical; as Eickhout said, move the billions of euros that move every day and that move our economy forward and function.  To this end, there are three main objectives: to change these investments, to move them towards sustainable investments; define well what is and what is not sustainable investment; and put the financial sector under strict climate control. And for that there are some things that we have to do that are very important. Firstly, not only to regulate investments that are already sustainable, but to cover the whole financial sector, which I believe has been the effort that has been made with this Regulation. Second, define a list of what are not sustainable investments. And I fully agree: we cannot include issues such as coal, such as shale gas, such as intensive animal husbandry as sustainable investments. This is beyond any logic. Third, too, to have a strict definition of what sustainable investment is and not to allow a certain greenwashing or for someone to put the sustainable investment seal on something that is not.  And finally, when we talk about sustainable investments, we cannot forget the social dimension, which is fundamental.

This is strange because the European Central Bank has been raising money for years and investment interest rates are currently at record low levels.

The watchword: to regenerate the places of life in use to human capital, within the renewed attention to sustainability, to counter any form of insult to the ecosystem and people's health, to affirm the idea that poverty must be combated, precisely, with choices of vision. It therefore seems to us necessary to link together the most important political choices of recent years: the vision of a fairer, fairer Europe, which combats inequalities, which is more attentive to the health of citizens and workers, which is growing respectful of the environment and social rights. In fact, the Europe of rights and equal opportunities. That is why it is important for us to start firmly planting our roots for a social taxonomy.

The opposition that we’ve heard in this House to climate action is actually about protecting the profits of corporations and financial institutions above our future, and everyone knows it. The millions of schoolchildren who have been striking from school to march on the streets across Europe and around the world know it. They demand real action – not tokenism, not carbon taxes – real action, such as a 100% renewable energy by 2030. You call them idealistic, but actually they are the ones who are being realistic. We can’t compromise or negotiate with the laws of physics or chemistry.

The European Commission has prepared criteria to determine whether an investment contributes to the transformation of the European economy towards environmental and climate objectives. Our task is to fight climate change ambitiously, which is why I support the European Commission's proposal.  At the same time, however, I believe that the approach to sustainable financing must be realistic and based on technological neutrality. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions should go hand in hand with preserving the competitiveness of European industry. We should consider the widest possible range of technologies that support the fight against climate warming.  Unfortunately, the proposal put forward by the rapporteurs threatens to eliminate a whole range of investments aimed at reducing CO2 emissions. The arbitrary exclusion of certain technologies will lead to a situation where sustainable financing concerns a very narrow group of investments and does not have economies of scale. We cannot support solutions that, a priori and administratively, exclude entire industrial sectors from access to sustainable finance.  I believe that our task is to create incentives and mobilise industry for low-carbon activities, not to penalise it. Stigmatising and punishing entire sectors is not needed.

We cannot go back to them after five to ten years, like it is with the 2030 targets on climate reduction, and say ‘look, we got it wrong, now we are changing the rules of the game once again’, and after five or ten years go back and say ‘look, actually, palm oil was a huge mistake, you shouldn’t invest in it’ – because the money and investment is already there.  This means that we have to bear our responsibility. We have to set that kind of a taxonomy that takes other aspects other than just climate on board, that gives the right incentives and guidance for investors and that is reliable from the investment perspective for the upcoming 30 years.

In this regard, the social and economic crisis in recent years has, unfortunately, further deepened inequalities between regions. In this regard, I would like to emphasize two important areas. In the first place, the lack of or insufficient reference to culture in the legislative texts creates additional obstacles for the sector to apply for European funds. This, in turn, is problematic, because when we talk about poor, lagging regions in the Union, we must keep in mind that a large part of them rely mainly on European funding. Secondly, I believe that future cohesion policy must make it a priority to tackle the demographic crisis.

Almost nobody ever stands back and asks whether these cohesion and regional grants have any impact. If they did, then the major recipient regions would now be very wealthy, and we would have seen the spectacle of Greek taxpayers being asked to bail out Germany. The reason that they do not work is, first of all, because the money goes primarily to buy the loyalty of NGOs, local government associations and the like, in order to bind them into the European project. Secondly, because it creates perverse incentives – people find it easier to arrange their affairs to qualify for a pot of money, than to make things, sell things or create wealth.

of the Union, as such a policy simply does not exist under the Treaties.At the same time, it is unwise and short-sighted to demand the introduction of induced abortions in Arab countries.In these, the vast majority of citizens fundamentally reject for deep-rooted cultural reasons.The European Union is thus weakening its position and freeing up space for other world players, especially China.",

Last year, the Vienna Parliament passed a law adjusting the allowances of children of foreign workers who do not live with their parents in Austria to the cost of living in the countries in which they reside. This measure implies a substantial reduction in the allowances for children in Eastern Europe from 1 January 2019. However, the legislation adopted violates European Union regulations on the coordination of social security systems. They provide for common rules for the payment of family benefits for workers employed in another Member State. Mobile workers - and I emphasize here - mobile workers are entitled to the same child allowances as local workers, regardless of where their children live. The Treaty prohibits any form of direct or indirect discrimination against workers on the grounds of nationality. European workers must enjoy the same rights, and the European Commission cannot tolerate discriminatory actions, which affect the idea of ​​unity, solidarity at European level, actions that fully contribute to the aggravation of the feeling that in the European Union there could be first-class citizens and rank II. We emphasize that we are talking about the children of those who have legally concluded employment contracts and pay taxes to the Austrian state, children who stay away from their parents, whom they see only at Easter or Christmas, who do not have the parental kiss at night. good and who do not have that much-needed parental upbringing and education.

For me, the discussion is about fairness and equal treatment. You have heard me say before that there are no second-class workers in the Union and I’ve always insisted on equal pay for equal work at the same place. We ensured this key principle when we revised the rules for posted workers. Equal treatment also means equal benefits.  When mobile workers contribute to a social security and tax system in the same way as local workers do, they should receive the same benefits, regardless of where the children live abroad. There should be no second class workers, but also no second class children. Under the European Social Security Regulation, European citizens that work in another Member State and contribute just like local workers are entitled to the same social security benefits and tax advantages. The Commission considers that any adjustment mechanism for family benefits and family tax credits for children of migrant workers who are residing in another Member State are not compatible with our acquis. Such indexation mechanisms go against the principle of equal treatment set out in Regulation 883 on social security coordination. It also goes against Article 7 of that Regulation, which expressly states that cash benefits cannot be reduced or modified merely because family members reside in other Member States. It also breaches the principle of equal treatment as regards social and fiscal advantages laid down in the Free Movement Regulation – the principle of equal treatment that is also at the heart of the single market. You know that some Member States asked to introduce indexation of child benefits when we launched a revision of the European Union social security regulations. But we refused to propose such indexation, based on our strong belief that mobility needs to be based on fair rules. That has remained the Commission’s position throughout the negotiations on the proposed modernisation of social security rules on which we reached a political agreement last week – an agreement that, I can assure you, is a balanced agreement, built on the shared understanding that European rules should safeguard free movement and protect citizens’ rights by strengthening the tools to address possible fraud or abuse. An agreement that still has to be confirmed by Coreper next Friday, so tomorrow, and also of course by Parliament in the coming weeks.  As regards the legislation introduced in Austria since 1 January, you know that the Commission has already launched an infringement procedure. We sent a letter of formal notice to the Austrian Government on 25 January. This Monday we received a reply from the Austrian Government and we are now in the process of analysing this reply before we can decide on the appropriate next step.  I can assure you that we take this situation seriously, as indeed many families are directly affected by this Austrian law and have seen their benefits reduced. I have to add, however, that in order to preserve their rights, the citizens concerned should be prepared to claim their rights before the Austrian administration and, if necessary, start court proceedings. National courts are bound to apply European law and they are the only ones that can offer citizens direct redress when their rights are not respected. As in other infringement cases, I am confident that the Commission’s actions will result in the correct and effective application of European law in all Member States. That is indeed what citizens and businesses and also Member States expect from us in a single market.

It is impossible to turn a blind eye to a Member State's breach of the fundamental principles of European law, the principles of free movement of persons and the principles of equal treatment. It is not just a matter of discriminating in this way by Europeans, citizens of other European Union countries who work in Austria and who therefore pay taxes in Austria and therefore have logical and moral rights to the same social benefits. But it is a very dangerous precedent which, if we let it be, we will start to break up the European Union's internal market and destroy the ideas on which European integration is based. And that is extremely dangerous. So thank you very much for perceiving this Austrian populist proposal as unacceptable, and I very much ask that the European Commission do its utmost to get Austria to make amends. It has been made clear that European Union citizens who work in Austria and pay taxes and social security contributions in Austria as Austrians have logically the same right to social benefits as Austrians. It is a principle of European integration, and we cannot assess the economic differences between Member States, break the principle of European solidarity and say that if someone has their children in a country with lower social security contributions, they should receive lower contributions when they pay the same fees in Austria as Austrians.

The Austrian government is acting completely wrong when it cuts child benefits for EU citizens in Austria.

The adjustment of child benefit to the costs in the country of residence is deeply unjust. It is bizarre that at the same time the Austrian government grants diplomats exceptional regulations, while normal Austrians who have children abroad have to accept other regulations. As Social Democrats, we stand firmly by the principle of equal treatment. Equal treatment and the prohibition of discrimination - that is Europe's strong foundation. I know the debate from Germany. Our position is clear: The problem is not freedom of movement, but abuse in individual cases. Indeed, there is gang abuse. The state has to take action here - it has become active in Germany too. In Germany, family funds, job centers in association with the immigration authorities and customs have started to monitor more closely. This is also the right way to stop the abuse. Against employment relationships that appear to exist, so that child benefits can be applied for at the family benefits office, will be actively emerged. However, benefit entitlements that EU citizens attach to their economic activities cannot be reduced or even canceled. We do not need such measures, we need a Europe that provides social security.

It is indeed about indexing family allowances, as it has now been discussed in Austria and which has evidently led to a warning letter from the Commission. In essence, it is right to adhere to or consider the principle of equal treatment. But obviously the Commission is completely disregarding the principle that what is unequal must not be treated equally. And that happens and I would like to use an example to record it: If, for example, a Romanian employee for a child who is at home and lives in Romania and for whom the cost of living is significantly lower, the same amount is paid as a child in Austria live with a much higher cost of living. The widely differing level, the price level and these cost of living justify an indexation adapted to the respective country of residence. This indexation is therefore not about savings, not about reductions or withdrawals, but about adjustment to the respective cost of living. I am happy to give examples: in the last fifteen years alone, these entitlements for children living in other EU countries have risen from 1,500 to 130,000, so this number of people has increased a hundredfold. May I also give you an example from Romania-Austria: Romania: a white bread, half a kilo of 50 cents - Austria 1.83 euros; local cheese 0.47 cents compared to 1.08 euros in Austria; Beef 6.11 euros compared to around 19.96 euros. This goes so far that it can be stated that an average child benefit in Austria, paid at 135 euros, makes up a quarter of the average income in Romania. So this different situation is to be observed with full respect. And finally, a word on the subject of equal treatment. If, in 2019, Mr Tusk promised Mr Cameron an emergency brake to the effect that the Union's social benefits would have been suspended for a short time, including child benefits and many other benefits, then I wonder why if the Commission itself offered Mr Cameron that In order to prevent a Brexit, would the same obviously not have applied to Austria?

Austria is a rich country with a relatively generous social system, but I would like to respond to the fact that every worker not only has children who need some care, but can also go to Austria to see him, which increases their costs. They can live with their parents in Austria, and this is not taken into account at all in the proposal. Moreover, the point is that it pays exactly the same taxes, exactly the same levies, so if the expenditure on children were to be indexed, then the levies would probably have to be indexed, that is, taxes, and Austria did not do so.

Mobile workers are entitled to the same child allowances as local workers.

I too would like to thank the Commissioner for her introductory words. For three months now, there has been a situation in the European Union where common rules on the free movement of persons have not been respected in one Member State. Since January this year, Austria has decided to divide EU citizens working on its territory into two categories. For those who are entitled to a full share of social security and for those to whom this right is limited. Although the European Union does not formally recognize second-class workers, as the Commissioner has said, one Member State is still tolerating this situation. If workers pay the same contributions to their social security system as their neighbors, but receive a relatively lower share of it, can we speak of a fair single market here? I don't think we can. I therefore welcome the fact that the Commission has initiated infringement proceedings against Austria, and I also consider it extremely important that we return to this matter regularly in the European Parliament as well. Because if the Commission is not able to take action against this situation, we risk the credibility of the European project and its founding principles. I am afraid that this case could serve as an unacceptable inspiration for other countries.

As regards the Austrian legislation, the Commission now needs to analyse the reply of the Austrian Government that we received this Monday, and we can only decide upon any further steps after having carefully assessed the arguments put forward, as we always do. But let me recap. First of all, for me, this is a question of fairness and equal treatment. The issue that we have in front of us is not one of social dumping, it is not a situation prone to abuse or fraud: we are indeed talking of European citizens who took up a job abroad and provide their skills in a host country where they are contributing to the social security system and to the tax system. Equal treatment and fairness demand that these workers receive the same benefits as local workers regardless of where their children are living. The fact that their children are living in a Member State with a lower cost of living than the Member State of work should not be relevant for the benefit that is paid out as a lump sum and that is not linked to the actual expense of maintaining a child. I am well aware of the peculiarities of certain national systems whereby employers finance a large part of the benefits. Let me just recall that in such systems, employers pay the same amount of contributions for their employees, regardless of the nationality or place of residence of the children in question. I’m also aware of the content of what we called a couple of years ago the UK settlement agreement, but, as you all know, this ceased to exist. It was foreseen in the agreement that if the outcome of the referendum were to leave the European Union, then this agreement would be null and void. Allow me also to ask the question: if you open the door to indexation for child benefits, then what would be the next candidate for adjustment of benefits on the basis of living costs? Allow Member States to reduce pension rights when workers retire to States where it is cheaper to live, as Ms Ayala Sender said? Some people say we have concerns about fraud and abuse and I share all those concerns, but then I have to say that indexation is not the answer. On the contrary, you are hitting those people who get up in the morning, work hard and make a real contribution to the Member State of work. In order to fight abuses and fraud, we need to strengthen the tools for national authorities to control and obtain information from their counterparts abroad, and that this why we have created the European Labour Authority. That is also why we strengthened the cooperation requirements for Member States when revising the European social security rules, strengthening cooperation between Member States while also avoiding excessive control measures based on distrust.  To conclude, mobility needs to be based on clear, fair and enforceable rules. These rules benefit Austrians, Slovaks, Germans, Belgians and all the other European citizens alike by protecting their social rights when they are on the move. I thank you for the support of the action that I have been taking in this area and on which we have been able to reach an important political agreement that will improve the situation for our citizens’ families and businesses. Together with some members who mentioned this agreement on which Coreper has to decide tomorrow, I hope together with you that this deal will be accepted by the Member States, and of course after that also by the European Parliament.

Many colleagues underlined the importance of protecting workers' rights and improving working conditions. We argued about the introduction of the 'same pay for the same job in the same place' principle, which was advocated by many MEPs. That is why it is so surprising that in countries that carry slogans of protection of the rights of mobile workers on their banners, there are ideas to introduce indexation of child benefits. It is inconsistent with EU law and the values ​​proclaimed by these countries. Austria went a step further and, regardless of European regulations, introduced indexation as of January 1, 2019. Austria thus divided workers and their children into two categories. Such action is unacceptable and I would like to protest loudly against such a policy today. I am protesting on behalf of those who have taken advantage of mobility, work abroad, build GDP and pay the same taxes and contributions as their colleagues. I protest on behalf of those people who have left for work, leaving their families and children in the country, and who, thanks to the money and benefits earned, can offer them a better future. I protest on behalf of those who are close to European values ​​based on equal treatment and solidarity.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 149, "date": "2019-03-28.json", "name": "Rainer WIELAND", "mepid": "2323", "text": "I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}]
