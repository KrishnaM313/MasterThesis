Mr President, dear David, good morning to all of you, we are going to debate today an important initiative report, since it concerns the issue of the sustainable market of the European Union. The European Union is the world's largest market, it is not nothing. And so as such, we have the power and the ability to prescribe a number of rules that not only preserve the planet, that also preserve sustainable jobs in our territories and that protect consumers. The purpose of the report I am going to present to you is to review a number of rules, to propose a reflection so that we can move forward. It is good that we are talking about it in Parliament because it is also on the Commission's agenda and we have already had the opportunity to talk to the IMCO committee with Commissioner Reynders. We can therefore, as parliamentarians of the European Union, begin to chart a course in relation to our ambitions. The context is also that of the Green Pact. But how can we think of an ecological transition if we don't review the rules of the market? Because ladies and gentlemen, in reality, our consumer society has become a consuming society, where resources are wasted and destroyed and where poor consumer products are often produced outside our borders, which make consumers and consumers, especially the most vulnerable, dependent on products they are often forced to replace. , which is not very good for their wallet either. So how is this report organized? First, the issue of premature obsolescence must be addressed. This issue is to ensure that consumer products have a shorter lifespan than would be expected of them and therefore we propose that this premature obsolescence be added to the blacklist of unfair business practices. We also want to extend the legal guarantee. As we know, manufacturers are able to produce, for example, washing machines that last ten years or more, and the legal guarantee is very reduced. Again, to protect consumers, we propose to extend this legal guarantee. We also want to add a usage meter, you know, like car mileage meters, on a number of consumer products, put in use meters that promote their second life, resell them, and enlighten consumers. For digital goods, we also want to separate the corrective updates that are needed from the scalable updates that all too often accelerate the obsolescence of digital products. We want a right to repair for objects that would allow for delays in accessing spare parts at an acceptable price. All the studies we have done at european union level show that more than three-quarters of European citizens want to repair their belongings more. This means that spare parts are not too expensive and that the time to obtain them is as short as possible. And we also want clear and harmonized information about product sustainability, which is absolutely fundamental. We are therefore in favour of mandatory posting, and that is the subject of an amendment that will be proposed to you. A mandatory display so that everyone can know the environmental quality of a product, because the latter has a known cost, it is the cost of purchase, but it also has a hidden cost, it is the cost that this product really costs at the environmental level. On the other hand, in relation to advertising, we want to frame the so-called green claims, which are misleading. There must also be some form of ethics in advertising so as not to mislead consumers. Finally, we want to promote sustainable products in public markets, which account for 16% of GDP in Europe. It is therefore essential to give a boost to sustainable products and quality objects, often made by European producers, to make them criteria for awarding public contracts and give them more importance and a prescriptive value. We also want to make product sustainability data public and transparent. We want there to be a digital passport of products that are put on the market so that everyone can know the environmental quality of these products, and that there is a sustainable digital index, because digital, which is often seen as something intangible, actually has very concrete consequences. There there is also a need for transparency and consumers need to be informed. Finally, we want to strengthen surveillance of the European market. It is not normal for objects that do not meet the standards we enact to enter our territories, especially through online purchases. This is unacceptable and it is unfair competition from European producers. So we need ways to check. These are my dear friends, the essence of this report. Once again, our ambition is both to protect European jobs, to protect the planet, with a more sustainable market, and above all to protect consumers so that they can be enlightened and not seen as cash cows in the economic model, as they still too often are today.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 7, "date": "2020-11-23.json", "name": "Fabio Massimo CASTALDO", "mepid": "124812", "text": "  Thank you very much Mr Cormand, thank you very much to the rapporteur of Parliament.

Je voudrais tout d’abord évidemment remercier le rapporteur, Monsieur David Cormand, et le féliciter pour son rapport pour un marché unique durable. La Commission européenne se félicite de l’initiative de la commission IMCO, ainsi que de l’engagement du Parlement européen pour le développement durable. Nous partageons l’ambition d’une action politique forte et multidimensionnelle au sein de l’Union, afin de faciliter davantage la transition vers une économie plus durable, plus efficace dans l’utilisation des ressources et plus circulaire. The Commission set its out strategy in the Circular Economy Action Plan adopted earlier this year. Like Mr Cormand’s report, the Circular Economy Action Plan recognises that the transition will require measures both on the supply and the demand side. We agree that a number of the changes needed, such as better rules for the lifespan and reparability of products, will require product-specific and sectoral approaches. Evidence shows that 80% of environmental impacts are determined at the design phase of a product, and that is exactly where the Sustainable Products Initiative will intervene. It will set out sustainability principles and specific requirements linked to environmental and social aspects. In this context, the digital product passport could combine unique product identification with data collected by different actors in the value chain. This could provide better information to economic operators, market surveillance authorities and the general public. It could enable more sustainable products, as well as the emergence of new sustainable business opportunities, strengthening the competitiveness of EU industry and the resilience of the EU economy. Various measures, both horizontal and product-specific, should also contribute to establishing an effective right to repair. We also want to ensure high environmental performance for all products placed on the EU market. Work is ongoing within the framework of the Ecodesign Directive, with the focus on durability, reparability and efficiency of products. This horizontal initiative, together with some sector-specific proposals, such as the Circular Electronics Initiative, will respond to a number of points included in your report. The New Consumer Agenda, which we will discuss later this evening, also provides for action on the demand side. It will include an ambitious programme of empowering consumers’ participation in the green transition. In 2021, a legislative initiative will aim to ensure better information for consumers. It will help them choose products, not only according to the price, but also based on reliable and clear information about the products’ durability, availability of spare parts and accessibility of repair services. The Commission will, at the same time, address certain commercial practices which undermine consumers’ trust – notably early obsolescence, as well as greenwashing. In parallel, the Commission will propose rules for the substantiation of green claims, to further reinforce the credibility of consumer information. Public procurement plays an important part as well as the demand side. The Commission is working on criteria and targets in sectoral legislation for minimum mandatory green public procurement, as well as comprehensive guidance on public investment into sustainable infrastructure projects. For green public procurement to be widely used, the environmental impact of products and services needs to be standardised and must use comparable assessment methodology. Several points in the report also touch upon the Sale of Goods Directive. This important directive will start to apply as of 1 January 2022. As announced in the New Consumer Agenda, the Commission will use the future review of the Directive to explore how it could contribute to sustainability goals, including by taking into account a number of issues raised in Mr Cormand’s report. Et je voudrais assurer encore, M. Cormand, que, comme je viens de l’évoquer, nous allons réagir à toute une série de points qui font l’objet des propositions qu’il a énumérées tout à l’heure. Nous verrons jusqu’où nous pourrons aller dans l’ensemble de ces remarques, mais je vous remercie à nouveau de votre attention.

There is an overall agreement on the goal to become climate-neutral and a circular economy. The discussion is not about the goal, but how to get there and I think that is a very fundamentally good thing. It’s also symbolic that we’re having this discussion during the European Week for Waste Reduction, because let’s not forget that prevention is the best way to deal with the waste problem. Last year saw the heated discussion on whether premature obsolescence exists. I personally believe it does. They don’t make them like they used to, as the idiom goes. But it’s not only about the cheap products from China, it’s also about expensive goods and software from big Western multinational companies. A company with a popular fruit in its name and logo is a well-known example. Of course it would be so easy to blame the companies for all the problems, but it would not be correct. We all have a share. We all have a shared responsibility for the situation. We have created a system where the preferred choice is to throw away and buy new rather than fix or upgrade. So it is companies that need to change. It is the consumer culture that needs to change. But it’s up to us, the legislators, to change the system, to change it in a way that leads us to a climate-neutral and circular economy. This means more information and rights for consumers. This means stepping up our efforts against premature obsolescence by ensuring and supporting reparability of the product, reuse, replacability of the parts, extending the guarantees and changing the designs of products to extend their life cycles. This will not only help the consumers and increase their trust in the European market and the European ideas, but also create opportunities for small and local businesses across the EU, stimulate innovation and maintain the value of the product. I believe that this is the right step towards a win-win for citizens, businesses and the planet.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 10, "date": "2020-11-23.json", "name": "Arba KOKALARI", "mepid": "197406", "text": "  On the other: Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating Mr The EU is the world's largest economy. We have 500 million consumers who make billions of purchasing decisions every day. Everything from what to eat to dinner to what to buy for car and which TV fits best in the living room. If we are to make these goods and services consumed across the EU more sustainable – well, it will have a major impact on climate emissions and how we consume resources. If we are to succeed in this, it must be as easy as possible for companies to change their business models so that they can start offering more of climate-smart, circular products and services in the internal market. If we are to achieve sustainable trade properly, we must dismantle barriers to trade. It must be easier and cheaper to obtain recycled materials. Today it is expensive. It's hard. Every country has different rules. And recycled materials are perceived as junk, instead of being perceived and regulated as materials that can be used again. We need to dismantle barriers to trade for sustainable services so that we can enable more repairs and rentals. Today, we have an incredible amount of barriers to trade in the EUROPEAN Union in the services sector in particular. This hinders the climate change change. We must remove the EU's own tariffs on climate-friendly products. We need to invest in new technologies and AI so that we can boost new and green innovation. We need to remove the jungle of labels that consumers see every day, so that it is easier for them to get clear information about what is more sustainable in a product and how products can be more climate friendly. Unfortunately, the Social Americans, the Green Party and the Left Party have completely the wrong focus. Instead of benefiting from trade and technology development, it wants to introduce bans, restrictions and new taxes that then prevent companies from making these important climate investments, where the goal is to stop consumption rather than create sustainable consumption.

They are convinced that these are built-in failures that force them to buy a new device. A recent study found that the devices actually last shorter today than those purchased by our mothers or grandmothers lasted. This is estimated to increase the financial burden per household member by as much as 110 euros per month. The industry's claims that consumers are buying new because they want, perhaps, a new design - it may stand for shoes, but they're certainly not buying a new freezer or stove because a new model has come out.  I call on all colleagues to support a firm ban on embedded blacklisting failures of the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive. This is something that our citizens want and nothing less than such a ban will lead to real changes in the market.  Each of us knows how frustrating it is when you want to fix a device for which you have set aside a good part of your home budget, but you can't because the spare part is too expensive or there isn't even one on the market. We used to be able to replace the battery on our phone very cheaply ourselves, and today it is dug deep into the device. We have reached the point that the cost of replacing the battery on the phone is unprofitable in relation to the price of the new device. As many as 80% of such failures can be easily solved at the design stage.  This report lays the groundwork for the introduction of repair rights, calls for better availability and reasonable prices for spare parts, as well as strengthening the repair sector and second-hand goods markets. Indeed, research has shown that reuse and re-use create more new jobs than throwing away or even recycling.  In order to truly change the buy-to-use-throw model underpinning our economy, it is essential to inform consumers! Our citizens have a right to know what they're spending their money on. Every time they make a purchase, they need to know what to expect from the product, which is why the Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament are in favour of introducing mandatory device life expectancy labels as well as fixability. Studies have shown that consumers are even willing to pay more for a product that lasts longer and can be more easily repaired. Our job is to give them a choice. However, we must do everything in our power to make sure that a sustainable lifestyle is not just a privilege for the rich, but for everyone who cares about the environment.  As a result of the health crisis, the economic crisis is making us think outside the usual frameworks and work out how to create new jobs, save citizens' money, while achieving the ambitious goal of making Europe a climate-neutral continent by 2050.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have made a choice to spearhead the ecological transition. We did it together and we saw our weaknesses and our blind spots. Today, we must prove that we are able to adapt and emerge as winners of the crisis. This is also true for the great European success of the single market.  Today, it is our duty to establish a circular economy with more sustainable production and consumption, to make our European industry more resilient and autonomous. To do this, it is imperative to review our entire ecosystem, including the single market. Every area must be studied, targeted, nothing should be forgotten. Several European countries have already begun to regulate in this area. I recall the French experience of 2018 with the anti-waste law carried by Brune Poirson. It is up to us, at European level, to affirm our ambition and to ensure that this fight becomes the norm in the European Union. Sustainable consumption must become our default choice. Today, we propose a strategy based on the principles of sustainability, consumer protection, competitiveness and fair competition. We call for establishing a right to repair products - because, as has been said, we are all consumers and we all want to see our rights strengthened - to combat programmed obsolescence practices, which are a reality, to better inform consumers, to guarantee an effective right of redress, to introduce sustainability criteria in public tenders and to reciprocid with third countries to make public markets more environmentally friendly and more Innovative. So far we have done a very difficult job and I want to thank Mr Cormand, all the other shadow rapporteurs and all the colleagues in the Internal Market Committee. A difficult job, of course, but a very constructive work. But in order to succeed, we must overcome our individualities in plenary and we must overcome our political divisions, because the greater our commitment and the more united we are in the European Parliament, the stronger our influence will be.  Every citizen must be able to enjoy real freedom of choice - but to be free, one must be informed - and appropriate and dignified protection. Let's develop this ambition and act. While there are risks and associated costs, they are much less than those of uncomfortable inaction. Change is the law of life and those who look only at the past or present are certain to miss the future.

However, while we are voting on a report supported by the Greens to combat programmed obsolescence, to develop an ecosystem of repair and opportunity, these same Greens have thrown away, put in the trash, a beautiful nuclear power plant. The Fessenheim nuclear power plant, which is a few kilometres from here, not opened in the Middle Ages, but less than 50 years ago. The Greens got its head and it closed its last reactor in February 2020. What were they blaming him for? Its wear and tear? Argument rejected by the Nuclear Safety Authority which classifies it as the safest in Europe. They blame him for his old age. Cost of this fad: between 4 and 5 billion euros and more than 2,000 employees swung at the Job Centre. And everyone loses. EDF loses because the compensation paid to it is low if we consider that this plant could have run until 2041 and that it was equipment that was depreciated and in perfect working order. The state budget must pay 377 million euros to EDF, so the taxpayer loses. In the midst of a crisis, we would be better off using that money elsewhere. Our foreign trade is losing because we are importing coal and gas that we could have avoided burning in our power plants. The planet loses because we emit more CO2, all for purely political and ideological reasons. This absurd situation is not about to stop, since the Multi-Year Energy Act provides for the closure of 14 other nuclear reactors, when they are in working order and they would have been more useful because of the rise of renewable energies, because the more renewable there is, the more we need regular electricity production that is not dependent on weather conditions. To this stupid example, we can add another: the desire to close the European Parliament in Strasbourg, which is considered obsolete and expensive. Governing is planning and planning is designing things before others. We cannot say that this is the virtue of the Greens, but when we know that MEP Karima Delli, chair of the European Parliament's transport committee, confuses uranium and lithium with regard to electric batteries, nothing surprises us anymore. Ecology has always been in the DNA of the National Gathering. Also because our vision of ecology is pragmatic, humane, rooted, we support this report, because we are against the programmed obsolescence that pushes for overconsumption and nibbles a little more the purchasing power of our fellow citizens. Against food waste, against the disposable whole and for a circular economy with the repairability and recyclability of products within our territories. For example, the two-year legal warranty period is not suitable for all product categories with a higher estimated lifespan. The report suggests aligning legal warranty terms with the estimated lifespan of a property and ensuring a minimum period of disposal of spare parts. We are in favour of that. We are also in favour of sustainability and repairability labelling that takes into account multiple criteria throughout the product lifecycle. This labelling should provide consumers with the necessary and useful information at the time of purchase. When Apple restricts our phones, when smart printers block printing beyond a certain number of printed sheets, it is the consumer who is cheated. When Decathlon forges a fortune on the backs of Chinese or Bangladeshis paid 60 euros a month, the consumer must know. This enthusiasm of the Greens for repairability and sustainability must first be demonstrated here, I will repeat, by defending the maintenance of the Seat of the European Parliament in Strasbourg and by stopping looking for spurious arguments to stop coming here in Alsace.

In doing so, we are driving the earth heating. And it is well known that if all human beings were to use up as many resources as we do in Europe, all planetary boundaries would have been crossed long ago. So it is about our own future, but it is also about the future of the billions of people in the global south. This is because they have contributed the least and must suffer most from the heat of the earth and also from pollution. The good news is that we have all the levers in our hands to shape our future differently. We just have to use it. The European Union is the largest single market in the world. Let us ensure that it becomes even the greenest, the most sustainable and innovative internal market in the world and, beyond the Brussels effect, even radiates beyond European borders. Every product sold here in Europe should be durable and not break down after two years. It should be repairable. This is how we delight consumers and we save resources.  The vast majority of consumers would much rather buy sustainable products, as countless studies show. With a mandatory label for the longevity of the products, one could make the choice of these consumers easier and made them actors of sustainability. Please vote in favour of our amendment! Many of the products are specially built in such a way that they break down after a short time. It drives profits when people have to keep buying new mobile phones or new kettles.

Does the single market have its drawbacks? Of course. Competition between producers who compete primarily on price has an impact on the durability of certain products. But is this a reason to consider that shortening the life cycle of a product is a deliberate and widespread action, as the rapporteur suggests?  In the opinion of the ECR Group, this report does not provide evidence to support this thesis, and yet many new and costly administrative requirements for entrepreneurs are suggested. Any new bureaucratic burden hastily introduced, without proper market analysis and research, will significantly affect prices and reduce the competitiveness of European companies. At a time of economic crisis, this is a disastrous prospect. The centralist approach, according to which the unconscious consumer must be guided by the hand like a child, and each product should be basically identical, resembles a reality that in the countries of real socialism we remember all too well. I can tell Mr Cormand with a clear conscience that this economic model did not work then and will not work now.  Consumers make conscious choices, they themselves look for more permanent and environmentally friendly products, if that is what they want to buy. Entrepreneurs also want to be seen as more responsible and balanced. Whether they are credible or not in these efforts is also part of the market rivalry. We should not interfere too much with prohibitions and orders, which for many companies, especially small and medium-sized ones, will be another insurmountable barrier. I hope that the Commission will show more responsibility than the rapporteur and base its legislative proposals on reliable data.

Mr President, Commissioner. We all live on the same and unique planet. Having responsible consumption to conserve limited resources should be consensual as we know that we need to change the way we produce and consume. I would like to thank David Cormand for his report, which, in the first hand, was very ambitious. Even as the Commission wants to address this issue, it is distressing to see how certain groups have done everything they can to empty this report of its substance. Finally, the doctrine of some colleagues is: yes, we must put green in the market, but without changing the market. Many European citizens have taken the measure of urgency and here in this Parliament we must be up to the task. We can no longer afford to sprinkle the green pact, because that would be fashionable. No, we must meet this challenge with consumers and with businesses by accompanying them and giving them perspectives through strong political signals. A sustainable single market is first and foremost common sense in allowing a mandatory label on products that indicate their environmental and social impact from conception to the end of their life. Second, it is to inform the consumer and bring transparency to the market and transparency is born trust. Allowing consumers to repair their product with spare parts available and at a reasonable cost is also common sense. If tomorrow repairing his washing machine costs more than buying a new one with the health crises we know consumers will go down that road. When we talk about purchasing power, let's talk about programmed obsolescence. A plague. I actually want to think about batteries that fall apart after updates or printers. Let's think about the consumers. Do you think, ladies and gentlemen, that if we defend this practice, we defend it properly? The big challenges we face are also to say that there should not be the market on one side and the consumer on the other. I want to remind you of this simple thing here: we are not asking producers to change the way they produce, we are asking for transparency on how they produce and an end to the most harmful practices for the environment. So it's not about opposing here, producers and consumers, they're the same. And all suffer from the race to the least social and least environmental that a market without limits wants to impose on us. In conclusion, I call on the Commission in its new strategy to first be vigilant about targeted advertising of the most vulnerable, responsible consumption is not frivolous consumption. Then, to look at the textile industry that pollutes with great strides and destroys its unsold, playing on the fashion effects of which we know the immediacy. I call on the Commission to be vigilant about the end of life of products and not to accept a near-systematic destruction of unsold goods, because as Lavoisier said, nothing is lost, nothing is created, everything is transformed.

We want more sustainability in the European internal market, especially for consumer products, and we also know, of course, that we can promote this sustainability through political and legal measures. However, as the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, we have opposed a whole series of proposals from the outset, because they contradict the market-based approach that we want to maintain in Europe – a democracy without a planned economy. We have opposed exemptions from intellectual property law, we have opposed the idea of introducing psychological obsolescence, and we have also spoken out against an EU advertising tax: we believe, rightly, because market principles – and the speakers before me have already mentioned it – help to ensure that the supplier who makes the best offer to the consumer wins in competition. , and it will be the most sustainable offer in the long term. However, I would like to raise two or three points which are important because they do not need to be reinvented in this parliamentary term. First of all, we need some legal certainty for manufacturers of consumer products. For more sustainability, we must also keep on board the manufacturers who need one thing above all else, namely legal certainty and the associated planning security. After all, we only renegotiated the directive on the sale of goods in the last parliamentary term , as the Commissioner will have noted in detail. And we have jointly agreed on a guarantee period that businesses and consumers must and must adhere to. Secondly, we need reliability in consumer information. Consumers must also be able to see the information attached to a product in order to make sustainable decisions. Unfortunately, the amount of product information that is already available to consumers today is often confusing. Now to print another mandatory consumer information on products, which ultimately only contains the presumed lifespan of a product, does not bring any added value to the consumer. Finally, we are talking about so-called premature obsolescence, i.e. German, the limited shelf life of technical products. Of course, it is not acceptable. However, the proposal to classify even an obsolescence that is not planned but premature is illegal does not bring any more than colleagues have already said before. Because there is no way to predict how long a product will last – it also depends very much on its use in the end.

A big thank you to Rapporteur Cormand for a very good report. Let me make it clear right away: we are not going to achieve the objective of the green transition simply by setting binding targets for CO2 reductions. We will only be at the end if we dare and have the courage to make a transformation of our entire society. And with this report, we come from the Committee on the Internal Market with very specific suggestions on how we can ensure a greener and a more sustainable internal market for the benefit of both consumers and businesses and our planet. The objective is clear: we need to change the way we produce and consume, otherwise we cannot protect our planet. We also need to ensure a way to have sustainable economic growth. This requires that we boost the circular economy, promote the recycling sector and ensure that the bill is not left with those who already have the least. In short: a sustainable green transition must go hand in hand with a just green transition, which is why I support our report. I think it's good. It launches a wide range of initiatives that not only enable consumers to participate in the green transition, but also ensure effective consumer protection along the way.  Let me highlight a few of the initiatives that I think are very important: a great many Europeans want to buy sustainably, but they do not have the information necessary for this, and that is why I think it is important that we should set up a labelling system that should clearly inform consumers about the life expectancy of a product. This makes it easier to buy more durable.  Secondly, consumers must also have the right to have easier access to have their products repaired. A large majority of EU citizens would rather have their products repaired than replace them. That is why it is positive that we are also proposing here, or that we are actually calling for a right to repair, that is, a right to repair its product. This should make it both attractive and cost-effective to opt for repair.  And thirdly, we must stop certain companies choosing to use planned obsolescence in their products. I think that products should be able to last as long as they possibly can, instead of someone wanting them to stop you before they are actually finished.  We need to change this, and that's why we need to ban planned obsolescence. We have a lot of initiatives in this report. I also know that Rome was not built in a day. We will not solve the climate problems in one day, but with this report we are giving a great deal of good ideas on how we can do this, how we can get on with securing a green and sustainable internal market.", "language": "en", "original_language": "da", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 20, "date": "2020-11-23.json", "name": "Dita CHARANZOVÁ", "mepid": "124708", "text": "   – Mr President, we all want to be more sustainable but this goal should not come at a cost to the European SMEs and the access of consumers to low-cost options and a wide choice of products. As for labelling, consumers are already overwhelmed by the information. Adding just another list of strange symbols or other marks to packaging that means nothing to the average consumer will not help. Instead we should focus on controlling the voluntary labels and the green-washing which often misleads consumers to think something is more sustainable than it is. The problem is not too little information, but misinformation. If we must work on better sustainable labelling, let’s work on making the existing Eco-design Directive better, not just adding another number from 1 to 10 to every label without any context. And let us remember that reparability doesn’t mean a better product. A product might be easy to repair, but if it breaks every week, how is that better than a non-repairable one that lasts forever? A poor quality product can be repairable. It might get a score of 10 for reparability but a D on energy consumption. This is misleading for consumers. Mr President, there must be a cost-benefit analysis and impact assessment for any proposed measures. If the costs are higher, while the environmental benefits are low, we should seek other solutions.

A harsh reality, in which the priority is to survive the economic and social catastrophe caused by the pandemic, in an increasingly competitive and globalised world. That is why we believe in a rational rather than ideological transition, progressive and with achievable objectives, facilitated by incentives rather than penalized by new burdens, but above all a transition compatible with the situation before us. The plastic tax, for example, risks blowing up entire sectors already on the verge of collapse: not only does this tax penalise businesses but it also does not protect the environment and consumers, since plastic requirements will still be met by goods from non-EU countries, which are the main producers of both greenhouse gases and plastics potentially dangerous to human health. There is a striking contradiction between the noble words and policies put in place by Europe: in words, Brussels wants to restart the economy and consumption, but it imposes production models that threaten companies and risk making workers pay the price of this transition; it claims to want to defend the retail trade, but at the same time pushes for the digital economy, without guaranteeing even-armed competition between the two worlds. Europe says that it supports local production and the right of consumers to transparent information, but then introduces misleading labels such as nutri-score, rather than legislating on traceability, thus penalising entire products without really protecting the health of citizens. It also encourages the short supply chain in public procurement, but does not offer entrepreneurs regulatory certainty about the environmental requirements needed to participate in tenders. Brussels is calling for more trade in the single market but then does not invest in strategic infrastructure, such as airports, and cuts funding to those who want to expand and upgrade cargo activities. Finally, Europe promotes low-impact mobility, but it should know that the electric car, and in general all the most environmentally friendly and durable products, are not within the reach of the majority of people, especially now that we are fighting for what is essential. Many fine abstract words about sustainability can be said in this House, but outside here there are nations in distress, where companies, workers and families are concerned about the more immediate future, even before the 2050 climate targets.

We can support them by providing a regulatory framework that sets a clear direction towards climate neutrality, circularity and energy efficiency. A strong internal market shouldn’t be a place where the one best fooling consumers and externalising costs prevails. Clear rules will help create an investment climate where businesses that bring sustainable alternatives to the market are rewarded, instead of being confronted with competitors that are misleading consumers with false green claims or are bringing products to the market that break shortly past the warranty deadline. Consumers need to be given correct information on the lifetime and reparability of products. Voluntary commitments have been tried and have not delivered.

This will help to counter all the vague and false green claims that are thrown at consumers, and businesses with the intention of bringing durable and quality products to the markets will be grateful.

Consumers who choose not to repair the product generally do so due to a lack of information on the durability and repairability of the product. It is obvious, then, that we need to work on better informing consumers. When purchasing, consumers must be informed of the product details, including, inter alia, information on the availability of replacement parts and product repair options.  Although a 2018 Survey by the European Commission states that 64% of consumers are repairing their products, the Eurobarometer on the environment provides different data. According to this survey, published in March this year, in the European Union only 32% of respondents said they were fixing the product. This is worrying data that shows a tendency to lose consumer interest in repairing products. This information obliges us to make additional efforts to establish the right to repair products and to guarantee to our consumers that they will be able to repair the product in a quick, efficient and affordable manner.  When it comes to consumer protection, in the context of a sustainable single market, attention should also be paid to the issue of early product obsolesction. In doing so, of course, deliberately designing and incorporating mechanisms into products in order to shorten their service life is unacceptable to us. However, what I would emphasize is that we do not need an ideological debate here, we do not need things based on individual extremist positions, but we should make decisions as Europarlamentaries, based on facts and concrete data and information. It is the special responsibility of all of us to conduct such a public debate.  I would also certainly point out that this should be taken into account, with all the measures we take to protect consumers, and the consequences that such measures will have for the single market. The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union clearly states that European Union policies ensure a high level of consumer protection.

You need to be able to buy your own needs, your needs, and be able to buy them at zero kilometer, to be able to buy them at measured quality, that is, to be able to see what you buy. Unfortunately, however, The European policies and also the policies provided for in this measure, which Europe intends to pursue, look to the interests of the globalised world and not to the real interests and needs of the consumer, who would like to buy at the right cost but products from our territory. Today, too, this pandemic, on the other hand, unfortunately, leads our producers to great difficulties, leads our consumers into great difficulties and those who benefit from it are those who, on the one hand, are complicit in this pandemic – think of the Chinese, the Chinese products that are currently stealing other slices of the market – and, on the other hand, the large giants that do not pay taxes either in Europe or in Italy. So outside these buildings, even outside the Palace of Milan, people ask you: why does Europe not react? Why does Europe not find the formula for actually making these giants pay taxes, which today exploit the European market and the Italian market to the detriment of our producers? Why does Europe not protect us from selling products of the same quality in Europe and selling products in Italy? Think Cambodian rice, Moroccan oranges, Tunisian oil, products that come to our tables. Why did Europe, which was supposed to be the means of winning against other continents, now lead us into worse situations than when Italy was alone? The European continent had to win the challenge against America, it had to win the challenge against China, it had to win the challenge against Russia and the other giants. Today, however, Europe has led the Member States and Italy, producers and consumers, to kneel down to this continuous invasion of products of poor quality and at the highest cost to our taxpayers. Today, in order to be able to consume and to be able to consume, we must offer jobs in Italy and in Europe. We must increase our production, and to do this we need an instrument: a reduction in the tax burden. Europe cannot act in increasing the tax burden but must act in reducing it. One thing we said a few weeks ago and I repeat it: Europe renounces the VAT that it takes from the pockets of Italian citizens every day. That is EUR 2 billion. If that EUR 2 billion could remain in the pockets of Italian citizens to buy the Italian product, to buy the European product, we would be induced today.

Consumers, wherever they are in the European Union, should be able to effectively assert their rights vis-à-vis traders, just as traders are entitled to sell their products and offer their services to all consumers in the single market.  We need to think about changing the way we produce and consume in Europe. Products should be more sustainable, more environmentally friendly, longer-lasting and repairable. Undoubtedly, the main objective that we face is to find a solution to how to encourage sustainable consumption for consumers and producers to move towards a green economy. In this context, we need to consider whether imposing mandatory burdens and certificates on European companies, and thus passing on the inevitable additional costs to consumers, is the solution here.

The aim of this report, which is being debated, is to be welcomed, but some of the rapporteur's proposals certainly need to be fine-tuned. I believe that the lifespan of products really depends on a combination of independent stakeholders: manufacturers, suppliers, distributors, consumers and even Member States. We must therefore not ignore the fact that prolonging the lifespan of products must contribute to the development of an economic model based on a balance between the needs of consumers and industry and environmental necessities. Consumers are dissatisfied not only because of the low durability of the goods, but also because they cannot be repaired. Indeed, many defective devices will not be repaired. However, support for the repair sector could instead create jobs, significantly reduce waste production and pollution, significantly improve consumer purchasing power and confer a commercial advantage on European businesses. That is why it is important that we act thoughtfully and deal with this important issue not only on the lines of irrational arguments, but also on the lines of realities, with sufficient weight. We are currently witnessing the fourth industrial revolution, which is being operated by digitalisation and an incomprehensible amount of data instead of a steam engine. While the first Industrial Revolution introduced the world to the phenomenon of waste, the current fourth has the chance to eliminate, or at least greatly reduce, the phenomenon of waste. The EU should therefore support circular business models, since what is waste from one industry may be the raw material of another industry. You may no longer be able to recover the wastes and by-products of a company in your own value chain chain, but with minimal changes, they can be taken up by companies in other industries. I am sure that by rethinking the production, sales and consumption methods to extend the lifespan of products, conditions can be created that could benefit the recovery of European market activities.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hu", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 30, "date": "2020-11-23.json", "name": "Alex AGIUS SALIBA", "mepid": "197403", "text": "   – Sur President, sabiex niġġieldu l-kriżi fil-klima u nilħqu t-tragwardi ambizzjużi għat-tranżizzjoni l-ħidra u l-Patt Aħdar Ewropew, hemm bżonn illi kemm il-produzzjoni u kif ukoll il-modelli tal-konsum ikunu koll ha kemm sostenibbli.

That is why a clear strategy and rules are absolutely necessary to help us get there, to the green economy that we all want. In my view, innovation is the main factor that will help us achieve our targets much faster and better than the constraints on consumers, economic operators, public authorities. We need innovative products that are environmentally friendly from the first phase, from design to the last phase. For these we need collaboration with economic agents, with researchers, with investors, with consumers. From my point of view, we need to improve products, to innovat, to encourage and stimulate the purchase of state-of-the-art products, green products that pollute much less and can be recycled or reused in their entirety. Just as important is education, the dissemination of information, both in terms of the environmental emergency we are experiencing and in terms of how each of us can contribute to a cleaner planet. It is important that these two priorities – innovation and education – are united at the level of the European Single Market. It is important that the rules and standards for innovative green products and services are uniform, so that all European consumers can benefit from them, regardless of the country or region in which they are located. This report, in my view, is based on certain wrong pillars. We can talk about a second-rate product revolution, we can talk about the long-lasting product revolution, but it pollutes much more than ten new products, we can talk about an economy in which the State or the European Union decides the production and consumption patterns. But as we have seen in Romania, in my country, in so many years of communism and socialism with five-year plans, this attitude will only bring resistance to change.

Therefore, today it is essential where we produce and where and how we consume. Therefore, from an industry point of view, it is important that the European Union takes action on where we will produce and how we will be able to increase sustainability across the value chain, from design to product distribution. And, in relation to consumers, I think it is important that we give a tip, which is that in the last Eurobarometer, in a survey that has been carried out, more than 77% of Europeans are willing to reuse their products and try to fix them and usually do so. This fact has to make us think that European culture, European citizens are demanding a better way of consuming, more sustainable consumption. And, as the European Parliament, together with the different institutions, we need to be able to give an answer to these citizens. Therefore, from the Socialist Group, we believe that it is important to ban everything that has to do with the programmed obsolescence of products. It is important that consumers are not deceived.

This proposal therefore gives a clear, firm and coherent message to the Commission, the Council, The States, industry, services and consumers. The transition from linear to circular begins in the same product design, in the possibility they offer to be reused and last over time. Continue with the guarantees we offer users to access accessible, quality and monopoly-free spare parts and repair processes, extend that philosophy to digital updates, and end premature or scheduled obsolescence. This bet obliges trade transparency and involves traceability. Both qualities should allow us to make visible the origin and durability expectations of a product, from the origin of the materials with which it has been manufactured to the possible destination of them at the end of its useful life.

We must always bear in mind, above all, the interests of citizens as consumers and also the interests of small entrepreneurs, who make up up two thirds of jobs. I want to highlight three areas of this report that I consider important: digitalisation, public procurement and simplification. First area: Digitisation. In digital technologies, which also give us new opportunities for transparency, I welcome the initiative of the so-called 'digital product passport' to improve traceability and access to information on product production conditions, durability, composition, re-use or repair. However, I stress that, in these developments, account must be taken of the needs of the small firms that make up the most jobs. In the second area, in the area of public procurement, which accounts for up to 16% of European GDP, we should send out a clear signal for reliable sustainability criteria. I consider it most important to reduce the supply chain and to take into account the needs of small firms, which are often discriminated against in public procurement today, and we therefore need to improve their position. As far as simplification is concerned, I would like to stress its need, and I consider a common connector for electronic mobile devices to be such a typical example. It is important for the European Commission to implement our initiative and the European Parliament's decision on a common connector ending. This will contribute not only to simplifying facilities, but also to better recyclability and meeting environmental objectives.   However, we must always strike a balance in protecting the consumer and the sustainability of producers' abilities. Therefore, on the other hand, I would like to draw attention to the following: there is no need to tighten requirements in the area of spare parts. I believe that forcing companies to produce and store large quantities of spare parts, for which there is not necessarily demand, would not only damage the environment, but also the competitiveness of our companies in the Union. The second area I want to draw attention to is the services sector. This has a very important role to play for sustainability. We need to complete the internal market in services as soon as possible, because this can make a decisive contribution to a sustainable internal market that can benefit the consumer. Last but not least, I want to emphasise the area of standards. For digital technologies in particular, we need to introduce standards and protocols to improve interoperability and data sharing between firms, investors and institutions, which will undoubtedly bring further development opportunities. In this area, we also need to invest much more in research into new technologies within our budget.

Raising the sustainability of products, ending programmed obsolescence, is first of all an issue of consumer protection, surely, of protecting the environment and the climate, too, but also of protecting the production of our economy and employment. We must put an end to this reality, which is a form of deception towards consumers, which is at least how it is felt, to say the least. We must also put an end to all these products that end up in our garbage dumps and that clutter them every day. We must also act immediately on the products that are currently being marketed on European territory, I am thinking in particular of Chinese products. The Court of Auditors noted in one of its latest reports how Chinese products that were marketed in the European Union could represent a form of dangerousness - some reports refer to one in two products marketed in Europe. This issue of control of current products is obviously essential, and I am linking it to a vote that will take place tomorrow, I think, on product safety in this area, which is obviously an extremely important issue. I'm talking about that, why? Because yes, we will have to give our companies, especially the smallest and mediums, a little time to adapt and also produce mandatory labelling in this area in order to guarantee consumers all the necessary transparency. You have to give yourself a little bit of time, but the sooner you get started, the sooner you can help and support them.

Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has I think that most of the speakers in this debate have shown that, of course, we want to make more sustainable products and the internal market sustainable in Europe. But what has also been said is also important: it is also about jobs, it is about consumers, it is about high costs and social compatibility. If, on the one hand, we create something that burdens people, then we must also ensure that we do not create bureaucratic hurdles, that is, a new bureaucratic monster on the part of the European Union, which will lead to widespread rejection in the Member States and ultimately harm the European Union. That is why we need to reduce red tape – for businesses, but also for consumers. I can think of an example, Commissioner Reynders, because you are here, an important example of the issue of cutting red tape: the so-called A1 certificate for workers in other EU countries. Many small companies, but above all scientists with me in Hesse, have complained very much about the fact that they are subjected to a disproportionate bureaucratic burden during short assembly work abroad, at two-day scientific meetings in France and Austria. I have therefore addressed the Commission, and the Commission's answer is: this is not our competence, it is the responsibility of the Member States, we do not see any need for action. But! There is. After all, there are many bureaucratic hurdles due to differences in the application of EU law. And I would like to draw your attention to this point: A1 certificate, please take it with you. There is a need for action here on the part of the Commission, which has the uniform application of Union law for the enforcement of the internal market within its sphere of competence. That would be an example where we can reduce bureaucracy, and then we can also create new requirements for businesses and consumers in the area of sustainability.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 41, "date": "2020-11-23.json", "name": "Sunčana GLAVAK", "mepid": "202036", "text": "   – Dear Chairman, for years consumers have encountered anomalies that need to be corrected. We must strive to create a market where consumers can buy safe and affordable products and services without fear and make, above all, informed decisions.  Consumers today are the focus of many controversies and need to be provided with the necessary protection. On the other hand, there is a need to find a way to enable producers operating in a responsible and sustainable manner to take advantage of the market, especially small and medium-sized enterprises that we need to relieve and not impose additional burdens on them. It is also important to mention the promotion and equalification of European standards that will ensure the durability and quality of all products. This is particularly true of today's global economy, in which we must protect businessmen. This would achieve a dual role for standards, through consumer protection, but also for the protection of businessmen.  It is necessary to promote the reuse of products and repairs, and to try to suppress, of course, as far as possible, practices that shorten the life of products available on the market. It is essential that consumers are provided with the so-called right to repair by making repairs more cost-effective and attractive. One way is to better access information about product repair and maintenance. In this context, I want to mention the establishment of a single charger - it was an important step forward towards reducing electronic waste and preserving the environment. In times to come, we must turn to more sustainable systems that will make the future easier for our citizens. The single market, in fact, has made Europe attractive for business and life. It must be used to its full potential, but also adapt, of course, to change.  But we need to find a balance between the economy and life. I think we're on the right track.

Mr President, thank you very much. Let me, first of all, thank all those who have spoken today in a debate to which I believe the various European institutions are very keen. In any case, I can say that, beyond the report discussed today, this is work that we will also be talking about in a few minutes, on the consumer agenda that the Commission has just adopted. You know, the Commission is committed to strong action to combat climate change and achieve ambitious environmental targets with a comprehensive approach. The Commission has also made clear commitments to integrate sustainability into the next multi-year financial framework. Once the budget negotiations are over, we will be able to mobilise European funding to support sustainable initiatives. We need to organize and support the change in the behaviour of businesses and consumers alike. For businesses, as you know, the initiative, which the Commission will present next year on sustainable governance, will play an important role, but we will also do everything possible to give consumers a better ability to choose sustainable products, including, as your report indicates, credible and readable information on sustainability, a right to reparation, action in the face of programmed obsolescence or the introduction of programmed obsolescence. , to cite a few examples, sustainability criteria in public procurement. We will do this to strengthen the internal market and support employment, taking into account, of course, the particular issues affecting small and medium-sized enterprises. Administrative burdens should not be increased. We will also do this by developing actions to ensure product safety, including from third countries. We have begun the development of an action plan with China to strengthen the safety of products sold online, this is a process that will continue. So I thank you again for the attention you have given for a long time to this consumer protection, I would say above all to strengthening rights and implementing consumer rights. I look forward to continuing our collaboration towards a more sustainable European internal market.

At the same time, almost 80% of EU consumers would prefer to repair a broken appliance rather than buying a new product, but due to the excessively high price of repairs or even the absence of spare parts, our citizens often have no choice but to buy a new product. The lifespan of many household appliances on the European market is significantly lower than it was a few years ago, as demonstrated by European surveys, and the existence of so-called spoilers can no longer be described as hoaxes. While refrigerators once lasted 20-30 years, today many terminate the service shortly after the warranty period expires. That is why I am strongly in favour of banning the use of procedures that deliberately shorten the lifespan of products, known by the familial name of a spoiler, which is also the subject of our amendment. This is despite the fact that a large proportion of fellow MEPs from the right-wing spectrum are opposed to this effort.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by thanking you again for this invitation to present to you, this time, the new consumer agenda published by the Commission on 13 November. This agenda echoes many of the Suggestions of the European Parliament, whether in reports or in other debates in Parliament. For example, on issues such as the sustainability of the internal market, which we have just talked about, or product safety, which will also be on your agenda this week. I think it is important that we can continue to work together on these issues. Europe is known for its high level of consumer protection. With the New Agenda, we want to uphold this European achievement. The Agenda will allow us to ensure that European consumers benefit from the single market, also in a crisis period like the current pandemic. The Agenda sets out a political vision and longer-term priorities, aiming to build trust so that consumers can be key actors for the green and digital transitions and also be key to drive the economic recovery out of the COVID-19 crisis. The Agenda proposes 22 concrete actions. This to address both the immediate challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as longer-term priorities. Our long-term priorities include consumer protection in green and digital transitions. The approach set out in the new agenda will contribute to the implementation of the circular economy and digital strategy action plan, including through more sustainable and safer products and services. The new agenda calls for action to better inform products' environmental characteristics, such as their lifespan, environmental impact and repairability. We will better protect consumers from practices such as eco-money laundering, early obsolescence or the sale of unsustainable products. We will also ensure that the needs of a strong legal framework on artificial intelligence can be met to ensure a high level of consumer protection and fundamental rights online. Consumers need to be able to shop online safely and confidently, as well as in the physical world. The digital transition also has an impact on the consumer credit market. These include new lenders and new ways to assess consumer credit by using their online data. In addition to environmental and digital transitions, the new consumer agenda addresses three other priorities: effective enforcement of legislation and effective remedies, consumer awareness taking into account the specific needs of different groups and strengthening international cooperation. We must ensure that European citizens can enforce their rights as consumers, regardless of their social or economic situation. Consumer accountability in the green and digital transition must be inclusive. A high level of consumer protection cannot be a privilege accessible only to some, for example, those who have access to online tools and digital skills. Let me conclude with a few words on how we want to implement this new policy vision. Given the nature and global dimension of the challenges we aim to address, the agenda seeks to foster consumer policy priorities that could be pursued by the EU and its Member States.  The agenda also suggests a broad partnership, including consumer organisations, but also businesses and all stakeholders, including the European Parliament.

I’d like to add, Commissioner, that the level of protection of consumers in Europe is high, and we should not say something else, lest we create misunderstandings. The level of protection is very high, but that doesn’t mean that consumers such as ourselves haven’t had experiences where the protection was not right. Therefore, the EPP Group wants to work on adapting consumer protection in those areas where it is not yet right.  Let me conclude, first, that it’s very often not the right level of protection in areas where we don’t have full harmonisation, so your task, from our point of view, is first and foremost to fight for full harmonisation, so that we can offer European consumers – wherever they live, wherever they buy, whatever they want to do – the unique and common protection that they merit. Unfortunately, here, we face a lot of resistance, and I kindly remind you that we believe that the best tool and the best project where we have successfully implemented this is the Passenger Rights Directive, where every flight passenger in arrivals at the airport can see their rights and can implement them. Therefore, it has taken us by surprise and by deception, that it was not possible in this crisis to offer all citizens that were flying in the Corona crisis in the first half of the year the same level of reimbursement. Some have been given a voucher, others have been given their money back – and this, in the European Union, in the 21st century is not what consumers merit. We discussed that when we were meeting in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection. That is one important element. We need full harmonisation in consumer protection to make sure that we can move on to the 21st century all together in Europe. The second point I want to point out as well, Commissioner: we believe that consumer protection can be improved in some points, but we don’t believe that the new concept of vulnerable consumers is a valid concept, because there is no general definition of vulnerability. You can become a consumer in vulnerability if you break your leg, but if you haven’t, you are not vulnerable, so we have to adapt this concept with a lot of calm and prudence so as not to create further bureaucracy. One element where we have, in the past, had quite a difficult path with Parliament was the Consumer Credit Directive. If there is something to improve, the EPP is open and ready to work on it, but please, let’s make sure, Commissioner, that we don’t add further bureaucracy to a directive which is already quite difficult to apply in the interests of consumers, because sometimes they would more easily be getting a credit and that is something that we should not block.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 49, "date": "2020-11-23.json", "name": "Christel SCHALDEMOSE", "mepid": "37312", "text": "  for the S&amp;D Group. Mr President! A big thank you to Commissioner Reynders for a good presentation. But let me start by rewinding the time more than 14 years. At that time I was a newly elected Member of the European Parliament. Amazon was only in its infancy, and Facebook had only just been created. When we talked about consumer policy, it was about physical products and how we made them safer. But since then, a lot has happened. Today, online marketplaces outperform traditional physical stores. More and more of our production is taken over by robots and other technologies. On top of that, the green transition today dominates much of the consumer debate. The development has been strong, which is why it is also time for us to develop and adapt our consumer rights from yesterday's world to the world of tomorrow. That is why I am also extremely pleased that the Commission is presenting a proposal for a new consumer agenda. A proposal that not only calls for updating, but also for closing the gaps in our consumer protection rules. I am very pleased with what has been presented and I really think it is worth praising. This is one of the most ambitious things I have seen in the many years i have been a Member of the European Parliament, but of course there are also thistles. There are also things that can be done better, and I will touch on that in a moment. However, let me start by mentioning two things that I think are very good: I am pleased that the Commission is proposing to improve consumer safety on digital platforms. It seems to me that there is no doubt that what is illegal offline must also be illegal online. I hope we will see this not only as a principle, but also concretely translated into legislation. Secondly, I think it is very good that the European Union wants to make consumers more active in the green transition, but we have just debated that and that is why I will not go into it any more. As I said, the trees don't grow into the sky. In some places we should go further than what the Commission is proposing. I do not think, for example, that it is enough for information to be left alone. It must be accompanied by clear rules and clear rights for consumers. Take, for example, the idea of the green consumption pledge! Yes, it is important that we consumers know about the carbon footprint of companies when we pull goods off the shelves, but it cannot stand alone. We must also have a right for consumers, a right to have their products repaired. And then, moreover, we must also look at how we can ensure that market surveillance is improved. Perhaps there is a need to have a check on the checks that are taking place. I also think that it is really important to emphasise that, for example, Members of the European Parliament can also become much more clearly involved in the whole of consumer policy.  The trend has been strong in the last 14 years and will only be faster in the future. That is why we must also be efficient and flexible in our legislation, so that we can ensure green and digital achievements with consumers at the centre and not at their expense. So it is not about making more legislation for the sake of legislation, but it is about ensuring clear climate targets and a level playing field for the benefit of both businesses and consumers through legislation. I very much look forward to working with the Commission and with the European Parliament on this.

As I have little time, let me focus on four of them.  First, package travel. I encourage the Commission to look to the Danish example of their answer to the crisis, where the Guarantee Fund ensured that consumers were reimbursed within the normal delay, while giving a lifeline to travel companies to continue to have liquid assets and not go under. Such temporary guarantee loans seemed to work well for both consumers and businesses alike. But, whatever the final decision is, we cannot have the situation of the last six months, where consumers were used as free bank loans by travel companies. This is not acceptable.  Second, on general product safety and product liability, the key here is a tweaking of the law, not a compete redrafting of it. Much of the legal framework is still working and is working well. We cannot let fear of the future and technological developments lead to new rules that stop or slow down innovation. Risk is not in itself negative. All actions involve risk. If we had banned all products with an element of risk in the past, we would not have elevators in buildings, planes in the air or cars on the road. All innovations include some risk, which we should be willing to take.  Third, on geo—blocking, the deadline for the first review expired on 23 March, and here we are in November. I hope the delay will have given you time to draft the amendment to include copyrighted goods and services, like e-books, videos and music, within its scope. Our citizens should be allowed to buy digital goods across borders. It is time to say ‘enough is enough’ to national fragmented markets. Lastly, we still have the problem of dual product quality in Europe. This must be addressed and included in the guidance from the Commission on unfair commercial practices. We should go further to end this practice once and for all in the single market. So, Commissioner, we have put a lot on your plate. You can count on the support of my group. We just have to make sure that the proposals are balanced and the single market is not fragmented, but better completed.

It is full of good intentions, but you will allow me to welcome it with scepticism, because I had seen the same good intentions in the industrial strategy of the European Union, before discovering that in fact nothing had changed on the merits. It contains two main axes, one ecological, the other digital. I will focus on the digital part for which the European Commission intends to update its legislation. Its stated aims are clear: to combat the collection and use of behavioural data, to combat manipulation (false advertisements, tampered opinions, profiled advertisements), to strengthen surveillance of online commerce to identify defective products, to improve the marking and traceability of products and finally to regulate the digital transition of financial services and thus prevent citizens from being won over by debt. All of these objectives can only be agreed with, but they pose a dual fundamental problem. The first is that the principle of globalization is contradictory to these virtuous goals. The European Commission in its text admits that production and value chains are increasingly globalised and interconnected, but does not intend to change that. Take, for example, China, which is responsible for more than 60% of the defective products that enter the domestic market today. Globalization encourages free trade with China. What will prevent China from supplying substandard products or even cheap counterfeits to the European public on its own online trading sites? These are Chinese sites governed by Chinese law. What European legislation can make a difference to this? The solution advocated by the European Commission, namely the development of pseudo action plans with third countries including China, is a market of dupes. We have already tried this with the United States on the protection of personal data and we have allowed that country to plunder it by pretending to look elsewhere. Only the regulation and questioning of ultra-globalism can provide a lasting solution by, for example, putting in place customs barriers, which I note are totally absent from the project. The second problem is that our regulations will restrict the development of European technology. I take the example of artificial intelligence: by processing and analyzing data en masse, it can, for example, predict reactions in the event of a crisis, typically the health crisis we are currently experiencing. By prohibiting us from exploiting this kind of data, we will deprive our companies of valuable advances in this area. Our international competitors do not have these qualms, they will develop these technologies on their own population and then apply them in other areas, including offensive ones, specifying for example the most effective way to cause mass panic by attacking the organization of certain networks in a country. We will not have the means to respond. The only solution is to offer our data only to strictly regulated European companies and close it to third-party companies. This implies protectionism that is assumed to break with the idea of equal access to the public, the European Commission, of course, is not considering this solution. However, it will have to be considered. These fundamental problems will arise sooner or later and will demand solutions. So, ladies and gentlemen, I have said this many times and I repeat, it is the political will that we lack to actually carry out the necessary reforms, I urge you all to follow me on this reflection and on this path.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 52, "date": "2020-11-23.json", "name": "Anna CAVAZZINI", "mepid": "86793", "text": "  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Madam President, passenger rights, product safety and collective redress – the EU consumer protection standards are amongst the highest in the world.

The climate crisis is more urgent than ever and to empower consumers to make the most sustainable choices is something that we have to urgently do. With a proper right to repair and mandatory labelling we can make the consumers become agents of sustainable change. Many people fear that the digital transformation is going on faster than we, the policy-makers, are able to regulate. This cannot be. Consumer protection may not lag behind in the online world. I am very happy that the Commission took up in its strategy the concept of vulnerable consumers. There are groups that need a closer look, that might need special protection, like for example, heavily indebted fellow citizens. And we have to make sure that our high consumer protection standards are not undermined in trade agreements. Take the precautionary principle: it is a fundamental standard in EU policy-making, yet it is not fully anchored in our bilateral trade agreements, like CETA, and this needs to change. Commissioner, I am expecting ambitious proposals in those areas and am looking forward to working with you and my colleagues in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection (IMCO) on ambitious legislation.

In addition to the many advantages, i.e. greater competition between traders, faster purchasing and access to an enlarged supplier base for consumers, this change poses some risks. This is particularly important in the context of online platforms or sellers outside the common market who are not interested in complying with european Union standards. Such practices, on the one hand, put consumers at risk and, on the other hand, they hit European small and medium-sized enterprises.  In the face of economic collapse, it is essential to develop standards that support consumer rights without undermining consumer purchasing power. The Commission is facing the challenge of updating the rules in response to the challenges of a pandemic and at the same time not overregulate the regenerating market.  The revision of the General Product Safety Directive will be one such task. The legal framework developed for disruptive technologies – such as artificial intelligence – can make it the driving force behind the European economy and a tool to support consumers, or make European economies in the tail end of innovative solutions in a dozen years' time.

According to the European Commission, this programme strengthens the position of European consumers and enables them to play an active role in the green and digital transformation.  Before I get to the more positive points of this programme, I would like to express my regret that this programme does not mark a watermeal down in the fight against dual quality. It does not change the fact that the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, which was supposed to definitively prohibit the dual quality of not only food but also other goods, is unusable due to the intransigence of some Member States of the European Union, particularly Germany and Austria, and the intervention of the European Commission for supervisory authorities in a number of Member States and effectively leads to its legalisation. You, Commissioner Reynders, said: 'European consumers are at the centre of global change. They can affect a lot of things by their actions. Consumers must be able to make sustainable decisions and ensure that their rights are protected in all circumstances.' And I ask you here, Commissioner: does this also apply to the dual quality of food? If the European Commission wants to defend the rights of all consumers, how can it accept the fact that different approaches to the quality of products sold are applied within the single trade area?  So is it now that if consumers say that they do not want double quality, it will be added to the list of unfair commercial practices as we demand it? Or rather, the European Commission advises consumers to go to other countries to buy their goods, which would mean, for example, for Czechs to take German trades by storm during the pandemic. Is that your goal? To be clear, I very much appreciate what the new consumer programme contains. I believe that in many ways this is a step in the right direction and, for example, the priority of effective enforcement of consumer rights is very crucial for me. I just have a problem with the fact that the European Commission cannot be consistent in its actions and often applies a half-hearted approach, and I am very sorry, especially in the case of consumer protection, and I consider this to be a fundamental mistake. Yes, let us strengthen consumer rights, involve more consumer organisations, combat premature product obsolescence, online unfair practices, but let us also not forget that, dear Commission, we have a huge debt to the citizens of the European Union from Central and Eastern Europe.

Consumer protection is taking on new dimensions in the conditions of the digital economy. It's no longer just about exchanging defective goods, poor quality service or refunding money. We are increasingly confronted with sophisticated fraud on the Internet, identity theft or a new phenomenon of so-called cryptocurrencies. These phenomena can no longer be dealt with by individual states on their own.  Any reform of European consumer protection policy must count on them. And we need to create effective mechanisms to protect our citizens from them. This topic is also closely linked to the development of AI technologies – here we must always bear in mind that the ultimate decision-making is man here. Not only in the process of using products and services with AI elements, but also in the overall AI-enabled end chain. A particular topic that I want to draw attention to and which deserves more attention is the topic of protecting children in the online space. They are particularly exposed to deceptive or aggressive business practices and often even harassment. I consider that a number of measures need to be taken to protect children, such as: firstly, to promote media literacy, to develop critical thinking and to develop the skills needed for analysis, which is necessary to recognise the difference between objective facts and subjective opinions. Secondly, initiate the establishment of effective age verification systems and ensure their use in order to ensure that children are protected from digital product, services and content and commercial exploitation. Thirdly, to establish an online mechanism for reporting illegal and inappropriate content on the Internet, including a rapid intervention system, and to prevent access to web content. At the same time, internet service providers, including social networks, need to be involved in playing an active role in preventing and removing illegal content. I think we need the Union principles for safer social networks and the extension of the use of the standard privacy settings for children who register on social networks in order to increase the safety of minors. We also need an EU-wide code of conduct on the sale of video games to minors.

We know that the opposite has happened, the market power of large platforms is enormous and grows every minute due to the network effect. It's more or less like going naked to the market. When we enter an online store, sellers know us better than ourselves and can therefore exploit our weaknesses and vulnerabilities. If we're looking for sneakers, they recommend us a gym, a personal trainer and maybe even a diet program. We thus need to \"dress\" to regain some power and privacy. Consumer data should not be used for purposes other than those for which it was provided, nor should data be collected that is not essential to provide the sought-after service. Commissioner, the digital transition has not just transformed ways of selling and buying. It has also transformed products, which are now confused with services, becoming intelligent and dynamic throughout their life cycle. From the car, which walks by itself, to a simple cooking machine, to which I order the king cake for Christmas, instead of going to the pastry shop, as usual. We need to prevent these digital products from becoming obsolete faster and, above all, to ensure that the speed of entry of new products into the market we are watching, European or imported, and their successive updates are not made by trampling our security. The revision of the General Product Safety Directive should therefore take into account the findings of the IMCO report, which will be presented today, and in particular consider the precautionary principle in relation to innovative products at greatest risk, making the burden of proof that they are not dangerous, and not the other way around. The slowest innovation, in some cases, may be the one that deserves the most confidence and the one that lasts without setbacks. Or the use of blockchain to ensure better traceability of products, or artificial intelligence, to strengthen the capacity of surveillance authorities.

The need to adapt quickly to this way of life has highlighted numerous problems of the online environment. That is why I am pleased to see that the regulation of consumer rights related to this environment is one of the priorities set out by the Commission. It will certainly be one of the difficult areas to regulate, especially if we take into account that the digital market is not limited to the European Union.  Relations between buyers and sellers or producers are already moving beyond traditional national or European cooperation, and we will have to enter the field of international trade relations. We will also have to address the issue of those who cannot be consumers because they do not have access to this market due to lack of infrastructure, technical facilities or knowledge to navigate such a complex environment. Another particularly important point will be the swift implementation of European legislation in the Member States and the effective support of supervisory authorities to ensure that consumer protection regulations are applied. Every consumer in the European Union has the same rights at theoretical level, but we know very well that there are major differences both in the transposition of legislation and in its application and market surveillance. That is why we will need to find specific interoperable digital tools that work across the entire European single market.

There is little good news in the difficult times we are going through, to dare to affirm when a sign of hope crosses our troubled sky. And the agenda we are discussing here is moving in the right direction. It is going in the right direction but, as always, words must be transformed into actions. I think the debate we have is an exciting debate. I understand in some of the speeches that there would be some kind of opposition between the ecological issue and the social issue. In reality, it is the same subject: how to destroy the planet with poor quality products and to push for consumption, especially the most fragile, of products that have a reduced lifespan. It is a social issue and it is an ecological issue. So our job as a legislator is to make rules, otherwise we are useless. Rules that allow both this consideration of the ecological issue, but also the rules that protect consumers and, from this point of view, I stress that, yes, there are vulnerable consumers, and the commission in which I sit is that of the internal market and consumer protection.

This means that consumers need to be better informed and that there is a right to repair that facilitates the transition to a circular economy. Artificial ageing also needs to be addressed. Misleading consumers by deliberately shortening the life of products is an unfair commercial practice that we must ban.  It is important that the new rules encourage consumers to make sustainable choices. Online, too, citizens want to enjoy the same high level of protection. Consumers are increasingly buying products and services online. In this context, we are seeing an increase in unauthorised activities such as online fraud, the dissemination of false information and certain forms of profiling. These practices affect consumer choice and do not belong in Europe.  In addition, there are specific groups of consumers with specific needs. Children, people with limited digital literacy, families in difficult financial situations are some examples of this. They ask for a customized protection.  The COVID–19 crisis also exposed some gaps in European consumer law. Let's learn from this and take this lesson into the future.

Many people who have to turn around every euro three times due to COVID have spent their savings on annual leave. This money must not now disappear into airline balance sheets.

In the circumstances of an unprecedented crisis, this is not an easy task at all. European consumers, 450 million of them, as a weaker contracting party in a legal relationship with traders must enjoy qualified redress.  It is through effective redress and a comprehensive consumer protection policy that the single market can function properly and effectively. Empowering consumers, protecting their security and economic interests are priority policy objectives of the European Union. During the COVID-19 crisis, consumer policy has proven crucial to ensuring reimbursement of costs for cancelling services, combating the spread of disinformation and UTPs, in particular those selling fraudulent or non-compliants' medical equipment.  However, while the European Union has a long tradition of protecting consumer rights, the crisis has shown us that there is room for improvement in the consumer protection system as well. In this regard, the European Commission has correctly detected the key priorities it wishes to achieve over the next five-year period, in particular the green transition, digital transformation, level of redress and protection of vulnerable groups. In doing so, I would certainly highlight the issue of digital transformation and the new challenges emerging in the European market such as the issue of selling defective products, spreading fake news that we have to fight with all the instruments we have at our disposal. In doing so, I would point out that the legal protections that consumers should enjoy should be uniform across the European Union so that consumers in Croatia, Germany, Italy or the Netherlands enjoy exactly the same rights. In this regard, the European Union should continue to build a consumer policy based on the scientific background at the heart of which is the consumer, which sees entrepreneurs as partners in the implementation of this policy, not as enemies.  As a member of the Internal Market and Consumer Protection Committee, I welcome the new strategy and at the same time call for us to use the lessons we learned in the crisis to ensure a high level of consumer redress.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 64, "date": "2020-11-23.json", "name": "Marc ANGEL", "mepid": "202073", "text": "   – Madam President, a fantastic achievement of the European Union has been the development of a robust consumer law acquis, providing rights to consumers and also empowering them to make the right decisions. EU consumer law should largely be based on the principle that well-informed consumers make the best choices and that they can trust in an effective law enforcement. Commissioner, like my S&amp;D colleagues and many others, I welcome the update of the Consumer Agenda. I would like to highlight two specific issues. First of all, the notions of ‘average consumer’ and ‘vulnerable consumer’ which are used in EU law. I believe that, in the digital world, these notions need to be called into question because the consumer is faced with constant monitoring and manipulation. Consumers are in a state of permanent digital vulnerability, or ‘vulnerability by default’. Therefore, we need a shift away from the average consumer to the principle of ‘protection by default or by design’. This would be a clear and real reaction on the information asymmetries we face. I also believe, like many of us here, that legislation without effective enforcement puts at risk consumers’ trust and confidence in the single market. And here I arrive at my second topic. According to the regulation on air passengers’ rights, passengers should be reimbursed in seven days for cancelled flights. We all know that. Even if we intend to help airlines overcome the extraordinary circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic and protect the employees – there are hundreds and thousands of employees in these companies – this can only happen without harming consumer rights.  I believe that the recommendation of the Commission on reimbursement for cancelled transport services in the context of the pandemic was necessary. However, on my written question, Commissioner Vălean answered that the responsibility of enforcement is linked to the national enforcement bodies and that the Commission considers appropriate actions only in case of a systematic failure. Well, I think there is a clear systematic failure in this case, but we do not see an effective reaction to that by the Commission, so we should avoid such situations. If we want to keep consumers’ trust and confidence in the single market we have to do that. I hope that these examples help to clarify how we can develop our Consumer Agenda beyond 2020.

However, the desired result is in the effect and we expect something from you there. Without consumer confidence, there is no market. So consumer confidence needs to be strengthened, especially when it comes to digital purchases. I believe that consumers should be better protected online than offline. Offline you see what you buy. You can feel it. You can see it. Online, you don't know where your store is. Is it in China or is it on the corner? A survey in Germany indicates that one in four consumers are faced with online fraud, of which 30% actually lose money because they fall for online fraud. I think we need to ensure that we have fantastic protection. I also do not know exactly how, but perhaps due to a delay at banks so that the money can be reclaimed later, because if you have lost your money, then you as a consumer have hardly any rights, because go for a small purchase litigating with a seller in China or wherever. Then we hope that you will come up with proposals that are cast into a regulation, full harmonised legislation in a single market, and not that Member States should transposing the directives, giving us a kind of Scottish blanket with all sorts of different levels of legislation, so that consumers don't know where they are, but neither do businesses. Regulations are therefore good for businesses and good for consumers.  Promoting safe products is very important. But what is also very important – we have seen this with COVID–19 – is to promote a healthy lifestyle. And perhaps we can encourage that with the proposals you are going to make, and we trust them. Then there must be reciprocity, in the sense that companies from outside the European Union that offer products in the European Union and make money there must fully comply with all the European protection legislation we know.

It should be added that the restrictions resulting from the measures necessary to contain COVID have pushed consumers further towards this commercial mode, increasing online purchases, which since 2009 have even doubled, from 32 to 60 %. The new consumer agenda comes at the right time, because it must be recognised that existing legislation is no longer adequate to fully protect our consumers, just as businesses cannot be fully satisfied with their access to the digital market either. At the moment the goods we buy online are not subject to controls comparable to those that traditional distributors have to comply with and this often causes great dissatisfaction with many goods and services bought online. In the case of food purchases, the greatest risk is of incurring low-quality products or counterfeiting, with potential risks also to health. We must pay attention to initiatives aimed at modernising digital services, with both consumer and producer protection as a priority. Digital platforms, whose role has increased considerably in recent years, must be more responsible for the services they offer and we must pay close attention to vulnerable users in order to protect them from fraud or impropriety. We must combat unfair commercial practices that violate the right of consumers to make an informed choice, by abusing their behavioural inclinations or by altering their decision-making processes with covert or misleading advertising.

An essential condition for making the Digital Single Market more attractive and dynamic is that both citizens and businesses have confidence in e-commerce. For a long time, all signs have pointed in the direction of the need to modernise certain consumer protection rules in order to meet the current challenges. I am pleased that the Commission has also seen the need for changes and, as a result, the new consumer strategy that we are discussing today has been presented, which I can only welcome.  I believe that better enforcement of the rules is a more effective means of redress. Deeper knowledge of consumer rights can strengthen consumer confidence and a sense of security. However, the rules can only be effective if they allow consumers to easily obtain redress in the event of an infringement and can be implemented by national authorities. The strategy tries to answer important consumer protection issues that are emerging today. Markets continue to develop and change rapidly, mainly due to the effects of the coronavirus epidemic. The pandemic has increased consumers' need for transparency, sustainability and comfort. The biggest advantages will be given to companies that gain consumer trust, do not regret the investment needed to achieve a smooth and trouble-free shopping experience, and prioritise the health and safety of consumers.  I very much ask the Commission to pay attention to consumer safety, in particular the cybersecurity aspects of consumer protection, and to continue to monitor consumer markets in order to identify emerging problems.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hu", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 1, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 69, "date": "2020-11-23.json", "name": "Edina TÓTH", "mepid": "27714", "text": "   membre de la Commission. – Madame la Présidente, Mesdames, Messieurs les députés, je voudrais vous remercier à nouveau de ce débat comme du débat précédent et je me réjouis que votre assemblée s’engage pleinement dans la mise en œuvre du nouvel agenda du consommateur. Comme je l’ai mentionné au début de notre débat, votre rôle dans l’élaboration des priorités et des actions présentées dans cet agenda est primordial et je voudrais revenir sur un certain nombre d’aspects en saluant d’abord le fait que vous vous penchez non seulement sur la politique que nous pourrions mener à l’intérieur de l’Union européenne, mais aussi sur la façon de poursuivre cette politique dans des accords internationaux, je pense notamment aux accords de commerce. Un certain nombre de politiques devront effectivement être utilisées pour atteindre nos objectifs et pas seulement spécifiquement la politique du consommateur dans l’Union européenne. Il y a d’autres cadres bien entendu à utiliser de la même manière. Maintenant, je voudrais, comme je le disais, revenir sur quelques questions évoquées. EU harmonisation has brought solid progress for consumer policy. Many EU consumer laws follow this approach, such as the Directive on pre—contractual information and rights of withdrawal for online contracts. However, when proposing new legislation we need to carefully consider the level of protection in the different Member States. Sometimes minimum harmonisation is chosen so that Member States have a possibility to go beyond common EU requirements in certain areas. Therefore, the Commission will decide on the level of harmonisation of its proposal on a case-by-case basis.  We need to work on concrete enforcement of the rights enshrined in EU law for consumers, and for protection of consumers. For example, the Commission opened 11 infringement proceedings against Member States that adopted national measures contrary to the Package Travel Directive during the pandemic.  Four proceedings are still open, and in addition I wrote on 30 October to 10 Member States that are now back in compliance with EU rules but that had adopted national legislation contrary to the Package Travel Directive. I urged them to take measures to remedy the situation created by their past legislation that ran contrary to Union law and to make sure that consumers effectively get their rights in accordance with the Package Travel Directive.  I also reminded them of the primacy of EU law and some will continue to work, to organise, of course, protection of consumers, but more than that, to go to real enforcement of consumer rights. And we will pay attention to some categories of consumers, vulnerable ones like children, but we will also pay attention to other kinds of people – I’m thinking about people having difficulties to use digital tools, like people with disabilities. For them, we need to organise better accessibility.  The Geo-blocking Regulation was adopted in 2018. As explained in the Consumer Agenda, the Commission is evaluating its impact and will publish a report. This report will include an assessment of the possible application of new rules to certain electronically supplied services which offer copyright protected content, such as music, e-books, software and online games, as well as of services in sectors such as transport and audiovisual.  The Commission is of course strongly committed to addressing all kinds of unfair commercial practices, including practices suggesting to consumers that goods have the same composition and characteristics when this is not the case. In this context, the Commission will continue to work with the Member States and their competent authorities in order to ensure correct and timely transposition of the new rules in the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive. These rules have been introduced by the Better Enforcement and Modernisation Directive that will apply across the EU from May 2022.  Moreover, as dual-quality cases are cross-border cases by nature, the Commission will facilitate and support the work of the competent authorities of the Member States under the new Consumer Protection Cooperation (CPC) Regulation.  As announced in the Agenda, the Commission will come with further concrete proposals in the following months and years, and in the second quarter of the next year three legislative proposals will be put on the table: an initiative to empower consumers in the green transition, a review of the Consumer Credit Directive and a review of the General Product Safety Directive. So I’m looking forward to working further with you in the preparation and follow-up of these proposals.  Our goal is to build a real trust in consumers in the good functioning of the internal market and in the safety and sustainability of all the products proposed in the EU, offline and online, and of course, I’m sure that we will work together to build such a trust inside the European Union. So thank you again for this opportunity to present to you the Consumer Agenda.

Madam Vice-President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the Commissioner for her excellent work and for the work she has done. First of all, a warm greeting to God, dear Mairead McGuinness. I believe it is the first time that you are no longer sitting up there as Vice-President in your new role, but here with the Commissioners. Welcome and I look forward to a good cooperation with you in the future. Let me say a few sentences to what we are debating today. The MiFID adjustment that we are now talking about is just a few things. MiFID itself is a very large, very complex piece of legislation, and the Commission has rightly identified a few points where we now also need to provide answers in view of the situation in 2020. I just want to pick out a few points. Firstly, I am pleased that we can now speak in plenary. I would say very clearly that at no time in committee was it possible to even talk briefly about this dossier, that the Commission can imagine its issues, that we can also talk.  I do not think that is acceptable. The way in which the European Parliament operates is very, very unsatisfactory at this point, to put it very clearly. I do not think that this is acceptable for us to legislate on a permanent basis without even having a debate. And I even had to fight for us to talk about it here in plenary today, otherwise it would have gone through everything without debate. That is not the way to go. Secondly, we must also consider: is it COVID-relevant here or is it not COVID-relevant what we do? I believe that the COVID pandemic has clearly shown one thing: companies that were well positioned even before the crisis have so far got through quite well. But when companies start adapting to new challenges, they have a very difficult time. And that is where the Commission's proposal is all about. How can we facilitate companies' access to capital and how can we facilitate investor access to companies?  And that is precisely the challenge at stake, which we must also answer at this time. That is why it is specifically about: how do we better bring supply and demand together? I would also like to say quite frankly that this is not about undermining investor protection, as some people claim. Yes, sorry, if we no longer overwaste a professional investor who really does nothing else every day, who knows what it is all about – I can't say otherwise – then it is not a softening of consumer protection, but the challenge is to give professional investors the opportunity to make a decision, but not to overwhelm them by constantly being overwhelmed with new information. This is not deregulation, it is adaptation. The same applies when it comes to allowing new medium-sized enterprises on the capital market. I do not know where the problem is. I am surprised that, for example, an ESMA dossier is not accepted here, which clearly states that our regulations make it so difficult for new companies – especially the excellently positioned mid-caps, which are world market leaders in their segment, even though they employ only a few people – to access the capital market. The Commission is taking up what ESMA says, and SUDDENLY ESMA no longer plays a role. While on the third issue in the Commission proposal, on the position limits, what ESMA says is rejected in bausch and arc. I wonder: where are we here? I looked at commodity futures markets in Chicago in 2008; I looked at the preparation of the MiFID commodity futures markets in London so that we could get the best out of the people of Europe, namely no speculation on food. And now there are even organisations such as Finance Watch, which we finance from the European Union budget and which are sending around here sending around and claiming that we are allowing food speculation. It is clear in the Commission's proposal: no! It is clear from the Council decision: no! It is clear in Parliament's decision: No! What is it all about? It is about us wanting to take the transformation of our energy supply forward – in Europe. We need to give small new entrants – not the large electricity companies, whom we are making life harder with the Commission proposal by examining certain exemptions more rigorously in the future – new entrants – a small cooperative that operates its wind farm, a small group that operates a solar system – to survive in the market.  The shops will take place, either in the European Union with the euro, with European partners, or they will be hedged outside Europe, with investors from other countries outside the European Union. Is that our ambition? If we want the Green Deal to succeed, we must allow it to happen. I understand that some Members have ideological problems here. But my dear friends, this is not about ideology. It is a question of preparing Europe, making it capable of action, of strengthening the euro, of making our business here in the European Union attractive to investors from the European Union. I therefore ask that we support the decision of the ECON Committee here in plenary.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 1, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 77, "date": "2020-11-23.json", "name": "Mairead McGUINNESS", "mepid": "28115", "text": "  Member of the Commission. – Madam President, I thank you very much Madam Vice-President, thank you colleagues and thank you Mr Ferber for your warm welcome back to my old home. It’s very hot in here and perhaps this debate will be a heated one but a very necessary one. And as it is my first return to Parliament: I do miss you somewhat, but I hope that I can do good service for Europe now as Commissioner. You’ve dealt with some of the issues, but I want to just say that this debate is important because we need clarity, and therefore I hope I can provide that to you. I want to thank Mr Ferber for his work and for this report. It is a very important part of our Capital Markets Recovery Package, and this was proposed in July. And we want it to help the recovery from this COVID-19 crisis and we want it agreed as soon as possible, because time is of the essence in terms of getting capital flowing to where it’s needed. There are some concerns, and I’m sure I’ll hear them spelled out in detail this evening and I will listen very carefully to them. But first, let me address some issues, which may help our understanding. The first point is that our recovery from this crisis has to be green: I’ve made that statement in every comment I’ve made publicly since becoming Commissioner. The green energy transition needs to be accompanied by greater liquidity and transparency in the markets for energy derivatives. Producers of green energy, electricity from wind or solar, need to negotiate forward contracts. These contracts secure a minimum price for energy produced from renewable sources, and these forward supply contracts are derivative contracts. They secure a certain price for green energy. These forward contracts serve the real economy by providing some certainty to investors in the growing renewable energy sector. This is not about price speculation; it’s about certainty for those who are investing. Second, to be effective, forward supply contracts need to be liquid and available on a new generation of energy exchanges. If we maintain the current low position limit of 25% of market participants, these energy exchanges simply will not take off. And this is particularly important for energy contracts in smaller Member States, as contracts for forward delivery of green energy are still in their infancy. At most, there are often two or three market participants offering such hedging tools, and this means that all of these market players would be in breach of the 25% position limit even before the market takes off, and I’m sure you agree that is not what we want to see. My third point is that there is a clear link to the Covid pandemic. Energy prices have been volatile due to the more erratic demand for energy. Production capacity has ebbed and flowed in line with Covid restrictions. It is crucial that we protect the income for renewable energy producers when demand for energy is volatile. Fourthly, I want to be very clear that the Commission is not using the Covid crisis as a cover to introduce opportunities for food or energy price speculation. The proposed amendments do not apply to agriculture derivatives or derivatives for food for human consumption. The proposed amendments also do not apply to mature energy derivative markets. These markets will remain subject to the rules agreed with Parliament in 2016. Securing a decent price for the delivery of green energy is not price speculation. So in conclusion, inaction on energy derivative reform means that there are no transparent energy exchanges offering derivative contracts for electricity produced in smaller Member States. In our preparatory work we have presented evidence to this effect. Some will argue that there is no rush in reforming energy markets and that volatility is not going to last. I would just say that the COVID-19 crisis hit us harder and over a longer time period than any of us expected, and indeed, when my staff started working on this, this was not the case. So we are living with a more prolonged situation. Therefore, we cannot afford to postpone this important reform of energy markets for another year. The proposed measures are more important than ever. They should be adopted by the end of this year to make it easier for capital markets to support European businesses to recover from the crisis. Thank you, and I look forward to what I hope will be a very stimulating debate and where there is better understanding of the issues that may be in play at the moment.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 78, "date": "2020-11-23.json", "name": "Othmar KARAS", "mepid": "4246", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to thank the commissioner for her work and for the work she has done Rapporteur Markus Ferber, warm congratulations on this excellent report with the aim of reshaping the future and on the impassioned speech. We need to turn many screws to help citizens and businesses get out of the crisis. The NextGenerationEU investment plan, the Green Deal, the EU long-term budget and our monetary policy measures must and will also be followed by the financial market, and we want to put it more at the service of our common future. Indeed, unlike the 2008 financial crisis, when some banks were the source of the problem, the financial sector is now part of the solution. We have already successfully tightened the first screw in the banking sector. The banking rules have been revised at record speed to mobilise €450 billion in additional loans. We have preferred the extended support factor for SMEs to make it easier and more widely available for loans, pension loans and infrastructure financing. We have relaxed the capital rules for software investments in order to provide an answer to digitalization. Turning the second screw is just about, namely the package of measures for the recovery of capital markets. We are adopting this Ferber report in order to reduce unnecessary administrative burdens, promote the recapitalisation of companies and strengthen the international role of the euro by supporting the development of the market for energy derivatives. We are working on the right dosage of the securitisation financial instrument, which I am negotiating with Paul Tang, in order to increase support for SMEs, further boost lending and create new investment opportunities. We are developing an EU reconstruction prospectus to help companies raise capital in the form of shares, rather than continuing to get into debt. We have tackled many screws, many areas. We are not finished yet, but we must use this time to reduce the risks, to eliminate the problems and to actively address the challenges. We must not waste any time.

That has been heard from the Commission. My political group fully supports measures helping business, in particular in these difficult times of COVID-19. That is what business needs – financial support – but it needs it now in the days, weeks and months to come. That is why the S&amp;D Group took the lead for the EU recovery fund and welcomes the EIB’s EUR 25 billion pan-European Guarantee Fund supporting SMEs. At the same time, we are fully aware that there is a deeper structural problem with a lack of equity financing of the European Union businesses. This needs structural solutions, with the right level of investor protection. This is the reason why my Group wants the Commission to come forward with an ambitious reform of the MiFID rules by mid next year, after full consultation of all stakeholders, and based on a serious impact assessment. Indeed, structural long existing problems cannot be solved in a hasty way via a quick fix. That is the reason why we had rather strong reservations around the MiFID quick fix from the start. We fail to see the clear link between this proposal and the COVID-19 crisis. In particular as these rules will only be applicable at the earliest second half 2021. So let’s be clear: we will not allow the COVID-19 crisis to be used as an excuse for a deregulation agenda, and this is a real threat here. This quick fix, or, as some have proposed, a mini review should not become a maxi review. Therefore my Group, together with the Greens, tabled a very targeted amendment on the review of the position limits in derivative contracts. This should make it possible to address a specific problem in emerging energy markets, which are suffering the impact of COVID, instead of removing a balanced system which we have agreed during the last mandate period.  Secondly, if we want to convince investors to invest in the market, transparency around the costs is critical. Unbundling rules are introduced by MiFID II to allow for a more transparent reporting of costs, and that has to be accepted also in the future. Therefore, we proposed a strong review clause and this reform needs to be well prepared based on facts and data and after consultation with all the relevant stakeholders. As the S&amp;D Group, we are looking forward to such a balanced reform which also protects investors and helps businesses.

It’s the first opportunity to formally congratulate you in a plenary session, so I wish you well. The response to the economic crisis caused by the global pandemic needs to be multifaceted. It needs to embrace both public and private national governments and the European institutions. And the European Union has responded quickly and generously to provide support to the broader economies, including a temporary state aid framework, the European Central Bank’s pandemic emergency purchase programme, and the European Investment Bank’s EUR 200 billion support plan for small and medium-sized enterprises. Aside, of course, from the injections of public money, it is important that the market as well contributes to the recovery, and the amendments to the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive were timely, and the Parliament did react quickly and in a spirit of cooperation to ensure these amendments could take effect as soon as possible. These amendments will provide investors with greater flexibility and will also ease some of the burdensome requirements, thereby freeing up resources and allowing investors to contribute to the recapitalisation of our small and medium-size enterprises, which are the backbone of the European economy. I suppose I am disappointed I did put down some amendments, Commissioner, to this particular report around the issue of dual listing of companies on different stock exchanges – so, for example, Irish companies dual listed in Dublin and in the UK – and certainly it is regrettable that they weren’t taken on board. I know that the European Securities and Markets Authority did bring forward partial solutions, but that does not resolve the issue around Irish companies listed in Dublin and in the UK in euros. So I would really urge the Commission to look at that. And I know that Brexit is a word that, you know, is very sensitive at the moment because we around the final negotiations, but I do believe that we can’t let any inhibitants to capital and liquidity and access to same, and if this issue is not addressed around dual listing of companies, well then it could tie up a huge amount of capital that is required by Irish companies. Also, Commissioner, the pandemic shows the urgency around the capital markets union. We all need to ensure that there’s no inhibitants or blocks to access to finance, and the Covid pandemic has brought forward a certain element of urgency in us responding to the needs of the broader economy out there. But when we return to some form of normality, we have to insist that the capital markets union is a vibrant market, that it ensures that there is access to finance and also that there is accessibility to trading: in other words, people can invest knowing that there’s certainty and they can trade. So I would urge that we do not relax, that we stay in tune, and we ensure that the capital market union is a priority.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 4, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 81, "date": "2020-11-23.json", "name": "Joachim KUHS", "mepid": "197482", "text": "  On behalf of the ID Group, I would like to make a i-see of the Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. Mr Ferber, thank you very much for your report. The Financial Markets Directive is an important piece of legislation aimed at promoting the development of currently underdeveloped capital markets in the EU, while ensuring investor and consumer protection. Especially in the age of Corona, it is important to ensure that our European companies can recapitalise quickly and safely. However, the history of this directive is also a prime example of institutional uncertainty. One step forward, two back. It was not until 2018 that we drastically tightened financial regulation. We have forced the financial sector to shower its customers with hundreds of pages of paperwork, as well as registering confidential phone calls between companies and customers. No one believes that this somehow protects the interests of customers. The only ones who benefited from MiFID were the financial advisers, who collected huge consulting fees by helping the financial sector to comply with the rules they had drawn up themselves. But then a small miracle happened. In a rare moment of listening to her bad conscience, the Commission recognised her mistake and proposed a review. Unfortunately, this is now being postponed until 2021. However, given that, in COVID times, small and medium-sized enterprises are having a very difficult time finding investment capital on the market – partly because of MiFID – this Parliament is now trying to carefully debureaucratise part of the financial market – and we welcome that. Unfortunately, the rapporteur has now withdrawn many of his good proposals in order to please the left – and we regret that. However, we expect the directive to be reviewed next year and further deregulated and de-bureaucratised. That is why we also recommend that we vote in favour of the directive. But what if the next financial crisis breaks out in the coming years? Given the huge increase in public and private debt across the EU, that would not even be a surprise. Will we then increase the regulatory burden again? I am sure that the consulting industry would be enthusiastic. For once, what our companies and investors really need is regulatory security. Overturning the rules does not create confidence in the EU institutions. On the contrary, the more we regulate at European level, the more we experience the centrifugal forces of an EU that is still struggling to hold together. And you all don't want that.

You inherit a dossier which is not easy in this House: there are many groups that we do not like the quick fix that the Commission has presented. I think you are aware of this, because we have the impression that we are walking a path that will dismantle everything that had cost us so much to build from the G20 after the previous financial crisis and some of these measures are clearly on the way to deregulating finances, in a path that seems very dangerous to us. I enter MiFID, to begin with, the limit regime of positions that was introduced to avoid speculation of raw materials in the energy sector. We cannot forget that this measure was introduced precisely after the food price crisis in 2009 and 2011 — so as not to repeat this issue. The Commission contends, and today reminds us, that the proposed changes to this scheme are carefully calibrated, because they will not apply to agricultural commodity derivatives; it is true, but what is completely ignored is the strong interrelationship that exists between energy markets and food markets.  Clearly, if there is a speculative attack on energy prices this is going to affect the food markets, something that Oxfam and Finance Watch have reminded us of, and they are right, Mr Ferber. In addition, I have to say, Commissioner, that the MiFID Directive states in a very clear way that, before touching this regime, you should have submitted an environmental impact assessment, which you have not done. I know we have the ESMA study, but the MiFID Directive does not mandata ESMA to do this, it makes you mandata, and we don't have this impact assessment study yet. Therefore, this reform does not satisfy us in any way. But there are also other measures that are added to these , as I said before , very worrying, for example: how is it possible for the Commission to introduce, in another reform, preferential treatment for synthetic securitisation, in which risk transfer is achieved through the use of derivatives, when we know that derivatives in financial markets were at the centre of the financial crisis? Or, for example, what justifies the proposal that the securitisation of delinquent loans be treated better in terms of capital requirements? We have the impression that we are giving a covert subsidy to banking in exchange for increased systemic risk, and that is a profound mistake.  These measures do not help finance the real economy of families, they only increase risk and financing, and what I think we have to ask ourselves is: when the next financial crisis comes — and we know that we have very significant risks in front of us – are these measures that we are taking to help us better deal with the financial crisis or will we be in worse condition? We certainly believe that on this path we are not doing well and, in the specific case of MiFID, the reasonable, sensible thing to do, would be to postpone this partial reform, to wait for the comprehensive reform that we have to do, for you to be able to make your environmental impact assessment, and thereby to face a comprehensive reform of the Directive. These reforms in a hurry and running in this way of regimes as, as, as delicate and important as that of the limits of positions I do not think they lead us on the right path.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 83, "date": "2020-11-23.json", "name": "José GUSMÃO", "mepid": "88715", "text": "  gue/NGL Group. – Madam President, this document is another one of several quick fixes, quick arrangements, which have been put to this Parliament in recent times, all of them in order to deregulate the financial system and all of them retreating into many of the most important consensuses which, in spite of everything, at least in the speeches, have been built on the regulation of the financial system following the financial crisis and we see all of them being reversed today.  Information to investor clients is now no longer information, it is not transparency; it is unnecessary bureaucracy and therefore touches to cut it. It is not quite possible that capital markets will work better, giving less information to customers and researchers, but that is what has been approved. It is not only proposed in this report, but also in a report which has passed very discreetly on prospects.  We are also retreating into the very organisation of the financial system. We know that derivatives were a product that was at the heart of the last financial crisis. We know that securitisation was also one of the key elements in the instability that led to the last financial crisis. We know, with regard to agricultural goods and energy goods, that we have already had several demonstrations of the very strong correlation between these markets, including the crises that have already been mentioned.  On this, there has been no impact study, because a quick consultation with some representatives of the financial industry is not an impact assessment. It is only the European institutions, the Commission and the European Parliament, who make their work the direct representation of the lobbyists of the financial system, in line with what is the worst tradition of public action in regulating the financial system.  There is a reason why we are having all these quick arrangements, now in a hurry, in the midst of the COVID crisis and that reason has nothing to do with the economic recovery, it has nothing to do with getting capital to small and medium-sized enterprises, which is the usual conversation whenever these proposals come up on the table.  It has to do with two very simple issues: using the economic crisis to push this agenda of deregulation of the financial system against everything we learned in the last financial crisis, and two, taking advantage of the fact that people are distracted by more serious events and more media events to push a deeply irresponsible agenda and that people would refuse and refuse if they were informed of it.

It is a pleasure to have you here, now sitting in the Commission area. I hope these months of work have been positive. The truth is that, since the start of this crisis, the Commission has shown high activism, with legislative proposals for partial reform of previous regulations — the revision of the Capital Requirements Regulation, the recent revision in relation to securitisations, prospects... — and I believe that the Socialist Group has tried to be a part of or bring together a majority in this chamber that would allow these legislative proposals to be processed with the aim of facilitating the release of capital to sustain capital. productive economy and allow the banking sector, which had been at the focus of the previous crisis, now that it is facing this crisis in principle with better capital ratios, to help. We certainly have done so, with all the proposals, and in today's debate on the proposal for a Directive for the protection of investors we have ambivalent feelings. We believe that the Commission's proposal was reasonably reasoned, but we also consider that the rapporteur of this House, Markus Ferber, has tried to expand the area of liberalisation, for review, of the Directive which the Commission itself had carried out. It has also done so a few months before the Commission itself presented the proposal for a comprehensive revision of MiFID, without the necessary technical support, without the impact reports engsing a wider debate in this house. Markus complained that we had not had the opportunity to discuss this directive in committee, and it is true. But I would also like to share that this debate would have taken longer from the European Commission, with a deeper analysis of the impact, and that some of the proposals in this report should most likely be in the future review that you are going to prepare. In any case, I believe that my group has done the work, and I would particularly like to congratulate our rapporteur, Eero Hein-luoma, because I believe that he has managed to get the debate right. And it has channeled it and allowed some of the rapporteur's proposals not to finally be in this text, which is why our group will support it, but we certainly believe that there has been no necessary public debate for the reforms to be adopted, bearing in mind that we are going to have a formal proposal for a thorough review of MiFID next year.

I look forward to further good cooperation.  This debate here on the reform of our financial markets is indeed taking place in a very difficult situation – in a situation of serious economic upheaval in Europe, the extent of which is not yet clear. Gross domestic product has fallen by 8%. We have record-breaking aid programmes: EUR 400 billion in Germany alone; Europe will put EUR 750 billion into the works. Many other states are also indebted to stabilize the economy during this period.  At the same time, technology companies are making record profits, especially in the area of Internet services, while the real economic activities of smaller companies are suffering major losses. Inequality and economic concentration of power are increasing. Unfortunately, in this situation, we still have no progress in increasing the taxation of these global digitised activities in the market.  The ECB has acted decisively: it has so far bought EUR 600 billion in bonds, put EUR 1 500 billion in cheap liquidity into the market, and at the same time the capital requirements for the banking system have been reduced by some EUR 100 billion. In the summer alone, about 6% of bank loans were deferred, and in some Member States more than 10%. This means that we are entering a situation of severe economic upheaval, in a situation with low bank equity – still only around 5% of the balance sheet total. In summary, a new banking crisis is looming and we have to ask ourselves tough questions about the resolution of banks that are in difficulty. In this situation, we are discussing mini-reforms in the financial market that will not solve these major problems.

We expect a structural change to the financial markets directive proposed by the European Commission, with an impact assessment properly presented, and the responsibility of the European Commission, and that is what we lack and that is what we lack in this process.  It cannot be all on the pretext of the crisis and deregulation changes cannot be made on the pretext of responding to the crisis.

As part of the recovery package, the aim is to facilitate more private investment to counter the problems faced by firms as a result of COVID-19. Regulatory requirements that administratively clutter the mobilisation of such investment will be eased while the effects of the pandemic last. Yet more generally, the intention is to make the basic regulatory text less burdensome on investors and financial intermediaries, but mainly the latter.  The target is to dust away so-called formal burdens. The recovery package is serving as a basis from which longer-term changes to the regulatory framework are carried out. Yet, a comprehensive review of the framework is scheduled for the near future. But why pre-empt it as of now without a proper assessment? At a time of crisis, investor confidence can act fast. To maintain existing levels of investment globalisation, let alone increase them as we are seeking to do, is a stiff challenge.

But look, I want to be very clear to colleagues who are suspicious about what we are doing in the Commission, and maybe it’s good that this item is first up on my agenda. I am no supporter of light-touch regulation, and I’m going to repeat that for all ears: I do not support light-touch regulation. The second observation is that our banks are stronger going into this crisis because of regulation, and therefore we have had the flexibility so banks can lend. So be very clear: this is not an agenda for deregulation, and I hope that you hear my words and take them as they are. Indeed, nor are they an agenda for over-bureaucratic systems, and I think what we have to do, as the Commission and the co-legislators, is work together effectively so that our regulation works and that it has an impact. The reason why we went for a quick fix is because we needed to react to the COVID-19 crisis. Indeed, some of you have rightly used this evening’s debate to talk about some of the challenges that we will face in the coming months, and they will be very difficult, and you know that before the end of this year the Commission will come forward with a communication on non-performing loans. And we do that so that we raise this issue which will face us in the coming months. We don’t know when, but we want to prepare. So do not look on the Commission as an ally for bureaucracy or for light-touch regulation. I lived through light-touch regulation and I know it does not work. So I hope that you are convinced, those of you who had concerns about what we are doing, that this is an agenda for something that none of us wish or want, and I need to be very clear on that, and I hope that message gets through. There were some other specific issues raised about why are we not dealing with the social-economic, why are we only dealing with these sorts of financial issues. But clearly there is a link between public health and the economy, and banks, and financial stability. You cannot separate one from the other, and I think we all know that and we need to work together on it. And particularly when you mentioned the climate crisis, as one of the colleagues did: this is integral to what we’re trying to do. Publicly, I have said very loudly that we will not allow Covid to take our eye off the issue of addressing climate change. The challenge is greater for us, and therefore I think the challenge for our institutions is to work very effectively, so that even with the COVID-19 public health crisis, which we are not out of yet, we will legislate effectively and deal with the climate emergency, the biodiversity challenge, the environmental difficulties. We’re also looking at the social aspects of companies, not just the financial. So I want you to be very clear today, in my first appearance in Parliament, that there will be no light-touch regulation on my watch – but there will, I hope, be effective regulation that you, as Members of this Parliament, have helped to shape. I want to thank the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON) for the work that they’ve done and Marcus Ferber for the work that he has done as rapporteur. The differences that are, if you like, on the floor this evening can be resolved if we listen to each other very carefully. Remember that I come from a background of the food supply chain, of agricultural markets. I fought for unfair trading practices legislation, against the wishes of some in the House, but we got there. So please rest assured: we are in very serious times here. What we are trying to do, and we hope we will be effective, is to make sure that finance flows to SMEs, that those sectors which are currently very hit by this pandemic, who have had to open and close because of the various waves of this pandemic, will survive. And I think we are concerned that some sectors may not survive, or they will be much changed. So let me again stress why we are doing this: it is to try and ease capital flows. It is nothing else. We know that there will be a bigger review of MIFID at some time, and I value the points that have been made here, and I hope we can work together on that review and do the best for both investors and those companies who need the investment. In my first appearance here, I think it was good to clear the air on where I stand. I hope you also heard very clearly what I intend to do. But I would ask you – and I think this will be the case: this is a different time for us all. None of us have ever lived or worked through a public health pandemic, which we are not yet clear of – the end, if you like. We hope that in 2021, vaccination will help and that, as some said, we will get back to normal. However, I don’t think we will get back to the past, and there were aspects of our normal past that we should perhaps not go back to. So let us use what we have learned from this crisis, and indeed will continue to learn, to regulate better and effectively, and I promise you that that is my intention as the Commissioner with this responsibility. I wish I didn’t have it on my shoulders, because it will be a heavy responsibility. But if you put your shoulder with mine (socially distanced, of course), I think we can do good things, and I think we will all be proud eventually of the changes that we make.

In our European internal market, we must ensure that consumers are protected from dangerous products, even if they involve new technologies such as artificial intelligence.

We should stick to the risk-based approach, which means that the higher the risk of the product with AI use, the stricter conditions should apply to admission to the internal market. We should also avoid administrative burdens and review the impact of the measures on SMEs. Over the years, the number of dangerous products has increased progressively: 29% of the most frequently reported products were toys, and 50% of all products classified as hazardous last year came from the People's Republic of China. Market surveillance authorities must therefore cooperate even more specifically and across borders with customs authorities and also with online marketplaces. They need to be better equipped to identify unsafe products, even using innovative technologies. The European database for dangerous products, RAPEX, needs to be modernised and made more user-friendly and better known. Recalls must also be made in such a way that they actually reach those who have bought the products, which unfortunately is not the case today. Especially in the Corona era, consumers in some Member States are completely reliant on online purchases. Online marketplaces could make a significant contribution to ensuring that dangerous products are not offered to consumers in the first place, that they are immediately withdrawn from the market and that the buyers of these products are informed. The measures proposed in the report aim to increase the safety of all products, whether they are purchased online or offline, whether or not there are sector-specific rules for these products, and whether they have been purchased by a supplier inside or outside the EU.  We have formulated this objective together, and I would therefore like to express my sincere thanks to the shadow rapporteurs and their teams for their excellent cooperation. Even though the negotiations were not easy and were difficult due to Corona restrictions, we nevertheless managed to reach unanimous agreement on a text in the Committee on the Internal Market. If we stick together as a team in plenary, the Commission will get a strong signal from the European Parliament that we are speaking with one voice when it comes to strengthening product safety and thus consumer protection and the European internal market.

I’m delighted you mentioned Christmas, because a lot of us have fears around Christmas, but it’s nice to look on it as an opportunity, and of course when we’re buying gifts to think of safety. So thank you for your good work on this. It’s both important and timely.  Buying a safe product is the utmost important thing – it protects consumers and also the functioning of the single market, and all products sold on the market should be safe, but you have raised a number of very important issues when it comes to non-food products. Most of these issues correspond with the main objectives of the revision of the General Product Safety Directive, which is planned for the second quarter of next year. And this includes the safety of consumer products, linked, as you said, to new technologies, like connected products or products powered by artificial intelligence and the need to address the growth in online sales. These issues need to be tackled from different angles and we’ll carry out the revision of the General Product Safety Directive in conjunction with other initiatives such as the Digital Services Act, the revision of the Machinery Directive and initiatives on artificial intelligence. The Commission is also working on delegated acts under the Radio Equipment Directive.  In your report, you underline the importance of the recently adopted regulation on market surveillance and compliance. This new regulation is a major step forward for the 70 pieces of harmonised product legislation, many of them on product safety, such as the Low Voltage Directive and the Toy Safety Directive. It will provide better protection for consumers, it will greatly help national inspectors, and the implementation of this regulation is ongoing.  The Commission will also support the EU Product Compliance Network, providing funding from the single market programme, and we thank Parliament for emphasising the importance of market surveillance in this programme.  This report also calls on the Commission to encourage more online marketplaces to join the Product Safety Pledge. Just two weeks ago, two new online marketplaces joined the pledge, which brings the total number of signatories to nine major online actors.  The report also raises issues linked to ineffective recalls of dangerous products from consumers, and I think this is an area of deep concern. Most consumers are not sometimes even aware that they own a recalled product and many others continue to use dangerous products despite seeing a recall notice. I think that is deeply concerning but important to stress.  We are currently working on developing guidance on product recalls and we will also look at this issue during the revision of the General Product Safety Directive. So thank you for this opportunity this evening, for your work and I look forward to tomorrow’s vote.

I am very pleased with this debate today. Indeed, the development of the European product safety system is a demonstration of the essential role that the European Union plays: protecting our fellow citizens, our consumers from the dangers of the modern world. At the same time, all the rules established by the Union are also a demonstration of our capacity for beneficial influence: products that meet European Union standards are also found in third-country markets.  However, the stakes remain high. They may be new as the development of new chemicals, the increasingly important place of digital, software and artificial intelligence. They can be linked to crime as the danger of counterfeit products not meeting the standards. Or they may be linked to the division and increasing diversification of supply chains.

Smart home devices, connected to a single platform and controlled via the Internet, give us the ability to control, e.g. in terms of electricity consumption, and this has a positive impact on ecological sustainability.  On the other hand, putting all information online creates many risks, so let us use modern platforms, save energy, but also protect consumers while maintaining their safety and the competitiveness of businesses. Let us remember that cyberspace is not just the EU, and products and new technologies offered by external countries often do not have sufficient safeguards to protect consumers' rights and data.

Honourable Commissioner, I would like to thank you for your excellent work. I am pleased and congratulate you on your choice.  We believed that the European Union would protect democracy. This is not the case. We believed that our law and the memory of millions of victims of wars would protect us from authoritarianism and nationalism. This is not the case. We believed that democracy was immune to anti-democratic manipulation. This is not the case.  It is rare that strong words about mortal danger are heard, because they are rarely true. Today they are like never before. Today we are witnessing the annulment of democracy. A vote cast out of hatred, on the basis of misinformation or lack of information, even the real one counted, will never be a democratic choice. It is, at most, a formal caricature of it. Today, through lies and hatred, power is gained or maintained in many places around the world, including in the European Union. That is why, here and now, as far as possible, our common voice, the voice of Europeans, the voice of the children of generations dying for freedom, the voice of parents who want peace and prosperity for future generations must sound.  The media is meant to serve the truth, not the lie. The media is intended to serve the select, not the select. The media is meant to control power, not to maintain it. That is why the media must be independent, and when they are attacked and destroyed, we must defend free media. The media is supposed to defend democracy, but the media can also kill democracy. The media can also kill a man. It is their independence that determines which of these roles the media performs. Therefore, anyone who treats the rules of democracy as an obstacle, not a safeguard against abuses of power, every autocrat at all costs the independent media will destroy.  That is why we Europeans must have media independence and pluralism on the banner. There is no freedom without media independence, there is no democracy without media pluralism. Excessive concentration, dependence on state money bought by oligarchy or state corporations is an alarm that media funding is becoming an electoral tool, a tool of crimes against democracy.  Therefore, for independent journalism, especially local and investigative journalism, there must be a permanent place in the multiannual financial framework. I therefore ask for the establishment of a permanent European fund for direct financial support for independent journalists and the media. There must be no shortage of money to defend our democracy when there is a lot of money to destroy it. We must protect independent journalists. They face violence and intimidation, they are murdered here in the European Union. Women journalists are disproportionately more likely to encounter hatred and intimidation. Finally, it is time to put an end to the silence of women's voices. The protection of independent journalists must have a legal dimension, which is why I call on the Commission to present a legislative act that will establish minimum standards throughout the European Union for strategic actions, the so-called SLAPP. To conclude, I will say as clearly as possible: if we do not defend freedom of the media, the European Union and our democracy will collapse. And it doesn't matter which becomes the first. Anyone, regardless of political colour, who is not afraid of the controlling role of the media, anyone who believes in the power of argument and not the power of manipulation, anyone who does not want a return to the dark times of nationalism and authoritarianism, anyone who believes in freedom, I ask you to support my report.

Let me be very clear that media freedom and pluralism are enshrined in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. And I agree that democracy cannot work without a free and independent media. It’s more important than ever that journalists are able to do their job so that citizens have access to accurate information. So I really do appreciate this work and perhaps, as a former journalist, I appreciate the depth of your comments this evening.  The Commission as you know is currently finalising a series of initiatives that will address many of the issues in this report. The safety of journalists is a top priority that we do intend to address. We have already announced an initiative against abusive litigation targeting journalists and rights defenders in our 2021 work programme, and this will be part of the European Democracy Action Plan which the Commission will present on 2 December. As part of the first annual rule of law report, we analysed the framework for the protection of journalists in all Member States, alongside the independence of audio-visual regulatory authorities, transparency of media ownership, the political independence of media, and state advertising in the media sector.  The conclusion is that no Member State is immune from the risks to media freedom and pluralism. This is also clear from the media pluralism monitor co-funded by the EU, with the support of the European Parliament.  We welcome the report’s emphasis on the importance of media pluralism, media freedom and media literacy to fight disinformation. The code of practice on disinformation for online platforms and the advertising sector is a good example of structured cooperation to ensure greater transparency and accountability. It’s also a useful framework to monitor and improve platforms’ policies on disinformation. The European Democracy Action Plan will outline the next steps to upgrade this code.  This report also highlights the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on the media, especially local media, with estimated reduction in revenues of as much as 80%. To help the sector recover and support its digital transformation the Commission will also present a media and audio-visual action plan on 2 December. We will also propose the Digital Service Act by the end of the year. This aims to harmonise a clear set of due-diligence obligations for online platforms, including notice and action procedures and voluntary proactive measures for illegal content such as illegal hate speech, redress mechanisms, accountability measures and obligations to cooperate with public authorities. One of the main objectives of this instrument will be to improve the safety of users online across the European Union, while improving the protection of their fundamental rights.  The Digital Service Act will be adopted along with the Digital Markets Act, which aims to better address market deficiencies resulting from the position of large online platforms. The Commission will continue working with the European Parliament to strengthen media freedom and pluralism, as well as to fight hate speech and disinformation, while protecting fundamental rights. This is essential for our democracy and the rule of law.

On the one hand, real cases of hate speech must be strongly opposed, and on the other hand, it must not be allowed to be a tool for restricting freedom of expression or to paralyse the fundamental power of human judgement.  The question has to be asked: is censorship the only way to have theoretical hate speech? The road is dangerous, because it can be used to close people's mouths simply because they do not think as they should, that they have different views.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we began to write this report on the days when we were overwhelmed by the first pandemic of the modern era. An event that determines, in addition to the dramatic health consequences, a symmetrical shock on supply and demand that has been unprecedented since the Second World War. The effort made during these months has always had as its objective a shared result, aimed at strengthening Parliament's role, even pending the review of the industrial policy strategy announced by the Commission. For this work I would like to thank my fellow shadow rapporteurs. The 700 amendments received have become 17 compromise amendments, balanced and widely supported. Our report divides industrial strategy into two distinct phases: a first phase aimed at the recovery of the production system after the emergency and a second phase that aims to build an industrial system that is socially, economically and environmentally resilient. At its heart is the need to promote and accelerate the dual digital and environmental transition. The goal of climate neutrality in 2050 remains our compass. The report also takes account of the external dimension of industrial policy. In a world that has become less open and harsher, the European Union, while remaining committed to free and balanced trade, both bilaterally and multilaterally, must make more assertive use of trade defence instruments, activate measures that push towards reciprocity in public procurement and monitor the acquisition of strategic companies by State-owned enterprises and companies linked to foreign governments. The report is based on a number of key points. I will mention a few of them. Firstly, a strong focus on social aspects, in particular training, in order to avoid job losses and safeguard territorial cohesion in the spirit of the 'No one left behind' principle. We know from experience over the last thirty years that transformations, if not properly managed, lead to deep rifts between winners and losers. Among the latter, young people and women are the most affected groups. Secondly, a balanced review of the rules on competition and state aid in order to protect our strategic autonomy and global competitiveness and to enable support for investment in the environment and digitalisation, preserving and completing the single market. Thirdly, ad hoc measures to enable SMEs to participate on an equal footing with large companies in the dual transition, measures that must be easy and immediate to use, such as tax credits to encourage investment and training co-financed by European funds. Fourthly, proposals for an EU Next Generation that is a real driving force for investment by encouraging EIB guarantees and capital increases. Fifthly, proposals to provide companies with the appropriate tools to make an effective contribution to reducing CO2 emissions in line with climate law. In this respect, we must at all costs prevent environmental processing that is not adequately supported financially and protected from environmental dumping, including through the imposition of a Carbon Border Tax, from causing relocations to countries with less stringent emission standards, with a consequent increase in pollution and job losses here. The Commission's analysis of ecosystems will be key to selecting interventions and priorities. In the report we have also called for a system of Key Performance Indicators and impact analyses, which will help to verify ex ante and ex post the effectiveness of the measures taken and the instruments put in place.

Europe has always been the home of industry and, throughout history, industry has proven its ability to lead change. To prepare for the future, Europe needs industry that is greener, more digital and more resilient, while remaining competitive on the global stage. EU institutions, Member States and regions have to work alongside industry to make this happen. We must do more than just adapt. We want to accelerate and enable change and innovation. This is why we must move forward on our agenda, as announced in the new industrial strategy. Important initiatives have been delivered, such as the Action Plan on Critical Raw Materials, and many are still to come. A deeper and more digital single market; a global level playing field and open markets; working towards climate neutrality and a more circular economy; fostering employment and innovation, skills and investments: all these will be essential to achieve our goals. The COVID—19 crisis has increased the momentum to use the recovery as an opportunity to accelerate our joint efforts. We will update the industrial strategy next year to take account of the lessons learned from the pandemic and to ensure that it continues to be fit for purpose to lead the green and digital transformations. To achieve this, we will have to work together. In updating our industrial strategy, we plan to work closer than ever with the Member States, as well as with industry and other stakeholders: for example, in the context of industrial ecosystems, alliances and the Industry Forum. Europe has an excellent industrial foundation. We have the benefit of diverse and competitive companies of all sizes, including SMEs and social economy enterprises, and a huge range of different industries, not only a few giants. That’s why the focus of the new industrial strategy is on industrial ecosystems, incorporating all players operating in a value chain: not just a few big companies, but value chains in which companies of all sizes can participate. Such an approach has already shown its benefits in the field of batteries. In July, the Commission launched the European Clean Hydrogen Alliance and the new European Raw Materials Alliance in September. A European alliance on industrial data and cloud is also on the way. Soon we will launch a new industrial forum, which will bring together companies of all sizes with researchers and unions and national governments. Our new industrial strategy is part of a package of initiatives to make Europe’s businesses future ready. There will also be a dedicated strategy for SMEs and concrete steps to address barriers in the way of a well-functioning single market. This single market is Europe’s strongest asset to allow all of our businesses to grow and compete in Europe and beyond. The openness of Europe’s economy is a source of prosperity and competitiveness. We need a European industrial policy based on competition, open markets, world—leading research and technologies, and a strong single market, which removes barriers and cuts red tape. But we must resist the simplistic temptations that come with protectionism or market distortions, while not being naive in the face of unfair competition, to ensure a level playing field beyond the single market. Reciprocity in public procurement is a key part of the industrial policy toolbox. We’re also working on legislative proposals to tackle the distortive effects of foreign subsidies on the single market. The COVID—19 crisis has highlighted that dependency on a single supplier for some specific critical goods could limit Europe’s ability to respond to future shocks. Europe needs to build up resilience and strengthen the open strategic autonomy of the EU economy in the long run, while remaining open to the world. This requires an evidence-based approach, where we first identify any vulnerabilities and then explore how to address them, notably by contributing to the diversification of our supply chains. The Commission supports the agreement found in the trilogue between the Council and Parliament on Europe’s next long—term budget and Next Generation EU, Europe’s new recovery instrument. Now it is important to move forward. The strength of our Union has always been that we overcome difficult situations by engaging with each other. So we are working hard to implement the final step on the MFF, while ensuring respect for the rule of law. This new powerful and modern long-term budget for the Union will allow us to turn the immediate challenges posed by the COVID—19 pandemic into long-term opportunities by not only supporting the recovery, but also by investing in our future. To make that future sustainable, inclusive and fair for all, we need to spend the money from the recovery instrument in a way that crowds in private investment and does not undermine the ability of our industries to compete by harming competition or weakening the single market.

That’s the harsh but undeniable conclusion of my report. Instead of working more closely together to find a solution, the world’s superpowers have abused the pandemic to compete and to try to shape the world order to their own advantage.  So we urge Europe to strengthen its foreign policy presence in order to be able to defend its interests in the new geopolitical era – because it is a new political era. The COVID-19 pandemic has been a game changer. It has changed the relationship between the world’s biggest players. Look at the United States. Under the failed leadership of Trump, the United States opted to stand alone. There was no cooperation. Even worse, they sometimes denied the severity of the pandemic by spreading misleading information and undermined global institutions to deal with it. China actually did the same. The lack of transparency on the outbreak of the virus and attempts to withhold information about its magnitude made at the start of the battle against the virus was ineffective. Since then, the ‘virus diplomacy’ as I call it is seeking to fill the global political vacuum, and in the light of such disturbing trends, our response has been slow and disjointed.  We need to reduce our dependency on third countries in strategic sectors. We need better communication strategies and strong resilience in order to counter this information. That is what we need to do to play a bigger role in the world. My report is very clear. We need to get our own house in order first. We need to reclaim our place on the world stage to make sure our children will continue to live in a world of cooperation, democracy and the rule of law. We can no longer count on others for solutions. We need to be able to count on Europe by making it more decisive, more dynamic, and more resilient internationally.  Let us work together to finally get rid of the unanimity rule in foreign affairs, to be able to push back against the strongmen surrounding us, to build a real European defence union as the European pillar within NATO, to re-engage with the United States, to develop a new strategy towards China, and to urge them to fully cooperate with an independent international investigation into the origin of the virus.

In this report, Ms Vautmans, you say COVID-19 is a game changer, and it is, and one that we were not prepared for, but it very much is a game changer. And you speak of a new political era, so let me just outline what the Commission is doing in this regard.  Firstly, we’re working on a joint communication on multilateralism that will reaffirm our commitment and propose a strategic approach, underlining the EU interest in promoting multilateral solutions. Respect for human rights, democracy and the rule of law will remain at the very heart of our response to this pandemic. The new action plan on human rights and democracy seeks to reduce inequalities by combating poverty and social exclusion and by promoting non-discriminatory access to social services, including quality and affordable health services. Our global EU response to the pandemic, that brought together Team Europe, has now reached EUR 38.5 billion. We have sent a strong message of EU unity in times of crisis, as well as international solidarity and global leadership. The Western Balkans and eastern neighbourhood have remained our close partners throughout the pandemic. In your report, you call for united EU efforts to invest in the region. The economic and investment plan presented in October is a clear step in that direction. We are continuing the discussion on a reinforced EU partnership with southern neighbourhood countries. We will jointly identify concrete areas of cooperation with a focus on supporting resilience through reforms that directly impact the quality of life of citizens. COVID-19 is likely to impact conflict areas such as the Sahel or the Horn of Africa and least-developed countries disproportionately, we know this, increasing their vulnerability and the vulnerability of their citizens. We are stepping up the political dialogue with African partners ahead of the next EU-Africa summit. In the wake of the US presidential election on 3 November, the EU wants to enhance cooperation with the new US administration, not only to tackle COVID-19, but also to maintain and reform the rules-based order and crucial commitments, such as the Paris Agreement.  It is important to continue calling on China to participate in the review of lessons learned from the international health response and to address the consequences of the pandemic in developing countries, notably as regards debt relief.

Instead, the content of the report is exhausted in criticizing the actions of some countries, including the United States, in relation to the epidemic. The report takes a position on issues not related to the pan-epidemic, in many cases on ideological grounds, such as migration routes. It is unacceptable that, under the pretext of the epidemic, the report calls for a transition to qualified majority voting in the field of EU foreign policy. This not only oversets its powers, but also ignores the strong opposition of many Member States and MEPs on this issue, since it is not possible to take away the right and opportunity of smaller Member States to represent their own interests in European foreign policy-making. This would further divide The Member States at a time of critical pandemic where, to the contrary, cooperation and greater consistency are needed.

Today, COVID-19 concerns key aspects of the EU's foreign and security and defence policy, but it is also a turning point on the international stage, a multiplier of risks and a catalyst for change in the world order. Unfortunately, the lack of global leadership and a coordinated international response in the early stages of the crisis were a fundamental prerequisite for the rapid spread of the virus, which in turn provoked isolationist solutions, the rise of authoritarian nationalism and the sponsorship of state disinformation campaigns.  I therefore believe that the EU needs to work to revive the transatlantic partnership sooner to make fighting pandemics and other major international challenges, such as climate change, more effective.

This report I see as a wake-up call to put effectiveness again at the centre of development cooperation. The European Union is the biggest donor in the world and we have to take the lead now in making better use of aid. We owe this not only to the aid recipients but also to Europe’s taxpayers. And now, let us be clear: development aid can never be 100% effective and efficient, but we need to check that our aid provides pathways for communities and countries to become less and less dependent on aid. The long-term objective of our Union’s aid policy must be that the recipient countries of today will no longer need our aid tomorrow. But the needs today are high. The current COVID-19 pandemic is undoing years of progress, and we can see also at the same time that populations in developing countries are growing faster than gross national income and the job markets do. Hunger is on the rise and conflicts are increasing during the last years, and therefore we need to challenge the practices of the past and try also to adjust. This report makes clear and practical recommendations to the Commission and to the Member States. We want Team Europe to become an everyday reality of our work with developing countries. For this, we want to see a drastic increase in joint programming and joint implementation so that it covers all partner countries in the developing world. We also need clear rules and guidelines on how to make aid coordination among EU countries and the Commission a reality, and I will commit, therefore, to ask the Commission to bring forward proposals in this regard. Furthermore, we ask the Commission to publish, bi-annually, a development and effectiveness progress report covering planning, programming, implementation and results by EU institutions, EU Member States, as well as European local and regional authorities. I believe that local governments in the developing world tend to be more accountable and more in tune with the real problems and the real solutions. We want the European Commission also to start a real reflection on this and turn it into action, including when it comes to budget support. To conclude: the EU needs to remain the champion and the leader when it comes to upholding and applying the principles of aid-effectiveness to secure a real impact and to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. Commissioner McGuinness, we were together at the United Nations’ SDG and Climate Summit last year. We both heard their appreciation for our commitment, but also how everybody asked Europe to take the lead. I look forward now to turning the message from this report into actions, together with you and all the other relevant actors. So let me finish by saying: by being more effective we will achieve more. This report is a first step in that direction.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 1, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 125, "date": "2020-11-23.json", "name": "Mairead McGUINNESS", "mepid": "28115", "text": "  Member of the Commission. – Madam President, I would first like to thank Mr Tobé, Chair of the Committee on Development (DEVE), very much for his excellent work in this area. Mr Tobé, I would also like to thank you for your great personal commitment as Chair of the Committee on Development.  You mentioned the Sustainable Development Goals - and we only have a decade to deliver on them - and facing a resource gap that will grow with the impact of the Covid—19 pandemic. So we need to be more determined than ever to ensure that development is effective, and that we have development effectiveness. This is about delivering more and delivering better.  The Commission is, and has been, a leader on development effectiveness. The Team Europe approach is a clear demonstration of how the European Union and Member States could act as one in partner countries and ensure that European cooperation is delivered consistently and coherently, with a greater impact and in line with our fundamental principles.  That is why we actively promote and pursue joint programming and joint implementation and will do so increasingly, as suggested in your report, notably by identifying Team Europe initiatives. The proposed Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument will strengthen our ability to provide coherent and policy—driven cooperation. It streamlines a number of existing external financing instruments into one broad instrument. This simplification reduces the gaps or overlaps between instruments, while at the same time facilitating EU engagement with partners in a more comprehensive way. We also need to influence the behaviour of development partners beyond the EU - donors, international organisations and partner countries - and build partnerships on this issue. Team Europe will be important here as well. By speaking with a single European voice in international fora and in the governance structures of the UN, international financial institutions and other bodies, we will become more influential in promoting effectiveness among multilateralals.  Finally, the Commission remains determined to improve the transparency and accountability of our external action. Commissioner Urpilainen has been very clear about this commitment from the very start of this new Commission. Having clear and agreed targets on which to report is crucial if we wish to contribute to a better world. It is also essential for continued public support for our endeavours. The role of the European Parliament in this process is crucial.  Madam President, dear Tomas, thank you again for the recommendations of this report. I know that the Parliament will work with the Commission to improve effectiveness in the area of development. This is key.

In the economic crisis caused by the coronavirus, it is even more important that we can use the resources available directly in the most efficient way possible. It is a sinful omission that, while people in need are waiting in vain for the Union's help in their homeland, the European Commission has still not allowed local churches and religiously based organisations to participate in EU development and humanitarian aid in the spirit of extreme impartiality. This omission is also highlighted in the report initiated by the People's Party, which calls on the Commission to take account of reliable ecclesiastical organisations and to involve them in the implementation of EU development projects.
