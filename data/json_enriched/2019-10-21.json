After unsuccessful attempts to obtain financial support from his government, the mayor of Bihaé announced at the weekend that the supply of food and water supply in the refugee camp would be stopped – as well as medical care. In plain language, this means that, as of today, there will be no more supply for 2 000 to 2 500 people who are already living in the dump there. Biha' has already addressed the EU and has not been heard. I would like to say that the difficult situation in Vujak has been known for about a year.

Tourism is an important economic activity for the European Union. It contributes – directly and indirectly – 10% of EU GDP and employs more than 25 million people. This equals 11% of total EU employment. For some European regions, tourism is even the main economic activity. The tourism sector is also much interlinked with other economic activities. One euro of value added in tourism results in 56 cents’ value added upstream, and in this sector there are not only big players: out of the 2.2 million enterprises active in tourism, 90% are small or medium-sized enterprises. The combination of these factors makes the tourism industry not only complex, but also tightly connected with, and affecting, other areas of the economy. The unfortunate insolvency of Thomas Cook exemplifies this well: it shows once more that tourism and the travel industry require an integrated approach across different European policies. We are in contact with the Member States to assess the impacts in terms of the numbers of businesses, jobs and travellers affected in their constituency, and to share information about the European support available to help address such impacts. European instruments are available under different policy areas and may be mobilised to support Member States.  First, we can help avoid negative impacts on the people affected by job losses. The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) is a strong demonstration of European solidarity: it provides assistance to dismissed workers to help them find new employment, on top of what public employment services offer. The EGF may be triggered by Member States under certain conditions and the Commission stands ready to help the Member States concerned. Furthermore, the European Social Fund may support actions to help dismissed workers for retraining, reskilling and job counselling.  Second, other cohesion policy instruments may help affected regions. The European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) in particular can be instrumental in helping regions that face problems of industrial transition, digitalisation, globalisation, decarbonisation natural disasters or regions that need to diversify – for instance, by avoiding too strong a dependence on the tourism sector. The ERDF support is available via the relevant national and regional managing authorities, in line with the respective operational programmes.  Third, European state—aid rules give Member States flexibility to support companies facing acute liquidity shortages due to unforeseen circumstances. In particular, Member States can create schemes supporting SMEs which face financial difficulties. Any scheme has, of course, to be notified to the Commission and be approved. Fourth, on the question of travellers’ rights, the Directive on package travel obliges organisers such as tour operators to have insolvency protection to ensure the repatriation of travellers to their place of departure and the reimbursement of the travel services not yet performed, free of charge for the affected travellers. Repatriation worked well for all the Thomas Cook travellers.  The Commission is currently evaluating how Member States transposed the Directive on package travel, and its focus is in particular on the effectiveness of the insolvency protection schemes. We will report to the Council and to the European Parliament, of course, by January 2021. Let me also recall our proposed revision of the Passengers’ Rights Regulation – EU Regulation 261/2004. With that revision, we aim at improving the effectiveness and consistent enforcement of passengers’ rights, while better taking into account the financial capacities of the air carriers. This proposal, which is still in the interinstitutional procedure, does not provide for any specific rules in the case of airline insolvencies. With its 2013 Communication on passenger protection in the event of airline insolvency, the Commission proposed a number of soft measures.  It is worth pointing out some tools in place to mitigate the negative impacts of insolvencies on passengers, such as an industry commitment to provide rescue fares to passengers, which was indeed triggered on several occasions. Furthermore, national authorities have, in some cases, been actively engaging in ensuring the repatriation of stranded passengers. However, the Commission is aware of the difficulties passengers may still face in asserting their rights ahead of, or during, insolvency proceedings.  In the light of the recent experiences and mechanisms in place, the Commission is currently examining options and a possible follow-up of the 2013 Commission communication on passengers’ protection in the event of airline insolvency.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 42, "date": "2019-10-21.json", "name": "Rosa ESTARÀS FERRAGUT", "mepid": "96811", "text": "  PPE Group. – Madam President, today we have brought to this House, at the initiative of the People's Group, the debate for the House to reflect on the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook, a company that has overcome two world wars, 178 years of history, but has not overcome the adaptation to digitisation, the uncertainties of Brexit and the future of that new world of the 21st century. We have to reflect, because in the end it was a company with 105 aircraft, more than two hundred hotels and more than five hundred agencies located almost all in the UK; 22,000 employees. My region, the Balearic Islands, is one of the regions – with the Canary Islands, Andalusia and Catalonia – most affected by this bankruptcy, not only by the loss of jobs, but also by the number of people, tourists, who stayed in those days on the islands themselves. I would also like to tell you that this bankruptcy brings problems not only in hotels: in the tertiary sector, in the transport sector and throughout the economy in general. It is therefore necessary to ask this Commission, this Parliament to have a serious and in-depth debate and reflection on tourism; a strategy — as the sector asks for — on tourism, truly a European strategy, which helps to be able to take on the challenges of digitisation, which change at the speed of light; we need to make a tourism strategy in a sector that accounts for more than 4% of the European Union's GDP. We also need to reflect on how to prepare the European economy to cushion the decline of large companies and their possible subsequent effects, which are many and diverse. Also on consumer rights. More prevention has been needed in this crisis, but more coordination has also been needed. In the Member States there have been lights and shadows in the management of this bankruptcy; there has been uncoordination, particularly in my autonomous community, the Balearic Islands. But above all, we need to reflect on the protection of certain agents and property when a bankruptcy occurs.

Madam President! I would also like to express my solidarity with the affected employees of Thomas Cook and the many passengers who experienced negative consequences in connection with the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook in September. Thomas Cook has for decades been a huge company that has brought a great many travellers across Europe and the world, but is no longer there.  But the bankruptcy also shows us that we are simply not in place in Europe with the rules needed to protect consumers and workers. And we know that there are many companies – both travel companies and airlines – that are going bankrupt on an ongoing basis. Since 2017, 32 airlines have gone bankrupt with our touches here in Europe. We simply do not have good enough legislation in place. And then it's fine, we have funds and everything that can help, it's obviously better than nothing. However, we Socialists want us to tighten up and improve our legislation in this area. We believe that a comprehensive and comprehensive approach is needed for our airlines, our travel companies in Europe. Travelling in Europe must be safe and it must be safe to work in Europe. And it has turned out that this has not been the case for the many who have worked at Thomas Cook and who have used the travel company. That is why we believe that more needs to be done.  On the one hand, our passenger rights for air travellers must be better – the Commissioner mentioned that too, and it is a pity that we have not made any progress on this.  The European Parliament has dealt with the matter and we have our proposal for it. Now we need to get the Council up and running. But we also believe that more is needed than that.  We also need to be able to look at whether we should not go in and help at European level when there are bankruptcies in companies that are so large and affect so many people.

I want to be the voice of all those employees who, at night, at night hours—at two in the morning—saw their jobs lose.

For some hedge fund managers and financial speculators, this was just another business opportunity. Two companies in particular scooped up over GBP 200 million as Thomas Cook went under. These vulture capitalists make rich pickings by investing in financial products that pay out when a company defaults on its debts, as was the case with Thomas Cook. But aside from this perversity of capitalism, we should also consider how Thomas Cook arrived at this destination. The company cited heatwaves and uncertainty over Brexit among the factors in its collapse. So the two biggest issues of our time, the climate emergency and Brexit, played a part. It’s low-cost flights that are fuelling the heating of our planet, which in turn is making popular destinations in Europe unbearable at peak holiday times. Now, tackling climate change will involve new patterns of travel and different types of holiday: overland travel and more stay-cations will have to replace the existing model. And lamenting the loss of jobs in the old system must go hand-in-hand with a properly funded transition to a more secure future.

There is no single mechanism to support local communities and jobs and there is no mechanism to strengthen the image of European tourism that is repeatedly hit, with negative consequences for all.  Europe is a single leading tourist destination and tourism is the fourth largest import sector with a EUR 27 billion surplus. Who will support him, if not the European Union itself? We do not have the means to deal effectively with crises that affect tourism activity in Europe horizontally. We have only one directive on the repatriation of tourists who have purchased travel packages and individual movements of Member States, on the basis of the national interest and without coordination. I want to be clear; the collapse of Thomas Cook is not the only challenge to the sustainability of tourism.  We are faced with the climate crisis and increasing extreme weather events and also with the critical issue of security on issues dominated by the need to respect human rights, such as refugees.

Productivity growth has been declining for years and has now become virtually zero. This has very important consequences in terms of job growth, economic growth and public finances. More and more research shows that there is a link between lower interest rates and the fall in productivity; keeping companies alive that accumulate debt and get into immediate trouble with a slightly higher interest rate.

The recent tragic events in Halle, Germany, have further underlined the very real and growing threat posed by right—wing violent extremism and, in this particular case, anti-Semitism, a threat already highlighted by the horrible slaughter of innocent people earlier this year in Christchurch. After both those events, I know that all our thoughts were with the families and friends of those involved. It’s vital that we fully recognise this threat and work together at EU level, as well as in each of our Member States, stepping up our efforts urgently to address this particular challenge. Let’s be clear: violent extremism is violent extremism, whatever hate—filled ideology fuels it. It has no place in our societies: not jihadism, nor far—right nor far—left violent extremism. Racism, anti-Semitism, xenophobia and extreme nationalism are fundamentally anti-democratic and un-European. Jo Cox, a Member of Parliament in the United Kingdom, was not murdered by a British patriot. Her life was taken by a far—right violent extremist thug. Our European countries belong to all of us, not to those who would use their supposed patriotism as an excuse for committing cold—blooded murder. The Commission welcomes the initiative that the Presidency has taken to focus on this area, and indeed this was reflected in a discussion in the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 8 October, which endorsed a set of suggestions from the Presidency. The Commission stands ready to support all the Member States and the Presidency and, obviously, to work with this House in any way possible. While our work on countering violent extremism and terrorism at EU level covers all forms of extremism, it’s fair to say that the primary focus in recent years has been on jihadi terrorism. This needs to remain a priority, given the nature of the threat, but the Commission is also increasingly focusing on, and working to tackle, violent right-wing extremism, especially through the Radicalisation Awareness Network (RAN) that is working with police officers, prison and probation staff, local government officials, teachers and others on the front line of tackling this particular challenge. And building on this work, we think there are a number of areas where we can go further – where we need to go further. First, we agree with all those who argue that we need to do more to counter violent, right—wing extremist content online. Three years ago, we signed with the platforms an EU Code of Conduct on countering illegal hate speech online. When the code was signed in 2016, 28% of such content was being removed. I’m glad to say we’re now at 72% of content. But, while the Code of Conduct has proved a very useful tool, the fight against illegal hate speech online is far from over. Unfortunately, there are no signs that the generation and circulation of such content has decreased. The Commission and the social media platforms will continue to build our cooperation within the EU Internet Forum. Indeed, a couple of weeks ago, the Internet Forum met, and this item – countering violent right—wing extremism –was at the top of the agenda. This cooperation in the Internet Forum has produced some concrete results, something that was highlighted by the companies’ rapid response to the Halle attack. The platforms were able to remove virtually all of the 200 different variants of the video and the extremist so—called manifesto – including the soundtrack used to glorify the attack – within a couple of hours. So I very much welcome the good cooperation with the companies involved in the Internet Forum. In addition, it’s important to ensure that Europol’s Internet Referral Unit has sufficient resources and capacity to monitor and refer right—wing violent extremist content, and I know that this House will support that. Europol, in fact, is now working with more than 350 different social media platforms, but there are still platforms today which refuse to cooperate in our efforts to take down illegal terrorist content online, including violent right—wing extremist content. For me, that’s one of the reasons why it’s crucial that together, as co-legislators, we advance swiftly in the negotiations on the proposal for a regulation countering terrorist content online. We need to get this done. We need to crack down on this poison and help save some lives. Let’s put in place clear and effective measures to prevent the dissemination of illegal terrorist content, including live streaming directly linked to attacks, while at the same time ensuring that we retain full respect for fundamental rights and freedom of speech. Second, the Commission stands ready to provide further support to Member States in their efforts to tackle this particular challenge. The threat posed by violent right—wing extremism has featured prominently in the discussions on the 2020 strategic orientations for a coordinated EU approach to the prevention of radicalisation. Among other things, this includes helping local and national governments to develop their action plans to prevent right—wing violent extremism, including through exit and de-radicalisation programmes. The Commission will also continue to support local authorities and cities in their efforts to tackle radicalisation. As a follow-up to the Cities Against Radicalisation conference, which we organised together with the European Committee of the Regions earlier this year, the Commission is supporting a pilot group of interested cities in building a network focused on countering radicalisation in our communities. Third – and this has also been stressed by Member States in the Council – it’s important to support our neighbours in their efforts to tackle violent extremism, particularly our partners in the Western Balkans. The Joint Action Plan on Counter-Terrorism for the Western Balkans, signed a year ago, covers counter—terrorism policy as well as prevention of all forms of radicalisation and violent extremism. To implement the Joint Action Plan, the Commission is putting in place a set of tailor—made arrangements with each of the Western Balkan partner countries, including actions for effective prevention and countering of all forms of violent extremism. We will continue to push forward our work in all of these areas, in close cooperation with our partners, including, of course, our partners here in this House.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 98, "date": "2019-10-21.json", "name": "Karoline EDTSTADLER", "mepid": "197643", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to thank the commissioner for her work and for the work she has During the Austrian Presidency, it was possible to adopt a Council declaration on the fight against anti-Semitism, in which all member states committed themselves to developing a security concept for Jewish institutions and communities throughout Europe. A study by the Fundamental Rights Agency, published in December, showed just how urgent this is. Nearly 16,400 Jews from 12 Member States took part in the study, or about 96% of the Jewish population in the European Union. Conclusion: Jews feel increasingly insecure in Europe. Well, what has happened since then? Apparently too little, because otherwise it would not have been possible for a synagogue to be completely unguarded on the most important holiday of Judaism, at Yom Kippur, and that a heavily armed assassin could fight his way forward. Two people were killed, and only miraculously prevented an even greater massacre. The event in the middle of Germany will forever burn deep into the collective memory not only of the Jewish communities. It is therefore high time to remind the Member States that it is not enough to adopt declarations. Concrete action must now finally follow. The cooperation with the police, which has been lived in Austria for decades and works well, can become a model and a best practice model here. A drama like the one in Halle must not be repeated.

Jews are living in growing insecurity.  Even in my care region in Dortmund, people of Jewish faith are still confronted with anti-Semitic clichés. The local newspaper reported on student Dennis Khavkin, who is Jewish. Last year, for example, a parishioner was attacked in Dortmund simply because he was wearing the kippah. The student also avoids certain districts. He experienced everyday anti-Semitism, for example, at his university. He wrote an accounting statement, and a student addressed him: \"You certainly do this, you are a Jew.\" Journalist Hazel Rosenstrauch wrote in Friday's weekend newspaper that she was considering whether it was advisable to publish an article under her name that deals with the question of how many sympathizers the right-wing extremist terrorist of Halle has within the constitutional protection and the police. The fact that the police in Halle did not guarantee the protection of the synagogue on Yom Kippur Day is a failure that has structural and systemic causes. The terrorist is not an individual perpetrator, and the intellectual arsonists unfortunately also sit here in Parliament, as for example from the AfD. The terrorist attack also shows that it is not only about Jews, but that it can affect us all.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. The images of Halle and other attacks in Europe are stunned. But it is not enough to mourn the victims. We must also be stunned that anti-Semitism has been gaining space in Europe for years – unnoticed, often underestimated, partly disguised as a peaceful protest, for example, by the anti-Israel anti-Semitic BDS movement. \"Jew,\" \"Yahudi\" as a swear word and exclusion on our streets and in schoolyards, as well as crude conspiracy theories, show that anti-Semitism is common in everyday life. According to Eurobarometer, one in two EU citizens considers anti-Semitism to be a problem in their country. Yes, no protection from this synagogue in Halle an Yom Kippur is a question, but why are synagogues more at risk than mosques and churches? Why do we have to station police there? What shortcomings can be identified in our societies that make it possible for anti-Semitism to arise in the first place? How do young people grow up, what is taught in schools? Are we really forgotten about history? And that after the catastrophe of the Second World War? How do we deal with anti-Semitic stereotypes? How do we respond to anti-Semitic incidents? Does it really leave us indifferent that Jewish fellow citizens no longer feel safe that Jewish families are leaving Europe? That is not what we must, ladies and gentlemen. In schools, Shoah and contemporary Jewish life must be addressed in equal measure. We need tailor-made education, we need prevention. Young people must learn to deal with digital violence as early as possible; Exchange with Jewish institutions, Israeli-European youth works, active town twinning stake are all in the focus. Only the recognition that anti-Semitism threatens us all – us all – will enable us to protect Europe's community of values. We must therefore take action against anti-Semitism. Whatever its origin – whether from the right, from the left or for pseudo-religious reasons – anti-Semitism affects us all, our democracy, regardless of ideology from which it descends.

In our minds are still the terrible images of the bloodshed of Halle. A far-right assassin has ripped two people off and two injured. The incomprehensible has happened: a man murders out of hatred for others – Jews, migrants – in the middle of Europe.  Let us make it quite clear that this attack was anti-Semitic and racist. It was directed against our open society and against our European values. And it is obvious that the perpetrator is not alone with his hatred. The chemnitz hate hunts, speeches about the great exchange of populations, fascist quotes from Salvini, Le Pen's anti-immigration hate tirades, burning refugee homes, Jews beaten up when they wear a kippah, the murder of Walter Lübcke, and now Halle – all of this is connected.  For years, the right-wing forces have been working together – including here in this Parliament – to create a mood against minorities, and this is the breeding ground for hatred, which leads to a social climate in which right-wing perpetrators of violence no longer have to be afraid. Here in Parliament, too, right-wing forces are putting the lighter ever closer to the petrol canister. They are the political arm of right-wing terrorism.  I cannot repeat it often enough: we must take decisive, much more decisive action than before, against all forms of anti-Semitism and racism. Education, education and criminal prosecution; and then thank you to the Commission for setting a new priority here, that much more attention should now be paid to right-wing terrorism than before.  What happened in Halle is a highly European matter, because rights were interconnected across Europe. We definitely need better European cooperation between our investigative authorities and intelligence services, but above all a very different political focus on the fact that right-wing terrorism is linked to Europe and the world.

The loss of two lives is to be mourned, and it would have been much more if he had succeeded in storming the synagogue in Halle. The perpetrator is a murderer consumed by anti-Semitic delusion. It stands for the opposite of what we all stand for. It is completely indisputable that right-wing extremism is dangerous and must be combated by all means of the rule of law. Anywhere, anytime. But we also say that the state must not tolerate any form of extremism. No right, left, Islamist, no extremism. But our states are failing here.

Only a robust synagogue door prevented a massacre, as we had to experience painfully in Christchurch. No interior minister and no security forces. If those who have failed here accuse my party – as is happening here again – the most evil incitement, distracting from one's own failure, is and it cannot be outdone in shame. And one more thing has to be said loud and clear: anti-Semitism directed against Jews and against Israel today comes predominantly from the left. It has always been part of the DNA of the left. Because it is you – the left and the Greens – who are not bothered by Germany's anti-Israeli voting behaviour at the UN. That doesn't bother you at all. It is they who have rejected our request for a ban on Hezbollah. They are the ones who cling to EU payments to the UN Palestinian Relief and Works Agency, thus financing Hamas, a terrorist organisation. And you tell us something about anti-Semitism? Let one thing be said: if we govern one day, we will give consistent protection to Jewish fellow citizens. protection that you have not granted them.

Anything less bad than Auschwitz could walk down for decades, so to speak. This \"respect the beginnings\", the \"Never again\" has long since become a phrase. This was recently written by the journalist Richard Schneider in the weekly newspaper Die Zeit, and this sentence should apply throughout Europe. After the crimes of Halle, the thesis of a confused individual perpetrator was once again in the room, and the ECR has just spoken again of a tragic incident. I ask you: after the attacks on synagogues in the 1990s, after Breivik, after the attacks in Paris and Brussels, after the NSU trials in Germany, how can we still be fascinated by confused individual perpetrators? Today there was again an arson attack on a mosque in Dortmund. When politicians talk about sudden alarm signs after the actions in Halle, they seem to have slept for decades. Unfortunately, anti-Semitism and racism have never disappeared from the centre of society. In reality, we are facing a decades-long policy failure in which even anti-fascists are being vilified. The best example is Mr Meuthen. From education to politics, blindness on the right eye is unmistakable. Not only since today, but since the day before yesterday. Right-wing extremism and anti-Semitism have many causes, and this starts with the brutalization of language and the disrespectful treatment of one another. Unfortunately, we have been seeing this in this House for years, just with Mr Meuthen. Violence in language becomes violence in the street, hatred and hatred are destroying our democracies.

Also, if we look at various websites and various media that are not open to question, in my own country at least, in Greece, in 2018 there were 574 attacks on Christian temples, for which nothing was heard.

First of all, thank you for the debate today on extremism and the growing anti-Semitism in Europe. Less than two weeks ago, there was this terrible, horrific armed attack on a synagogue in Halle, in which, as you know, two people were murdered. This horrific attack shows once again that we must do everything we can to protect Jewish life in Germany, and not only in Germany, but also in other European Member States.  Anti-Semitism is spreading again in many European countries. Gravestones in Jewish cemeteries are smeared with swastikas, neo-Nazis march through one city or another, show Hitler salutes and chanting anti-Semitic slogans. And that's just a small part of what we experience every day. At the beginning of the year, we had Charlotte Knobloch with us in the plenary session in Brussels on the occasion of the International Holocaust Remembrance Day. She confirmed that anti-Semitism is returning not only in Germany, but throughout Europe, and that jewish citizens no longer feel safe, thinking about emigration. We cannot accept that hatred of Jews is once again becoming the norm in Europe. If Jewish fellow citizens no longer feel safe, then we have failed. We must launch a new European initiative against anti-Semitism and right-wing extremism. Firstly, the Internet is not a lawless area: anyone who rails against minorities there should also have to bear the consequences. Secondly, we must educate our young people, our young people, and thirdly, and I would like to stress this too, we must nominate the parties and their representatives who incite hatred and exclusion and thus provide the spiritual breeding ground for anti-Semitism.

Right-wing extremism is on the rise in many countries of the Union. The growing violence and terrorism of the white supremacist movements is a consequence of the normalisation of far-right parties and their views. In this House too, we have parties and people with dark opinions, and as Mrs Michels said, verbal violence leads to physical violence.  The terrorist attack on the Synagogue in Halle was a heinous attack on our entire democracy. Violence and terrorism by right-wing extremism are not a new phenomenon in the history of Europe. We saw it in 1980 at the station in Bologna. We saw it at Utöya in 2011 and we saw it in New Zealand in 2019. We also saw a Europe in ruins when they gained political power during the Second World War. In several Member States today, including the UNITED Kingdom, far-right terrorism by the security police has been identified as the greatest growing threat. Europol also notes in its trend report that the number of arrests linked to far-right groups has increased for the third year in a row. Although far-right groups look different in different Member States, their targets are the same: religious and ethnic minorities, LGBTQ people, women, refugees and those perceived as political opponents. Europe must take the lead in the fight against growing nationalism and racism. Hate crimes are defined differently in the Member States, and there is a large gap between the number of offences convicted and the number of reports.

Some – as the CDU now does in Germany – want to ban computer games, others want to pull up border bars again and others simply want to collect even more data and restrict civil rights. None of this would have prevented the attack in Halle. Police presence would have actually prevented the attack, and that is why our Member States must finally make the resources and staff available and also improve police cooperation. But every anti-Semitic attack in Europe is indeed a state failure, and I am particularly ashamed, as a German, that Jews in Germany and Europe must feel insecure again. But what Mr Meuthen has just said, that the rise in this anti-Semitism is mainly due to immigration, migration, is simply factually wrong. The figures from the Federal Criminal Police Office show otherwise. Overall, anti-Semitic crimes have increased, indeed, even those with the background of foreigners, but far-right crimes have risen even more sharply. In 2018, there were 1,600 far-right crimes and 154 with a foreign background.

The recent act of terror in Halle is yet another appalling pre-meditated attack on the Jewish community. Anti-Semitism and the threat of right-wing extremism is, sadly, on the rise across Europe. France reported a 74% increase, Germany more than 60%, and 10% in the UK. This is the highest number in the UK since records began in 1984, with the anti-terror ‘Prevent’ programme reporting a shocking 36% increase in far-right cases in 2018. I represent more than 30 0001 Jewish constituents in the North-West of England, and I know we cannot be complacent.

In Milan, in mid-September, an illegal immigrant stabbed a soldier in the throat shouting 'Allah akbar'.  So why is there no mention of the many violent cases of anti-Semitism in France? Why does Europe not discuss the danger of terrorism, Islamic fundamentalism in many European cities, islamic ghettos where fundamentalism lingers? Why is there no mention of the danger of Isis terrorists returning to Europe, not least because of Turkey's intervention in Syria, perhaps with boats in the middle of the sea?

It’s a very important debate. We have to keep shining a light on the issues that have been raised this evening.  There have been other occasions when we’ve discussed anti-Semitism. There can be no doubt about the Commission’s commitment to tackle that. You’ve discussed it at length with my colleagues Frans Timmermans and Věra Jourová, and I think there can be no doubt that the new Commission will continue its efforts to tackle anti-Semitism and tackle racism, xenophobia and extreme nationalism because these are fundamentally opposed to our shared values.  At the same time, we need to continue our efforts to counter violent extremism. I said it at the beginning of this debate and I shall say it at the end of this debate: violent extremism, whatever its source – that is, far-right violent extremism, far-left violent extremism, Jihadi extremism, I’m not making some sort of distinction between those – we must focus our efforts to tackle violent extremism.  I agree with those who have spoken about the need to focus on prevention, to counter the radicalisation that can lead to that hatred and violence, and we must do that through education and we must do that through our effective engagement with civil society, that is, local government, teachers, but also police officers, prison and probation staff. All those who find themselves on the front line in this fight. And we must work as part of this effort with the social media platforms because, whether we like it or not, this is the vehicle and the vector that spreads and accelerates so much of this hateful, violent and illegal content. It’s not because I have some problem with the social media platforms – they are being abused to spread this hatred and illegal content – but we do need to work with them. The violent extremist activity at Halle which we’ve all spoken about during this debate was carried out with a commentary in English. It was designed to spread a message across all our countries and possibly wider – a message of violence and hatred.  Because some of the lessons that have been learnt after Christchurch were put into effect, it was, as somebody said during the debate, only half an hour after that live-streaming that it was being taken down. That meant that it was actually seen as live-streaming by a relatively small number of people. But unfortunately that doesn’t stop it spreading. It’s spread to various channels, social networks, fora, image boards. It is still possible to see this content, as it is possible still to see content from the Christchurch attack, which is why we have to find more effective ways – working with the social media platforms – of targeting and eliminating this content because it does poison minds. I, like many of you who have spoken, believe that our strength is our values, and we need to remember what we stand for as we take forward this fight against extremism, hatred and violence. And it’s going to help us. Those values are going to help us to win this fight.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 153, "date": "2019-10-21.json", "name": "Nicola BEER", "mepid": "197437", "text": "  The debate is closed.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 154, "date": "2019-10-21.json", "name": "Nicola BEER", "mepid": "197437", "text": "  The next item on the agenda is the debate on the Commission statement on the criminalisation of sex education in Poland (2019/2891(RSP)).", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 155, "date": "2019-10-21.json", "name": "Nicola BEER", "mepid": "197437", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, the Parliament has invited the Commission to issue a statement on criminalisation of sexual education in Poland.

When it comes to education policy, as you know, Article 165 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union sets out that Member States are responsible for the content of teaching and the organisation of their education systems. That said, the Union does encourage cooperation between the Member States in this area. Curricula regarding sexual education are part of teaching. That said, the School Education Gateway – which is Europe’s online platform on school education for teachers, school leaders, policy-makers and experts – has opened a survey on the topic of sexual education to try and understand better the views of teachers who work in this field. The survey is open until 20 November, available in 23 languages, and the results of that survey will be published on the School Education Gateway. When it comes to the criminal law: again, as you know, Article 83 of the TFEU sets out that Union competence comes into play for serious crimes with a cross-border dimension. Now that does include the offence of sexual exploitation of women and children. Indeed, as you know, Directive 2011/93 criminalises sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children and child pornography. The Directive requires Member States to take appropriate measures, including education and training, to discourage and reduce the demand that fosters all forms of sexual exploitation of children. Examples include campaigns on the consequences of violating the law as well as the short- and long-term damage to those who are caught up in this vile crime. The Commission will make use of its enforcement powers under the Treaties to ensure that this Directive is implemented fully and correctly, and that includes ensuring that national laws do not interfere with the purpose of the Directive of preventing the sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 156, "date": "2019-10-21.json", "name": "Elżbieta Katarzyna ŁUKACIJEWSKA", "mepid": "96791", "text": "  On behalf of the PPE Group. – Madam President, i voted in favour of the report by Mrs Schwab Commissioner, i would like to thank you for your comments.

Pope Francis said: \"Sex is a gift from God. Sex education must be conducted in schools.\" He said this for the sake of the younger generation, and unfortunately I get the impression that school sex education in Poland today under PiS has become a very suspicious thing. Ba, even some say that the lack of sex education protects against paedophilia. I am surprised that the current government is deaf to all rational and scientific arguments, because what is going on? In Poland, more and more people are infected with venereal diseases, HIV prevention is limping, the number of mothers under the age of 15 is increasing, children are giving birth to children, the number of young people who take their own lives through lack of understanding, intolerance and hatred is increasing. In 2018 only, 13,500 children in Poland were victims of sexual violence and only fair, good sex education allows young people to start their sex life later, allows them to deal with violence, paedophile seduces, peer pressure, and also allows them to protect themselves from forced sexual initiation. I ask you, in the 21st century, the depravity is not sex education, it is denying the right to a fair knowledge of one's own body, sexuality, methods of contraception and the dangers of paedophiles.

Such punishments will also meet a teacher who will take the children to the cinema and during the film there will be a scene of a sexual nature. This teacher will also face a prosecutor.

In fact, like my colleague, I find it quite impossible that, in 21st-century Europe, teachers would actually be threatened with prison time for explaining the practice and benefits of condoms to youngsters. Normally, governments in Europe – and all across the world – do their utmost to invest in education: education which is free from ideology and equips children with the necessary knowledge and skills to navigate through their professional and social lives. What we see here is actually the very opposite: depriving children of this very right. The authors of this legislation claim that it is intended to protect children and young people from sexual deprivation. The problem is that it might in fact cause the very opposite because, without proper knowledge about sexual abuse by potential victims, it may well be that sexual violence will increase as a result, because making sexuality taboo is typically an invitation for paedophiles. Any attempt to effectively ban sexual education would therefore be to the detriment of the children’s well—being and safety. The other negative consequence would be to scare off and discourage professional teachers from doing their job, given the harsh penalties involved. This would send a very bad signal to the entire profession and create an atmosphere of fear and persecution. Perhaps, as some might suggest, these harsh sentences would not in fact be applied and the law would be interpreted in a fairly lenient fashion. However, given the aggressive campaign of scapegoating and hatred against, say, the LGBTI community in Poland over the past few months, it is very difficult to believe these assurances.

This is outrageous from the point of view of the sovereignty of the Polish people. One can be divided on whether the sex education of children belongs in the hands of the state or that of the parents. What you can't argue about, however, is whether you teach children all kinds of sexual practices, from anal intercourse to oral intercourse, at primary school age, and encourage them to do it with everyone – no matter when, how, where, and with whom. The sexology curriculum has already been implemented in Germany. According to a brochure by pro familia (sic!), our children are supposed to sniff each other's butts with their eyes closed to guess whose child's butt might be. This has nothing to do with sex education, but is a disgusting attempt to sexualize our children as early as possible. The natural shame limit of the children is to be destroyed, they should be educated to distanceless behavior. But this opens the door for the paedophiles of this world, because the sexual rape of children who are distancing is much easier. With such children you can also do what you want, and that seems to be the goal of this left-green disgusting ideology. I congratulate the Polish citizens for having a government that takes the protection of our children seriously and protects them from this disgusting left-wing, perverse ideology.

If we in Europe are to ensure gender equality – real equality – where women, girls, men and boys, understand their value, worth and responsibilities, we need to progress sexual education, not hamper it. We must educate our young people. As I know well from Ireland, it is rather a lack of education, as opposed to education, that results in alarming and unexpected consequences. And what consequences they are. Development of healthy relationships is hampered, awareness of what constitutes sexual abuse is stifled, and fundamentally it does a disservice to the youth in Europe by denying them the right of information, a fundamental of our democracy.  As regards the proposal that to teach young people about sexual education would be akin to promoting paedophilia, I say absolute nonsense. In fact, sexual education can heighten young people’s understanding and therefore make them more aware of what constitutes sexual abuse and protect them. To deny young people the opportunity of such an education makes them vulnerable, not just at that moment, but actually throughout their lives.  Fundamentally, this proposal will not, and cannot, achieve its true aim to reduce the numbers of young people engaging in sexual activity.

Some topics should only be discussed between children and parents. Adolescents in Poland are often referred only to information from the Internet. They can come across not only YouTuber Natalie Trybus, who is trying to substitute the lack of sex education in schools, but also a large number of dubious and dangerous sources.  In the Polish Sejm lies a controversial law that provides for a sentence of three to five years in prison for teaching sex education. According to the authors of the standard, sex education poses a threat to young people. Opponents of the legislation, for their work, consider it dangerous to remain silent on the subject. The internet campaign \"sexedPL\" wants to show young people that sex should and must be talked about. Its author, the well-known top model Anja Rubik, wrote a book intended as a textbook about sex, its joys, but mainly about the risks. But her book could now be blacklisted.  The authors of the standard consider teaching in schools perhaps to be the spread of pedophilia. So I'm asking, do the authors of the law even know what pedophilia is? I don't think so. In modern times, sex education is the standard in the schedule of teaching hours. Sex education, on the other hand, should be strengthened in the school curriculum, not prohibited.

Now the government is even threatening to do so illegally, with prison sentences of up to five years. This clearly shows the Stone Age tendencies of the ruling Law and Justice party in Poland. Referring to paedophilia is strange and sick. Sex education helps young people better understand their bodies, their feelings and their personal integrity. It can also prevent harassment, sexual violence and discrimination and challenge stereotypes and norms in society. It is a matter of freedom that I – and only I – have the right to decide over my body and no one else, and that is part of the sex education case. In addition, it promotes equality and equality.

The Commission is currently exploring, with the Spanish and with the Portuguese authorities, the best ways to support the recovery from the damage caused. The EU Solidarity Fund provides Member States and regions affected by serious natural disasters with financial assistance for emergency and recovery operations. The Commission services, in fact, have already had meetings with the authorities of the Valencia region and with the authorities of the Azores to explain the conditions and the procedures that activate the Solidarity Fund.  The Spanish Government in a recent letter to the Commission have announced their intention to apply for Solidarity Fund assistance once they’ve completed the ongoing damage assessment. If the applications are submitted within the deadline and their assessment by the Commission reveals that the conditions for activating the Solidarity Fund are met then the Commission will move rapidly to propose an amount of aid to be approved by this House and by the Council. In both cases, these would be categorised as so-called ‘regional disasters’, for which aid can amount to up to 2.5% of the total direct damage.  In addition, the European Structural and Investment Funds can intervene to help with certain recovery operations, and again, as some of the damage concerned affects the agricultural sector, the EU Rural Development Policy provides for restoring agricultural production potential damaged by natural disasters and catastrophic events and introduction of appropriate preventive actions, so it too could provide support to help farmers cope with the impact of natural disasters. And to compensate for damage caused to primary producers by heavy rains and floods, Member States can, as I’m sure you know, also consider granting state aid.

As the representative of the Commission commented, the Spanish Government argued that it was still calculating the damage suffered by Murcia, Valencia and Almería following the so-called 'cold drop', following the torrential rains in Spain between 12 and 15 September. These damages are already calculated, and what I want to report to this House is the passivity of the Spanish government – the Government of Pedro Sánchez – in activating and implementing the Solidarity Fund as quickly as possible; in the case of Murcia in particular, this region meets all the requirements to be a beneficiary of the Solidarity Fund.  We are talking about the fact that unfortunately there have been six fatalities and damages that are already calculated by the regional government of Murcia at EUR 560 million in this region. In Valencia and Andalusia the damage is estimated at 190 million euros. We are talking about damage that has already been accounted for and of citizens who are waiting for Europe to react.  One of the main European values is solidarity and the European Solidarity Fund is to work in cases like these, to react and respond to citizens who are overwhelmed and in often dramatic situations like the ones we are currently experiencing.  Therefore, from here, from the European Parliament, I call on the Council, I ask the Member States to speed up as much as possible the launch of the European Solidarity Fund. And I say this in the face of a threat that there may be torrential rains affecting the Balearic Islands, Valencia or Catalonia these days.  The European Union has to react quickly and cannot be an agency that takes weeks and weeks to react to natural disasters such as those we have just suffered in Spain or those suffered by our neighbours in Portugal , in the Azores.

Now what we are asking for is the need to act together so that all resources and instruments, of course also those of the European Union, are put at the service of citizens. It is the citizens who have to feel that their institutions are at their side when they need them most, to recover everything they have lost, and certainly to invest - and for that I appeal to the need for European funds – so that this never happens again.

So we have important environmental and economic consequences in this area as well.  In the face of this serious situation, what we are asking is that the Solidarity Fund be launched. We need to deal with the havoc caused by the cold drop and restore hope to all those families who have lost their homes, farmers and fishermen, and help them rebuild their lives and their future.  Because DANA is yet another example of the natural disasters that will affect Europe in the coming years as a result of climate change and highlights the need for all Member States to combat climate change together, because just as it has affected Spain and Portugal it will also affect other European regions.  Unfortunately, it's not a problem that's going to go away. Today in Spain, for example, we have been alert to a new storm coming. European mechanisms, such as the European Union Solidarity Fund, need to respond to these problems.

This partnership has always been a great certainty and alliance between Europe and the US. And what we are witnessing today is of great concern to me. The erratic nature of the administration, and President Trump in particular, meant that the Kurds on the Syrian side were actually left unattended, and the European Union was not informed of this. It is clear that the new Trump administration does not seem to care so much about good cooperation with Europe. I think that's very shortsighted.
