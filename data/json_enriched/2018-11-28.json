The tug boat was later rammed by a Moscow military vessel and the Russian navy fired on Ukrainian ships and seized them; at least 6 Ukrainian soldiers were wounded and 23 were arrested. Following these events, Ukraine declared martial law in 10 regions for a period of 30 days.  In view of this further serious escalation of tensions in the region, I would like to express our deep concern and remember that for us the territorial integrity of Ukraine is fundamental: Russia does not have the right to prevent the passage of Ukrainian or other vessels to the Sea of Azov and has an obligation to comply with the UNITED Nations Convention on Maritime Law and the Cooperation Agreement concluded with Ukraine in 2003. We therefore call on the Russian authorities to commit themselves to ensuring that their obligations are fulfilled and to release the Ukrainian military who have been arrested.  In my meeting yesterday with the President of the Ukrainian Parliament, Andriy Parubij, I wanted to assure you that this Parliament is following this matter very closely and that it will do everything possible to facilitate a positive solution. I also informed him of the resolution we adopted on 30 October, which deplores the disproportionate actions of the Russian authorities in the Sea of Azov.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE-DE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "PPE-DE"}, {"id": 2, "date": "2018-11-28.json", "name": "Antonio TAJANI", "mepid": "2187", "text": "   I inform you that I have signed, together with the President of the Council, the following acts adopted in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure: – Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the use of the Schengen Information System for the return of third-country nationals whose stay is irregular (00034/2018/LEX - C8-0485/2018 - 2016/0407(COD)); – Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the establishment, the exercise and use of the Schengen Information System (SIS) in the field of border checks, amending the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement and repealing Regulation (EC) No 1987/2006 (00035/2018/LEX - C8-0486/2018 - 2016/0408(COD)); – Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the establishment, operation and use of the Schengen Information System (SIS) in the field of police cooperation and judicial cooperation in criminal matters, amending and repealing Council Decision 2007/533/JHA and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No Regulation (EC) No 1986/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council and Commission Decision 2010/261/EU (00036/2018/LEX - C8-0487/2018 - 2016/0409(COD)).", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE-DE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "PPE-DE"}, {"id": 3, "date": "2018-11-28.json", "name": "Philippe LAMBERTS", "mepid": "96648", "text": "   – Mr President, two days ago, in Estonia, a demonstration was organised by the parliamentary party, the Conservative People’s Party of Estonia, in front of the Estonian Parliament.

The votes on the following reports, all linked to the budgetary procedure, will be postponed: – report by Mrs Viotti, on the mobilisation of a flexibility instrument to finance immediate budgetary measures to address the current challenges of migration, the flow of refugees and security threats;  - report by Mr Christoforou on the mobilisation of the European Union Solidarity Fund for the payment of advances from the Union's general budget for 2019; – report by Mr Mureşan, on draft amending budget No 6/2018: reduction of payment and commitment appropriations: own resources. In addition, the following points are added directly to the votes: – report by Mr Dalli on the recommitment of the remaining amounts committed in support of the implementation of Council decisions no. 2015/1523 and 2015/1601 or their allocation to other actions under national programmes, and objection under Article 106 on authorisation for certain uses of sodium chromate.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE-DE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 2, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "PPE-DE"}, {"id": 14, "date": "2018-11-28.json", "name": "Tanja FAJON", "mepid": "96911", "text": "   – Mr President, on behalf of the S&amp;D Group, I request the Council and Commission statement on the preparation of the Marrakesh Intergovernmental Conference of 10 and 11 December on the UN Global Compact for Migration to be the second item on Thursday morning.

I bring up these statements today not because they are shared by me or because they are shared by the majority – far from it, but because these are views that are not uncommon in Denmark or the rest of Europe. I bring up these statements because I care. I care about my country, about Europe, about our Union: a Union born from the ashes of war and division turned into the greatest and most successful peace project in the history of the world.  My grandfather witnessed the First World War from a distance. My mother witnessed the Second World War up close. To her, the golden stars were not only symbols of peace; they were also a reminder of the opposite: fear, destruction, war. She was born on the island of Bornholm and she witnessed the Russian bombardment after Denmark had regained freedom in May 1945, so she witnessed the burning fire when bombs fell from the sky. To people like my mother, the Anthem of Europe was the anthem of peace, but to my daughter and my sons, war in Europe is a long time ago. It’s a story, not a memory. To them and to younger generations, bringing peace in the past will not be enough to justify our Union in the future. This puts new pressure on the European Union. How should we respond? We must keep reminding people of what we have achieved together in the past, but we must also listen – listen to what the people of Europe want the EU to be in the future. If we don’t, we risk jeopardising European solidarity. Brexit is a case in point. We must respect the choice of the British people, but we also need to learn from this choice. For forty years, the people of Britain were told how European cooperation was holding them back, but in fact, Brexit has revealed how European cooperation was solving problems that the Brits now have to deal with on their own: securing open borders, frictionless trade, peace and security. In Britain, the Government perhaps forgot to tell people about the results in Europe, forgot to tell people about what we have achieved together, and perhaps, along the way, they forgot to listen to the voices of concern, too – before it was all too late. Many of you would maybe claim that the Danes, too, are reluctant Europeans. You saw how the Danes rejected the Maastricht Treaty in 1992, rejected the Euro in the year 2000, and, in 2015, rejected the ability to fully participate in cooperation on Justice and Home Affairs, but you would be greatly mistaken to cast the Danes as being in opposition to the European Union. In fact, the share of people supporting the EU is larger in Denmark than in most other European countries and the share of Danes who believe their voice is heard at European level ranks 2nd among all 28 Member States. How can that be? Part of the reason is that in Denmark, we have a long tradition of discussing the European Union. Not as much as I would like, but politicians from left to right have, in fact, promoted this debate for the last 30 years. This has given everyone, including myself, a much more pragmatic view on our Union. Perhaps this is also why Danes are not swayed by distant dreams of a future that might be. Grand ideas of the ‘United States of Europe’ fall on deaf ears. We are concerned about finding down-to-earth solutions to present-day problems, to making the EU work better. As a people with a thousand-year long tradition for trading, Danes recognise a good deal when they see it, and the EU is a good deal. The Single Market is a tremendous benefit to our economy which cannot be understated. The EU is also a close-knit political community of nations that share and seek to protect the same fundamental values, a Union of nations that solve their problems through peaceful means. That is a good deal. Denmark belongs in the European Union, but, at the same time, Danes are proud of their unique model of society. Over the course of this past century, Denmark has developed one of the best welfare states known in history. People pay a large share of their income to ensure that every citizen, regardless of gender, race or origin, has a fair chance to succeed. For the most part, our model of society is well protected under the EU Treaties and in EU regulations. In fact, the EU has helped to strengthen our economy: estimates say that real wages in Denmark are 10 percent higher than they would have been had we been outside the EU. The freedom of movement ensures that our businesses have direct access to half a billion consumers and that Danes can work and deliver services all over Europe. However, in certain key areas, I have a hard time defending and explaining the EU rules. For instance, our high levels of child benefit payments – financed by Danish tax payers – are made available to all workers in Denmark, regardless of whether their children actually live in Denmark or not. This is, from a Danish perspective, not fair, and it is a challenge to the Danish model of society, which is based on a shared sense of solidarity and on our ability to ensure a sustainable balance of rights and responsibilities. The EU must guarantee the freedom to move, but freedom of movement must also be fair and freedom of movement must not be abused. During this very fall, a number of third-country truck drivers – technically employed in another EU country – were found to be working permanently in Denmark under horrible conditions, apparently under the pretext of the freedom of movement. Stories like this hurt the image of the EU and we need to work together to ensure that they are not repeated and that rules are strongly enforced for the benefit of the people. In some cases, the solution is for the EU to step down, to interfere less; yet, in other areas, the EU needs to step up. In four existential areas, I hear our citizens calling for more cooperation. Our time will be defined by our ability to solve these issues – together in this room and in the Council. The first issue is migration. This is a challenge that will not disappear anytime soon, but even if the challenge is still here, we could all do a better job of explaining to citizens that the EU and the Member States have already achieved quite a lot: for instance, a 95% drop in arrivals since the crisis of 2015. However, more needs to be done. We have to break the cynical business model of human traffickers. We must develop European policies which remove the incentive for those with no real need for protection to embark on a dangerous journey towards Europe. Common solutions are necessary, but not all European solutions are equally good. I continue to believe that redistribution of asylum seekers is not the right way to solve the problem, but make no mistake: Denmark is willing to take responsibility and support those frontline Member States in need. We support a more flexible – yet mandatory – mechanism of solidarity and we are ready to put actions behind our words. In 2019, we will significantly enhance our contribution to Frontex. We already rank among the top four when it comes to financing the EU Trust Fund for Africa. We are among only three or four European Member States who actually have managed to allocate 0.7% of GDP to aid, and we are actively exploring further contributions. Speaking of Africa, I believe it is time for Europe to start rebuilding our partnership with the nations of Africa. Our two continents are bound to each other: what is good for Africa will also be good for Europe. Europe has flourished because of decades of international trade liberalisation by the EU. There is no reason why the same benefits cannot be applied to Africa. That is why I believe we must help Africa in building a true African free trade area which can serve as the bedrock for future African jobs and prosperity. While pushing for further progress on return and readmission, our aim should be to create a full and equal partnership. The second issue where increased EU action is essential is the fight against climate change. Almost three years ago, Paris, the City of Lights, turned into the shining city on the hill as the world agreed to save the planet from climate breakdown. Two months earlier, at the UN Assembly in New York, I had the privilege to co-chair the very UN meeting where we adopted the Sustainable Development Goals. These are two historic agreements offering new hope for future generations. Denmark is determined to act in support of both agreements. During the last 17 years, we have tripled our consumption of green electricity. On windy days, all of our electricity is produced by windmills, and we are well on the way to reaching our goal of net zero emissions by 2050. I was happy to learn earlier today that the Commission has adopted the same vision of carbon neutrality for all of Europe. Decades ago, a political decision on renewable energy was taken in Denmark and it has proven to be a good deal for Danish companies. They were forced to innovate and now we all profit: businesses as well as the environment. Recently, my government has launched a new vision. In 17 years – in 2035 – every single new car bought in Denmark must be an electric car or another type of zero-emission car. It is a big ambition that will not be easy to reach, but it is precisely this kind of decision that I believe will foster innovation, and I will push hard to make this a European policy. Make no mistake about it: if we set ambitious goals for the green transition at European level, we will motivate our own industry to be frontrunners – to the benefit of all of us in Europe, and not least to the benefit of our children and grandchildren. Today, the EU has become the global voice of the climate and green transition. We need to live up to that responsibility and I urge everyone in this room to work to that end. Now is not the time to slow down. The third issue where more EU action is needed is on expanding and modernising and implementing the Single Market. That is, after all, the backbone of our European cooperation. Our internal market needs to be brought up to speed. I can be blunt: the internal market is no longer only about physical goods at physical borders; the modern economy is much more than that. Today, services, and in particular digital services, constitute an increasingly important part of our economy; goods and services are intertwined in global value chains. The Single Market must match this development: it must be digitally competitive, data must flow freely, every corner of the Internal Market must be digitally fit – from production to consumer protection. As legislators, we have to stimulate innovation, not kill it in regulation. The digital transformation of the Internal Market is a huge challenge, but the US and China will not wait for Europe. Finally, the fourth issue where the EU needs to do more is on free trade. Europe itself is a testament to how trade liberalisation brings both prosperity and peace among free people. It is our duty to safeguard free trade, even when we find ourselves under historic pressure. In the US, the land of dreams, they are now dreaming of less free trade, of fewer international obligations, of barriers to trade and perhaps even of breaking up the international rules-based trading system. We must not allow that to happen and it has become increasingly clear that only Europe will be able to prevent it. My fellow Europeans, I started my speech by saying that the European Union must be justified by more than the memory of division and war, but that doesn’t mean that we should forget about the past. In contrast to my parents, I didn’t witness the two world wars; I witnessed the Cold War, but I also witnessed the end of it 28 years ago. On 2 October 1990, my wife and I fastened the seatbelts in our wrecked Volvo and headed for Berlin. We took the ferry to Rostock and we reached the Brandenburger Tor at midnight, just in time to witness the official reunification of Germany. In my old passport, there are two stamps from that trip: one from 2 October saying ‘Rostock, DDR’, the other from 3 October saying ‘Rostock, Bundesrepublik Deutschland’.

Escalating tensions in the Azov Sea over the past days have led to the seizure of Ukrainian vessels and shots being fired at them by Russia, as well as injuries to a number of Ukrainian servicemen. These developments are unacceptable and we expect Russia to immediately release the vessels and the crew and to ensure the medical assistance needed is given to the Ukrainian servicemen. International law obliges the Russian Federation to ensure unhindered and free passage of all vessels through the Kerch Strait. Therefore we expect Russia to restore freedom of passage at the Kerch Strait. As you know, the EU does not and will not recognise the illegal annexation of the Crimean peninsula by Russia and condemns its aggression towards Ukraine. High Representative Federica Mogherini has been in touch with several partners since this escalation started, and will continue to engage on this issue with a view to a broader international response. The EU’s Political and Security Committee also met earlier this week to discuss the situation and the next steps.  (Applause) Mr President, now let me move to today’s discussion on the future of Europe. Speaking on behalf of President Juncker, who is on his way to Buenos Aires for the G20 meeting, allow me to start by thanking Prime Minister Rasmussen for taking part in today’s debate on the future of the Union. At the start of this year we celebrated 45 years since Denmark joined the European Union. In that time Denmark has given the Union so much, from its effective social model, its growth-friendly business environment and its well-functioning social dialogue to the richness of its culture. It was Denmark that pioneered a successful model for labour markets, combining flexibility with a high degree of social protection. In a political sphere Danish leadership was also as visible. As a Latvian I well remember that Denmark was among the first countries to recognise Latvia’s restoration of independence in 1991; it was a concrete expression of European solidarity. This support continued and together with other Nordic countries, Denmark provided important political backing for the accession of the Baltic states in 2004. This leadership role has continued since the crisis. For instance, in the post-crisis period Denmark was quick to implement difficult but effective public spending controls. Crucially this was achieved by still maintaining the second highest level of social protection spending in the EU. This serves as a good example of how prudent fiscal policy is compatible with the delivery of high-quality public services. More recently, Denmark has been working hard to further improve competitiveness and increase productivity. Ultimately it is productivity gains that will allow for continued improvements in living standards. That too is a lesson for all countries to draw on. These are good economic times. Europe’s economy is now entering its sixth year of uninterrupted growth. Employment has risen to a record level of 239 million people and unemployment has fallen back to pre-crisis levels, helping more than 10 million people out of poverty or social exclusion. But we cannot become complacent. External risks are there and mounting while at the same time important reforms remain incomplete. The current economic sunshine is an opportunity for us to finish what we have started before the next storm arrives. Completing reforms is not just a matter of individual countries. Building a stronger, more democratic and more united Union will require us to stay close and build trust with one another. As President Juncker said in his State of the Union address, Europe succeeds when it speaks with one voice. Now more than ever, global events highlight the importance of this message. The reality is that European nations have neither the size nor the means to shape global affairs on their own and the strength is only going in one direction. By 2060, no single European nation will have more than 1% of the world’s population. This is why European countries, big or small, pool and share their sovereignty to build a stronger form of common sovereignty. As part of the world’s largest single market, and a bloc which accounts for a fifth of the global economy, each country is better placed to defend its national interests and to ensure fairness and prosperity for its people. This pooling of sovereignty begins with a single market, a concept that Denmark has embraced and made the most of since 1973. Last week we presented the communication to highlight the achievements of the single market over the past 25 years, but we also stressed the need to improve and deepen it for our future prosperity. This is why we have set out our road map for deepening economic and monetary union. A strong economic and monetary union is vital to the stability and prospects of the euro area, but as the Prime Minister has often said, it is equally important for the European Union as a whole. In that spirit, Denmark has played an active and positive role in the debate on strengthening our economic and monetary union, but now it is time to move from debate to decision in order to strengthen the resilience of the euro area. This means completing the banking union, which Denmark might decide to join soon, and completing the capital markets’ union on which the Commission adopted a report today. Strengthening the single market and economic and monetary union also means strengthening the role the euro plays in the global currency system. Even if Denmark remains outside the currency area, its peg to the euro has given it a solid anchor for low and stable inflation and to reduce uncertainty in trade. This is true for Denmark, as it is true for many other countries. Countries across the globe rely on the euro as a safe store of value. Around 20% of international reserves of foreign central banks are denominated in euros. Yet there is scope for the further development of the euro’s global political role. Recent political events should serve as a wake-up call in this area. Now it’s time for us to take the initiative. The Commission will put out a communication and an accompanying act on this important issue next week. Last but not least, if we want to be truly ready for the future, we need to invest in it now. We need to plan together with a common purpose. This is why we have focused our proposals for the new multiannual financial framework on areas where we can achieve more together and which are crucial to Denmark’s and Europe’s future. Our proposal is balanced. As Denmark and others have called for, we have put forward programmes that are modern, more efficient and more focused on urgent priorities. For instance, there has been almost a three-fold increase in funding for migration and security to make sure that Europe can protect its citizens. Funding for research and innovation, of which Denmark is one of the highest recipients, will be increased by 50% to reach EUR 100 billion. We have proposed a new digital Europe programme worth EUR 9 billion to support Europe’s digital transformation, and we will also ensure that 25% of the budget will support our climate and sustainable development targets. But, just as we cannot delay or postpone our future, we should not lose time in agreeing on the resources needed to bring that future alive. As President Juncker said, there would be no better message, no greater symbol to Europeans that their Union will invest in the future and take its destiny in its own hands. To conclude, when we think about the future of Europe, we should perhaps recall an old and wise Danish saying, ‘making predictions is hazardous, especially about the future’. But there are two things I feel confident in predicting. Firstly if we are going to protect our citizens, harness the benefits of a rapidly changing world and create more opportunities for more prosperity, we will have to remain strong and united. And my second prediction is that Denmark will continue to play a positive role for shaping a better, stronger, European future.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE-DE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "PPE-DE"}, {"id": 25, "date": "2018-11-28.json", "name": "Manfred WEBER", "mepid": "28229", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, I would like to welcome the Prime Minister to the European Parliament. Denmark has been a member of the European Union for 45 years – Valdis Dombrovskis was referring to this – so that gives you a lot of knowledge and a lot of experience about the future of Europe and what the experience of the Danish people and Danish society on Europe has been in the last decades. As you said, it was not always easy with Europe in Denmark and the Maastricht Treaty, but finally there was always a clear ‘yes’ to membership and to readiness to contribute to positive development. I was surprised when I saw the Eurobarometer data, which said that Denmark is a country where the people say that their voice counts the most in Europe. So Denmark is in first place and public involvement in the European decision-making process is obviously working very well in Denmark. Congratulations on this because I think that the most important thing for the future of Europe is the bridge between the European decision-making process and the people of Europe. You said it: some call us bureaucrats and some call us elites. People have the feeling that, after the votes in the elections next year, nothing will have changed. Some people will have been removed, but nothing will have changed in the political direction. I think that is the key question. When we talk about Brexit and the lesson we have to learn from Brexit, it is about getting sovereignty back. People want to have a say. People must know that their voice counts at a European level. That’s why I welcome the ideas in this regard to make it clearer to people what we are doing here. I want to strongly underline that the most important issue for the future of Europe is – and I think all of us here in this plenary agree – the field of foreign affairs and defence. Russia is giving us a concrete case at the moment where we have to give a proper answer as Europeans together. For us it is clear that the Ukrainians must decide about their way towards the future, whether they want to go in the direction of the European Union or whether they see their future more in the east. it is up to Kiev to decide. it is not for Russia, not for Moscow and not for Brussels, but for Kiev to decide. I also want to underline that we urgently need a common voice in these fields of external affairs. We understand that unanimous voting is an old concept. We have to come to the majority decision—making process in this field to be stronger and more active. Finally, on the Russian thing, I want to underline that, when Russia is still provoking Europe and European partners and friends, I think we also have to rethink the investments on Nord Stream 2. I do not think we should be more dependent on Russian gas than we already are now, and it should be a European decision-making process when we talk about Nord Stream 2. We have a lot of these points on the table. I only want to mention the key issues. When we want to discuss a Europe for the future, we have to defend Europe. That’s why the Schengen question, the border protection issue – in my home region between Germany and Austria, but also in the Danish-German border region – is not something which is good for the future. That’s why we should invest in Frontex. Let’s protect the Bulgarian and the Greek border with Turkey. That would be much more efficient and would also bring the same effect. Another element is to continue to convince – you had all of the decisions about Europol in your country where people didn’t trust cooperation on data exchange – and to strengthen the data exchange for more security and for the fight against organised crime at a European level. Prime Minister, I thank you for your engagement in this regard to try still to convince the Danish people that it is in all of our interests to have this data exchange and, finally, to strengthen Europe. Yes, the single market is the future. In this period, frankly speaking, we did not do much to strengthen the single market, or only the digital single market but not the rest. We have to be more engaged in this. You have the full support of the EPP. We have to create prosperity and that’s why free and fair trade agreements are the future of this continent. We have to do so. You have the full support of the EPP. Finally, let me switch to German. Ich möchte nämlich am Schluss einen grundsätzlichen Gedanken anbringen: Die Sorge der Menschen, wie es weitergeht auf dem Kontinent, wird zum einen durch Populisten mit einfachen Antworten bedient, aber wir haben leider auch die Situation, dass einfach Schuldige gesucht werden. Der Antisemitismus auf diesem Kontinent nimmt zu, sowohl in meinem Land, in Deutschland, als auch in Frankreich, in Großbritannien, in vielen Staaten sind die Entwicklungen beunruhigend. Ich habe letzte Woche Auschwitz besucht. Man wird dort an diesem Ort still, es ist kalt dort, die Tötungsmaschine der Nazideutschen hat dort ihr unsägliches Werk vollbracht. Ich spreche das deswegen an, weil es auch der Gründungsimpuls für Europa war. Simone Veil war die erste Präsidentin dieser Institution und Auschwitz-Überlebende. Sie hat beim vierzigsten Jahrestag der Befreiung von Auschwitz in einer Rede gesagt, dass der Gründungsimpuls für Europa das „Nie wieder!“ war. „Nie wieder Krieg!“, so wie Sie es angesprochen haben. Aber auch nie wieder Rassismus, Antisemitismus, Ausgrenzung, kein Respekt vor den Menschenrechten. Auch das war das Gründungsmoment für die Europäische Union. Warum spreche ich das heute an? Weil ich in den Unterlagen gesehen habe, dass in Dänemark 99 % aller Juden den Holocaust überlebt haben. Dänemark hat gehandelt. In Dänemark sind die Menschen aufgestanden und haben den Juden einen Weg aus dem Land heraus ermöglicht und haben sie gerettet, die Bürgergesellschaft hat sie gerettet, die Werte hochgehalten, die Europa ausmachen. Ich finde das, gerade wenn wir über die Zukunft Europas reden, einen wichtigen Gedanken, dass Menschen, dass wir zu unseren Werten stehen, dass wir sie verteidigen, auch in dunklen Zeiten, und da ist Dänemark ein Vorbild.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 26, "date": "2018-11-28.json", "name": "Jeppe KOFOD", "mepid": "124870", "text": "  for the S&amp;D Group. Mr President! Dear Prime Minister, Dear Lars Løkke Rasmussen, welcome to the European Parliament. Allow me to speak in my mother tongue for today' s occasion. The project of peace, migration, climate change, the proper functioning of the internal market, free and fair trade, all important things on which we can agree must be strengthened in the cooperation we stand in.  But it is also important to say that when there is dissatisfaction among the citizens of Europe, it is also because there are also failed policies. We have seen globalisation over the last few decades, which has brought many positive things, but also negative things. We have lost control of areas where citizens are rightly demanding that we take back control democratically. So some - liberals and conservatives in particular - have hailed the winners of globalisation and closed their eyes to those who pay the price in the form of wage printing and social dumping. Let me take an example: in the last 20 years, corporation tax in EU countries has fallen from 35% to 22%. The trend continues. There's a tax race to the bottom. Apple, Facebook and Google have paid less than 1 percent of their profits in Europe in taxes. Europe's treasuries have been stolen over 400 billion kroner in the Cum-Ex scandal, the Cum-Cum scandal, which we have seen in many European countries. Denmark alone has lost over 12 billion kroner on the scammers. They stole from our treasury, bandits in suits. Tax on digital giants, common bottom under corporation tax in Europe, financial transaction tax, open accounts for subsidiaries of multinationals, a consolidated corporate tax base in the EU, an EU emergency response centre against tax fraud and money laundering, financial crime. All these concrete solutions to international tax fraud, fighting your government – your government! – actively opposed at EU level. The Prime Minister's own minister of tax even refused and met with the special tax cheating committee in parliament when we invited him. So Prime Minister, in the fight against international tax fraud, your government is all too often, unfortunately not – and I mourn it – part of the solution, but part of the problem.  And, dear Prime Minister, EU cooperation is precisely about and working together – we agree on that – and finding some good pragmatic common solutions. And decisions are taken by those who are present at the table, as we all know in this room. That is why I am also surprised that the Danish Government is as little active in the EU as it is. Even on its own very stated brand issues – and this was also mentioned here in the speech by the Prime Minister – the government is absent. Seven days before the 2015 elections, you, the Liberal Party, the Danish People's Party, the Conservatives and the Liberal Alliance issued a joint statement under the heading I quote; \"bourgeois parties will ensure Danish welfare in the EU\". You went to the polls on – and I quote; \"secure benefit rules so that EU citizens cannot in future obtain full entitlement to Danish unemployment benefit after just a few weeks of membership of an unemployment insurance fund and full-time work in Denmark\". Now we have to note that the government cannot live up to the election promise promised before the last election, that the Council of Ministers has not made the necessary efforts and that we now have the same situation in this House. Why would it take a full 1266 days from the Liberals, Danish People's Party, Liberal Alliance and Conservatives, the Danes promised to limit the possibilities for the export of welfare benefits until they now raise the matter in the European Parliament, as we heard today. I don't understand that.  What is important, Prime Minister, is that we have a strong Europe around the values that characterise us with well-functioning welfare states, well-functioning democracies and the protection of citizens' rights. So it's people before the market. That is, working before the share price, and it is, also climate before competition concerns. In this way, we can build a future Europe that respects citizens' concerns and protect our particular social model in Europe. We have to stand together on that. We need a new course, and I would have liked to hear more about it today.", "language": "en", "original_language": "da", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 27, "date": "2018-11-28.json", "name": "Anders Primdahl VISTISEN", "mepid": "124875", "text": "  for the ECR Group. Mr President! Welcome to the European Parliament on behalf of the ECR Group and the Danish People's Party, Prime Minister. We have been very much looking forward to hearing your vision for the European Union of the future. I understand that this is very much about the European Union as a project of peace, and it is perhaps possible to ask the Prime Minister what conflicts Denmark could have dealt with if we had not joined the European Union in 1973. But today it is more obvious to me to ask the Prime Minister about the defence opt-out, which the Prime Minister and his Defence Minister have recently said we should abolish. It is surprising that, for not the first, but the second – and not the second, but third time, the Danes are required to deal with the reservations in a referendum, even though they have been confirmed each time. But what more amazes me about the defence opt-out, Prime Minister, is what the Liberal Party's logic is? The Liberal Party, as I have heard, wants to get rid of the defence opt-out so that we cannot join a European army. After all, this is internally contradictory, and I understand that the logic is that the Prime Minister finds that if he just sits at the table, he can prevent the establishment of a European army, despite the fact that this Parliament, the Commission, Germany's Angela Merkel and President Macron are all warm advocates of the project. Yes, the latter Macron has even said that the initiative is partly aimed at our close friend and ally the United States. But, Prime Minister, I'm sorry, I think, unfortunately, your confidence is a little generous in this area. I do not believe that you can turn the tide here in Europe when it comes to federalisation, and the reason Why I mean it is precisely what you yourself have brought up today with welfare benefits.  After all, your government has run into one defeat after another when it comes to fighting welfare tourism, which was otherwise a shared ambition of our parties before the last election. You have failed to index child benefit, even though the Austrian government has gone down that path. Unfortunately, you will not run the same procedural risk with the European Court of Justice. And in relation to the fight for unemployment benefits – Danish unemployment benefit – where before the election it was a disaster that a full benefit could be granted after a small month, the majority now accounts for this to happen after one day's work in Denmark, and you have to take this unemployment benefit with you to another EU country for up to six months. So, Prime Minister, I respect the fact that you want to sit at the table, but it doesn't seem to be much useful for Danish interests whether you're there or not.  One might then be led to believe that the streak of defeats the government has run into its EU political brand, which was presented before the elections, had led the Prime Minister and his party to reflect on all the positive feelings that are generally expressed about the EU project. That does not seem to be the case. After all, the Prime Minister has just had a national meeting in the Liberal Party, and I understand that the mantra that came out of there in the lead-up to the EU elections was that the Liberal Party is Denmark's most EU-positive party, and right must be right, that is how I really feel about it here from the European Parliament. After all, you sit in the federalist ALDE Group, you have supported Mr Tsipras. Mr Verhofstadt as group chairman of the group, you have supported him as a Spitzenkandidat in the last EU parliamentary campaign, and you have even supported him for the presidency here in the European Parliament. It was a warm statement of support, Mr President. Verhofstadt, the author of the book on the United States of Europe. It is good with the love in ALDE, and the statement of support was that Mr Saunders' Verhofstadt had the clearest visions for Europe. And mr. Verhofstadt's visions are clear! This is a new EU Constitution containing everything from a common president, foreign minister, finance minister, direct taxes, EU army, abolition of all national opt-outs and forced distribution of migrants.  And mr. Mr Verhofstadt's vision goes even further: he has also said that the ultimate consequence of thinking in national identity is the gas chambers of Auschwitz, and finally, that our homeland is now Europe, our national anthem is now the anthem of joy, our flag is the 12 yellow stars on the azure background. It must be said that there are clear liberal visions for Europe, Prime Minister. And I look forward to you and Denmark's most EU-happy party, the Liberal Party, contesting those views in the election campaign in the running for the 2019 European elections.", "language": "en", "original_language": "da", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 28, "date": "2018-11-28.json", "name": "Guy VERHOFSTADT", "mepid": "97058", "text": "  on behalf of the ALDE Group. – Mr President, I should like to say to Prime Minister Rasmussen, Mr Vistisen tried to tell you what a devil I am and that you are in fact working with the devil at the European level. But let me explain what I think about Europe – it’s not necessary to believe what Mr Vistisen is telling you this morning. In fact I was very pleased that you were talking about your red Volvo. I don’t know, was it a 122 or a 140 or a 240? If it is a 140 or a 240 then it could have been made in Ghent, in Belgium, and that says everything about Europe today. The single market is what you are talking about. It’s a Swedish car, used by a Danish Prime Minister, built in Belgium to go to the Berlin Wall. And that is in fact why I’m so pleased about the way you talked about the future of the European Union. The future of the European Union is not the centralistic nightmare that Mr Vistisen is telling us it is. I am very much pleased by what you have told us today, namely that also Denmark is of the opinion that the worst thing to do today is to throw away the European Union, and that is exactly what didn’t happen in recent years, Mr Vistisen. It’s a pity that Mr Farage is not here, because the first thing Mr Farage told us after Brexit was that the next domino stone to fall would be Denmark. After Brexit we should have seen immediately a Dexit! That is what he was telling us here two years ago, but we have seen exactly the opposite. There was no Dexit, and in today’s Eurobarometer the Danish people are in favour of the European Union; they like the European project. They are still critical towards the European project. I don’t think that every Danish citizen finds that everything is going well – certainly not Mr Vistisen! But anyway they are saying that they are not so stupid as to leave the European Union. Let’s reform the European Union: that is the message of the Danish people as I see it in the Eurobarometer. And I hear this not only in Denmark but in many countries of the European Union when we are talking about the future. What we have to do now, Prime Minister – and this is in opposition to Mr Vistisen who wants everything as a conservative, so nothing will change for him, otherwise he is not a conservative – what we have to do now is to take the lesson of Brexit seriously. Not say ‘oh Brexit, it’s only the UK going out and let’s just go on the same way’. No, take the lessons from Brexit, because the UK leaving the European Union is not an enormous success, it’s a failure of the European Union. So we have to reform the European Union. I want to mention two things. First, the so-called European army, as Angela Merkel called it. I think that Mr Weber has given all the arguments about why we need a foreign policy, why we need a European army – and Mr Vistisen, it has nothing to do with killing NATO – for me a European army is the European pillar of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, and it is absolutely not in opposition to that. But we have to stop the waste of money on defence in Europe: we are spending 40% of what the Americans spend on their army but we are incapable of doing 10% what the American army does. We are spending three times more than the Russians on military defence in Europe – three times more! But I’m not sure, Prime Minister, that if the Russians come over our borders we will be capable of stopping them without American help. My second point concerns the single market. We need the single market to complete it. You are totally right. We have a single market for Belgian chocolates. Very good. We have a single market for French champagne. Good also. We have a single market for German cars. Fine. We have a German market for Danish design. I’m not talking about IKEA now, I am talking about real design, especially in Denmark. But we do not have a single market for the services of the future. We don’t have one for telecom, or for digital, or for the capital markets. That can only be realised when we have a single regulator in Europe. At one time we had one standard for mobile, you might remember, the GSM standard, a European standard. We had champions in Europe, Nokia, Eriksson... And now we don’t have European standards, and among the 200 biggest high-tech companies there are only eight Europeans.

When Denmark comes into the conversation, many good things spring to mind: the global champion of renewable energy, a world leader in development aid, a country that has the guts to confront Russia’s power plays by saying ‘no’ to Nord Stream 2 (and for that thank you), and a country where the social partners are strong and which invented flexicurity as a way to give security to workers and flexibility to employers, and not the other way round. Your country also gave us Margrethe Vestager, the most impressive Competition Commissioner for a very long time, a real liberal fighting rent-extraction, even when it gets in the way of sweetheart deals given by governments to multinationals. Denmark, as a small country like my own, has a lot to offer to the European Union. You had four points. I have only three, but at least we have two in common. Let me start with the ecological and just transition. We share your view that it’s vital for Europe to be a world leader in that transition. We need to ensure that all societies operate within the boundaries that our planet has set for them. We also need to do it in a way that is good for everyone and not just for the happy few like we can see in France. it is an environmental imperative, a social necessity, a geopolitical aspiration, but also  – and you mentioned this – an economic opportunity not to be missed. One could expect Denmark to share in that aspiration towards leadership – and listening to you, I tend to believe this – and we praise you for pushing Europe to the most ambitious standards for instance on CO2 emissions for cars. Thank you for that as well. But your country – and this is a bit surprising – ranks fifth in Europe in terms of carbon footprint by household. If you don’t change political course, the non-renewable part of your energy mix is actually expected to increase, and thus your CO2 emissions would rise and not fall. On the second point, migration, we believe that the European Union should assume its part of the responsibility in facing the asylum and migration challenge. We agree with you when you say that this is a place where more European action is needed. But, under your party’s leadership, Denmark is now joining hands with those who want to make Europe a fortress, slamming its door shut to those in need. When you speak about tackling the root causes of migration, you are only focusing on the smugglers. Not only is your country reducing its development budget, because you claim – and rightly so – that it is 0.7% of GDP, but it used to be 1% of GDP. But it is now increasingly using this development budget to force beneficiary countries to lock their borders and take back migrants who might have escaped. Prime Minister, when people forcibly leave their country, it is because they are fleeing wars, persecution, climate change, natural resource exhaustion or their social and economic conditions. If they turn to smugglers, it is for a lack of safe and legal ways to access safe countries such as ours. Nowadays, the key words of EU asylum and migration policy are pushback and containment. We believe that we should welcome our fair share, while working on the real root causes. Of course Europe cannot solve all the world’s problems. But we can do much more to fight climate change, to have a fairer global economic system, and to promote democracy and the rule of law instead of supporting tyrannies, notably by selling them weapons and buying natural resources extracted with little respect for the local communities. Let me conclude with a point that you didn’t tackle: the euro. Denmark is in the unenviable position of actually not being part of the euro, but having its currency pegged to it. We are disappointed that your country is now joining the camp of the naysayers who deny reality by claiming that the euro is safe and viable just by applying the current rules.  On the contrary, we are convinced that no monetary union is viable without strong financial solidarity, both in the private and public sectors. That means a fiscal union where common taxes fund a common budget and, possibly, basic elements of a common social safety net. It also means a full banking union that eliminates the doom loop between states and their banking systems. And of course financial solidarity comes with responsibility enshrined in rules. But these rules need to be based on sound economic science, which is not always the case – far from it – and protect the general, rather than particular, interests. Indeed, mutual trust is badly affected when these rules are breached. Speaking of which, Mr Prime Minister, such breaches sometimes come from unexpected quarters, like when Danske Bank is exposed as one of the worst money launderers in Europe. Mr Prime Minister, we share your European ambition. I’m not sure that we agree on everything, but I’m glad to see Denmark engaging. I’m sure that we are going to have lively debates because in this – we could hear this, for instance, from Mr Vistisen – we have strikingly different visions about the future of Europe. But you know what? I am confident that next year, during the European elections, those who are committed to discourse in our continent, to keep it as a beacon of peace, human rights, liberty and freedoms will prevail.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "Verts/ALE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Greens and regionalists"}, {"id": 30, "date": "2018-11-28.json", "name": "Dennis de JONG", "mepid": "96748", "text": "  on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. – Mr President, a big welcome to the Danish Prime Minister. I must confess that I have a bit of a weak spot for Denmark, coming from the Netherlands myself. I am thinking not only of the landscape and the windmills – the old ones but especially also the new ones are a good example – but also the people’s character. Danes are pretty stubborn, you can’t tell the Danes what to do and in that they are very much like the Dutch. I mean, they have the same sort of character. I must say that, when you started, Mr Prime Minister, the reactions like ‘the EU has too much power’ or also ‘it is not good for the ordinary citizen’ sound like what I am hearing in my country. At the same time we have the, now famous, 84% of the Danes saying that the EU has brought Denmark advantages. I really am a bit puzzled how you could bring these together. Is the Eurobarometer representative or is your public consultation representative? What is the real opinion in Denmark at the moment? Now, the other particular aspect of Denmark is all its opt—outs. To go through them one-by-one, you have opted out of EU citizenship. I have asked my Danish colleagues what that means – nobody knew – but perhaps it is relevant in the context of Brexit. It would be nice to know if there is a difference between how the rest of Europe will deal with British citizens after Brexit and how Denmark will deal with them, or is this just not a problem? Then, on justice and home affairs you have an opt—out. In 2015, the Danes confirmed that they didn’t want an opt—in, instead of an opt-out. Again, the question of organised crime doesn’t stop at the Danish border. Do you think you will have another referendum shortly on this issue, and what is the general opinion these days on that? Then on the opt—out on defence. It has been mentioned by others, we had a meeting in Copenhagen, hosted by you, of the Liberal prime ministers in Europe. Apparently, the European army was discussed there because at least the Dutch Minister of the Interior said, ‘yes, in the long term we are in favour of a European army’. Is that true? Do you share that opinion or what was the outcome of that meeting, because there’s a lot of confusion about it. You have no euro but are pegged to the euro. I can see that Denmark is not doing so badly at the moment. My question there, again, is there still discussion on the euro? Do you think this is a better solution than being part of the euro yourself and having the euro instead of the Danish crown? Just one or two minutes on the single market. I think that we can safely say that the single market, as such, brings economic benefits, but the point is always: to whom? And if we look at the general situation, then I think workers, employees, are generally of the opinion that the single market works better for employers, for the factor of capital, than for the factor of labour and work. I’m just curious how you see this. If you see the new single market programme of the Commission, the word ‘employee’ doesn’t occur anywhere. So no money for the workers, whereas we also see Commission proposals for mobility of companies. But where is the voice of the workers? If your company, where you have worked for many decades, suddenly goes to another Member State, does the worker have to right to say ‘no, we don’t want that’? Do we give a golden share to the workers for these type of decisions are so important for their daily lives? Also, this morning we had the transport trade unions at our group and I saw a documentary on 200 Filipinos being exploited in Denmark because of the freedom of movement of services. It was completely legal, this works via subsidiaries in Poland which hired Filipinos who are now being used all over Europe, and especially in Denmark. How can we counter that, and make these practices illegal? And how can we counter the fact that, for example, Ukrainians are now working in the Polish construction sector, while Poles are working in the construction sector elsewhere in Europe? That’s not right. So I call for there to be a single market for workers too, what are your views about that?", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 31, "date": "2018-11-28.json", "name": "Laura AGEA", "mepid": "124811", "text": "  Mr President, president, ladies and gentlemen, i.e. the european Union, the European Union and its Member States are Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Prime Minister Rasmussen, Mr Dombrovskis, this is another of the many debates we have on the future of Europe. We obviously appreciate this comparison, we really appreciate it. But we should be equally honest and we should tell each other and admit that the European Union is going through a period of extreme difficulty, a difficulty that concerns its citizens; I imagine it also partly affects your citizens, Minister. Above all, it concerns institutions that are neither in excellent health nor in good health, and we must ask ourselves what is really the cause of this unfortunate situation.  Citizens are in great difficulty. Of course, the choices that this Europe has made in recent years – and above all the choices made by the European institutions – have really done irreparable damage to the citizens and to the social fabric of this Europe. These are years of austerity policies and years of austerity that have caused disasters in the social fabric; economic and fiscal policies have brought not only citizens to their knees, but also wrong businesses and economic policies do harm and injustice.  Every now and then I follow the questions we ask ourselves, my fellow Members, the professors who wonder why there is so much disaffection on the part of the citizens towards the institutions; we ask ourselves questions, we ask ourselves questions, we even commission studies to understand what we do not like in this Europe. In fact, the truth is before our eyes: it is a pity that we have forgotten to confront each other and to talk constantly with the citizens.  We are there and you, above all, have locked yourself in these golden cages, in these golden palaces and do not confront reality; do not talk to the citizens, because the citizens would be able to tell you what difficulties they face, what are the problems and sufferings that they are experiencing today. It is as if you had locked yourself in a glass bell, in which the words of the citizens do not arrive, but in the States and in our society they are experiencing situations of great difficulty and we should return to talk to them constantly.  The citizens want substantial, immediate and radical change, and I am following the example of my country, Italy. We are trying to radically change the reality of our country with reforms that are really made for the citizens, because the agenda of governments must not be dictated either by austerity, by budgetary rules, by taxation or by treaties. The agenda of governments must be dictated by the needs, needs and suffering of citizens, and we are trying to achieve citizenship income.  I believe that in all the countries you are well aware of this measure, a measure that you already have except Italy, which still does not have it because there has been no way of achieving it. A measure of dignity that will enable citizens to live in decent conditions and return to work, as well as young people – and this is a fundamental measure. We are trying to reform pensions: Europe really imposed on us the pension reform that was carried out by the previous government in a substantial and care-scathing way with devastating results for all citizens and in the Italian social fabric. We created the \"exodated\", we really created a chasm and a social disaster.  Today we are trying to get to work on this reform, imposed by Europe and carried out in a prone way by the previous government, but which, among other things, has been sent home precisely on the basis of the evil reforms that it has made in recent years and we are trying to give dignity with the reform of pensions. We have set up a fund for bank fraudsters, because previous governments, with citizens' money, are saving private banks and there are citizens who have been left on the streets: they have seen their current accounts wiped out; Today we must work to be able to support the citizens who have been cheated. We are sure that these are changes that will be accepted because only through these substantial changes will Europe be able to restart and rebuild its foundations.  We believe deeply in Europe and we want to remain in Europe, but on sustainable and substantial terms, changed for our citizens. We want a Union that is not only in name but also in fact: a Union that takes root in the needs and needs of its citizens. We welcomed, for example, yesterday's vote to 'no' to the inclusion of the fiscal compact in the Treaties: it is essential. This is a bad agreement and the fact that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has said such an uncompromising no – and we are very much in favour of this step – is proof of this. how austerity policies are failing and we need to reverse course.  I believe that this is the change that the citizens are asking us for: they are asking for it in Italy, they are asking for it here in Europe and, of course, they will be asking for it in a few months' time with the vote of the European elections. Surely a wind of change, which is blowing not only in Italy but also in Europe, will bring substantial changes next year and perhaps, then, next year it will also be much more interesting to sit here and talk about the future of Europe, when there are different conditions, a different basis, made up of real needs and a political agenda and really reforms dictated on the basis of the needs and needs of citizens.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 32, "date": "2018-11-28.json", "name": "Nicolas BAY", "mepid": "124760", "text": "  on behalf of the ENF group. Mr Prime Minister, your country joined the European Community in 1973, at the same time as the United Kingdom. Like the British, the Danes were able to assert their uniqueness from the outset. Indeed, your country has negotiated a number of opt-outs, i.e. exceptions to European law. When other leaders delivered their country's feet and fists linked to the European Commission, your predecessors were able to preserve whole swathes of your sovereignty, that is, your freedom according to your interests. Thus have you not adhered to the area of freedom, security and justice, the flattering and pompous name of the European asylum system. You have also not joined, and you are the only Member State in this case, in the PSDC, the common security and defence policy. You also got an option to withdraw in the negotiations on the Maastricht Treaty, which transformed the European Community into the European Union. So you have not joined the Economic and Monetary Union and you are still using the Danish krone and not the euro. Close to Sweden, culturally but also and firstly geographically, you have not made the same mistakes as your neighbour when it comes to migration policy. By connecting you to Sweden, the bridge built between Copenhagen and Malmo has no doubt helped to keep you away from your neighbour, at least from its so-called model of integration of immigrant communities. Malmo, the Molenbeek of Scandinavia, where almost half of the population is of immigrant origin; Malmo, where crime has skyrocketed, from petty crime to big banditry; Malmo, which regularly suffers riots of the kind that France experienced in 2005. Your government has taken drastic measures to prevent such disintegration of Danish society. You yourself have denounced the emergence of law-free zones and, I quote, 'Muslim parallel societies'. In September, you again called for the strengthening of external borders, even though you have already re-established effective control of internal borders. In October, your Minister of Immigration and Integration announced that Denmark would not accept any more refugees until further notice. However, after this flattering portrait, let me tell you that there is still something rotten in the Kingdom of Denmark. Far from me, of course, the idea of offending your country, of which I have just praised. But by this phrase of Shakespeare, which has become proverbial in the language of Molière, I would like to point out a form of schizophrenia. Despite all these measures which place you, in many respects, almost to the right of Viktor Orban, you still belong to Mr Verhofstadt's liberal federalist group and you are full of praise for Mrs Merkel and for Mr Macron. Mr Macron is an ultraliberal and, at the same time, to use his fetish formula, a follower of tax racketeering. Yes, it burdens the French with new taxes, even though France is already one of the most taxed - or overtaxed - countries in Europe. It is the same Mr Macron who is spending billions on a migration policy that is diametrically opposed to yours. While your country is not part of the PSDC, you have surprisingly supported the macronian idea of a European army. Would you be prepared, Prime Minister, to place Danish soldiers under the direct orders of Mr Juncker or the successor? Personally, I do not want French soldiers to shed their blood on the orders of unelected bureaucrats without legitimacy from the European Commission. Finally, just yesterday, in the Danish Parliament, you said that Denmark would benefit from the UN Global Pact on Migration. Yet this pact is immigrationist, it is rejected by the United States, Australia, Israel, Austria, Hungary, Poland, Bulgaria, Switzerland, Croatia and probably many others. Today, the future of Europe, the subject of our debate, is being played out in Budapest, Rome and Warsaw. The tandem between Mr Macron and Mrs Merkel, who represents federalism and immigrationism, is already a thing of the past.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 33, "date": "2018-11-28.json", "name": "Lampros FOUNTOULIS", "mepid": "125070", "text": "   Mr President, Prime Minister, our debate today concerns the future of Europe.

In reality, however, the Union is at the beginning of a much larger crisis, and that is because the Union's hegemonic elites are unable - or do not want - to understand the enormous distance between their own priorities and those of the European peoples. This new crisis will be a political crisis, but I hope it will bring to power forces that express the will of the people and not of multinational corporations.

It is not easy to respond because you brought many issues to the table. First of all, I would like to thank the Vice-President of the Commission for your very kind comments about the Danish society model, flexicurity, etc. I think that is in response to some remarks given by good colleagues here, that is one of the reasons – because you asked me, which is right, the Eurobarometer or the people’s consultations – I think that’s probably the secret why the Danes are still so open-minded towards this idea of European cooperation and the single market, it is due to our social model. The fact that we, perhaps better than many other countries, have managed to redistribute what we have achieved from being a part of this more and more global economy. I think that should be a lesson learned, but not necessarily something we should then reinvent in a European context because countries are different. But it should be something that should inspire each of the 28 – unfortunately soon 27 – member countries to look inwards. How can we secure sound fiscal policy? How can we introduce flexicurity? How can we strike a balance between high taxation and at the same time citizens’ freedom to choose within services provided to the public, etc. I think that’s exactly why both figures are right. The Danes are reluctant in certain aspects and are pragmatic and not as warm-blooded as perhaps you will find in other countries, and that is why political leaders will not make speeches like my good friend Guy, but at the same time, they share these values. That is, I think, an important point to make. Now, if you will excuse me, I will turn to my mother tongue in order to respond to some of the Danes present here today. Og det står lidt i kontrast, hr. Vistisen og hr. Kofoed, når man ligesom portrætterer det billede af den danske regering. Der blev sagt, at der skulle gå 1200-et-eller-andet dage, før jeg bragte temaerne omkring mere fairness i den frie bevægelighed op i Europa Parlamentet, og det er jo rigtigt i den forstand, at det er første gang, jeg optræder i Europa Parlamentet. Jeg har jo heller ikke været inviteret før, jeg er ikke medlem, så jeg har jo ikke rigtig haft mulighed for at komme lige her før. Men det er jo ikke et rigtigt billede at tegne, at der ikke har været arbejdet med den sag, og hele denne sag handler jo altså om, hvordan vi – inden for visionen om den frie bevægelighed – sikrer, at befolkningen føler rimelighed, og at vi undgår løntrykkeri, social dumping, noget af det vi har set på den dansk-tyske grænse. Det har der været arbejdet med, og det er jo rigtigt, hr. Vistisen, at vi jo ikke har haft den store succes. Jeg var selv glad ved, at vi op til den britiske folkeafstemning jo rent faktisk begyndte at nå nogle resultater. For under indtryk af en britisk folkeafstemning om brexit eller remain lykkedes det jo faktisk i Rådet at lave et kompromis, som betød – under den forudsætning, at briterne stemte remain – at nogle af de danske prioriteter, f. eks omkring indekseringen af børnechecken, kunne sættes igennem. Det er jo sådan set bare en ekstra grund til at beklage udkommet af den britiske folkeafstemning, og jeg bliver nødt til at sige, også i dette rum, at vi kommer til at genbesøge nogle af disse spørgsmål. Og det bør vi jo gøre allerede i forbindelse med forordning 883, hvor jeg har noteret mig, at der nu er opbakning her i Parlamentet til, at der kommer en generaldebat i Parlamentet om den forordning. For vi skal finde de balancer, der gør, at vores befolkninger stadigvæk omfavner den frie bevægelighed. Og det gør de ikke, hvis man optjener retten til dagpenge allerede efter én dag. Det gør de ikke, hvis man kan hjemsende en børnecheck, der modsvarer mere end en månedsløn, til børn, der bor i et andet land, hvor leveomkostningerne er langt lavere end i f.eks Danmark. Og her er der en kæmpe opgave for Parlamentet, som jeg håber, man vil gribe ud efter. Jeg har jo lyttet nok til debatten allerede nu til at kunne konstatere, at der jo ikke i Parlamentet er konsensus om alting, men der ligger en vigtig opgave for Parlamentet her.  Så kunne jeg godt have lyst til at sige en bemærkning omkring de spørgsmål og kommentarer, der har været rejst fra forskellige sider, om en europæisk hær, den nye sikkerhedspolitisk situation, etc.  We are living in a different security situation, that goes without saying: a more aggressive Putin to the East – and I totally share what the Vice-President said about Russia’s aggression in Ukraine – but it’s not only about Russia, it’s also about what we experience in the Middle East, in Turkey, a US President who is not as engaged in world policy as one perhaps could wish, and we have to respond to this. But we have to respond to this in a clever way, and introducing this vision of a European army as something very operational, something that is kind of in competition with NATO, that’s not, at least in my opinion, the right way to respond. We need to uphold this strong transatlantic defence cooperation. With the UK leaving the European Union, I think the rest of us together will represent less than 20% of NATO’s total capacity. So the idea that we should, among ourselves, be able to do something which can compete with the NATO alliance, that’s not a good idea, but that’s not what is proposed either. So I think we should be careful in the way we use words. My perspective is that it is absolutely necessary that Europe steps up – it’s about spending but it’s also about closer cooperation. But by doing so we have to be sure that we do not duplicate capacity that already exists in the NATO framework. So we should stick to the idea of added value, and that’s not a European army in the sense that I think people will interpret the idea if you just say ‘a European army’. It’s all about closer cooperation in the defence industry, it’s about closer cooperation when we, for instance, go in and stabilise things after wars in neighbouring countries. And the reason why I have called for a debate in Denmark about this defence opt-out is exactly this. We are known as a country who always participates and steps up. This is the case for aid: we haven’t reduced our aid actually, due to the growth in our economy our aid budget is increasing year on year. We are always ready to contribute soldiers to the NATO framework, and if we develop in the future a different division of labour between NATO and Europe, then it will be from my perspective a disaster if Danish soldiers wearing a NATO cap can do the tough missions but then if we turn the tough missions into soft missions and stabilise nations – talking about nation-building within the European framework – then Danish soldiers have to return home. That’s exactly why I raised this debate about a possible referendum sometime in the future about this defence opt-out. Not joining a European army under the leadership of Juncker, as was said, but a stronger cooperation between national defence capacities within the European Union. Given the time, I think I should bring this to a conclusion and just respond perhaps to one very concrete question about the Nord Stream, which is in my eyes, or in my opinion, linked to this discussion about the new security situation in Europe. And that’s why I have been asking again and again and again – and I really hope that the Parliament will give a big push towards this – for us to discuss this infrastructure project at a European level, because it is definitely a project which comes with some geopolitical implications as well. And honestly speaking, I must say that I think it shouldn’t be up to Denmark, squeezed in between countries who have already given a clear ‘yes’ to this line, to take the final decision. So what we need is a European answer to that challenge. I think I will limit myself to these short comments and I’m looking forward to this catch-the-eye element.

Instead of telling people that when they've come here and been here for a while, and the kids are here and so on, they can have a life. Children can have a life.

The EU has tried to stamp the jackboot down on Britain with this recent so-called Brexit deal for democratically daring to leave. An attempted enslavement of the very nation that fought the Nazis and liberated Europe. The EU is supposed to be about government by consent, not force. I asked the Parliament when we voted on an arrangement for Lake Lugano’s Italian-Swiss border why the same arrangement could not be made for Northern Ireland. No answer. Well it is because the EU are using the tragedy of Ulster as a bargaining chip. Well that’s not government by consent with friends. In reality, I tried in vain to explain to Mr Barnier that the UK constitution explicitly forbids one Parliament binding another. The deal must be fair to stick. Well, he obviously hasn’t got that message through – obviously I got it wrong. When the Brexit deal fails in the UK Parliament and we have a World Trade Organisation deal, a totally liberated UK economy will take on a command economy – Europe – and we will win. We will see that happen. A potentially despotic EU army controlled by unelected bureaucrats, more EU isolationism and regulation. Crazy immigration, a false currency, mass unemployment as you isolate your greatest trading partner, London, the financial centre of the world with which you can never compete. The future of Europe is one of a division like the Berlin Wall. On one side we will have those countries outside the EU, particularly in the Anglosphere and its free enterprise, which will prosper and grow as it always has. On the other side will be a command economy – the EU. Once again plunged into poverty, darkness and held back from real progress like the Soviet Union. It is the EU folly, along with the absence of a proper relationship which will cause Europe to collapse. We should try to part amicably as friends.

But four points of fix are not resolved if we want to build support for European cooperation. It requires coherence in defence and security policy, common tax base, so that we can put an end to all the cheating that is going on in the financial sector, common migration rules – what is the government doing to unblock the situation that is in the Council at the moment when things are locked into the asylum package? It also requires social equality, a certain social equality if we are to have support for freedom of movement.

Mr President! Thank you so much for the many comments, the many questions, many of them from Danish committed Members of the European Parliament. I shall try to answer as much as possible.  In relation to the green transition, Bendt Bendtsen has mentioned – and I think that is wise – that you should also reach for the low hanging fruits, and they are of course to get hold of. And there is no doubt that greater efforts towards energy efficiency and energy refurbishment are part of it. There is therefore much that can be done if all Europeans washed at 10 degrees lower than what we normally do, then it corresponds to the total capacity of all German a-power stations – that is, if we washed at 30 degrees instead of 40 degrees – and similarly, in the case of energy renovation, similar calculations can be made. It just goes to show that we have to use all the instruments in the green transition, and what you are pointing to, Bendt, is one of them.  Then I would like to say to Grapini, who creates an image that I should be against, that people who work in Denmark, for example, do not have the same rights as Danes who work in Denmark. It's not. what I say! It is clear that if you come to Denmark and you have your children with you, you must be able to work and live under the same conditions as all sorts of others. I am talking about the fact that you do not have your children with you and where the Danish children's cheque, which is thus intended to cover the costs of having children in Danish society, is sent to other countries where the cost of living is much lower and the money therefore goes further. That is the situation I am talking about.  Grapini also asked about my views on MFF, and it could be a very long lecture. I would just like to say quite briefly that under a reasonable framework, 1% of GNP, which will be an increasing budget, given that there is growth in Europe, our priorities will be to invest in new areas. It is, among other things, development, research, innovation, but it is also – to make a point on the very last question from the Finnish MEP – a more holistic effort in relation to the whole challenge of migration in all forms, and several have mentioned it: Margrethe Auken has mentioned it, Jens Rohde suggests it, several others have mentioned it. And I think the time has come when we need to talk about these things in a context and be a little clear when we talk about these things. For there is an extreme difference between a young African who, quite naturally, one might say, seeks happiness in a prosperous Europe in order to improve his life situation, and so the individual persecuted, who is genuinely on the run, versus the internal movement in Europe in a labour market. And there is a tendency in the debate – possibly not here, but then elsewhere where I participate in the debate – to mix it all together in a big bulb ouster.  I am a staunch supporter of freedom of movement in Europe. Denmark will not be able to function unless we had the privilege of drawing on labour that comes from elsewhere. Sometimes there are also some problems. I am very much in favour of us taking action in relation to and combat, in relation to and safeguarding people who are on the run. That is why I am proud to come from a country where we, like only a handful of countries around the world, are increasing the UN target of 0.7 in development aid. That is why we need to develop – and Mr Rohde is asking what we are going to do in the Council – we need to develop a comprehensive strategy that is not just about protecting the external borders, which is not just about making development aid in Africa, which is not just about supporting a truly free market economy in Africa. with the potential to develop, in a reflection of Europe, an African internal market. But it can't just be about that. It's got to be about everything at once, and that's the only way we get everyone on board. That is also why I have the view, in relation to Mr Morten Helveg and others who have raised the issue of reallocation and solidarity, that we have to work on a basis of reality, and the reality is that it is not possible to reform the Dublin system based on compulsory reallocation. That is not to say, it will not, it will divide Europe. And then, on the basis of pragmatically, we will have to discuss what we are putting in place. What can be put in place is, after all, another form of committed solidarity, which is not just about welcoming people on the run, but which is about and making a different contribution in a different way elsewhere. Because if we do not get any progress in the development of this concept, which is both about protecting Europe and reaching out to Africa, and which is also about ensuring temporary access to the people who are temporarily fleeing something, an opportunity and return, then we will not have to deal with the overall challenge, which is huge, huge, and perhaps in fact the greatest we face.  I must say to Ronja about referendum and democracy: Danish participation in the European Union is based on not just one but several referenda. After the Danish people's 'no' vote on Maastricht, a national compromise was then reached in Denmark, which was also put to a referendum, and that is where our reservations rest. And it goes without saying that if the conditions on which the Danes have agreed in the Maastricht Treaty are to be changed, then of course a referendum is needed. However, this cannot be edenth to the view that any adjustment to cooperation, which is not covered by the Danish opt-outs, would require a referendum. I do not subscribe to the view that we should have this year's referendum to decide whether we still want to be part of it. I also say this as a remark to Hekel and the reflections on a new deal, if and if a decision is not reached in the British House of Commons to support the agreement that has been reached, and Denmark should bid in here and say that we will just find another solution. In my reading of it, the agreement that Theresa May has reached is to compare with what we did in Denmark when the Danes back around Maastricht said no to Maastricht, namely that we defined our national bid for the circumstances under which we can then have a relationship. We went to a referendum on that and we won that and it will not be a viable path if it is to be renegotiated successively. So I think I have to say that I am in line with Juncker and all colleagues in the Council who have said that now there has been a long complicated process in which every comma in a very, very complicated agreement has been reversed. It is like the construction that is on the table, and that is the one that has to be decided.  I would like to conclude by saying, perhaps, when the Lithuanian MEMBER asks me how I would look at things, from, for example, a Lithuanian perspective, in the light of the fact that there are differences in living standards. And it is also an answer to Christel Schaldemose and others who have touched on the issue of freedom of movement and the fairness of things – Jens Rohde also, Mr. Morten Lykkegaard also. Basically, as a precondition for freedom of movement, it is a question of making sure that when you move somewhere else, you are acting on the same terms, under the same conditions as those that were already there – that is, when we talk about pay and employment. If you look at Denmark as a showcase here, you have to say that where we are challenged is not where people move into Denmark for shorter or longer and say, \"I'm taking a job here\". If we look at their level of coverage collectively, it is almost on a par with the Danes in general, that is not where the problems arise. Problems occur in relation to service, problems occur in relation to transport. And the problems we've seen lately are just the link to it. We have to do something about that and do something about it, and we have to attack that in concrete terms, and parliament also has a job to do here. After all, it is a question of guarding against the fact that you can use mailbox companies to win some rights to cross borders in reality. It's about making some demands on what pay conditions you can drive around. It is about making sure that there are not many exceptions to the general services directive in relation to the transport sector. It is, of course, a very practical piece of work that needs to be done and on which we must work together if we are to secure the support of the people. Because my own reading of the Danish people is that it is not against freedom of movement, it is against situations where people find that, under the guise of freedom of movement, people are in fact being offered wages and conditions that we would not agree to take on our own bodies. That is what it is all about, and it is a piece of practical work that needs to be done.  Then I think I will just finish by saying thank you to Jens Rohde for the nice words. And then perhaps one thing about the UN paper, the global migration pact, which is not a treaty and is not a Marrakesh treaty, but which is a UN paper which will then be discussed in Marrakesh. And I just want to try and put it into context to finish on. There is no point in introducing international cooperation, where the standard will be that of participation only if everyone thinks the same as oneself. And that is a bit of a shadow that I think is being cast into the European landscape, at least in a trend, and which you also see. at a few of the speeches here today. We want it the way we want it, or we don't want to be part of it. This is against the whole concept, and I am, of course, talking into a topical Danish debate, but I am also speaking into a European debate. The European Union is a dream, but it is also a reality, something we must deal with in practical terms. And there is no point in dividing us into the camps where we either have to praise the whole project with all its glories, because otherwise you are probably not a true European and you have to criticise everything. We need to take a balanced approach to it, that when we talk about cross-border problems and about lifting European prosperity, even in a global competition that is becoming sharper and sharper with an increasingly self-aware China, with a United States that turns its back to itself to some extent, then cooperation is needed! And there we all have an obligation to get that dialogue going with our citizens, where we say – because I think we all understand it – that if everything is going to be our own solution, then there will be nothing to cooperate on. That is the heavy task, and it is also where I think – and i would therefore like to thank you for coming here today – that the whole idea of trying to launch a European debate with Europeans at national level and anchored in this House has something to do. It is not done with it, we must also deliver on the specific content, but we need to start where we are told that there is no alternative to cooperation, other than that we turn into ourselves and slide backwards in terms of prosperity, etc. And with those words, I would like to thank you very much, Mr President, for having to be here today.", "language": "en", "original_language": "da", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "S&D", "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 52, "date": "2018-11-28.json", "name": "Antonio TAJANI", "mepid": "2187", "text": "  Thank you very much, Prime Minister Rasmussen.

European citizens enjoy freedom of movement in the biggest single market in the world, education opportunities under the Erasmus programme; and solidarity in times of crisis. Nevertheless, the unity of our union is put into question. I believe we need to learn to live in this new environment, where the European idea will be under attack and it will need to compete with other less liberal and less globalist ideas for the future of the European continent.

This autumn there has been a money laundering scandal at Danske Bank in Denmark. Up to EUR 200 billion worth of money was laud in the Estonian unit of the Danish bank. The first tip on criminal activity came from the Central Bank of Russia as early as 2007, but it was allowed to continue for years to come. No one was willing to intervene in criminal activity and there was total failure to monitor money laundering.  The whistleblower of the case, The Briton Howard Wilkinson, appeared before parliament's Special Committee on Financial Crimes, Tax Fraud and Tax Avoidance at the end of November. According to the evidence provided by Mr Wilkinson, the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority has deliberately turned a blind eye to the problems and even felt obliged to help the bank in its home country in its difficult situation. It is certainly not the supervisory authority's job to help the bank in its own country, but to monitor it. If the information provided by Mr Wilkinson is correct, the activities of the Financial Supervisory Authority appear to be unskilled, if not corrupt.  The fight against money laundering, the activities of public authorities and the exchange of information between countries must be stepped up. Hopefully, Prime Minister Rasmussen and his colleagues will do everything in their power to ensure that this does not happen again in any EU country.

The policies put in place will go a long way even after 2030, but they will only bring us to emission reductions of around 60% by 2050, and this is not sufficient for the EU to contribute to the Paris Agreement temperature goals. Climate change is already impacting on the European Union. We had extreme heat waves in four of the last five years and this summer temperatures in the Arctic Circle were five degrees higher than normal. Central Europe was so dry that the Rhine was in places too shallow for inland navigation. And this is just the beginning: a planet with a climate that’s out of control would not be a safe and prosperous home, and we have to act. Today we are therefore looking further ahead towards 2050 and towards a climate-neutral Europe, not only to contribute but to lead on the Paris goals. The Commission is responding to a call by this Parliament from last October which was renewed last month. In March the European Council also called on the Commission to present a long-term strategy by the first quarter of 2019, taking into account national plans. Parliament called for an ambitious mid-century zero emission strategy for the EU, providing a cost-efficient pathway towards a net zero carbon economy in the Union by 2050 at the latest. The Commission has taken up this challenge and we are starting from a good basis: we have reduced emissions by 22% while our economy grew by 58% since 1990 and this was accomplished by investing in clean energies, energy efficiency, innovation and cleaner transport. We have seen that this not only produces benefits for the environment and therefore for the citizens, but that it also creates growth and jobs. Four million green jobs already exist in the European Union. Under this Commission we have learned how to better integrate climate, energy, transport and other policies into the energy union and we are the world leader in designing coherent policies that drive investment, and investment that delivers results. The strategy we are presenting today builds on this comprehensive approach. The strategy looks at all the key economic sectors, at innovation, finance, agriculture, the circular economy, trade... in short, how to make climate neutrality a cornerstone of a modern European economy fit for the 21st Century that will leave the planet clean. Climate neutrality in 2050 will require additional investment – EUR 175 to 290 billion a year – but it will drastically reduce our bill for fossil fuel imports, which today is EUR 266 billion a year. The mathematics are clear, instead of paying to burn fuels that pollute our climate and our air, we can invest in cleaner and modern European industries that provide good local jobs. I’m particularly proud of one aspect. It’s a strategy that makes sure that we do not leave any Europeans or any regions behind. It analyses which sectors will benefit, which will transform and which will lose out, and it looks into how to mitigate these losses, especially through upskilling for higher quality jobs, and it has European solidarity at its core. Honourable Members, there are many strong reasons to put forward the long-term strategy now: global commitments, economic rationale, but also a key political reason. More and more people are asking in the run-up to the European elections about the future of Europe. There is widespread public support for climate action and actually widespread optimism: 85% of Europeans agree that fighting climate change and using energy more efficiently can create economic growth and jobs in Europe, and I am one of them.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 2, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "PPE", "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 58, "date": "2018-11-28.json", "name": "Miguel ARIAS CAÑETE", "mepid": "1351", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, the long-term strategy adopted by the Commission today spells out a clear vision for the European Union climate and energy policy, one that can lead to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, through a socially fair transition in a cost-efficient manner. The strategy is meant to set the direction of travel for European Union climate efforts and to frame the European Union contribution to achieving the Paris Agreement goals. In Paris, the world committed to keeping the global temperature rise to well below 2°C and to pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5°C, and thanks to the support of the European Parliament, the European Union has adopted all the legislation needed to meet our Paris commitment, and in fact in doing so we have de facto increased the level of ambition to some -45%, and the role of the Parliament was instrumental in this process. We should now follow through and start preparing the next step, looking at the 2050 perspective. The difference between 1.5°C and 2°C is considerable, and the IPCC Special Report presented this year provides a clear signal. If we are to avoid the more disastrous impact of climate change we should seek to limit it to 1.5°C. The IPCC report also told us what we have to do collectively to limit climate change. The world will have to go to net zero greenhouse emissions in the second half of the century, but if the aim is to pursue 1.5° this goal needs to be reached at global level by 2070. The European Union should lead in this transformation, demonstrating to others that the transition to net zero greenhouse gas emissions is possible and opens up many opportunities, and this is what the Commission is doing today. With this strategy, the European Union would become the first major economy to be climate neutral. If we succeed, others will follow. If we do not lead, nobody else will, and if nobody else acts unrestrained climate change will severely impact Europe and rest of the world. The Commission proposal is based on a detailed assessment looking at the possibilities for economic and social transformation that deliver such decarbonisation pathways. Some pathways are looking at reductions going to 80% by 2050, while others look into pathways leading to net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The results clearly point to a comprehensive vision with seven key strategic building blocks that will be required to achieve a net zero greenhouse gas economy by 2050. First, energy efficiency plays a central role. In the future our economy will grow but we need to prepare for reducing energy consumption by as much as a half compared to 2005. Energy efficiency is central to continue reducing emissions from industry but equally in the housing sectors. Second, we need to advance the deployment of renewables. By 2050 more than 80% of electricity will be coming from renewable energy sources and these will have beneficial effects on our security of energy supply and deliver cumulative savings on our import bill of between EUR 2 and 3 trillion over the period 2031-2050. There will also be additional benefits due to the reduced fugitive emissions of fossil fuels used in the energy sector and in this context, the Commission is looking into policy options for addressing methane emissions. A central tenet here is the electrification of our energy system, at least doubling its share in final energy demand by 2050 and with electricity generated by renewable sources, spreading to more uses such as heating and transport. Thirdly, we have to embrace a clean mobility system. The automotive industry already invested in this new future and electrification is a promising option but some transport modes will not be able to electrify. For them alternatives in the form of advanced biofuels and e-fuels would need to be applied. And it’s not only the vehicle or the fuel that can change. With 75% of our population living in urban areas, cities are breeding grounds for new solutions and we already see movement towards smart urban planning and traffic management. These, together with clean public transport, have the potential to reduce emissions and improve the quality of life. Our industry is already one of the most efficient globally, but the transformation will converge with the need for modernising industrial assets. Steel, cement and chemicals dominate industrial emissions and in the next 10 to 15 years technologies already known in these sectors will need to be demonstrated at a scale to facilitate investment in clean and competitive industrial installations. Electrification, hydrogen, biomass and synthetic fuels are part of the solution. The transformation will require an adequate smart network infrastructure and interconnections and we need also to harmonise the potential of the bio-economy while preserving our carbon sinks. European Union agriculture and forestry will continue to provide food, feed and fibres as well reduce emissions. Continued efficiency improvements, better fertiliser application and nutrient management, and healthy animal stocks will benefit both farmers and the climate. Agriculture and forestry will contribute also to decarbonising other sectors and EU forests will play a central role in providing biomass. The transition of our economy will always have to be careful of how to make best use of scarce land and other natural resources. And finally, we need to look into how to tackle with carbon capture and storage those CO2 emissions which we cannot otherwise reduce. Thanks to the rapid deployment of renewable energy this is no longer the silver bullet to decarbonising. Still, CCS has a crucial role to close the circle for a net-zero economy, notably for energy intensive industries. If combined with sustainable biomass it could create negative emissions, helping to compensate for remaining emissions in our economy. While by no means easy, these options, if deployed together, can make our path towards net-zero greenhouse gas emissions a reality. But to achieve this vision we will need additional investment of around 0.8% of our GDP. But this can also benefit our GDP by up to 2% by 2050. This transformation will also save on health costs, with estimated reductions in premature death of more than 40% and health damage reduced by around EUR 200 billion per year. The European Union climate policy relies on global cooperation and next week’s Conference of the Parties – COP 24 – is decisive for the future of the Paris Agreement. In Katowice the European Union has a good story to tell. We have adopted all the legislation needed for implementing our Paris contribution and our 2030 targets are projected to reduce greenhouse emissions by around 45% by 2030, which is the starting point for long-term planning. With the strategic vision that we adopted today we can also show our partners that we have started preparing for a climate-neutral economy fully in line with the Paris Agreement. It demonstrates our determination to shape together the best future for our planet, and this should inspire others to follow. In the months ahead our proposals and different pathways should be studied in detail to understand how the European Union can best achieve a net-zero greenhouse gas emission economy in 2050 in a cost-effective way. We look forward to engaging with you, the European Parliament, Member States, national parliaments, business, NGOs, cities, communities and our citizens on the EU’s long-term ambition and its contribution to the Paris Agreement. Whatever the outcome of this debate, the European Union objective needs broad and deep endorsement, not only by our decision-makers, by our legislators, but also by all stakeholders and citizens. These debates and discussions should allow the European Union to adopt and submit an ambitious and broadly supported long-term strategy by 2020 to the UNFCCC.

I quote Mr Šefčovič, ‘our strategy now shows that by 2050 it’s realistic to make Europe both climate neutral and prosperous, while leaving no European and no region behind’ – it’s beautiful – and Mr Arias Cañete, ‘going climate neutral is necessary, possible and in Europe’s interest’. It’s a beautiful press release, so I was eager to read it. I’m a bit confused now because, at the end of the document, you conclude, ‘well, you know, the EU should adopt and submit an ambitious strategy by early 2020 to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), as requested under the Paris agreement’, so our mid—century strategy for this beautiful scenario will be published sometime in early 2020. Now I’m really confused. I thought we were doing that here. This is just eight scenarios on the table and, more importantly, it’s avoiding one of the key questions: what are we going to do by 2030? If you are sketching a beautiful scenario out there that we should do it for everything – for people, for the economy, for the environment – so we are creating a heaven on earth, but we wait until 2030 before we take additional action, it doesn’t make sense economically. Environmentally it doesn’t make sense because the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was very clear: we need early action to meet the 1.5 degrees goal. 2030 is not early action and for Katowice, it doesn’t make sense because everyone will watch Europe. Are you going to raise ambition before 2030? There is a gap in reaching the Paris commitments.

Secondly, to ensure that this target is actually achieved and that we don’t miss it, has the Commission considered any pathways looking at reaching carbon neutrality already by 2040?

It also means a huge effort for the Member States to achieve climate neutrality, so far CO2 emissions have only been reduced by a fifth. Even if the measures recently adopted at EU level, such as the expansion of renewable energy, the increase in energy efficiency and the reform of emissions trading, were implemented, emissions would be reduced by 60% by 2050.

It is an important signal – and it is – if it is the first Paris signatory to set itself a precise target for a net-zero economy by 2050. In fact, the effects of climate instability, which science has been planning for some time, are now daily news stories, outlining what is our new daily life. Furthermore, I am pleased to note a change of pace, including terminology, since the title of the communication already mentions not the word 'growth' but the word 'prosperity': words are important, in addition to content.  However, to avoid more disastrous effects, we know that a deeper paradigm shift is needed. We have entered an era of enormous challenges, where the neoliberal market-based economy is not always able to manage our future any more. To overcome these challenges, we need highly expansionary economic policies and overcoming austerity, finally paying attention to the budget of natural capital and not only to the financial balance sheets that have lost sight of what is thermodynamic balance, which regulates the economy and our existence on Earth, thus paying attention to what is the so-called ecological spread.  At the same time, it is ineffective to think of leadership in the fight against climate change without considering the effect of trade; products are not subject to an analysis of the carbon emitted by the relocation of the products we import: there is therefore an urgent need for a carbon tax at the European border and, possibly, a reform of the WTO in this regard.  Moreover, in order to be responsible and aware leaders, we cannot neglect the needs of developing countries: we live on the same planet! We must prevent them from making the wrong choices that we made in the last century, and we must therefore allow not only people, but above all knowledge, to flow freely.

We started with our European economy, on the importance of social inclusion and the need for more advanced technology to use to power this transformation. Before I start, I really would like to thank the honourable Members for what I feel was broad support for our approach and for seeing this importance in the same way as we do. I absolutely agree with honourable Member Gerbrandy that what we started under the Energy Union is the deepest transformation of our energy systems since they were built in Europe one hundred years ago. I would like to assure Ms Rivasi and Mr Eickhout that climate change is a top priority for this Commission and I am ready to say that no other Commission in the history of the European Union did more to tackle climate change than this one, and it was in close cooperation with this House, the European Parliament.  Looking at the parameters, at the pace and milestones – and here I am sure that my colleague, Commissioner Miguel Arias Cañete, will explain the calendar and the timelines of our efforts – it is very important to have public support and to have people on board. Therefore, the issues like energy poverty and the need for upskilling for those who might lose their job because of this energy transformation are so important. Therefore, we started close cooperation with the co-regions in the transition, where we already have seven countries working with us and we will have our first annual assessment already this Friday and, yes, already in Katowice, just to show that we care, we have the solution and we have to offer these people a new, brighter, cleaner economic future.  When it comes to technologies, as you will see from our strategy, we’ve been looking at all aspects of the technologies and some of them would need help through our research and innovation programmes, would need help through our eligible Important Projects of Common European Interest (IPCEI) state aid programmes, like we do for batteries. Of course, we need to de-risk some of the financing for these cutting-edge new technologies, but it is very important, because what I see in the world of batteries is that if we hadn’t started at European level a year ago, we would really have risked being behind our competitors in Asia for many, many years. We need cleaner mobility, we need electric cars, we need less air pollution in our cities. Therefore, we are aiming to have 35 million electric cars in Europe by 2030, and I want to make sure that they will be powered by high-quality green energy batteries in Europe because the market for that would be enormous: EUR 250 billion a year. That is the challenge. That’s a market we have to capture.  What we are announcing today is the opening of the debate. We need to have the people with us. We need to analyse all the aspects of it and I’m sure that we will present an excellent story and clear European leadership, not only in Katowice, but also later when we present the document to the UN.

Some of you have complained that this strategy is not ambitious. Others considered the importance and dimension of this strategy. I would just say that the strategy proposed by the Commission is fully in line with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report. The Special Report talks of global greenhouse gas neutrality by 2070 and carbon neutrality, which is not as ambitious as greenhouse gas neutrality, in 2050. The Commission strategy is far more ambitious because it nails down climate neutrality and greenhouse gas neutrality already in 2050, 20 years before what the IPCC, with the better science available, recommends at global level, so we have ambitious objectives. It is very clear, if you read the communication, that the Commission considers that the European Union should, by 2050, be among the first to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions and lead the way worldwide. To do so, the European Union needs to step up its efforts. That means that we have to go through scenario 7 and 8, which are the most ambitious scenarios and those which lead to climate neutrality. The ambition is here and it touches all sectors of the economy.  Some of you say, ‘well, but there is no action’. We have started taking action. We have delivered, as Vice—President Šefčovič said, all the legislation needed on the climate, the Emissions Trading System that performs as foreseen, regulations on, land use, land use change and forestry, the whole energy union package. With the cooperation of Parliament, which has been more ambitious than the Commission – for sure, I have to recognise it – we could have a very good dialogue and we convinced also the Council to go along and now we have legislation that permits us to reach a reduction in emissions in 2030 of at least 45% – it might be bigger if other legislation comes – and this simple legislation, as the Vice—President said, will lead us in 2050 to emission reduction of greenhouse gas emission levels of 60%. So we are already working, but also because of you, we have excellent review clauses in 2023 and 2024 in all the legislation. That means that there will be more ambitious targets in 2030 because there are review clauses there that you have introduced and you have agreed, Mr Eickhout. So we have the tools, we have the elements to start being ambitious, but for sure we have to step up efforts in the future. This is a revolutionary change, a societal change. It’s a radical change. That’s why I don’t understand very well why Mr Eickhout considers that we can lead this exercise in 20 minutes. No, because now we, the Commission, are inviting the European Parliament, the European Council, the Committee of the Regions, the Economic and Social Committee and the European Investment Bank to consider this mission for a climate neutral Europe in 2050. We have to prepare the special summit of the Heads of State and of Government for shaping the future of Europe at the European Council on 9 May 2019 in Sibiu. In order to prepare for that Council, we want to have a real Council – all the relevant Council formations should have extensive political debates on the contribution of the respective policy areas to the world vision because this touches every area: industry, transport, mobility – all of them –energy, buildings, heating. This is a very complex debate at Council and at Parliament level. It touches all the committees of the House. All the Commissioners have worked together in project teams in order to deliver this communication. It has been a complicated exercise, but we have the product here. Also, in parallel to this political exercise, during the first half of 2019, the European Commission will take the debate on the necessary deep economic transformation and the profound societal change in an open and inclusive manner to all Member States, to national parliaments, to business, NGOs, cities, communities, citizens and youth. They should participate in a dialogue in the European Union and give their contributions on what is the level of ambition we really want and what is the speed of travel we really want with this informed debate in the whole of Europe. I expect in the European elections we will talk about the climate and that could be one of the most important topics. Nine out of ten Europeans think that the climate is an important problem and more than 74% that it is a very important problem. I think these topics will be at the election. If the different political parties show their positions and we have a world debate, then we are ready to go to the United Nations in 2020 with the final strategy. This is the first Commission communication to launch the debate. We have preferred scenarios, for sure. We have four ambitions and we also want an informed debate and that, finally, we follow an ambitious path and we are the first major economy to reach climate neutrality in 2050. It’s hard. We will require huge investments but with huge benefits also: for health, the economy and also for the responsibility we have with the rest of the world. Some of you said it, if we don’t lead, nobody will lead us. The United States are on climate holidays, as the Governor of California, Jerry Brown, said, and it is up to us to lead the way. But if we show that it is feasible and all our impact assessments – and I recommend that you have a look at the in—depth analysis that supports the Commission communication, which is a communication with 20-something pages, the documents here show the difficulties and the challenges, but the possibility to achieve our targets. This is a complex exercise. It touches all society and is something we have to discuss in depth. This is the first moment we sit together. There will be much conversation on it and I expect that we will reach agreement on a very ambitious pathway to deliver what is expected of the European Union: the leading climate change policy in the world.

In March, maybe some of you remember, the European Council asked us to present the state of play of the Single Market. They called on us to assess the remaining barriers, but also to set out opportunities for the future. Of course, there are more reasons why we decided to and why we needed to put this out right now. First, and most obviously, because this Parliament has six months left in this term and this Commission has just under one year. It is right to tell citizens and businesses where each of us stands. It is right that they know what the Commission has done and what the co-legislators have done so far. Second, because everyone in this room knows that the Single Market and the freedoms of the Single Market are really under threat today. Third, because there is no time to lose: what I hear again and again from businesses and entrepreneurs is that every minute we delay in creating the true Single Market is really an extra minute for our competitors in Asia or in the United States.  We need to revive the case for the Single Market. We need to shift the narrative from the traditional – completing the Single Market – to the new one: the Single Market as a tool to improve the lives of our citizens, raise our industrial competitiveness, to boost our standing and influence in the world. The traditional narrative of completing the Single Market really means only ticking the boxes, and this is what really, really a lot of bureaucrats do, but this is not really what we need right now in this moment of history. Our communication shows that there are very real benefits for our citizens and for businesses, not just in terms of jobs, not just in terms of more growth, but also in terms of freedoms and opportunities for people’s lives. It shows also three main areas where we really need to do more. These areas are as follows:  First, we need to adopt the proposals on the table. We have put forward, as a Commission, proposals only where there were the highest priority and all of them passed the most strict impact assessment. We have not flooded both Parliament and the Council with the new proposals, but still the statistics are stark. For instance, out of 67 proposals from the Commission directly relevant to the proper functioning of the Single Market, 44, for now, have still not been agreed by Parliament and the Council. The situation is especially bad on services and on capital markets and the banking union. We also need to agree on some key proposals for our digital Single Market, for example, copyright, e-privacy and platforms to business, just to name a few. We have four months to remedy this. We have four months to find truly intelligent compromises.  Secondly, we need to ensure that the rules deliver in practice. The Single Market needs everybody in the EU to play by the agreed rules. Let me just mention two words: defeat devices. I am currently dealing with over 1 000 infringement cases and this is over 1 000 unfair limitations on our citizens and on our businesses. I don’t exempt businesses from the criticism either. We recently, for example, found out that 40% of websites do not allow customers from other Member States to conclude purchases online. Geo-blocking: our geo-blocking regulation enters into force next week, and it needs to be implemented very swiftly.  Third, a real third point, we must continue adapting the Single Market so that it really fits a changing economy. We have to be more precise on how services become more important because they complement products or replace products. We need to be more ambitious in integrating digital technology in our traditional service sectors. The Single Market for services, as we all know, does not work as well as the Single Market for goods, but it offers really great opportunities and it shows enormous untapped potential. We need to look more at how the Single Market supports our trade agenda and we need to reflect more on how to be much more consistent and ambitious on enforcement and how this fits with our competition rules.  Let me conclude by saying that of course I understand that these are not easy issues. I understand that they take political courage and they need strong leadership, but time and again, I hear representatives of different institutions and different Member States declaring their belief in the Single Market outside the negotiating room. Once they enter this negotiation room, the proposals are blocked or watered down. Decent proposals are blocked or watered down. When the European Council addresses or discusses the future of the Single Market next month, I hope that the leaders will renew their commitments, not only in words but also in deeds, and I hope that they will show true leadership on this.

I think it is good that, a few months before the European elections, the Commission has once again made it clear with this communication that the internal market and cooperation between the economies of the 28 Member States have the potential for prosperity that brings us growth in Europe and is ultimately responsible for the prosperity of almost 500 million citizens in Europe. Unfortunately, you can only show this in the end with numbers, and numbers always lead to emotions being lost. However, to be brief, the fact that we are doing so well in Europe today – and this is true statistically for all Member States on average, even if many citizens do not want to see it – is because we work together in Europe, because very often we have only one European regulation instead of 28 different individual regulations. That is why it must be made quite clear that Europe does not stand for bureaucracy, but at the same time we are abolishing 27 with a European regulation. That is why the internal market means less bureaucracy. This is, of course, particularly true in view of what the Commissioner has said, that the Member States, the economic stakeholders concerned, always point out in the external discussion how strong they are for the internal market, but when it becomes concrete, they find it difficult.

However, I should also like to point out, of course, that the European Parliament, in its hard work, has also ensured, with some resistance from the Council, that we have at least made two of the proposals capable of winning a majority, which in the end also faced this very hostility in the Member States. That is why I believe that, in the coming years, we need to make it much clearthat that the internal market is not just the responsibility of the Commissioner for the Internal Market, that the internal market is not just DG GROW, but that the internal market is characterised by a great many other competences in the European Commission, all of which must work together so that they can convince the European Member States accordingly.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 97, "date": "2018-11-28.json", "name": "Nicola DANTI", "mepid": "124821", "text": "  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to thank the Commissioner for this communication. I think it is important to celebrate these 25 years of the single market – which is certainly Europe's success story – but also to start having a different approach, because in any case not everything is good, and here we are also highlighting the good and, above all, we must begin to get through the notion that the single market is not simply an abstract category but impacts on citizens' lives every day. : from roaming to digital products, to consumers. I mean, a lot of things that improve people's lives.  I think it is important to take stock of this end of the parliamentary term: it is clear that the Commission has had many proposals on the table – as you said, Commissioner – it is also true that many of these proposals have been strongly supported by Parliament. These include: certainly the abolition of roaming, the digital one-stop shop, the regulation on consumer cooperation, data initiatives – both free flow and personal data, in short geo-blocking – as you mentioned – all of which Parliament has contributed to in an improvement direction. Of course, we wasted time on proposals that were not the best, those on the services package; these did not meet the needs of citizens or add value to the quality of their lives. I am thinking of the e-card – which we have stopped in this Parliament – although we then found some compromises on the proportionality test and notifications.  However, Commissioner, let me tell you: there are also proposals that have come too late. You are right, we have a few months ahead of us, but we have only had important proposals in the last year concerning consumer protection, which relate to the goods package, which affect platforms. These proposals, with six months to go, would certainly have been completed by this Parliament and, unfortunately, we are currently racing to bring to a close things that are very important for European consumers and citizens.  However, Mr President, let me say one last thing to the Commissioner: I think that the single market will only evolve if we also deal with taxation, without a fiscal issue in Europe the single market will find it increasingly difficult to move forward.

The European Parliament is often as guilty as Member States of protectionism. The e-card system, which would have made it easier for professionals to work across borders, was blocked here. The Single Market is supposed to be at the heart of the EU. Services is supposed to be one of the four freedoms – that’s what I keep hearing in the Brexit negotiations – yet this Parliament seems to show little interest in it.

It is something to treasure and to protect. The daily benefits of the European Union can be found in the single market.

I believe the European Council must commit to a new pledge to further complete the single market by 2025, including a new binding timetable for action as European leaders did in 1985, a new pledge based on a proactive movement towards strengthening the single market and away from a defensive national focus.

I think all of us agree that, because it was repeated many times, the Single Market is one of the greatest achievements of the European Union, but of course, we have to face the truth, we have to face the reality that we are not using the full potential of this greatest achievement. We are not using it in 100% as was said, mostly in the services sector. The goods sector is more unified under the Single Market. I welcome very much your constructive approach on the various issues, although I very much do not agree on one of the statements saying that some of our proposals were a waste of time. It was not a waste of time, for example, the e-card proposal was – I’m completely sure – a step in a good direction, it was a step to allow our companies to go cross border and to trade cross border and to provide their services cross border. Unfortunately, it was blocked, as some other proposals were. I definitely also want to state that a fully functioning Single Market – because it is also under the framework of this communication – together with a properly functioning standardisation system will make the European Union, in an economic sense, more attractive, more powerful internationally and at the same time, ensure the high standards in the various sectors of our lives. Of course, those benefits should not be taken for granted. As we see also under this term of the Commission, of the Parliament, there is a lot of untapped potential. The question was what else we can achieve in the next month to come. Let me say – and I regret it very much – that three of our proposals, notification, e-card and Single Market Information Tool (SMIT), were blocked either in the Parliament or in the Council. Still to go are the single digital gateway, mutual recognition, market surveillance and some parts of type approval in different sectors. There are still proposals that are being negotiated in trilogue. Some of them have not started yet, but I think we’ll be able to deliver on all of those that I have just listed now before the end of this term. Definitely, those three, notification, SMIT and e-card, although seen by some as not highly ambitious, were really very important and substantial steps in a good direction, as I said.

Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank the commissioner for her work and for the work she has done. We have a global economic reality characterized by global value chains. This is indeed about rules for these global value chains. It is a question of ensuring that reasonable working conditions prevail at all stages of these global value chains. All of this actually means that we need more international rules, more multilateral rules. That, of course, is what the WTO is looking at.  On the other hand, we have a tendency for individual countries to undermine precisely these rules, which are so necessary. That is why one of the first statements in our report is to urge all partners, all 164 partners in the WTO, not to call this set of rules into question, but to develop it further. This is, of course, particularly true of the United States, which is still blocking the functioning of the WTO's jurisdiction and of re-appointing judges and appointing new ones, and which, in other areas of their trade policy, do not accept and respect the rules of the WTO. If that means not accepting rules, then of course the whole system will fall apart, and this will have immense political and economic consequences. That is why it is so important that we now start to preserve this instrument, but at the same time develop it further, because we naturally see that this instrument, which was founded in 1994, needs to be reformed.  That is why we want to go down the road to reform, and we also support the Commission's activities in saying in all three areas: we need to review the rules, both to ensure that development can be promoted for less developed countries, but also to integrate new elements – such as electronic commerce – so that we also have a modern world trade organisation set of rules here too. We also need to look again at how the judiciary works, the second pillar of the World Trade Organisation. Whether we can perhaps bring in more transparency, also process the processes more quickly and also reform the question of the nomination and functioning of the court, so that criticisms can be absorbed. Thirdly, we must also look at working methods. To think that all 164 partners can decide everything together at once, this single undertaking, I think, is an illusion. We must develop flexible facing-in methods, as we have already done with the trade facility agreement and other agreements, so that groups of countries can go ahead without leaving other countries behind, while also ensuring that each country has the opportunity to participate, in other words to organise capacity building, so that momentum can once again enter the negotiation process.

Purchasing power is generated by exports on the one hand, because new jobs can be created and good wages can be earned, and it serves to secure workers' jobs and to have an even better income. Import serves all of us. We are all consumers. If we can get products cheaper and better from anywhere in the world, it will also increase our purchasing power. So exports and imports double the purchasing power of our population. I believe that this is the essential feature of trade, it serves both sides and it is a global positive development if we promote trade, and ultimately trade also ensures democracy. The WTO was established in 1995. I have to say that I was there for the first time in 1999 in Seattle, where there were only demonstrations in the streets, where people spoke out against trade and against protectionism. I will never forget that the President went to the dockworkers at the time and said, \"We're closing the borders, We're helping you-away-what I've never understood.\" We then had the Doha Round in 2001. Pascal Lamy has pursued the idea here that we focus on trade facilitation. This chapter has been closed positively. We also have, of course, the question of agriculture, where there is still much to discuss, and aid for trade is actually at the heart of our development policy. I believe that the Sustainable Development Goals play a very important role in this area: No 2 – safe food, sustainable nutrition; No. 6 - sanitation, clean water; No. 7 - Renewable energy. There is a real need for action here, and here we can increase purchasing power not only in Europe, but also in those countries that are really bad, and thereby support it. I remember well, as we said in 2002, that it cannot only be up to ministers and our excellent officials to deal with this issue internationally. We then began to set up the Conference of Parliamentarians for the WTO. I remember well that, together with Erika Mann, we created this conference of Members on an equal footing with the International Parliamentary Union. And the last time, in Buenos Aires, we had 300 to 400 Members, where the ministers and the negotiators were speaking. This is also part of the fact that the members of parliament, not only the governing parties, but also the opposition, have the opportunity to follow these developments, especially in the least developed countries. In my view, this is crucial that we also try to communicate the successes. If we see that many of the least developed countries have now become advanced industrialised countries, then that is also a success of the WTO. The fact that we can resolve trade disputes in court, before the Appellate Body, and no longer have to settle them by military means, is also a huge success for the WTO. And we already know that with 164 states to achieve a unanimous result means a lot of work and a lot of time. And I know that we have already had 42 meetings at the Conference of WTO Parliamentarians and that these 16 years have really paid off, because, of course, attention to world trade issues has become accordingly stronger. Now is the time for reform to move on to the next round. The system has proved its worth, and we need to improve it in the future.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 122, "date": "2018-11-28.json", "name": "Cecilia MALMSTRÖM", "mepid": "4273", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, I would like to thank the two rapporteurs, Mr Lange and Mr Rübig, for your report. It is very timely and you highlight many of the challenges that the World Trade Organisation (WTO) is facing. You also point at ways forward and they are very much in line with what we are trying to do in the Commission with support from you and Member States. It also sends a political signal in this moment that the European Union is strongly committed to strengthening and to modernising and to preserving the WTO. As you said, the multilateral trading system has been good for Europe. It has been good for the world. We have had clear rules. It has been good for companies. It’s been good for economies. It has helped economies to grow, lifting hundreds of millions out of poverty and promoting stability and peace. As you say, the WTO is now under huge pressure and experiencing a very, very severe crisis and, even though the WTO is not perfect, without the WTO, we would not be well off. That would be bad for us in Europe and it would be really bad for the most vulnerable countries in the world. We in the European Union depend on open, rule-based, fair trade. That is essential for our economic prosperity and that is why the European Council, already in June last year, asked the Commission to take forward comprehensive approaches to modernising the WTO in its main functions – rulemaking, monitoring and dispute settlement – as a way out of the crisis. This was also echoed in the G20 meeting, for instance, so this is something that the whole world is aligned on. There are many threats to the WTO. The Appellate Body is the most urgent one and there is a clear realisation about the need to resolve the Appellate Body crisis. Until recently, we hadn’t seen a real strong awareness in the WTO community about the urgent need to reform, but I think this is gradually changing. The European Union is leading the reform efforts here and working with many other countries as well, and we are deepening and accelerating the work that I presented to you in September. There is a long list of challenges that need to be addressed – you mentioned them in your report – and it is absolutely necessary to put the WTO at the centre of a rules-based, multilateral trading system. As I said, the Appellate Body is the most urgent challenge. We believe that the proposal that we put on the table this week, together with 11 other countries, is a credible basis to engage with the WTO and show a way forward that would lead to a strengthened and modernised Appellate Body. We have also tabled, together with the US, Japan and a handful of other countries, a proposal on transparency and notification, which is important for trust and the functioning of the WTO internal procedures. We also need to address gaps in the WTO rulebook. Mr Lange said that the rulebook is from 1995. Absolutely. So, of course, we need to update it. We need to address issues such as non-market policies, forced technology transfer and other items. We are working with the US and Japan to try to see if we can draft new rules in the WTO on these, and, of course, there are many other issues as well. We are working together with a large group of WTO members on e-commerce. There were more than 80 countries engaging in this in Geneva as a result of the joint statement made in Buenos Aires almost a year ago – many of you were there – and that has translated to very active engagement and that is really good news. Of course, there are the outstanding Doha issues, the development issues, which are not to be forgotten. We need to address them as well. Finally, I agree with you that more should be done to contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, as we set out in the September paper. This is a vital strand of the WTO modernisation. We are engaged in the fisheries subsidies. That is one key in this, of course, but we are also working on identifying how the WTO could contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. I am committed – and so are we all – to continuing to make every effort to engage with the WTO membership. The members of the Council of the EU countries are all supporting this strategy. We’re engaging with major trading partners, as well, to support our ideas and to push this forward. Prospects are uncertain. They are gloomy and, therefore, I very much appreciate not only the support that you are giving to the Commission, but also the hard work that you are doing and I encourage you to continue reaching out to parliamentarians across the world to support this as well.

There are two key messages from our committee which tie in with what people have already said. The first is that, yes, we need a rules-based system, but this is particularly important for developing countries, because in a multilateral system they’ve got a better chance of getting a level playing field, of getting a seat at the table and having their voice heard, unlike in bilateral deals where bigger economies can call the shots. Secondly, our key message is that the multilateral trade system must be fair to all countries including the least developed countries (LDCs) and be set in the context of the sustainable development goals (SDGs). Free trade alone will not be enough to lift all boats, and so we need trade agreements which are broadly based, cover human rights, social and environmental aspects, and not just tariffs and trade liberalisation issues. We also need concrete steps to deliver on this agenda, like supporting the UN process to negotiate a UN binding treaty on business and human rights, and we need initiatives on the value chains that Bernd Lange spoke about. We have two areas where we could make quick progress: the first is cocoa and the second is textiles. These are areas where there is a growing mood to get something done, and I think we could work with businesses and Member States to get things done.

Firstly, the growing protectionism of the world, where more and more countries are challenging regulatory trade, is most clearly the United States. However, we have talked a lot about this.  Secondly, which is just as important, the serious threat of the WTO becoming outdated, that it is in fact not up to the challenges of our time, and of the future: Chinese state capitalism, trade in services, digital trade and our increasingly over-regulated societies. I therefore believe that those who defend world trade and the World Trade Organisation are committed to reforming the World Trade Organisation. That is why the Commission's proposal is very good. If we do not succeed in this, we will leave the rule-driven trade. Then Europe and countries like Sweden become the biggest losers.

But these are the basis for moving forward and, in order to move forward, it is essential, as you said, Commissioner, to modernize the WTO in order to meet the challenges we need to address and provide solutions, such as digital commerce, such as, indeed, the objectives of sustainable development, such as standardisation in labour rights.

You’re absolutely right that there’s a lot to be done. When the WTO was created the world looked very different to the one we have today, so it needs to be updated. But it’s also an international organisation with 164 members operating by unanimity. We have difficulties agreeing among 28 countries, but with 164 countries is indeed complicated. Nevertheless, it is in urgent need of strengthening, updating and modernisation, to live up to the demands that we face. So it’s far from perfect, but if we did not have the WTO we would be much worse off. We would have total anarchy and those who would suffer the most, I have to repeat that, would be the poorest countries. It has been good for them to have these rules, this predictability, to be helped, to be inside the global system with the multilateral rules, and that’s what we need to preserve, strengthen and develop. But there’s so much to do. We need to develop the internal function. Here the EU has been in the lead, together with a couple of other countries, to try to emphasise the need for continued transparency and notification. That is key for the WTO to function and to have its trust. We need to make sure that the rules that we have agreed upon in the WTO are enforced. It is the appellate body, it has served us well in the European Union, it has served many other countries well as well, and that’s what the most urgent need is. We have proposed here, with several other countries joining up, a way to come out of that deadlock and I hope this will be discussed in the coming weeks. We do need to address the so-called old issues, the old Doha issues, absolutely we need to do so, and we are engaging with other countries to try to see if there’s a way we can break the deadlock here. We need to address new issues. As I said, we are talking about e-commerce and digital trade with many other countries. That is a good thing. Furthermore, we are discussing how women can be included in a more systematic way in trade, and we need to discuss, I fully agree with you, how the WTO can play a greater role in living up to the sustainable development goals. We need to find ways there where we can work with all the other members and we need of course to make sure that we have modern rules, that the rule book is updated. And here, as I said, we are working with the US and Japan, but also with other countries. So we are trying to put forward proposals. We will continue to do so. We will continue to ally with countries across the globe to work on this, but we do need your strong support here, and therefore I really appreciate the reports that we have been discussing, I thank again the two rapporteurs and also for the opinion of the Committee on Development (DEVE), I think that is very useful.

Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank the commissioner for her work and for the work she has done. There are increasingly people who are very critical of globalisation.

Then the question is: what solution is there for these fears? There are some who think that we have to go back to the nation state and organise everything there. I firmly believe that, in a world of today, this is an absolute illusion.  We can only shape our future together and then we also need strong international rules. That is what it is all about: to provide this globalisation with guidelines so that people's lives can be strengthened. If you look at the global world, we basically have only one institution globally: the WTO, which organises equality in the voting behaviour of the countries and which has a jurisdiction. 96% of the judgments are complied with. We do not have that at the UN, we do not have that at any other global institution. We really should defend, expand and expand this asset. That we really have guidelines for globalisation that can shape the interests of nations in the sense of sustainable development in a fair way.

We see this in North Korea: when the borders are tight, when dictatorship prevails, people are hungry and poverty is bitter there. You can look at how people are doing if we don't trade. I believe that we also need more respect for our partners when we negotiate. What we believe is not always ideal in politics. We can also learn from others and create a better basis together. That is why we should oppose protectionism, look at where reciprocity makes sense, and ultimately we should also be tolerant. Tolerance is part of being able to listen to where our partners see problems in trading with us, and that we also set standards that are useful to both sides. Ultimately, trading is a win-win situation. We know that military usually has exactly the counter-order, loose-less, both sides lose, whohas lost the most is the loser. No, politics means something else: we want to be a win-win for our people, we want to strengthen purchasing power, we want to create jobs, not only in Europe, but especially in the poorest of these countries, and the WTO can make a significant contribution to this.

In this way, the WTO helped to generate significant growth in many economies. But the world is changing and unfortunately the WTO has not always evolved with it. I support the mandate that the Commission received from the European Council in June this year to accelerate and help the WTO to enter the 21st century. For me, two things matter. Firstly, the role of the WTO as a mediator in trade disputes must be strengthened. This can be done by adapting the rules of trade to the technological and economic developments of the last 20 years. There is also too little emphasis on sustainability and social challenges. More flexibility may be part of the answer. In addition, we must ensure that market participants are levelled by tackling market-distorting subsidies.

Let me also welcome Commissioner Hahn and thank him personally for his dedication and good work in the Western Balkans region.  Today we are debating the European Parliament’s last annual report on Serbia in this legislative term. It has often been said, including in this Chamber, that Serbia is moving towards the European Union. I would like to underline this by looking back at the beginning of this legislature in 2014, when the accession negotiations had just started and, concerning the opening of chapters, Serbia literally started from zero. Today, four and a half years later, 14 chapters have been opened in the negotiation process while two have already been provisionally closed. I sincerely hope that at least three more chapters will be opened at the intergovernmental conference in December.  Three points are of utmost importance on Serbia’s path towards the European Union. Firstly, the rule of law. I would like to use this opportunity to recall that Serbia’s progress on the rule of law – Chapters 23 and 24 – remains essential for the overall pace of the negotiating process. Judicial independence has to be assured in practice. Corruption and organised crime still remain an obstacle, not only to Serbia’s but to all Western Balkan countries’ democratic, social and economic development.  On another note, I agree with the European Commission and the Council on guaranteeing unhindered exercise of the freedom of expression and media. Shortcomings in this area should be addressed as a matter of priority.  Secondly, the economy. The criteria for membership are intended to help Serbia to stand on its own feet and become fit for the European Union, the common market, and for the global economy in general. The government in Belgrade is implementing an impressive agenda of economic and structural reforms. This has already yielded results in terms of growth prospects and reduction of domestic and external imbalances.  Thirdly, regional cooperation and good neighbourly relations. We all know Serbia’s EU accession process is closely linked to the normalisation of relations with Kosovo. Agreements need to be concluded and, afterwards, implemented. That said, both sides – Belgrade and Priština – should continue to move forward with the full implementation of the already—reached agreements in good faith and in a timely manner. Serbia and Kosovo have expressed on many occasions concerns about their relations. The format where these concerns should be addressed is the Brussels dialogue. The decision of the Kosovo government to increase tax on goods from Serbia and from Bosnia and Herzegovina to 100% clearly violates the CEFTA Agreement and the spirit of the EU—Kosovo stabilisation and association agreement. I call on the government in Priština to revoke this decision immediately.  A final remark – effective communication is key. We, as the European Union, are by far the most important donor in the Western Balkans. We are engaged in several thousand projects to support reform efforts and assist in preparations for EU membership. If too many people in the region are voicing a sentiment of being left alone by the EU, we need to take this seriously. It shows that there is an urgent need for the European Union to communicate effectively about the extent of our engagement.

As you know, this year the Western Balkans have been in the spotlight of the European Union, highlighted in particular by the EU leaders meeting with the Western Balkans leaders in Sofia in May and the adoption of the Council conclusions on Enlargement and Stabilisation and Association Process in June. During our Presidency, we have continued to pursue the Union’s engagement with the region, aiming to achieve further progress in the accession negotiations. This is one of the priorities of our Presidency.   Serbia has made important progress since the last country report by the Commission in 2016 and accession negotiations have advanced at a steady pace, as has already been mentioned by the rapporteur. We hope to keep up the momentum in Serbia’s accession negotiations under our Presidency by opening further negotiation chapters. In the June Council conclusions, we welcomed the reaffirmed commitment of the Serbian Government to EU integration as its strategic objective. This also needs to be further demonstrated by Serbia’s commitment to reforms, because progress on the rule of law and fundamental rights chapters, as well as on the normalisation of Serbia’s relations with Kosovo, as set out in the negotiation framework, is essential and will continue to determine the pace of accession negotiations overall.  Many areas which require further reform efforts are rightly spelt out in your draft resolution. The implementation of interim benchmarks for Chapters 23 and 24 and of the respective action plans should continue to guide the reform process as the rule of law continues to be at the heart of the enlargement process. As you do in your draft resolution, we consider that Serbia needs to significantly step up its reform efforts in this area and, in particular, to ensure the independence and overall efficiency of the judicial system.  Special focus should be put on tangible results and a sustainable track record, notably as regards the fight against corruption, organised crime and money laundering. The lack of progress in the area of freedom of expression raises increasing concerns. We strongly believe that the authorities should guarantee a safe climate conducive to the unhindered exercise of freedom of expression and the independence of the media as a matter of priority.  Serbia also needs to pay particular attention to full respect for fundamental rights, including the protection of the most vulnerable groups, as well as the non-discriminatory treatment of national minorities throughout Serbia. Guaranteeing the rule of law and fundamental rights would also contribute to improving the business environment in Serbia and underpin the current positive economic developments and the continuous progress made in this area.  The normalisation of relations with Kosovo continues to be essential for the overall pace of negotiations. The Council will continue to monitor closely Serbia’s engagement towards visible and sustainable progress here so that Serbia and Kosovo can continue on their respective European paths. We continue to call on Serbia to progressively align with EU common foreign and security policy, in line with the negotiation framework. Serbia should also refrain from diverging from the EU common visa policy as Serbia’s conclusion of visa liberalisation agreements with certain third countries has raised real concerns. We note that Serbia has, in the meantime, revoked again its visa liberalisation regime with Iran.  We stress the importance of regional cooperation and good neighbourly relations. We encourage Serbia to continue sustained efforts to strengthen good neighbourly relations and to resolve outstanding bilateral issues. In this context, actions undermining regional cooperation are not helpful. We regret the introduction of tariffs by Kosovo on products originating from Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. There is an urgent need for calm and de—escalation in the interest of the whole region. We welcome Commissioner Hahn’s offer of help to work on rapid practical solutions to the various trade issues at hand. I will conclude my intervention by again welcoming the continued progress in Serbia’s EU accession negotiations and the continued good cooperation with the EU and within the region.  Finally, let me also recall our appreciation for the constructive contribution of Parliament, and in particular of your rapporteur, David McAllister, to advance Serbia’s accession process to the EU. I can assure you that we pay particular attention to the views of Parliament in this regard.

This is a balanced and accurate assessment of Serbia’s progress on its path to the European Union. It’s also in line with the findings of our own report of April this year and the Commission’s assessment since then. I share your view that Serbia has made good progress towards EU membership. With 14 chapters opened and two provisionally closed, Serbia’s prospects for joining the EU are tangible, and this shows our firm commitment to Serbia’s EU path. This European perspective is even more important today when we witness a resurfacing of tensions between Belgrade and Priština. Let me stress once again that both sides need to resume dialogue. There is no alternative to this if they want to make progress on their European paths. No country can join the Union without having resolved outstanding bilateral issues. For Serbia, this means that it needs to conclude a legally binding agreement with Priština before it can join the Union. However, let me also stress that the solution with Kosovo is not the only prerequisite on Serbia’s path to the Union. Reforms in the area of rule of law, fundamental rights and good governance, remain at the heart of the country’s accession process. And, similar to the findings in your report, we found a mixed picture in our recent assessment on the rule of law in Serbia. Serbia has adopted some important pieces of legislation and carried out necessary institutional reforms. However, delays have been building up in important areas and concrete results are still difficult to demonstrate. It’s therefore crucial that efforts increase in fields such as the reform of the judiciary, anti—corruption and fundamental rights, including media freedom. In addition, and this is particularly relevant for this House, we have concerns about the process of adopting legislation in the Serbian Parliament. The continued use of urgent procedures, as well as other practices, limits legislative scrutiny and debate. I also share your views that strategic communication is of key importance. It will ensure public support for European values and understanding of the benefits and obligations of EU accession. The Union is by far Serbia’s most important partner, including on assistance, and without any possible comparison with other global players. This needs to be put up in lights. Finally, whatever the difficulties – and they are real – Serbia should not lose sight of its EU membership goal. It should keep focusing on fundamental reforms, with continued EU support, and I really appreciate that the European Parliament is on the same page.

Yours, of course, also to the honourable Commissioner and the Representative of the Council. First of all, I would like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs for their excellent work and for all the suggestions and amendments that we have received during this time of drafting of the report. The guiding principle in the preparation of the report is, above all, that there is a... the way in which progress has been made and also draw attention to topics and areas where shortcomings still exist and where improvements are needed. To highlight a few key points in the report, I would like to start this way: Kosovo has, of course, taken an important step forward in the observed period, progress, but which has not been quite as we wanted. We would like more in many areas, and in many areas there are still visible parts that will need to be improved. The reason goes out in external circumstances, but especially in internal circumstances, because sometimes it seems difficult for political groups in parliament to reach consensus, and also sometimes in the communication between political groups, that sometimes the legislation that should be passed is harder to break through in parliament. Above all, it is important that the laws adopted in the Parliament in Kosovo then experience implementation. Because it doesn't help much if we have laws as good as that, but we don't use them. However, at this point, I would, of course, draw attention to one of the topics that is extremely important, that is visa liberalisation. We have repeatedly reiterated that Kosovo has fulfilled all the required criteria, including the ratification of the border with Montenegro, which took place in March this year after more than two years of negotiations, and thus, in fact, opened the door to visa liberalisation. And this has been given the green light by both the Commission and Parliament. And also because of the credibility of the European institutions, I think it is now also on the side of Europe to fulfil its part of the agreement, and that is to allow visa liberalisation for the people of Kosovo and, in this way, to equate them with everyone else in the region. When I mentioned the laws, I must say that Kosovo has adopted quite a few important laws that can be regarded as progress. However, as I said, the report also mentions the problems of corruption and organised crime, which are still present, and it seems that a great additional effort will be needed to maximise the independence of the judicial branch of the authorities and to further strengthen the work in the field of record-keeping on the investigation of high-level corruption. This is where many of those involved, including in the region, will need to participate. Of course, in the end, I cannot pass the dialogue between Belgrade and Prishina, and we all want the situation to be as normalised as possible and to move on and to continue with the talks in search of a solution and to meet those requirements that... to which both countries have committed themselves. And, of course, the European Commission, as Parliament, is watching closely. I would, of course, mention, and without that, it is not that bilateral relations are not resolved by excessive measures, and this imposition of customs duties does not improve relations between Prishina and Belgrade. And I believe that consideration and different action is needed and that such decisions are withdrawn. Finally, of course, we all want Kosovo to move forward on these outstanding issues, too. And here I am convinced that the EU can also offer its support and cooperation.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sl", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 176, "date": "2018-11-28.json", "name": "Karoline EDTSTADLER", "mepid": "197643", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Thank you Mr President, honourable Members, dear Commissioner, dear rapporteur Šoltes.  Let me start by underlining the importance of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement. This agreement offers Kosovo an opportunity for sustainable progress and rapprochement with the European Union.  It is therefore essential for Kosovo to continue working on the implementation of the agreement. Here we concur with your view that Kosovo should pay particular attention to improving the rule of law, including traditional independence and due process of law. Kosovo also needs to continue its fight against organised crime and corruption, which should be a clear priority of the authorities. Consensus across the political spectrum is key to advancing Kosovo's European agenda. We share your view that the Assembly is the key forum for legislative work and political dialogue. A strong political will is required from all political actors to move Kosovo forward.  Turning to the EU-facilitated dialogue between Belgrade and Pristina, we welcome the commitment of both sides to work with the High Representative on a comprehensive normalisation of relations, including in the form of a legally binding agreement. We both agree that this is key for their respective European paths and essential for sustainable regional stability. The Council will continue to monitor closely Kosovo's engagement towards visible and sustainable progress here so that Serbia and Kosovo can continue on their respective European paths. We stress the importance of regional cooperation and good neighbourly relations. We encourage Kosovo to continue sustained efforts to strengthen good neighbourly relations and to resolve outstanding bilateral issues. In this context, actions undermining regional cooperation are not helpful. We regret the introduction of tariffs by Kosovo on products originating from Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. There is an urgent need for calm and de-escalation in the interests of the whole region and, again, we welcome Commissioner Hahn’s offer of help to work on rapid and practical solutions for the various trade issues at hand. Let me add a few comments on the visa liberalisation process, which as we know is high on the political agenda in Kosovo. We join the European Parliament in welcoming the ratification by the Kosovo Assembly of the border boundary agreement with Montenegro in March 2018. This fulfilled one of the key criteria for Kosovo's visa liberalisation and was an important achievement in the spirit of good neighbourly relations.  Let me recall here the Commission proposal in May 2016 to transfer Kosovo to the Schengen visa-free list and the Commission's report on the fulfilment of the remaining benchmarks in July 2018. We note that the Parliament has adopted its mandate and is ready to start negotiating with the Council on the proposal to waive visa requirements for Kosovo.  However, as you are aware, the decision on the Commission proposal is currently under consideration in the Council. Today in our discussions we focus on Kosovo's progress in 2017. However, also more generally, I would like to stress that the EU will continue to support Kosovo by putting particular emphasis on furthering Kosovo’s socio-economic reform agenda, including through financial and technical assistance. Economic growth and creating employment is a main concern of its people.  Let me finally welcome the agreement reached on the extension of the EULEX mission and underline the importance of continued close and effective cooperation with EULEX.

I believe that it is a balanced report and is in line with the main findings of our 2018 Commission report regarding progress and challenges in Kosovo. But we cannot hide the fact that today the discussion is overshadowed by what has been happening in recent weeks in Kosovo. The recent decisions by the Kosovo Government to impose a trade tariff increase of up to 100% against Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina are very concerning and doing real harm to relations with Kosovo and regional cooperation ambitions. As we have said clearly, these decisions are a clear violation of the Central European Free Trade Agreement and contrary to the spirit of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement between the European Union and Kosovo. This is why the European Union has called on the Kosovo Government to immediately revoke these decisions. Imposing blanket measures is not the appropriate way to address trade concerns. They must be addressed in the appropriate fora. I have already spoken with the Prime Minister and the President, who agreed on the urgent need to calm and de—escalate, in the interests of the country and the whole region, and offered a rapid and practical solution for the various trade issues at hand between Kosovo and Serbia. I will also use the opportunity of my planned visit to Pristina next week to help find a way out of this crisis. But now let me turn back briefly to the assessment in our 2018 report on Kosovo. As already noted also in Parliament’s report, the picture is a mixed one. We underline progress in certain areas, such as on the investment climate. We also welcome the ratification by the Kosovo Assembly of the Agreement on Border Demarcation with Montenegro last March, which was an important breakthrough. However, our overall conclusion is that Kosovo’s pace of EU—related reforms is too slow. This is partly due to a very high political polarisation and the fact that the Assembly has not been functioning as it should. Unfortunately, these conclusions are still valid today. We therefore expect all political actors to increase efforts to build consensus on strategic issues for Kosovo, in particular EU—related priority reforms and on the dialogue with Serbia. Let me now turn to visa liberalisation, which is of particular importance to Kosovo’s citizens. Kosovo has worked hard in recent years to meet its visa liberalisation roadmap criteria. Last July, the Commission confirmed that Kosovo had fulfilled all outstanding criteria. We continue to stand by our assessment that all benchmarks have been met and continue to be met. I welcome Parliament’s clear support for the Commission’s proposal on visa liberalisation. Your report also – rightly so – insists that the authorities in Kosovo demonstrate sustained efforts in the fight against organised crime and corruption. The ball is now in the Council’s court. I hope that the Council will demonstrate that when our partners deliver, the EU delivers too. In that respect I would like to thank the Austrian Presidency for its efforts to put this on the agenda and to try to start negotiations on this subject. The Commission remains committed to Kosovo and to giving Kosovo a real European perspective. We will continue to support Kosovo in its reform processes in important areas such as the rule of law, public administration, the economy and education. However, we need to see a clear commitment from Kosovo’s leaders to focus their attention on measures that will bring Kosovo closer to Europe.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 178, "date": "2018-11-28.json", "name": "Eduard KUKAN", "mepid": "96651", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, Kosovo has seen turbulent political months. While some issues have moved forward, not much overall progress has been achieved. We are expecting more from the political leaders of Kosovo. We need to see a genuine commitment to the reform process, especially in the rule of law and the fight against corruption. However, political polarisation, and the lack of consensus and efficient work of the Kuvendi hinders progress on EU—related issues. Moreover, escalating tensions between Belgrade and Pristina resulted in unprecedented tariffs and the waste of very valuable time in reaching the agreement.

The focus will be on the tariff decisions, but I’m also going to assess the implementation of the European Reform Agenda. I will be insisting that the Kosovan authorities need to get back to the issues that matter for Kosovo’s future, namely reforms and engagement in the dialogue. Kosovo’s priorities should remain the rule of law, economic development and education. Kosovo needs to become an attractive place for business, provide citizens with high—quality education and reduce the very high unemployment levels, in particular among young people. It’s also crucial that Kosovo continues to build confidence by demonstrating sustained progress in the fight against organised crime and corruption. The Commission is providing strong support for the implementation of these priorities through substantive financial assistance and technical advice. For this part Kosovo needs to keep pace with the rest of the region to promote economic growth and foster political stability, which is essential for the security of the Western Balkans as a whole. Regarding dialogue, it’s vital that Kosovo and Serbia remain committed to the full normalisation of their relations. A comprehensive, legally binding normalisation agreement should be reached as soon as possible. Both Kosovo and Serbia have expressed on many occasions concerns and grievances about their relations. They should be addressed through the dialogue which the European Union is committed to continue to facilitate. I would like to conclude by saying that the Commission remains strongly committed to driving forward Kosovo’s European agenda despite the current difficult political context.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 193, "date": "2018-11-28.json", "name": "Karoline EDTSTADLER", "mepid": "197643", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Mr President, at the outset of my concluding remarks, let me express my sincere gratitude to the rapporteur of the European Parliament on Kosovo, Igor Šoltes.

I hope that the Council has also heard what we have said today, that Kosovo has fulfilled its conditions with regard to visa liberalisation, and there are arrangements in place to respect, of course, and if one party has complied with this, the other side is reasonably expected to do so.  Believe me, the people of Kosovo are already eagerly awaiting that they are not subject to discrimination further, and expect the European Union to fulfil its part of its obligations in the name of credibility.  Secondly, I think that the government in Pristina has heard today that we are not most enthusiastic about introducing or raising customs duties by 100 per cent as a means of resolving disputes between Belgrade and Pristina, and I hope that it will reconsider whether this is really an appropriate measure, because dispute resolution is taking place or resolved in a different way.  The last thing I would like to highlight is the environment, the environmental issues.  I think that we are also under-highlighting the problem of the environment in Kosovo, and I would like to draw attention here to the serious problem facing Pristina, which is air pollution, which is one of the highest in Europe.

Because of the time, I'm going to shorten my intended performance a little bit and limit myself to the most essential things.  Macedonia's membership of the European Union, once the conditions are met and our promises to this country, which has been in the waiting room for too long, will certainly guarantee the most reliable future for the country, the present and future generations of its citizens, and will at the same time make a concrete contribution to the stability, security and progress of the entire region of South-East Europe.  The path to this moment of Macedonia has been steep, but we can see that the democratic will of the people prevailed in the country, a creative and responsible response of a policy that chose channels of communication, balancing in a multinational community, finding allies in the international community and new paths for strengthening fruitful and friendly relations with neighbouring countries.  The resolution we are dealing with today therefore emphasises the constructive role of the states mens of Macedonia, Greece and Bulgaria, who have sided with the inherited problems of the past and agreed on common interests in the future.  The government and parliament in Skopje are awaiting difficult tasks: first, the implementation of the agreement with the Greek Government on amending the Constitution and the relatedbriding of the long-standing conflict over the name, and then demanding work on reforms that will be a prerequisite for the opening of negotiations on the country's future membership of the European Union, I hope and believe, as early as next year in June.  All this will require creating a democratic, all-enthu veal in the country, the participation of all political parties, civil society and state institutions.  In line with the commitments made, the state will have to modernise the legislative procedures, the judiciary, ensure respect for the rule of law, open up space for truly free and plural media, protect journalists from pressure and violence, fight organised crime and corruption more effectively.  Systemic changes in the economy, improvements in the business environment, enforcement of contracts, introduction of control and transparency of public procurement data, State aid and the use of European Union funds and the like will be needed.  The resolution also noted the government's efforts to improve the living conditions of young people. The government is also calling for a comprehensive solution to the problem of long-term unemployment for women. It is important to keep the obligations under the Ohrid Agreement in full and fully respect the rights and protection of all national and other social minorities.  Dear Sirs, Macedonia has come after years of uncertainty and political crises to a situation where it can, with its own strength and will, pave the way for a more promising future as a member of the European Union and NATO. This is a journey from a complicated history, often peppered with violence, wars and conflicts in the Balkans, to a future of reciprocity and shared responsibility. It is right to ensure the full independence and functionality of the judiciary in the country, which investigates and penalises irregularities and violations of the laws of the past.  Unfortunately, the Hungarian authorities have intervened in an incomprehensible and unacceptable manner. There is more talk about this by the resolution and amendments tabled by the various parties in our Parliament.  I consider it appropriate to point out here that Macedonia, as a potential member for membership of the European Union, has always enjoyed the support of the European Parliament and that it can continue to count with this support.  I think it is right to also highlight the efforts made by the Commission, Commissioner Johannes Hahn and his team, who, also in cooperation with this House, have consistently sought and found a way to address the complex political contradictions that have hampered Macedonia's progress towards membership of the European Union.  I would also like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs for their extremely constructive and substantive cooperation.

Let me begin by recalling the Council conclusions of last June where the Council decided to respond positively to the progress made by the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and set out the path towards opening accession negotiations in June 2019.  We welcome the European Commission’s necessary preparatory work. The country has overcome its deep political crises, including through the continued implementation of the Prespa Agreement, and has made substantial progress on the urgent reform priorities. This is extremely important for the country’s further progress.  Let me emphasise that even in the difficult political context, the government has taken significant steps to gradually restore a culture of compromise. It has reached out to all stakeholders, including the opposition, to strengthen democracy and the rule of law and to show a genuine desire to reform in an inclusive and transparent manner.  We welcome the changes in the tenor of atmosphere in the country. We also welcome the first concrete progress towards the restoration of the independence of the judiciary, the improvement of the work of the courts, and a follow-up to the work of the Special Prosecutor’s office, which has started to reverse the backsliding of previous years.  Let me here recall the need to find a suitable, sustainable solution for the continuation of the work of the Special Prosecutor’s office.  Moreover, we share your calls for the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to intensify efforts to properly implement the judicial reform strategy and to make further efforts to address the outstanding recommendations. Sustained efforts are needed to ensure implementation of all commitments and to ensure that the judiciary can function independently. The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has achieved progress on the EU reform agenda and continues its efforts. We encourage it to deepen the reform momentum further, in particular showing real results in key rule of law areas such as the fight against corruption and organised crime, where it needs to further deliver. The institutions in charge of preventing and fighting corruption must have the necessary autonomy and the financial and human resources. The government must also implement other reforms, such as the reform of the intelligence and security services, and of the public administration. The EU will continue to follow these efforts very closely. We take note of the adoption of the public administration reform strategy and the public financial management reform programme and look forward to their implementation.  We encourage the government to continue to deepen the current reform momentum, including through Plan 18. We welcome the intention to continue working with the opposition parties, civil society and other stakeholders. Therefore, a constructive dialogue between all actors is required. We urge all parliamentary parties to put their divisions aside and work jointly on the common strategic goal of EU integration for the benefit of all citizens.  The implementation of the name agreement is one major step in this regard. Moreover, we welcome the holding of the Jean Monnet Dialogue, initiated by the European Parliament, aimed at improving the atmosphere and culture of compromise among the members of the Assembly as well as the work of the Assembly. We join you in applauding the country for reaching out to its neighbours in the spirit of good neighbourly relations. In particular, the conclusion of the Treaty on Friendship, Good Neighbourliness and Cooperation with Bulgaria, and the signature of the agreement on the name issue with Greece, have demonstrated the government’s determination to resolve all outstanding bilateral issues and build good neighbourly relations with all countries in the region.  Let me finally welcome the continued active participation and the constructive approach of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in different regional initiatives. Together these have contributed to an improved regional context.

May I also say thank you for your kind words on behalf of my team, not only here in Brussels, but also on the ground in Skopje, and I would like to include in this our previous Ambassador, Aivo Orav, who also did an excellent and outstanding job. I would also like to use this opportunity to thank the Honourable Members of the Parliament, Knut Fleckenstein and previously John Howarth, but also Eduard Kukan, who together with Ivo Vajgl have shown their commitment to move, not only once but many times, to the country and to contribute to resolving the severe political crisis by engaging together with me in the facilitation of the provisional agreement. They also played a key role in the organising of the first Chamonix dialogue, which aims at creating an atmosphere of compromise among the political parties in the Parliament. These are only a few examples of how this House contributes to reinforcing democratic processes and, hopefully, standards. Let me underline that overall this draft reflects the main findings of our 2018 report and the latest developments have shown to be crucial. As you have rightly pointed out, the country has finally overcome its political crisis and is now firmly back on its Euro—Atlantic path. In the light of the latest developments, let me emphasise that the rule of law is a fundamental principle of the Union, for Member States and candidate countries alike. After years of backsliding, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has been making good progress in this area and it’s important that we collectively support this process. I have been impressed by the energy and efforts invested by the government to strengthen good neighbourly relations, in particular with the bilateral treaty with Bulgaria and later on with the name agreement reached with Greece. This historic agreement sets an example for the region and the Union as a whole. It shows that with vision, leadership and determination, the obstacles of the past can be overcome for once and for all. Last month, the Parliament took a courageous step by initiating the process of constitutional change. We now expect the national procedures for the implementation of the agreement to continue without delay. In our 2018 report, we stated that we were satisfied that the Pržino agreement has been largely implemented and that substantial progress has been achieved in the implementation of the Urgent Reform Priorities. Therefore, we recommended opening accession negotiations with the country. In June, our Member States acknowledged the progress achieved in advancing the EU reforms and set out the path towards opening accession negotiations in June 2019. It’s important that the current reform momentum continues to deepen, primarily in the interests of the citizens. Over the coming months we look forward to further progress, in particular in key areas such as judicial reform, the fight against corruption and organised crime, public administration reform and the oversight of intelligence services. All these areas have been identified in the so—called Plan 18 of the government. On a very personal note, I welcome the opening of accession talks with NATO and look forward to cooperating on key reforms of common interest. Finally, let me reiterate the Commission’s strong commitment to accompanying the country’s reform efforts to advance on its EU path, including through the technical explanation of the acquis.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 201, "date": "2018-11-28.json", "name": "Tunne KELAM", "mepid": "28424", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, this report is being debated in a hopeful atmosphere and is based on broad political consensus. I think it’s a new spirit of mutual understanding with Macedonia’s neighbours that has opened the real EU and NATO perspective for this country. It is really high time for this, because in the meantime Macedonia has made impressive progress in aligning its legislation with the EU acquis.  Most importantly, there is now a positive political dynamic. Still, it is all about implementation. In the actual context it is vital for the government to prove the judiciary is truly independent and unbiased to avoid any doubts of possible political misuse of it.

In the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, gender based discrimination and the situation of sexual minorities is particularly difficult.

But the conference I attended was organised in partnership with the Socialist government of fYROM which demonstrated their political commitment to improving the situation of LGBTIQ+ people.

The Commission, in any case, will support and continue to support the reform efforts in every way we can in order to prepare the country to open accession negotiations.

The action was condemned by a significant part of the Hungarian public, the opposition and the remaining free press.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Madam Secretary of State, Commissioner, I would like to thank the Commissioner for the work she has I am pleased that the debate on the Albanian report falls on Albania's Independence Day today, and I would like to offer my warmest congratulations to the people of Albania and the diaspora, certainly on your behalf. Before tomorrow's vote, I would like to begin by thanking the shadow rapporteurs from the other groups for their very constructive cooperation. I have tried to take on board the main points of the various groups. I am therefore confident that, in tomorrow's vote, we will achieve a great deal of agreement on the content of the report. I would like to refer to the main messages that we, as the Committee on Foreign Affairs, want to send with this resolution to our Albanian partners, but also to the Council and the Commission. It is now more than four years since Albania was officially recognised by the EU as a candidate for eu membership. We make it clear that this must also be reflected in the practical reality and support the European Commission's recommendation to open accession negotiations with Albania. At the same time, we take note of the Council's decision before the summer and welcome the clear path shown in the start of these negotiations. We expect – and I think we can expect it – for the Albanian Government to use the time until then to make all the arrangements for the negotiations. However, we also expect the Council to stand by its word and take the appropriate decision in June next year, because anything else would be incomprehensible and counterproductive in terms of the role and credibility of the European Union in the region. Of course, this report is also, and above all, a contribution to the Albanian Government and the opposition in terms of the work that still needs to be done in the country and the work that has been done so far. It is important for me to point out that these reform efforts must always have one objective: to improve the practical reality of life for the people on the ground and not to do good for a Commissioner or a Member or A MEPs in general. In view of what has already been achieved, it must be said that Albania has earned the opening of the accession negotiations by implementing the key priorities required – in particular, the very ambitious judicial reform, which goes beyond what was originally requested by the Commission. They show clear results: the vetting process in the justice sector is in full swing and not only shows initial results, but also has a deterrent effect for the future. It could be a good example for all governments in the region that are still looking for ways to carry out their judicial reform. Let me conclude with two points: we urgently need electoral reform. It is essential that this reform is carried out in line with the OSCE recommendation, even before the 2019 local elections. And I am, still, very hopeful and hopeful that I can remain so, that the two chairmen of the ad hoc commission of the Democratic Party and the Socialist Party will find a common way to make a good proposal. We should certainly support them in this. We must encourage Albania to continue along the path of reform that has been taken, because that is precisely the way to consolidated democratic institutions and to a functioning rule of law that leads to the EU. I look forward to tomorrow's vote.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 230, "date": "2018-11-28.json", "name": "Karoline EDTSTADLER", "mepid": "197643", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Madam President, honourable Members, dear Commissioner, dear rapporteur, let me begin by recalling the Council conclusions of June 2018, in which the Council decided to respond positively to the progress made by Albania and set out the path towards opening accession negotiations in June 2019. We welcome the Commission’s necessary preparatory work. We concur with your view that Albania has made steady progress in addressing the five key priorities. These are positive signals which show that Albania is on the right path, and we strongly encourage it to continue its efforts. Moreover, Albania is implementing a comprehensive justice reform, as the rapporteur already mentioned; the re-evaluation process for judges and prosecutors – the so-called vetting – has started to deliver under the oversight of the international monitoring operation. We encourage Albania to build on the progress made and to pursue the justice reform in order to achieve increased independence, accountability and professionalism of the judicial system. Establishment of the independent judicial structures, as provided for by the constitutional reform, should be finalised. Albania has worked towards the establishment of a solid track record in the fight against corruption and organised crime. However, it is important that the Government delivers tangible and sustainable results, including against the cultivation and trafficking of drugs. Dismantling organised groups remains an important challenge. We commend Albania for its close cooperation with external law enforcement agencies. We welcome its participation in international police operations and joint investigations, in particular with EU Member States, and urge it to be even more proactive in international police cooperation. On elections, as set out in your report, we expect Albania to address the outstanding OSCE/ODIHR recommendations, amend its electoral code and introduce measures for further enhancing the independence, impartiality, professionalism and capacity of election administration.  We emphasise the need for legislative and policy measures to reinforce the protection of human rights and anti-discrimination policies, including the equal treatment of all minorities and access to rights for persons belonging to them throughout the country. Albania has made efforts to put in place effective measures to counter the high flow of manifestly unfounded asylum applications lodged to Albanian citizens. These measures need to be further pursued with the countries most affected until sustained results are achieved.  We welcome Albania’s constructive engagement in regional cooperation and good-neighbourly relations, which remain an essential element of the enlargement process. I equally want to commend Albania for its full alignment with the EU’s common foreign and security policy. Today in our discussion we are focusing on Albaniaʼs progress in 2017, on which we have a very similar opinion. However, and more generally, I would like to stress the importance of tangible and sustainable results focusing in particular on the rule of law: this will take Albania closer to the opening of accession talks.

I would also like to thank the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs for their work leading up to this resolution. Clearly, significant coordination efforts resulted in a document which, in my view, is a very balanced one. The resolution captures the progress that Albania has made in the past years and it highlights well the challenges that lie ahead in order to move the country closer to the Union. Starting with the progress, Albania continues to advance in many crucial areas. The vetting of judges and prosecutors has proven to be a thorough and fair process and continues to yield concrete and tangible results. The ongoing judicial reform is a major demand from Albanian citizens and its successful implementation will foster public trust in state institutions, enhance the credibility and effectiveness of the justice system, and contribute to the embedding of the rule of law throughout the country. We cannot compromise on quality in this very important process and we are monitoring it thoroughly. As regards current challenges, constructive political dialogue and cooperation across parties is crucial for further advancing in delicate areas such as the restructuring of the judiciary, as well as the electoral reform process. Cross—party consensus is necessary to guarantee that outstanding OSCE/ODHIR recommendations are met. This includes, in particular, the transparency of party financing, as well as the independence and professionalism of the electoral administration.  Strengthening the administrative capacity of institutions is essential, not only for the successful implementation of reforms, but also for the effective preparation of EU accession negotiations. That is why we continue to encourage Albania to pursue public administration reform by adhering to the highest standards. Progress in the fight against organised crime and corruption also continues to be necessary for Albania to further advance on its path towards EU accession. Further achievements are expected towards establishing a solid direct record of proactive investigations, prosecutions and convictions in the fight against organised crime and corruption at all levels.  Good neighbourly relations and regional stability are essential elements of the stabilisation and association process. Albania is an important actor in promoting regional cooperation. We appreciate in this regard the full convergence of foreign and security policy between Albania and the European Union, as already highlighted by previous speakers.  The Commission maintains its strong commitment to support Albania’s efforts to advance further on its path towards European integration.  I look forward to continuing the fruitful cooperation with the European Parliament in all of these matters in the months ahead.

Nevertheless, Albania has to be a benchmark for all EU candidate countries: the highest standards must be achieved.

Albania is expected to advance on the rule of law reforms to move forward on the path towards the Union, but first and foremost, it needs to deliver progress for the daily benefit of all its citizens across the country. We trust that advancing on the rule of law will progressively result in a better business environment which is crucial to create more jobs and hence foster socio-economic stabilisation.  The observations in your resolution provide very good guidance for Albania in all these areas. However, I would like to reiterate one issue that concerns regional cooperation and good neighbourly relations. I think everybody should aim at calming down the situation, especially concerning the Kosovo-Serbia relations. There is no alternative to dialogue and normalisation. This is in the interest of the entire region and its EU perspective, therefore everybody across the region should refrain from unhelpful statements that could be seen as inflammatory or taking sides. To conclude, I would like to reiterate that the Commission will continue to support Albania while monitoring results thoroughly. Concrete results will not only bring the country closer to the Union but also guarantee that all Albanian citizens can rely on a functioning democratic state that successfully provides welfare, security and opportunities. The EU reform agenda requires broad political support which needs to be matched by concrete efforts from all the parties to engage in constructive dialogue. I hope that all political actors in Albania will also work with this important objective in mind, in particular in the forthcoming months.

We only know this when the government does nothing, does not make reforms and so on.

On the whole, we see a picture of that country progressing well, with 31 of the 35 chapters now open in total. The government of Montenegro remains positively engaged with the negotiation process and there continues to exist a strong consensus, both in the political arena and in terms of public opinion, for the Euro-Atlantic integrationist agenda. Obviously, events during the 2016 parliamentary elections, however, show that there is no room for complacency, given the efforts of a big third country to exploit the fears and concerns of a small minority. Court proceedings concerning the coup plot continue, and whilst we wait to see the final judgments, I have little doubt that events played out in the way that the prosecution is now arguing. The general political climate has improved since then and the handling of this case has proved the robustness of Montenegro, strengthening democracy and legal systems. I am pleased to see that much of the opposition have now returned to the parliament, and I strongly urge the remaining boycotting parties to do so as well. As a first step, it would be good to see all political parties participating in the working group on reform of the law on the judicial council. Furthermore, during the reporting period, we have seen presidential elections that passed smoothly and fully in line with the ODIHR/OSCE fundamental freedoms. Clearly there is room for improvement in some of the state electoral commission’s working methods, and my report calls for reinforcing the transparency and professionalisation of the electoral administration with that end in mind. Despite the overall level of progress, there remain concerns about the media landscape in Montenegro. Three successive Commission reports have concluded that no progress has been made in the area of freedom of expression and media freedom – an important issue to satisfy the benchmark requirements of Chapters 23 and 24 of the acquis. Ongoing disputes about the role of RTCG and changes to the members of its council and leading executives have had a negative effect on public confidence in the network's editorial integrity. The attack against Olivera Lakić in May of 2018 has highlighted again the plight of journalists and acts of violence against journalists. We cannot forget that this is the second attack against her. Given her involvement in investigating cases of corruption, such incidents highlight the continuing need to fight organised crime and corruption in all its forms and at all levels. On a more positive note, engagement and cooperation in the fields of CFSP and CSDP remain very positive. Montenegro has for many years been fully compliant in these areas, and its well deserved accession to NATO in June of last year will only cement that cooperation. I particularly welcome Montenegro’s full alignment with all the sanctions regimes, particularly those concerning Russia. I should also say a few words on the elements related to the environment in this report, which has been given a much stronger focus than in previous years. As my two amendments demonstrate, this is being pushed by other political groups in this House, and to my mind has given the subject a slightly disproportionate coverage in relation to the overall balance of my report. As a self-declared ecological state, it could be argued that Montenegro deserves to be held to higher standards than others. However, we must account for the budgetary pressures that this small country faces in this regard, and we cannot seek to be too prescriptive, particularly when calls go beyond the requirements of the acquis communautaire. To conclude, ahead of the wider debate: for some nine years as rapporteur for Montenegro, I have referred to it as the ‘good news story’ of the Western Balkans. It remains today the leading EU accession candidate, but I hope that it will not be too long until we see it progress from the good news story of negotiations to the success story of accession as an EU Member State.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "ECR", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 248, "date": "2018-11-28.json", "name": "Karoline EDTSTADLER", "mepid": "197643", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Madam President, Montenegro remains the front—runner in the accession process and has made further progress over the past years, as already mentioned in detail by the rapporteur. With the institutional framework complete and the legal framework largely in place, the entire rule of law system should now deliver more tangible results and a strengthened and sustainable track record. Progress in particular on the rule of law and fundamental rights chapters, as set out in the negotiation framework, will continue to determine the pace of accession negotiations overall. Therefore, Montenegro should now focus its reform efforts on meeting the interim benchmarks for Chapters 23 and 24 and on implementing the respective action plans. The Council strongly encourages Montenegro to demonstrate real results in the fight against corruption and organised crime, money laundering and trafficking in human beings, including through effective investigations, prosecutions and final convictions, and to improve the seizure and confiscation of criminal assets. Recent attacks against journalists highlight the urgent need for the authorities to guarantee a safe climate conducive to freedom of expression and the independence of the media. On economic reforms, the Council has taken positive note of the continuous economic growth and has encouraged Montenegro to take measures to ensure fiscal sustainability, decrease the high public debt, reduce the trade deficit, advance reforms in important areas, such as public procurement and labour market, and improve the business environment. With regard to elections, Montenegro’s authority needs to address all irregularities reported by international observers. Returning the political debate to the parliament remains the responsibility of all parties. The Council has warmly welcomed Montenegro’s continued positive role in further developing regional cooperation and advancing good neighbourly relations, strongly commended it also for its consistent cooperation on foreign policy issues and, in particular, for its continuous full alignment with the EU Common Foreign and Security Policy.

Montenegro will have to intensify its focus on implementing reforms with determination and on fulfilling all benchmarks.

I also want to thank all honourable Members who have contributed to this. Montenegro has indeed made steady progress on its EU path. Montenegro’s legal and institutional framework is now largely in place. The country is strongly committed to regional cooperation and has good relations with its neighbours and, in the context of the Western Balkans, this is not a minor achievement. Let me also welcome again Montenegro’s complete alignment with the Union’s common foreign and security policy positions. Montenegro is a country with a clear EU perspective. It is well in the EU integration process with 31 chapters open for negotiation, three of which are provisionally closed. There’s overwhelming support for EU membership among the population and across the political spectrum.  Fully functioning national parliaments play a key role in this process. I am glad that, finally, after a prolonged boycott of parliament by the opposition, there has been real progress in political dialogue with the return of most of the opposition to the parliament. In October a temporary parliamentary committee for the reform of electoral and other legislation was formed. Its mandate is based on the proposal made by the two civic opposition parties in June. I regret and I fail to understand that these two opposition parties have decided not to participate in the work of this committee. All parties should play an active and constructive role in the work of this committee. I look forward to the continuation of Montenegro’s EU integration process. As ever, the base of negotiations is in Montenegro’s hands. We start seeing initial results with concrete cases in some areas, including the fight against corruption and organised crime and investigations into money laundering. I look forward to now seeing a similar track record for the fight against trafficking in human beings, media freedom and investigations into attacks against journalists.  Attacks against journalists are unacceptable and need to be followed and cleared up. The overall priority for Montenegro remains to meet the interim benchmarks for Chapters 23 and 24 and therefore continue advancing in the accession process. Further fiscal consolidation measures are also required, combined with the timely implementation of Montenegro’s reform priorities, which would lead to a more flexible economy, improved functioning of markets and a good investment climate. I also expect the effective implementation of the public administration reform to ensure effective depoliticisation of the public service and to allocate state administration resources where they are needed for the country’s EU accession process. On its side the European Commission will continue supporting Montenegro on its EU path with both technical and financial assistance, so that the journey towards EU membership already brings concrete benefits to all citizens of Montenegro.

Montenegro still has a lot to do in the area of freedom of expression and the fight against corruption and organised crime.

The accession negotiations’ benchmarks will help Montenegro to address these and other priority reforms, which will move Montenegro closer to the EU.  Negotiations will continue to proceed on the basis of the own merits principle. The Commission will continue to support the country.

Academic freedom is not some dry obscure subject. I want to highlight two reasons why academic freedom matters so much. The contributions that academics make and the fact that attacking academics is an early step on a familiar path towards tyranny. The truth is, threats to academic freedom impact everyone in our society, when researchers, professors and students can’t explore certain issues, society doesn’t get the benefit of their skills and talents looking into important questions. When research on gun violence, tobacco or other health-related issues can’t happen, public health is endangered. When research into global warming, pollution and air quality doesn’t happen, the whole of society and the environment suffers. Attacks on academic freedom hamper social, political, economic and cultural development.  Today, I hosted an event on academic freedom in the Parliament. I learned that 294 attacks have been reported on higher education communities in 47 countries between September 2017 and August this year.  Thousands of academics and students are threatened, attacked, imprisoned, censored, expelled or even killed each year because of what they teach, write or say. Recently, I was in Turkey as part of a Subcommittee on Human Rights mission. Turkey is a clear example of a country where a crack down on critical thinking occurs with an unprecedented witch-hunt targeting teachers, academics and other professionals. But Turkey is not the only country threatening academic freedom, we also hear reports of the detentions of Uighur scholars and students in China, targeted attacks on scholars in Iran, pressures on student expression in Nicaragua, mounting tensions in the United States and state-driven threats to institutional autonomy in Russia.  I should also address the elephant in the room, the terrible attacks on academic freedom in our own EU Member State, Hungary.  Sadly, violations of academic freedom claims are rarely brought under human rights law. This is in part due to a lack of familiarity with issues of academic freedom amongst human rights advocates; and secondly, the fact that claims often referred to other rights being violated, such as freedom of expression or opinion. As a result, standards in this area are under developed and violations of academic freedom go underreported. Therefore, recognising these incidents as a part of a single global phenomenon is a crucial first step in devising solutions.  There is an urgent need to raise awareness of the importance of academic freedom and to create opportunities to improve the capacity for its advocacy and defence. There is also an urgent need to explain why academics’ work is fundamental to democratic societies and the protection of our rights, especially in the current rise of autocratic leaders. There are organisations and universities that already do excellent work monitoring and reporting attacks and assisting those who are under threat.  I have been hugely inspired by the work of Scholars at Risk which launched its EU chapter today in this Parliament. However, they struggle with financial and administrative limitations, which preclude otherwise qualified at-risk academics or students from being able to obtain access to programme opportunities. More needs to be done and the EU could lead in this area, supporting persecuted and at-risk academics as well as defending and promoting academic freedom worldwide. Madam President my report deals with the EU’s exchange external actions as its title says but we cannot approach and tackle external issues without being honest with what is happening in our own backyard. We cannot talk about the inclusion of academic freedom in the Copenhagen criteria for EU candidate countries without referring to the case of Hungary, a Member State that has been through the accession process. This case provides evidence that there are shortcomings in the accession process and an urgent need to address it. We cannot be hypocrites. The EU global strategy clearly states that living up consistently to our values internally will determine our external credibility and influence. That is why I am saddened and disappointed by some of my EPP colleagues’ actions. It seems that, for some, the priority about this report was to ensure that it does not make references to EU Member States actions, it seems that the priority was to protect Mr Orbán. Finally, to those people we say that we will not be silenced, we will be banging on about this for years to come. We will keep highlighting the importance of academic freedom and institutional autonomy and we will never stop saying that academics must be free to research and publish the truth, in Hungary, throughout the EU and across the world.

The right to think and speak freely is fundamental for democracy and we see the increasing attacks on academic freedom as part of a general trend of shrinking civil and political rights across the globe.  Let me assure you that we wholeheartedly share the concerns expressed in the report and welcome the initiative by Mr  Khan to respond to this crisis, which is building up and threatening to erode our liberal societies. I note that this morning Mr Khan organised a roundtable on ‘Ideas are not crimes’ where colleagues from the European External Action Service (EEAS) already had an opportunity to share some of our activities in this area. Human rights and democratic values are at the heart of our external relations and policies and I thank the European Parliament for its leading role in upholding these values. The Khan report affirms that ideas are not crimes and that critical discourse is not disloyalty and that academic freedom plays an essential role in educational advancement and the development of humankind in modern society. This is true and our actions show that we mean it. The Khan report calls for explicitly recognising the importance of academic freedom in public statements, policies and actions relating to the EU’s external action. We are doing this in our relations with partner countries. The most recent statement on Turkey on 16 November 2018 condemns the detention of prominent academics and civil society representatives and calls for a rapid resolution based on the principles of presumption of innocence and in line with the European Convention on Human Rights. We also address these issues in our human-rights dialogues, raising attacks on basic freedoms like freedom of thought, speech, assembly and association in general terms, and by enquiring about specific cases. Academic freedom and freedom of thought are closely linked to fundamental freedoms and implicitly covered by some of our human-rights guidelines – notably the EU Guidelines on Freedom of Expression – on-line and off-line (ex 2014), EU Guidelines on Human Rights Defenders (ex 2016), and EU Guidelines on the Promotion and Protection of Freedom of Religion or Belief (from 2013). These guidelines were drafted to ensure a maximum of coherence, consistency and visibility of human-rights priorities in external relations. They provide practical guidance for the work of delegations in this domain. On top of these guidelines we have a number of financial instruments which directly support our human-rights agenda which scans for vulnerable groups like journalists, human-rights defenders and religious minorities. Academics have directly or indirectly benefitted from a number of such instruments. For instance, the PreotectDefenders.eu programme covers all types of human-rights defenders including academics or people defending academic freedom – at least 219 academics with this instrument. The EIDHR (European Instrument for Democracy &amp; Human Rights) emergency fund also covers human-rights defenders including academics at risk helping them with relocation if necessary. A number of EIDHR projects are implemented by our support universities. Our flagship is the European Masters Programme on Human Rights, which was established in 1997 thanks to the vision of ten pioneer universities. EMA (The European Master’s Programme in Human Rights and Democratisation) is the oldest Masters programme supported by the European Union. Over the years, it has developed according to changing approaches to human rights and democratisation in Europe and in the world and to more integrated strategies in trans-European human-rights education. Today, EMA counts on the participation of 41 prestigious universities and human-rights centres from all Member States of the European Union. The EIDHR also supports the work of the UN Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression. Thank you for your attention. It’s clear that the recommendations proposed by Mr Khan’s report and the actions of the Commission and the EEAS follow the same joint objectives. I therefore look forward to our discussion on how to improve our cooperation on this matter even further.

The subject is very important, because protecting academic freedom, research and acadity is a noble goal, and as we are experiencing, there are countless cases around the world where teachers and scientists have to flee to save their lives. When education laws are enacted that deprive hundreds of thousands of minority-speaking students and university students of the right to learn in their mother tongue – and I could say more – I therefore agree with the general wording.  However, neither these specific phenomena nor a single third or partner country are addressed in the report, but only with Hungary and CEU in an interesting way. What if this is not another political fabrication against Hungary? Another smear campaign organised jointly by the left, the Socialists, the Greens and the Liberals to discredit Hungary politically.  And the saddest part is that you, dear combative rights defenders, have never spoken out in defence of the Hungarian school system in Transcarpathia, which they want to dismantle under the new Ukrainian education law, but they have not even spoken about the Hungarian University in Târgu Mureş, which the Romanians would like to merge.
