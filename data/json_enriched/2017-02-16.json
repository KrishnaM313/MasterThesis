Imagine air transport twenty years ago, and the possibilities and opportunities for consumers, for us travellers; I think that flying away for a weekend somewhere in Europe at low cost was difficult to imagine. In fact, aviation at that time was for maybe a limited number of people. This is a concrete result of the Single European Sky and the liberalisation that we managed to pursue at European Union level.  Now, increased aviation transport does not mean that we do not face any challenges. In fact, I could name at least some of them: environmental targets, certainly. I do not think anybody would deny today that we need to continue with lowering emissions from air transport. Competition with third countries, digitalisation – it is now more than a year ago that the Commission came with its plan to address these and some other challenges. In fact, it proposed to start negotiations with our main partners, to revise the rules on the European Aviation Safety Agency, and tap EU potential for growth by revising some internal regulations. This is, of course, very welcome and we have already started working on some of it, but, at the same time, we still are still awaiting some of the proposals.  The aviation sector undoubtedly requires heavy investment in a fast-evolving environment. If we want to be efficient, then we need to set a clear vision for this sector, for the investments we make today and in the future. We need to have a vision for the next, even I would say, 50 years. This is, to a certain extent, the purpose of this report, to try to find some practical alternatives for what is not working today and to make some proposals for the future. I am afraid I cannot list all of them today, but at least allow me to make a few points.  First of all, develop a connectivity index based on added value of all modes of transport, in order to rationalise investment and improve the overall resilience of the transport network in Europe, while improving connectivity. This index can help policymakers to take the appropriate decisions without undermining territorial cohesion.  Secondly, a trans-European motorway of the sky, to limit the impact of possible disruptions to where they occur, thereby allowing EU flights to pursue their journey. This was the subject of a bit of a debate in meetings with some of my colleagues. I promised that I would make it clear to the Commission that this completely means that we are putting an EU stamp on a part of the airspace and saying that in this airspace the EU should have priority over national flights. I would like to stress that this is not against national sovereignty and it is not against the right to strike. On the contrary, this is only about recalling some obligations that we should have towards the European Union.  I will be very brief on the European Aviation model. We need to stop thinking that we will solve problems of competition with our partners by putting an end to competition. This is only going to be detrimental to passengers. Competition is an opportunity for our airlines. We need to provide them with the right safeguards, of course, and this is why the European Parliament will be following closely the negotiations on air agreements. I find intermodality a very important element of this report because quite often when we talk specifically about aviation as a transport mode, we tend to take it separately from other modes of transport.  Finally, on security, there is no need to recall why this is a major concern now. Of course, we need better coordination of EU intelligence and we should make sure we make the most up to date technology equipment, but we should also be careful not to overburden passengers. That is why the Commission is invited to consider the creation of an EU pre-check system where passengers could voluntarily register in order to go through smooth security checks once at the airport. There are many more [topics] in the draft aviation strategy and maybe we will have an opportunity to debate them today.

I welcome your own-initiative report, which provides a comprehensive view of the aviation sector.  I would like to thank Mr Telička and Mr Christensen for their hard work, as well as the other committees involved. Aviation clearly matters to our economy and citizens. We are talking about more than two million direct jobs and a direct contribution of EUR 110 billion to the EU economy. EU aviation today represents 26% of the world market. It therefore deserves all our attention.  It is clear that we have our work cut out – all actors, both at national and European level – so allow me to turn to the key points raised in your report. First, regarding the internal market, I fully support swift progress on the blocked aviation files. Each year around EUR 5 billion are wasted because we have not been making progress with the Single European Sky. I fully agree with your call for completing the EU single market for aviation. In this regard, the Commission will launch this year a feasibility study for the creation of a single European upper airspace to see how that could contribute concretely to the efficiency of our skies.  On foreign investment, the Commission welcomes your continued support and interest in the EU-level comprehensive aviation agreements. In line with our commitments, we will keep you fully informed at all stages of the negotiations. Related to the competitiveness of the EU aviation sector, I take note of the emphasis you put on attracting foreign investment. This is closely linked to the importance of having fair competition. We are currently working on new measures aimed to promote or safeguard regional and overall connectivity in Europe, as announced in the Aviation Strategy. These measures are expected in the spring and should include the following: first, new guidelines on ownership and control rules to bring clarity and facilitate their application; second, new guidelines on public service obligation; third, a proposal to replace Regulation No 868/2004 on unfair practices with more effective instruments, our objective being to present a credible instrument that will allow us to act effectively when EU air carriers are injured because of the discriminatory practices originating from third countries; and last, but not least, guidelines for ATM service continuity.  On the third topic, standards, let me first say a few words on safety. I am pleased to note your support for our proposal on the revision of the aviation safety basic regulation and in particular that EASA should be equipped with sufficient resources and staff. I look forward to a trialogue on this file, which should have started this Monday, and I sincerely hope that a new date will be agreed without further delay. A lot of progress has been made so far and I am confident that we will conclude this file under the Maltese Presidency.  On the environment issue, following ICAO’s landmark agreement, we are now focused on getting the global scheme up and running. We are serious about achieving carbon-neutral growth for aviation and we will provide technical and financial assistance to make it happen globally. Aviation is a global business and no country must be left behind. In its proposal adopted earlier this month, the Commission is proposing to continue with the current geographic scope of the EU emissions trading systems for aviation, covering flights between airports in the European economic area. This will ensure a level playing field and equal treatment for all airlines flying in Europe. On social issues, let me now touch upon the social policy elements of your report. As noted in our Aviation Strategy, aircrew face legal complex issues due to their high mobility. In May 2016 the Commission published guidelines to help pilots and cabin crews by clarifying the legal regime applicable to mobile workers. Furthermore, the EU Court of Justice is expected this year to provide interpretation of these matters, in particular as regards the home base of aircrews. We are evaluating the concept of whether this notion of principal place of business is still fit for purpose. This is part of our ongoing evaluation of the air service regulation and this work should be completed next year, as foreseen in the Aviation Strategy.  The Commission is committed to strengthening social dialogue in aviation. The Sectoral Social Dialogue Committee on Civil Aviation offers opportunities for the aviation social partners and the Commission to better assess and address together the social challenges of aviation. Moving on to safety, let me be clear that the same safety standards apply to everyone, regardless of their employment relationships. Safety is our top priority and EASA is continuously examining the safety aspects of emerging business models. We will continue to closely monitor developments in the market and take action where necessary. Social dialogue is essential. The Commission is active and works closely with social partners, the Member States and all stakeholders when addressing these matters.

As we look back over the last 20-30 years and look at the benefits of liberalisation and single skies in our airspace and what that has meant for businesses, for jobs, for tourism, connecting people, regions and cities – that was bold, that was ambitious and that has led to the growth of low-cost airlines connecting people across Europe. Now we need the next tranche, the next wave of ambition. The aviation agreements are urgent and they need to progress, and I think this was outlined clearly in the committee’s report.  Europe is important in terms of aviation but that importance is slipping, and we now see growth in the Middle East, Asia and the Pacific area. So we need to facilitate our European airlines and the aviation sector to tap into the growth potential of the fast-growing external markets. We know well the benefits of external aviation agreements. I mean, look at Morocco, at the way activity has doubled, the Balkan states, doubled, similarly with Canada and the US.  So the aviation air agreements, we have seen, are urgent, are important. We also need to look at ourselves and recognise that there are difficulties. Congestion is going to be a difficulty. We know that by 2035 two million flights will be lost due to airport capacity shortage in our airports. That will cost money and that will cost jobs. We also have the challenges of environmental targets and, of course, the files that are still sitting have not been resolved: single European sky, slot regulation, passenger rights.

And, therefore, turning our eyes from heaven to earth also means taking into account that the exponential growth that the democratization of travel has brought with this market opening has also brought about some problems; for example, airport capacity problems.

It has been excellent to work so closely with him again on this fantastic new aviation report, 99% of which is excellent in my opinion and has my full support. However, a serious problem arose because the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs was granted exclusive competence on the Social Agenda under Rule 54. Unbelievably their text infers that professional pilots on European airlines are employed on illegal, bogus contracts, thereby putting passengers in danger. None of their references are evidence-based and, in addition, comments regarding business models, such as ‘home base’ criteria, also have no place in this report, showing breathtaking ignorance, as 70% of flights across Europe come under general aviation.  Aviation is the most highly regulated form of transport. It is held to the most stringent legal safety standards with contracts of both pilots and crew having to be compliant with EASA EU OPS and flight time limitations. Therefore, these accusations are misleading, provocative and have no foundation. To make matters worse, we have been unable to amend the contribution by the Employment Committee. We have already made numerous references to good working conditions, high-skill jobs and training throughout the report, not least because all of us here support good jobs and good contracts of employment.  To conclude, this sends out the wrong signals for this committee. To suggest it is not safe for European citizens to fly on European carriers is quite disgraceful. Why should they book flights?

Yes, the Commission had already made a very good proposal for the aviation strategy in Europe. Now there is a very good report from Pavel Telička, whom I would also like to thank very much. It really is like this: We have more and more people in the world and the air is getting fuller and fuller - not only with passengers, but also with freight that has to be transported. I think it's a good idea that Pavel Telička said: We need some kind of motorway in the air. We already have that: we have motorways, we have motorways of the sea, now we also need motorways - although of course there are no cars - in the air. So we really have to think about how to make space for everyone there. Then we have to capture everything that flies. It's not just about the big passenger planes, it's also about small private planes, it's about drones, there are many things that have to be regulated, and all of that is recorded and named here. We need fair competition, not just between airports. International: Frankfurt, for example - I'm German now - has already lost its importance as a transfer airport and has been overtaken by Istanbul. It is also the case that there is a lot of competition, especially with the airlines, where you ask yourself: Is everything still fair? Do we need new rules of the game? Of course we need innovation. We have to become more environmentally friendly in air transport. I'm already waiting for the first airplane to run on algae fuel - that would be really awesome.

Admittedly, it is positive with increased mobility, but at the same time we must realize that emissions from aviation are escalating climate change.

For us Greens, it is of the utmost importance that aviation - just like all other modes of transport - pays for its climate costs and reduces its environmental impact. Neither current emissions trading, technology development nor other investments, such as green approaches, are sufficient to achieve this. We want to create fair rules of the game that improve the competitiveness of environmentally friendly alternatives such as the expansion of high-speed lines, comfortable night trains or even support for the development of more sustainable fuels for aviation. It is unreasonable that aviation should not bear its own costs, that they should avoid paying taxes and VAT and that so many airports are subsidized with tax money. Finally: Yesterday we voted on the reform of the EU emissions trading scheme. It was also intended to put a clear price on the climate impact of aviation. Unfortunately, yesterday's vote was another toothless reform that will not bring us closer to fulfilling the Paris Agreement.

I understand that the key aspects of the European Union's aviation strategy are competition, security and the single European sky. That's important. I understand that the proposals made by the rapporteur, Pavel Telička, from the development of the aviation model to the improvement of safety, are necessary. I also believe that the European Union's policy in the field of air transport should change from strict regulation in the field of internal competition and the position of punishers to the pursuit of a dominant position in the global air transport market, in its role as coordinator of enlargement. Small airports should be a priority for the European Union, and I therefore call on the Commission to pay special attention to them and to provide the Member States with more effective financial instruments and instruments to help keep small regional airports, especially on the periphery.

I do not understand why, when we are constantly talking about youth employment, we are not talking about attention, support for sports aviation, sports airports. I don’t understand why the demands on aviation organizations, especially those many of which are public, are growing uncontrollably, simply unstoppably. Why are the demands on private users, four-, two-seater planes, growing so fast that they will soon be the same as Boeing’s? I don’t understand the engineers-designers who build new, fast, safe planes and fight for every kilometer of speed, and when we arrive at the airport, we spend hours upon hours waiting for checks in the aisles. I don’t understand many airplane delays. I think that in the modern age of technology, this is not just due to meteorological conditions. I also do not understand how the rights of citizens are protected when they get on the air port, they find an airline striking.I missed that in strategy, p.P.

By dint of wanting too much and too often deregulating for reasons of profitability, the European Union has created a framework which, ultimately, benefits much more to foreign companies and low-cost than to our historical national companies, which pay today this excessive hunting for savings. The observation is clear, whether for the large incumbent operators or the main airports, large-scale developments are taking place outside the European Union. Only the aviation industry seems to be doing well, but at what cost? Despite its commercial successes, for example, the Airbus group has resorted to relocations, reduced its budgets devoted to research and development, and reduced its workforce. Also, I vigorously dispute the expression \"inadmissible tendency to protectionism\", which the rapporteur has inserted in his text, because I believe that it is the reverse logic which is inadmissible, that which nevertheless presides in the institutions of the 'European Union for forty years and which has established free trade as a dogma in the name of a sacrosanct free and undistorted competition, which we can clearly see that it is a lure, including in the air sector facing these years, to unfair competition from Gulf companies. Finally, I am not too surprised, Mr Rapporteur, that you share the mercantilist vision of the Commission, since you yourself have been a member of this institution, but I consider, for my part, that it is perfectly appropriate that the public authorities defend the employment of their nationals and protect their companies. If some believe that advocating a protective framework for our airline industry is populist, then I readily accept it as a compliment. Indeed, I cannot bring myself to see several airlines disappear or fall into the hands of foreign companies, because states are not allowed to save them. Nor do I resign myself to the emergence of these new business models of pay-to-fly, letterbox companies, zero-hour contracts and bogus self-employment. On this last point, on the other hand, I can only welcome the recommendations made by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, but I nevertheless remain cautious about the will of the Commission to apply them, because in general, the latter is reluctant to sanction this type of behavior, which nevertheless harms the safety of flight crews and passengers.

That this is a major problem for both pilots and consumers was shown by a study by the London School of Economics last year. In it, many pilots indicated that they are dealing with fatigue complaints and those fatigue complaints are actually not taken seriously by these types of airlines. I am very concerned about that situation. Pay to fly is an absurd construction and actually stands for an organizational culture with great risks.

However, it is extremely welcome that we are voting today in support of calls to protect the rights of workers throughout the sector. In contrast to what some others have said, most reasonable people in this Parliament agree there is ample evidence of the problems of precarious employment in the sector for pilots, cabin crew and ground staff and we must address this together.

I am pleased that Mr Telička has paid due attention in this report to the issue of air transport accessibility, which varies greatly between regions and between Member States. With the current level of mobility, having affordable connections and airports relatively close to home is extremely important. This availability can be ensured through free competition in the aviation market, including involving non-Union players and low-cost airlines, and an appropriate level of infrastructure investment.

It is noted that Fraport operates Frankfurt Airport and airports in the Balkans. Given that Fraport's shareholder is Lufthansa, it is becoming clear that Fraport now has a monopoly position in the Greek market, turning Greece into a German tourist protectorate.

I would like to respond to all of you, but the time is really limited, so I will try to focus only on a couple of issues. I hope we can have a further discussion through the bilateral meetings on all the topics you raised. First, just very quickly, on biofuels: in our low emission and mobility strategy we were very clear about the importance of alternative energies for transport. I have to say that, for aviation, biofuels are currently the only alternative which we will fully support.  On the topic of multimodality, which rolls with the same topic, and air quality, multimodality is certainly a very positive environmental impact, notably regarding local air quality, so we designed the TEN-T corridors fully multimodal. It has been estimated that many of the indirect CO2 emissions at airports originate from surface access transport. Developing important public transport systems is therefore key, both for environmental reasons and for fairer competition between airport modes, and we are pursuing this goal. On regional airports: these deliver very positive economic and other benefits for the communities they serve. In recent years, regional airports have begun to pursue commercial objectives and are competing with each other to attract air traffic. In this new competitive environment, public funding of regional airports may distort competition between regional airports, so allow me at this point to also mention state-aid rules, which are necessary to ensure a level playing field between regional airports. Our guidance makes clear under which conditions public funding can be justified.  Regarding the pre-check and pre-clearance programmes, the Commission is aware that at least one important international partner has commenced and implemented an expedited screening programme, so-called PreCheck, for so-called ‘trusted travellers’. As a prerequisite, such travellers need to enrol and a programme determines the level of risk posed by the individual. This issue is therefore worth exploring further.  Pre-clearance: the Commission has noted the US Preclearance programme which aims at facilitating and rendering more expeditious the process of their arrival in the US. A number of major airports in the Union and their respective state’s authorities has been approached and consulted, in order to have such an arrangement in place. This needs a series of procedural and infrastructural modifications to the current configuration in place at Union airports. EU funding on preclearance will be considered further. Regarding pay-to-fly: new employment models have emerged, such as pay-to-fly for flight crew. There is no evidence that safety is negatively impacted but the Commission and the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) are continuing to monitor the pay-to-fly scheme. I have already used up my time, so I am happy to discuss all other questions at the bilateral meetings. Thank you very much for your attention and I am really happy that we are on board together to make sure that aviation remains one of the success stories of the European Union.

I must say I have truly enjoyed working jointly with you and I appreciate your input. You have contributed immensely. Secondly, in reaction to some of the comments: Mrs Konečná said that she is happy that I backed off on the social issues. Well, I am afraid that she cannot recall the deliberations because she did not have the time to join us for one single meeting, otherwise she would know that the social aspects were present from the very beginning. The difficulty that I had was when we received an opinion from the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs which was as long as the draft report itself. Then it was extremely difficult to accommodate it. I think we need to have a certain sort of discipline. So I am glad that, together with the rapporteur from the Employment Committee, we then managed to shrink it, but as I say, it has always been present.  Secondly, on the COP: you know, it depends how we write reports. We can have a report of 20-30 pages mentioning the COPs, as important as they are – COP21 certainly – all the elements, all the documents, but nobody will read it. I am rather in favour of reports that will outline exactly the tools, the instruments with which we will manage to do it. I invite you to have a look at, for example, the connectivity index. It is there; I mean this is the tool with which we can really arrive at the outcome.  I do have a dream. My dream is that I wake up one day in the morning, I decide with the family or without to fly in the evening; that I will look at the internet, I will buy an integrated ticket which will take me from my village to Prague, then to the airport, then from the airport to another airport, and then by train – integrated ticketing, integrated modes of transport; that I will get to the airport and I will be safe; that there will be pre-screening with no extra hassle, but still security will matter; I will fly on a plane, whether it is European or international, which will have low emissions, which will be quiet, a plane with a rested crew, etc.; I will arrive without any disruption of traffic.

This situation has resulted, as in all sectors subject to strong competitive pressure due to aggressive liberalization policies, in a deterioration in the working conditions of employees of European airlines. Thus, certain abuses such as “zero hour” contracts or “independent” work are now proven in some of these companies.

As you know, the European Union follows very closely the situation on human rights in Nicaragua and we had been monitoring the case of Ms Ramirez. In this instance, the European Union delegation contacted her to find out her situation during the police seizure of her vehicles, which she finally recovered. International media attention probably played a role in the rapid return of her property. This is, of course, a satisfactory outcome for an unfortunate situation that could have been avoided in the first place. The EU, however, remains vigilant. The authorities of Nicaragua must ensure that all human rights defenders can express their legitimate opinions without fear of retaliation. Through continuing contacts and monitoring, the European Union draws attention, whenever it is necessary, to human rights issues and specific situations. Increased visibility, as has been the case with Ms Ramirez, may help to resolve or minimise human rights organisations’ and defenders’ difficulties. EU officials at all levels have regular contact with key local and international civil-society organisations, human rights organisations and activists. When necessary, the EU delegation and Member States have raised – and they will continue to raise – human rights issues with Government officials. The EU and the Member States have a number of programmes and projects to support Nicaraguan and other Central American civil-society organisations. Like any other civil-society organisation, Francesca Ramirez’s organisation can apply to benefit from EU development cooperation funds, and information sessions are regularly held at local level in order to explain the process to all the interested organisations. Among the human right priorities, the delegation and Member States’ embassies present in Nicaragua have decided to focus on improving the rule of law, promoting gender and LGBTI rights, as well as social, education health rights, and encouraging civil society to participate actively in the national development agenda and in the defence of fundamental rights. I would like to take this opportunity to reassert the European Union’s commitment to human rights in Nicaragua and to reiterate the EU’s pledge to contribute to human rights defenders’ security, well-being and dignity.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Liberals and centrists"}, {"id": 47, "date": "2017-02-16.json", "name": "Dimitrios PAPADIMOULIS", "mepid": "28586", "text": "I have received six motions for resolutions to end this debate.The discussion is over.The vote will take place on Thursday 16 February 2016.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "GUE/NGL", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Left-wing"}, {"id": 48, "date": "2017-02-16.json", "name": "Dimitrios PAPADIMOULIS", "mepid": "28586", "text": "The next item on the agenda is the debate on the executions in Kuwait and Bahrain (2017/2564 (RSP))", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "GUE/NGL", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Left-wing"}, {"id": 49, "date": "2017-02-16.json", "name": "Cristian Dan PREDA", "mepid": "96838", "text": "author. - Mr President, the PPE Group strongly condemns the recent executions in Bahrain and Kuwait as well as the fact that these two countries have ended the moratorium on the death penalty put in place many years ago.

As you know, and all of you said, the European Union has a strong principled position on the death penalty and it is always worth reaffirming this, in particular in cases where countries have not implemented the death penalty for some time, thus giving rise to the hope that a de facto moratorium will be applied. On 15 January 2017, the Bahraini authorities carried out the execution of three people who were convicted of a bomb attack against the police which killed three policemen, including an Emirati officer. As we stressed in the statement made by the spokesman for the Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, this case was particularly disappointing as it represented a serious step back, given that Bahrain had suspended executions for seven years. In addition, civil-society organisations have voiced concerns about possible violation of the right to a fair trial and due process for the three convicted, and an allegation of torture during the investigations. Most of all, we are concerned that this case might result in a resumption of executions in Bahrain. We are following, in particular, the cases of Mohammed Ramadan and Hussein Moussa, which bear strong similarities with the case of those recently executed.  On 25 January 2017 the Kuwaiti authorities executed seven people – four men and three women convicted for different criminal offences. This is the first execution in Kuwait since 2013. The External Action Service also issued a public statement on this case expressing our wish to see Kuwait returning to its previous de facto moratorium. Although recognising the serious nature of the crimes involved, we thought it was useful, because it always is, to reiterate the EU’s opposition to the use of the death penalty in all circumstances, without exception. The use of the death penalty represents an unacceptable denial of human dignity and integrity and, contrary to what some people argue, experience worldwide has demonstrated that it also fails to act as a deterrent to crime. In addition, it makes any miscarriage of justice – and those can happen in any legal system – irreversible. We look forward to continuing to engage with you and we will continue to do our utmost to ensure that this issue will be raised with the relevant authorities in Bahrain and Kuwait, as in any other country which applies the death penalty – because, of course, there are still many. We are aware that the fact of the death penalty is recognised in the legal systems of these countries but we know that authorities in other countries in similar situations have developed a pragmatic approach and have started to apply a moratorium. That is what we constantly encourage countries such as Bahrain and Kuwait to do. We will continue also, through the work with like-minded partners, with civil society and in various multilateral forums, to promote a global moratorium on the death penalty. We will be looking forward to working with you on this.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Liberals and centrists"}, {"id": 71, "date": "2017-02-16.json", "name": "Ryszard CZARNECKI", "mepid": "28372", "text": "I have received seven motions for a resolution tabled in accordance with Art.135 of the Regulations.I close the debate.The vote will take place on Thursday 16 February 2016.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "ECR", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 72, "date": "2017-02-16.json", "name": "Ryszard CZARNECKI", "mepid": "28372", "text": "The next item is the debate on the seven motions for resolutions on Guatemala, in particular the situation of human rights defenders (2017/2565 (RSP)).", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "ECR", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 73, "date": "2017-02-16.json", "name": "Gabriel MATO", "mepid": "96936", "text": "Author. - Mr. President, dear Commissioner: twenty years of the Guatemala Peace Accords; long way to go, but still a long way to go.

The promotion of human rights is a key principle which guides our action globally and therefore we follow closely the situation in the country.  While the overall population in Guatemala is suffering from widespread violation of human rights and violence, human rights defenders continue to be particularly affected, especially indigenous leaders, journalists, trade unionists, LGBTI communities and members of the judiciary. Although in 2015 and 2016, reports of aggression incidents have fallen compared to previous years, assassinations have increased and acts of intimidation and defamation are on the rise. Fourteen activists were killed last year alone, and the year of 2017 has sadly already witnessed the murder of yet another human rights defender.  The EU has strongly condemned these hideous crimes and urged the effective prosecution of material and intellectual authors. Limited capacities and resources have hindered the provision of an adequate response by the State’s institutions, and together with a perception of corruption and impunity, provoke mistrust of the institutions. This makes EU cooperation and partnership with Guatemala to consolidate institutions even more important.  The Guatemalan authorities have taken a series of decisions that point in the right direction and therefore deserve praise and support, such as the extension of the mandate of the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala up to 2019 and the prosecution of alleged corruption cases, including at high level. Still, more needs to be done to address the situation. This year will be of significant importance for Guatemala with the preparation of the 28th session of the Human Rights Council Universal Periodic Review. Numerous legislative initiatives are being discussed in the Congress, inter alia the constitutional reforms, that many of you referred to, in the justice sector, the policy of the protection of human rights defenders, the abolishment of the death penalty, which if properly designed and adopted and effectively implemented may constitute significant progress for human rights. Other areas for further progress include the establishment of a mechanism for free and informed prior consultations in line with ILO Convention 169, and the implementation of precautionary measures granted by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights to activists. Respect for human rights is a key commitment of the EU agenda in Guatemala. The EU is supporting and encouraging efforts on human rights challenges, including women and children’s rights, prison conditions, police behaviour, allegations of torture, corruption, collusion and impunity.  The EU has also renewed its support to the International Commission against Impunity and will further engage to support anti-corruption and prevention of violence against women and children. The EU Special Representative for Human Rights also visited Guatemala last June and had the opportunity to recall the imperious necessity to improve the situation.  And finally, I would like to take this occasion to pay tribute to all the activists that selflessly and at great risk continue to fight for human rights, good governance and the rule of law in Guatemala.

C’est un privilège pour moi d’être ici aujourd’hui. C’est la première fois qu’un Premier ministre canadien en poste prend la parole devant le Parlement européen. Aussi, je tiens sincèrement à vous remercier de m’accorder cet honneur. Comme vous le savez, j’étais à Bruxelles, il y a quelques mois, pour signer officiellement l’accord économique et commercial global et l’accord de partenariat stratégique. Le Président Tusk, le Président Juncker, le Premier ministre Fico et moi-même avons fait un grand pas en vue d’approfondir notre relation et d’accroître les échanges commerciaux libres et progressistes entre le Canada et l’Union européenne. Et hier, nous avons franchi une étape importante.  This year we celebrate 41 years since the diplomatic mission of the European Commission was established in Ottawa, which noticeably happened under a different Prime Minister Trudeau (‘plus ça change…’), and over the course of our historic partnership Canada and the EU have stood side by side on the things that matter, things like maintaining global security, advancing the values of peace and justice, creating good jobs for our people through trade and investment. We have worked together on climate change and on the rights of women and girls around the world. And, my friends, I am confident that we will achieve tremendous things together in the years to come for the countries we represent and, most importantly, for the people we serve.  The European Union is a truly remarkable achievement and an unprecedented model for peaceful cooperation. Canada knows that an effective European voice on the global stage isn’t just preferable, it’s essential. We know that the EU is the world’s largest donor of development and humanitarian assistance and that together your Member States constitute one of the world’s largest economies. You are a vital player in addressing the challenges that we collectively face as an international community. Indeed, the whole world benefits from a strong EU.  (Applause)  Au nom des Canadiens, je tiens à vous remercier pour cette relation soutenue et respectueuse ancrée dans notre culture, notre histoire et notre amitié. En fait, les liens qui unissent le Canada et l’Union européenne sont devenus un exemple de collaboration internationale.  J’aimerais remercier Dan Costello, l’ambassadeur actuel du Canada auprès de l’Union européenne, d’avoir servi notre pays de façon exemplaire.  Je dois aussi remercier et souligner le travail extraordinaire de notre négociateur en chef pour cet accord historique, Steve Verheul, pour son service exceptionnel, son travail acharné tout au long de chacune des étapes qu’il a été nécessaire de franchir ces dernières années. Merci. Je tiens aussi à souligner la nomination de notre nouveau porte-parole senior pour le continent européen, notre nouvel ambassadeur pour l’Union européenne et pour l’Allemagne, l’honorable Stéphane Dion. Stéphane, qui est pour moi un ami proche et un mentor, est un homme qui s’est longtemps battu pour faire de notre pays un endroit meilleur pour tous les Canadiens. Il représentera fièrement le Canada, avec courage et conviction, alors que nous amorçons ensemble ce nouveau chapitre important. Maintenant, permettez-moi de souligner encore une fois à quel point je suis honoré de représenter le Canada dans ce lieu historique aujourd’hui. C’était une priorité pour moi de venir à Strasbourg et de m’adresser à vous, parce que j’accorde beaucoup de valeur à notre relation et à ce que nous partageons. I believe that the relationship between Canada and the EU is so resilient because it is centred on an important bedrock of common values, values that shape and define us, values that Canadians and Europeans share. You see, collectively, we believe in democracy, transparency and the rule of law. We believe in human rights and we believe in inclusion and in diversity. We know that, in these times, we must choose to lead the international economy, not simply be subject to its whims, and we know that the state has an important role to play, not only in supporting its people, but also in creating the conditions for progress. And to this last point, we have just demonstrated to the world that we collectively value trade and the promise of prosperity for all our citizens that comes with it.   Hier, en plus d’avoir ratifié l’accord de partenariat stratégique, ce Parlement a voté en faveur de la ratification de l’accord économique et commercial global (AECG). Après des années de négociation, cet important accord commercial s’apprête à franchir la ligne d’arrivée. Je pense que nous pouvons tous nous entendre pour dire que l’AECG était un projet extrêmement ambitieux et, donc, s’avérera aussi être l’une de nos plus grandes réalisations. J’aimerais exprimer ma sincère reconnaissance à l’ancienne ministre du Commerce international du Canada, qui est maintenant notre ministre des Affaires étrangères, Chrystia Freeland, encore une fois, à notre négociateur en chef, Steeve Verheul, ainsi qu’à leurs homologues de l’Union européenne pour les efforts inlassables qu’ils ont déployés en vue de conclure cet accord. Je suis certain que notre nouveau ministre du Commerce international, François-Philippe Champagne, sera une voix forte pour le Canada sur la scène internationale au cours des prochaines années. Je sais que je peux compter sur les nombreux talents de François-Philippe pour travailler avec la communauté d’affaires et tous les citoyens dans le but de franchir les étapes nécessaires afin que cet accord atteigne son plein potentiel. Now let’s be clear. A deal as ambitious as CETA takes a lot of hard work. Every one of us in this room knows that it wasn’t easy. It took a lot of back and forth. It took extended discussions and negotiations, meetings in Canada, meetings in Europe. We can’t overstate how important it was to get this deal right. Trade needs to work for people, for people who are struggling to make ends meet and raise their families, for people who worry that their future or their children’s future won’t hold the same promise and opportunities that it did for past generations. The people we represent will support trade if it creates better jobs and makes their lives more affordable. That’s what they expect of us, and I for one fully intend to make sure that we deliver.  (Applause) My friends, we are all seasoned politicians in this room. We know it is always much, much easier to point out problems than it is to solve them. It’s harder to work to build than it is to tear things down. Well, with CETA we have built something, something important, especially at this moment, on your continent and mine. Now we need to make it work for your people and mine. If we are successful, CETA will become the blueprint for all ambitious future trade deals. If we are not, this could well be one of the last. So make no mistake about it, this is an important moment. The motto of the European Union, ‘United in Diversity’, is a great reminder of what can be accomplished when we recognise that we are stronger, not in spite of our differences but because of them.  (Applause) Now we live in a time when many people are worried that the current system only benefits society’s luckiest few, and their concern is valid. The anxiety people have toward the economy and trade, the worry that our kids won’t have access to the same jobs and opportunities that we had, can be addressed only if we ensure the trade is inclusive so that everyone benefits. And this agreement, the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, delivers just that, because at its heart CETA is a framework for trade that works for everyone.  Cet accord mènera à la création de bons emplois bien rémunérés pour la classe moyenne. Il permettra d’assurer le bien-être des familles et contribuera à faire croître et à renforcer nos communautés. Disons que vous êtes un jeune entrepreneur qui propose un nouveau produit ou une solution novatrice et que vous faites face au grand défi d’atteindre de nouveaux consommateurs: l’AECG vient de vous ouvrir la porte vers de nouveaux marchés. Vous êtes un consommateur qui souhaite acheter des biens importés, mais vous les trouvez trop chers? Prenons, par exemple, les magnifiques bottes d’hiver Mukluks fabriquées par Manitobah, une entreprise canadienne fondée par des autochtones, sont actuellement assujetties à une taxe européenne de 17 %. Grâce à la ratification de l’AECG, ces tarifs douaniers sont éliminés et vous, en tant que consommateur, pourrez payer moins cher lorsque vous passerez à la caisse si vous voulez de magnifiques bottes d’hiver! Trade that is free and fair means we can make the lives of our citizens more affordable and create more jobs, it means that manufacturers can expand their products’ global reach, gaining market share, and successfully compete with the best in the world. And it means that folks working in service sectors like engineering, architecture and information technology will see greater predictability and transparency when dealing with international clients. At the end of the day, both Canada and the EU want to do what is best for our people. We want  hard-working people to make a good living and support their families. We want mums and dads to be able to give their kids better opportunities than they ever had. We want each generation of Canadians and Europeans to be better off and to have a higher standard of living than the one that preceded it.  Deals like CETA, which is centred on the idea of trade that is both free and fair, will get us there at the end of the day by making it easier to buy and sell products. We can expand opportunities for our businesses, both back in Canada and right across the EU, for everyone – for small businesses, for entrepreneurs, for hard-working farmers and fishers. We can create jobs for the middle class and make sure that the benefits of trade reach our citizens. Mais, soyons clairs, il ne s’agit pas uniquement de commerce, d’importations, d’exportations ou de profits; il s’agit d’améliorer la vie des gens. L’AECG est un plan d’action complet pour assurer une coopération économique responsable entre les pays. Cet accord moderne, axé sur l’avenir, est le reflet d’un agenda commercial réellement progressiste avec des dispositions qui protègent la capacité qu’ont les sociétés à favoriser l’intérêt public.  L’AECG assure que les gouvernements peuvent continuer de protéger leurs citoyens: protéger la main-d’œuvre, promouvoir les pratiques responsables en matière d’investissement, assurer la salubrité des aliments et la sécurité des consommateurs, renforcer la gestion des forêts, des pêches et de l’aquaculture, et assurer la bonne gestion de l’environnement.  Mes amis, il s’agit véritablement de l’un des accords commerciaux les plus durables et progressistes au monde. À tous les députés présents, merci du travail acharné que vous avez accompli au cours des dernières années pour faire de cet objectif ambitieux une réalité. Je sais que tous nos citoyens s’en trouveront mieux servis.  Canada and the European Union have been friends, partners and allies for a very long time, and our natural, easy relationship is grounded in what we have in common. We share goals and aspirations for a better, safer and fairer world. We want to do what is right by the workers and families we were elected to represent. And we embrace change, seeking the opportunity to lead in a global economy that is constantly evolving. CETA and the SPA, these landmark agreements, are a direct reflection of what we have in common, and they will serve to benefit Canadians and Europeans alike for generations to come. In the things we have agreed upon so far, and in the discussions that lie ahead, the Canada-EU strategic partnership will forever be rooted in respect with an eye to the future. My friends, dear colleagues, it’s safe to say that this is just the beginning for Canada and the European Union. The best is very much yet to come.

I see this as a clear answer to citizens who are worried about their security, and I think that is exactly what they expect from the European Parliament and the European Union. I welcome the unification of facts across the Member States. The directive introduces offenses of traveling abroad for the purpose of terrorism, criminal sanctioning of terrorist trainers, participation in the activities of terrorist groups, etc. The draft directive also responds adequately to the phenomenon of increasing numbers of individuals traveling abroad for terrorism, so-called foreign fighters. The directive therefore introduces a mandatory exchange of information on the movement of potential perpetrators of terrorist acts and gives more rights to victims of terrorist acts and strengthens their protection in the field of health care, legal aid. I therefore think that the draft directive is indeed a successful update of criminal law, which will lead to greater coherence of national provisions of criminal law, and thus respond to the security challenges facing the European Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "cs", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 114, "date": "2017-02-16.json", "name": "Igor ŠOLTES", "mepid": "125003", "text": "   – Mr President, while I agree with the general objective of harmonising the definition of terrorist offences at European Union level, I believe the directive contains also many flaws and challenges.

I am also alarmed by Article 5 on public provocation to terrorism, which criminalises the indirect provocation to commit terrorist offences.

The Commission has to carry out an impact assessment for a compulsory insurance scheme which includes the possibility of giving the legal status of an electronic personality to robots, in order to facilitate compensation for victims when human responsibility cannot be fully attributed.

Such progress brings incredible opportunities for humanity to improve life. But sometimes it's just so apparent. On the other hand, this area raises, opens up a large number of questions and risks. In many cases, machines are already replacing people in the work process. In fact, no one knows what a fully robotic labor market will look like. According to the OECD, the Slovak Republic is the second most endangered economy in this respect in terms of rising unemployment. It is also dangerous for transhumanism to become law. Human rights belong sovereignly to man. Attributing them to artificial intelligence is completely against the natural creative order. I am afraid of the consequences of such an action.
