We have also taken note of the possibility for allies to be excluded from the scope of such measures. We expect that the EU as a whole will be excluded, as a key political, security and economic partner that trades fairly with the United States. The EU and the US are strong historic allies. We share and promote fundamental values such as democracy, the rule of law and human rights. We also believe in, and stand for, an undistorted market economy, as well as open, rule-based and fair trade. In past years, both the US and the EU have faced increased imports and dumping of steel and aluminium – mostly from Asia. To a large extent, this has been the consequence of global overcapacity, in particular in China, fuelled by massive domestic subsidies. As a response, both the EU and the United States have taken action against this in the form of anti-dumping measures on Chinese steel and aluminium imports, which are allowed by the WTO. Thanks to this, our industry has been able to survive for the time being. The problem is not over yet, and this is why we have created a Global Forum on Steel Excess Capacity in which the EU and US work together with China and others to address the root causes of the problem. This group aims at identifying and eliminating overcapacity and the support measures that fuel it. Such work should be expedited. We should also better enforce WTO rules and, ideally, update rules on subsidies which are incomplete and do not cover all situations well. This would provide stronger discipline on massive subsidies that can create distortions and hurt EU and US companies. The EU has already started to work with the US on this agenda. This is why we have created a trilateral cooperation on a level playing field with Japan as well. The first meeting took place this weekend in Brussels, on which Commissioner Malmström will debrief you. Work will accelerate and intensify in the near future. We hope that China will understand the value of a strong rules-based order and join our effort, even if it means going further in the reform of their economic model, where the state still has a strong role. In the meantime, we sincerely hope that the process of exclusion of EU steel and aluminium exports from the scope of US measures will be expedited, transparent and smooth. We believe that our exports do not cause any threat to US security. Commissioner Malmström had a bilateral exchange with US Trade Representative Lighthizer on this matter in the margins of the trilateral meeting this weekend and can tell you more about this.

This is a US law from the Cold War and it was justified on national security grounds. These measures will enter into force on the night between 22 and 23 March 2018.  We regret the adoption of these measures justifying tariffs on the basis of national security considerations. They risk undermining the multilateral trading system and, moreover, the European Union – which is made up of friends and allies in NATO – is not a threat to the national security of the US. During my meeting with US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer this Saturday, I made it clear to him that we are very disappointed indeed that long-standing allies and security partners from Europe need to justify their exports of steel and aluminium and prove that they are not a threat to US security. We are of the firm view that the EU should be excluded as a whole from the Section 232 measures announced next week, and I made this very clear to Ambassador Lighthizer.  Unfortunately, I did not leave Saturday’s meeting with sufficient clarity regarding the exclusions. We are in contact with my US counterpart to obtain more clarity as soon as possible and we have been told that the US Trade Representative will publish a more detailed outline of the procedures for the exclusions very soon on their website.  This would be very damaging to transatlantic relations and to the global rules system, which is based on a common global order that we have constructed together with our US partners. If the EU is not exempted from the measures, there will have to be a firm and resolute, but proportionate, response. We are continuing the preparations to ensure that we can respond, in line with WTO rules, in the event that we are not excluded from the scope of the Section 232 measures. Last week, the College of Commissioners discussed three strands of work for future measures that would defend our interests and those of the trading system. They will be fully in line with international obligations and in accordance with WTO procedures.  The first strand is that we would exercise our rights in the WTO. We are talking to friends and partners across the world who are also affected by the Section 232 decisions and who would be impacted by this measure. We are seeing if we can coordinate our rights in the WTO. But WTO proceedings take time, so we are also looking at other, more immediate, measures. The second track would be to protect our market from potentially significant trade diversion.  By the US’s own assessment, steel imports should be reduced by 13 million tonnes, and there could be a surge of steel or aluminium imports into the EU following US tariffs. We are therefore preparing to put in our own safeguard measures while maximising our openness. We urge our trading partners to do likewise. We do not want to encourage further closing of the steel and aluminium markets.  We suspect that the US’s steps are not actually based on security considerations, but that they are economic safeguard measures in disguise. We are therefore entitled to use the WTO safeguard agreement to rebalance the benefits we have granted to the US in the past. These allow for measures corresponding to the economic loss suffered, and we are discussing different US products.  So these are the three tracks we are discussing. We are ready to act in a proportionate way according to WTO rules. We do not want things to escalate. We do not share the view that trade wars are good and that they are easy to win. On the contrary, they are very bad for the world and they are very easy to lose. So things should not be escalated; we will manoeuvre carefully, but of course we need to protect the interests of the citizens and our jobs.  Dialogue with the US is intense. It is continuing this week, and we hope that very soon we can report to you in more detail on the outcome of this. Thank you very much, and I am looking forward to the debate.

The Group of the European People's Party has requested today's debate and has been gratefully supported by the other colleagues. Today's signal we need is that the European Parliament is fully behind the European Commission. We are united as Europeans and we want to respond together to the challenge of tariffs on steel and aluminium. My group, the European People's Party, stands for free world trade. We have documented and demonstrated this in recent votes, for example on CETA, and we know that in recent decades, trade has led to the world as a whole becoming richer. South Korea, Turkey, many countries in Africa, including China, have benefited massively from world trade, making the world more prosperous overall. And Europe's prosperity is also deliberately based on trade. We are competitive, we have good products, we are creative, and the world envies us for these products. The third positive argument in favour of world trade is the impact on the consumer: the choice is increasing, the products will be cheaper — all will benefit. So, yes to world trade. The second thing that is important to us is the question: what is happening in the US and how do we assess the measures? From the point of view of the Group of the European People's Party, there is no justification for the current measures against the European Union. What security interests should be affected? There is no dumping in the European Union. The measures are unjustified and it affects jobs. The EPP will not tolerate this. A third point is important to us that we are now discussing adequate measures, as Cecilia Malmström presented them. We in the Group of the European People's Party believe that the measures that are being discussed in the Commission are adequate measures are. We must not overreact, but we must respond decisively. We therefore believe that this is going in the right direction. We need unity and determination now. And for the fourth, we need to talk. We have to argue and convince each other, for example, that in the US 33 000 jobs are linked to the production of steel, but more than 180 000 jobs are attached to the processing of steel. That means Donald Trump is also damaging his jobs. And we need to finally talk about the real problem, which is China. We need a cap for the European market, direct measures so that there is no overcapacity and even more dumping on the European market. And we need to be able to talk to the US together about China and its overproduction. If we offset the iPhones with the BMW, then there will be a laughing third party, and that's China. This can't happen to us. That is why I would like to thank Paul Ryan and many friends in the United States who, thank God, initiated the discussion. Finally, we should also recognise the opportunities from these debates with the United States. The world is confused about what is happening in Washington. This is true for Mexico, Canada, Japan, Mercosur — they are confused. That is why the European Union can be the region that now offers the partnership with the rest of the world. We feel in the talks that there is a new openness.

It is clear that Mr Trump has imposed these foreclosure tariffs for purely domestic reasons. The election in Pennsylvania, the mid-term review elections in November, are the reasons. Even under American law, it is highly controversial whether these measures are covered by this 1962 Cold War law with national security. There will be some processes. But it cannot be that international law is ultimately being undermined on the basis of domestic policy considerations. And that's what it's about.

The United Kingdom and the European Union are close allies of the United States – the UK both as a Permanent Member of the UN Security Council, and as a nuclear power. The close cooperation between the UK, the EU and the US through NATO and other international forums is the cornerstone of international peace and security. So it is with great regret that we now see the impact that the US decision to impose tariffs on steel and aluminium will have on us here in the EU.  The ECR therefore welcomes the UK and the EU’s clarity that tariffs are not the right way to address the global problem of steel overcapacity. Instead, a multilateral solution is needed. Nonetheless, it is right that the UK and the EU seek to defend our domestic industries from US tariffs, but any countermeasures by the EU must be in accordance with international trade law and should not exacerbate an already tense situation. We should lead by example, to demonstrate that we believe in free trade and the rules-based multilateral trade system. I would like to reiterate the UK’s commitment to working closely with the EU and its partners to consider the scope for exemptions as outlined by the US. However, I would like clarification on three points. Firstly, Canada, Mexico and Australia have been excluded from these measures, with the US citing their close security alliances for this decision. Does the Commission believes that the US is seeking for the EU to negotiate a security agreement to address those concerns? Secondly, is the Commission re-evaluating its measures to tackle the overcapacity of steel?

We saw this during years of negotiating the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), negotiations that are stalled after a dramatic change in the American approach. Normally trade arrangements are certainly not the kind of topic to be shaped in a number of angry tweets one morning – tweets that sent stock markets plummeting and Gary Cohn resigning. We condemn the harsh accusations in the EU’s direction and frankly are puzzled by what we see. Adding insult to injury, the President’s tweets now also speculate about imposing tariffs on European cars and other accusations. For a country that exports so many German cars, this is at least a bad business proposition. Many jobs are created in the US by European companies and vice versa. We don’t live in a zero-sum world but we are actually mutually dependent. Senior officials have suggested national security is the reason to impose broad steel and aluminium tariffs also in Europe, and as allies we believe these arguments are misguided and not justified. The same goes for the notion that individual Member States may negotiate exemptions. American hints at undermining the EU as well as British hints at being open to special treatment can only be read as being made in bad faith and must be challenged, where the British governments will find out soon, if necessary, what the benefits of a common approach globally in the EU are (or were, in their case). For decades the US and the EU have worked together to craft a rules-based system: rules for human rights, war and peace, and also trade. Does that mean that the system or the World Trade Organisation (WTO) is perfect? Not at all. But does history suggest that our citizens benefit from shaping globalisation, from being rule makers instead of rule takers? Absolutely. That is precisely what makes the soundbites of the current US administration so disturbing. Right at the time we need to work together as the liberal democracies of this world to curb unfair trade practices of China and others, we are divided. As Vice-President of the Transatlantic Legislators Dialogue, I look to members of Congress in particular for their leadership and solid affirmation of the Transatlantic Relation.

China has been dumping steel. The European Steel Association (EUROFER) set this out in a statement in October 2015. Secondly, in the United States there are whole communities – indeed large towns – whose industry has been hollowed out, indeed devastated, by competition, competition that has likely been unfair. Thirdly, when running for election, the President of the United States made promises. These promises included tariffs.  Now we, as a party, favour free trade. Indeed, one compelling reason for Brexit is that the European Union is itself protectionist, despite what Mr Weber said. Before anybody blue cards me, that is what the customs union is – there is an external tariff wall. To give just one example, the EU imposes duties on agricultural goods that can be up to 67%. We would of course prefer it if the President of the United States did not introduce new tariffs. Nevertheless, it is important to understand the reasons.  If I may make a suggestion to the EU national governments, the United States would be much more likely to take note of what continental European governments want on tariffs if those same European governments were to spend the two percent of gross domestic product on security that is their obligation. That would be better for a peaceful world than the large EU tariff walls.

You're going to have to do it, President Trump keeps the promises of candidate Trump. While the trade balance experienced a record deficit of $566 billion last year, the United States is responding with strong measures to protect its economy, especially its steel and aluminum industry. Donald Trump announced this counter-offensive in Da Nang, Vietnam, in a speech I mentioned here last November. Today, the European Commission is responding to the US President with senseless threats. And now the high priests of free trade give us their usual sermons, like Mr Moscovici, who declares “protectionism is nationalism and nationalism, it is war”. But that Mr Moscovici, who was one of the most calamitous French ministers of the economy, spare us his hollow and upset formulas. For decades we have been rebeaten with the catechism of the total opening of borders, but these utopias are now crashing on the wall of reality because our continent continues to deindustrialize and hundreds of thousands of jobs have been sacrificed. In France, to speak only of the steel industry, it was the factories in Florange and Gandrange that have been liquidated and our steel production continues to plunge, since it has been halved in ten years. All the world's major powers protect their economy. An American car imported into China is taxed at 25% while a Chinese car in the United States is currently taxed at only 2.5%, that is, ten times less. As a result of Trump's decree, there was much talk about the departure of his advisor, Gary Cohn, but much less of the support given to him by Elon Musk, if any, avant-garde entrepreneur. On the day Trump announced these measures, the European Commission launched a new plan of action against global warming. But the Commission's environmental claims are now in total contradiction with its forced free trade. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions requires relocating economies and bringing production centres closer to places of consumption. That is why the measures of this President, certainly a billionaire, but who defends the middle and popular classes of his country, are legitimate. They must invite us to rethink our economic model. We must end this system of widespread impoverishment in which it is the poor of the rich countries who enrich the rich in poor countries.

The EU, together with Brazil, Canada and Mexico, are the countries most affected by this, but there are others who also export steel. Exactly how it strikes within the European Union: we do not have the figures here but we are of course in close dialogue with the Member States. There are about nine or ten countries affected in the European Union, but the consequences are, of course, much larger. We do not know much about the Australian exceptions. I have also read about it on Twitter. The exceptions for Canada and Mexico are related to a satisfactory outcome of the negotiations of NAFTA, so we are still looking for more information there. In the EU we are security partners to the United States. That goes a long way back. We work together in NATO; we have stood together in Iraq, Afghanistan and many other places in the world; we are cooperating in the fight against IS; and our friendship and strategic partnership goes way back. On tariffs, we need to clarify a few issues. Yes, the EU has tariffs on cars vis-à-vis the US and other countries, but the US has higher tariffs on other items. For instance, there are 25% tariffs on trucks and pickups, and you cannot discuss tariffs unilaterally. We try to take away tariffs in trade agreements. When there are no trade agreements, these are the tariffs, and they are not only vis-à-vis the US, but they are against all countries with whom we do not have a free trade agreement. So that is why you cannot negotiate them individually. It is part of a bigger picture. We believe that this measure is a safeguard in disguise and that the exception that does exist in the WTO, but which is meant to be used for wartime, is misused. So we are confident that we could win such a case in the WTO, and we are reaching out to other friends and allies to see if we can make a joint approach to the WTO. On trade distortions, Ms Arena, that is why we have the safeguard measures that we are ready to put into place. Whether a summit is the way to solve this is beyond my pay grade. I think we have to try to solve these issues quite urgently actually. But as long as the measures have not entered into force, we hope to avoid a significant trade dispute. The root problem, as many of you have said, is over-capacity in the steel and aluminium sectors. Certain countries are using massive subsidies and producing non-market conditions, so the EU and the US should work together on this, and we are doing so. The EU have, from our side, done our part. As you know, with your help, we have modernised the trade defence instruments. We are using them and we are trying to uphold rules against those countries which distort trade or which have unfair practices. That is why we met, together with the US Trade Representative and also with Minister Seko from Japan, this weekend to discuss how we jointly can work to face this challenge. We achieved a to-do list and an action plan and we will meet jointly again. It was a very constructive meeting, and the aim is, of course, to work to improve the level playing field. Protection is never a good answer, and that is why we are reaching out to other parties of the world in order to jointly stand up for the principles of the rules—based international global trading system and the multilateral organisations. WTO is not perfect, but it has served us well – us, the US and many other countries of the world – and we would rather work together to strengthen it and not weaken it. That is why we are also reaching out to other countries and have this very ambitious trading agenda. We are creating a circle of friends with parties across the world who are of the firm belief that trade is a good thing if we make good trade agreements based on fair, sustainable and transparent trade. That is good for our people and for our companies. That is why we stand up to do this within the framework of WTO rules and the global trading system. I want to thank you for the strong support you have given to the Commission and our approach to adopt WTO-compatible measures. We are doing this in a measured and calm way. I also want to thank you because I know many of you have reached out individually to US counterparts in Congress and elsewhere. That is indeed very useful. So thank you very much for this debate.

Both main parties – Republicans and Democrats – share the view on rules-based world order and rules-based trade with us. We have to acknowledge this good cooperation.

I think there are good reasons which both sides will, at the end of the day, accept that we don’t need and we don’t want a trade war. Instead we should concentrate on improving our trading conditions between the two trading blocks and like-minded continents. This incident is a good reminder for all of us: when we want to build or harness globalisation, it must be based on rules-based world order instead of the rule of the strongest.  Trade agreements are good examples of building a rules-based world order. Actually, the reality is as simple as this: we have to choose between the two options. Either we want to have trade agreements which bring values to trade and strengthen the rules-based world order, or then we are in a situation where we are at the moment, where arbitrary decisions can harm all of us.

The situation with Chinese imports of aluminum and steel should have been addressed by the US together with Europe and its allies. If necessary, the terms of trade may be changed, but we must not abandon them altogether.

To counter this, the need to sort out globalization and liberalization processes. The way to this end is through the adoption of certain rules, rules, good practices at world level. Until recently, the World Trade Organisation (WTO) was the forum for adopting such rules, but it is gradually losing its importance, as exemplified by the December talks fiasco at the Ministerial Conference in Buenos Aires. A small role in dismantling the WTO is played by President Trump's administration. Protectionism violates the rules of trade adopted between partners. I did not use the term “violates the principles of the free market” because there are situations where, by bilateral or multilateral agreement, certain preferences for certain participants in the free market are accepted. Such a departure from free market principles, however, must have deep justification. It would be necessary to specify at international level what situation that threatens national interests or security must occur on the market in order to introduce such sharp safeguard arrangements in the form of unilateral decisions, without any arrangements, consultation. A principle in line with good commercial practices has been adopted in order to ensure that the actions taken are always proportionate to the situation.

It is a great pleasure for me to return to this House, where I served, albeit briefly, as a Member and Vice-President, and which has contributed so much, as the only institution directly elected by the citizens, to improving transparency and democracy in Europe. I also welcome the presence of the President of the Commission, whose vision, pragmatism and experience and his Europeanism have helped us find solutions, overcome divisions and strengthen our Union. In recent years, the European Union has been shaken by a succession of crises unprecedented in its history and which have shaken it at its foundations — from the great economic recession of 2008 to Brexit and the dramatic refugee crisis in summer 2016. We live now, indeed, a moment of appeasement. We can finally celebrate the return of economic growth and we have prevented Brexit from becoming a principle of breakdown. In any case, there is no reason for complacency. The European Union must live up to its historic responsibility. In Bratislava, the Member States committed themselves to stay united and to make the Union more attractive and worthy of the trust and support of our citizens. In Brussels, before this Parliament, President Juncker presented, on behalf of the Commission, an ambitious White Paper on the future of Europe. In Gothenburg, we proclaimed the 20 principles of the Social Pillar, and the leaders agenda proposed by President Tusk has allowed a frank and direct debate between Heads of State or Government. The question today is very simple: do we want to continue to promise much and do little, or are we able to honour the commitments we have made to our citizens? Do we have the courage to make choices and to provide the Union with the means and instruments to respond to the challenges we face? Perhaps because Portugal has returned to Europe, after 48 years of dictatorship and thirteen years of anachronistic colonial wars in Africa, and because we experienced the tensions of the revolutionary period that founded our democracy, Portugal knows well that being European is not just a geographical or historical coincidence. More than a single currency, rather than an internal market, Europe is above all a community of values. Being European means belonging to a system of values. Peace, the unconditional defence of democracy, the rule of law, freedom, equality, the dignity of the human person and solidarity — these are the values that brought Portugal to Europe. It was the desire to consolidate the regained democracy and to be able to share a common area of freedom, security, peace and prosperity. It was with this vision that Mário Soares signed Portugal's application for membership of the then EEC as early as 1977 and signed the accession treaty in 1985. I would therefore like to take this opportunity to thank President Tajani once again for the tribute this Parliament has paid to this great European and its former member. Sharing a common home, sharing the same values obviously does not mean giving up our own identity or renouncing the freedom of each one to make their own choices. The future of Europe is not compatible with a single thought, whatever it may be. Democracy in Europe cannot be shunted by a 'there is no alternative' idea. On the contrary, it means awakening, among all, a set of common rules of coexistence and giving each one the freedom to be able to follow his own path, in accordance with these common rules and for the benefit of all. As in a big family, living at 28 or 27 in the same house isn't always easy. That's why rules are needed. But these rules do not serve to standardize policies. The rules serve to ensure that common compromises can be achieved through the different policies that electorates choose, democratically and sovereignly. In Portugal, we have defined an alternative to austerity policy, focusing on more economic growth, more and better jobs and greater equality. The replenishment of incomes has restored confidence to economic operators, allowing for the greatest economic growth since the beginning of the century, sustained growth in private investment, exports and employment. It is true that we have done differently, but we adhere to the rules and today we have stronger public finances than we had three years ago. We came out of the excessive deficit procedure in 2017. Last year we had the lowest deficit of 43 years of our democracy, and last week the European Commission removed Portugal from the list of countries with excessive macroeconomic imbalances. (Applause) But most importantly, the affirmation of democratic sovereignty has restored confidence in democratic institutions and in the European Union, as the last barometer shows, with clear support from the Portuguese for the European Union. We therefore have no existential crisis. It is in the Union, and with all who want it, that we want to build our future. And we have many challenges ahead of us: climate change, instability at our external border, terrorism, globalisation, digital transition and migration. But we must be aware that none of the great challenges we face will be better solved outside the Union, by each Member State alone, however populous or prosperous it may be. Only the European Union, together, will be able to lead concerted action on a global scale to implement the Paris Agreement, which is vital to respond to the climate change that threatens humanity in its existence. Only united in permanent structured cooperation can we assume a increasing responsibility, in solidarity and complementarity with NATO, in the face of instability at our borders, which threatens peace and our security. Only together can we strengthen police cooperation, judicial cooperation and the exchange of data between our intelligence services to tackle terrorism, which spreads fear on the streets of our cities. Only the Union will give strength to a trade policy capable of helping to regulate global markets and protect the high social, environmental and food safety standards that we want to preserve, regulating globalisation, which challenges the sustainability of the European social model. Only the development of the Social Pillar and the Single Market and joint investment in the knowledge society and energy transition enable us to ensure growth and decent employment, the only effective response to the anguish that digital transition and automation pose about the future of work. (Applause.) Only on a European scale can we go to the root of the problem of migration, which alter the balance of our societies, by acting to promote inclusive growth and sustainable development, peace and human rights in Africa, in cooperation with countries of origin and transit, following the call of Secretary-General of the United Nations, António Guterres, to a new global pact on migration, and only jointly and severally among all can we ensure the defence of our common external border against organised crime networks that promote trafficking in human beings and share, in solidarity, the duty to guarantee international protection to all those who need it. Yes, it is true that all these challenges exist and that we must face them. Not with major institutional debates or paralysing revisions of the treaties — the essential thing is to define what we want to do. Institutional architecture is just an instrument that will enable us to implement it. Invert order is counterproductive and divides us into the accessory before we unite on the essential. And time is pressing. Our focus must be on the citizens, listening to them and giving them back confidence in our ability to face and overcome each of these challenges. What distinguishes democratic politics from populism is that democratic politics does not exploit fears or lives off problems. On the contrary, democratic politics responds to problems, combats fear and anguish and returns hope to the future of all citizens. Globalization does not face itself by closing borders or erasing walls, going back into a protectionist logic or xenophobic drift. We must make it clear that these are not and will never be Europe's options. The European Union will only gain if it continues to project the vision of a Europe open to the world, from Japan to Mercosur. What globalisation requires of us is that we be able to invest in the skills, innovation and infrastructure that fit us into global networks, and only a cohesive society — economically, socially and territorially — guarantees sustained competitiveness. It is our political responsibility to respond to the legitimate wishes of European citizens, but we can only do so if we are able to build a genuine Union that is more cohesive economically, socially and politically. For this to be possible, there are two very clear priorities: completing Economic and Monetary Union — the most ambitious project we have ever been able to implement — and to provide the Union with resources tailored to its responsibilities and the challenges that we have to face. Ladies and gentlemen, convergence is the key to union in Europe. Only this can guarantee the necessary stability of the euro area by ensuring risk reduction and benefit-sharing. The financial crisis we are experiencing has exposed the weaknesses of the single currency. Faced with an emergency, we avoided, largely by enlightened action by the European Central Bank, the breakdown that it threatened us and we created, with the Juncker plan, a new instrument to support investment, which, with the contribution of this Parliament, would even be strengthened. However, even with these advances, the structural weaknesses in the euro area remain unresolved. The asymmetries and imbalances between its members reduce potential growth and call into question the stability of the single currency. As long as economic and monetary union remains incomplete, the risks of new crises will be greater. We need to take advantage of this moment of growth and optimism in the markets to give new impetus to Economic and Monetary Union, which strengthens convergence and prevents new crises. (Applause.) Economic and Monetary Union can never function satisfactorily based solely on its monetary pillar. As a matter of time, I am not going to develop here the issues of the Banking Union, which we have begun and which we must conclude, of the need to clarify obscure budgetary rules or the development of the European Stability Mechanism. I will focus on what I believe is essential in order to optimise the euro area as a monetary union, correcting the asymmetries and strengthening convergence. Every mature monetary union has a budgetary capacity, and that is why I am advocating the creation of a budgetary capacity of the euro area, linked to the exercise of the European Semester. This budgetary capacity could serve as a stabilisation instrument against external shocks, but its primary objective should be investment, providing the country-specific recommendations consolidated in the national reform programmes with financial instruments for their implementation. It is not a question of establishing a transfer union or financing mechanisms for national inefficiencies. I want to be clear: I do not advocate permanent transfers. The convergence mechanism that I propose, somewhat close to the reform instrument referred to recently by the Commission, should be based on a contractual basis, in order to implement reforms tailored to each country, based on its own structural blockades to improve its growth potential, with quantified and timed targets, the fulfilment of which determines the transfer phased out of the financing tranches. For example, looking at Portugal's country report, our priority should be investment in education, lifelong learning, research and development and innovation, setting success metrics and timetables for achievement. Support for convergence is the right step to hold each Member State accountable for carrying out the reforms it needs. It is the best instrument for ensuring the stability of the euro area and combining economic growth with budgetary discipline. It is about creating incentives for reforms, positive conditionality and not punitive conditionality. Because we cannot continue to look at the euro area as a set of economies that compete with each other and then with the rest of the world. We must treat the euro area as an integrated area, whose prosperity and cohesion benefit all its members, where the added value of the whole depends on the success of each and every one. (Applause.) The lasting and sustainable stabilisation of the euro area is the first condition for us to build Europe's future on a solid foundation. The second condition is that we give the Union a budget tailored to its demands and ambitions. In its recent report on the next multiannual financial framework, the European Parliament argued that more European policies and programmes can only be implemented with more resources and not less. We are following this Parliament and set out for this new round of negotiations on the multiannual financial framework with a clear position. We must strengthen the Union's own resources and we need an increase in contributions of all Member States. Portugal is available to increase its contribution and supports the creation of new own resources, as proposed in the Mário Monti report, the subject of multiple suggestions. Only in this way can we honour our commitment to citizens to ensure greater security against climate change, external threats and terrorism, and the future of our social model, employment and migration management, without sacrificing policies that are already part of the European Union's identity, such as the common agricultural policy or cohesion policy. It would be a grave mistake to sacrifice these policies. The success of the common agricultural policy is not limited to guaranteeing Europe's food security, and the success of cohesion policy is not limited to the contribution it has made to the economic and social modernisation of our territories. Its greatest added value was that it brought the European Union into the day-to-day life of its citizens, it has left Europe from being an abstraction to being something concrete in people's lives. With agricultural policy and cohesion policy, Europe has reached every village, every village, every part of our territory, from the large metropolises to the outermost regions. We have to tell our citizens the truth. We cannot want more from Europe without giving more to Europe. We cannot assign more responsibility to Europe without increasing our contributions and its own resources. But we can't obviously just want more, always more, more and more and more. We must also be able to do different and do better by exploiting the essential complementarity of policies and instruments and improving their efficiency. Firstly, between competitiveness and cohesion, there is no longer room for a Europe of productivity and a Europe of cohesion. We need a more competitive economy in the global market and a more cohesive society internally. But we must also be aware that the political agriculture must make a greater contribution to tackling climate change and cohesion policy must contribute to preventing radicalisation in urban peripheries and must focus more on people as an instrument of our social pillar. Similarly, the objective of cohesion must not be absent from programmes such as Horizon 2020 or the European Defence Fund, which must not aggravate the asymmetries between our economies. Only in complementarity with all these policies can we achieve greater convergence. That is why convergence should be the criterion of added value, which must be transversally present in all policies and instruments, which must complement each other, reinforcing the potential for added success. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are all aware of the difficulty of these debates, both on the conclusion of Economic and Monetary Union and on the adoption of the next Multiannual Financial Framework. But nothing that is difficult today gains from being postponed. On the contrary, postponing will make everything even more difficult, because it will diminish the confidence that citizens have in our capacity to make decisions and respond to their needs, desires and aspirations. That is why we must do everything, but even everything, to close these debates during the current term of office of the current European Parliament. (Applause.) This is everyone's responsibility. We have to live up to our time. I speak, of course, for Portugal. You can count on us. Once again, as always, Portugal also has Europe, and Europe can count on Portugal. The challenges ahead are very demanding, but whenever we doubt our ability to overcome them together, let us remember and draw inspiration from a great woman, Simone Veil, the first President of the European Parliament directly elected by the citizens: 'Je suis, je reste toujours optimisste. La vie m'a appris qu'avec le temps, le progrès l'emporte toujours. C'est long, c'est lent, more en définitif, je fais confiance.” (Applause.)", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "aws", "politicalGroup": "PSE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 64, "date": "2018-03-14.json", "name": "Jean-Claude Juncker", "mepid": "n/a", "text": " President of the Commission. — (FR) Mr President, Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased to take part in this third debate on the future of Europe in the presence and animated by the Portuguese Prime Minister, my friend António. I was in Portugal at the end of October last year and had the great honour of being invited by the President of the Portuguese Republic and to exchange views with the members of the Council of State on the same subject, the future of Europe. I also had the privilege of dialogue with the Prime Minister and in the context of a citizen dialogue with the students of Coimbra on the major European issues and their hopes for the future of the Union. That is to say how much this subject occupies, and rightly so, the minds of our Portuguese friends and not only their political leaders, but I think I can also say about a large part of Portuguese society. Portugal is a country that I love very much, I spent one of the most important moments of my life there. The Portuguese are very present in my country of origin, Luxembourg: 20% of the Luxembourg population is of Portuguese origin. Almost all of my neighbors are Portuguese. It is a joy every day to hear them speak Portuguese. Anecdote: very often, when I was Prime Minister in my country, our Portuguese friends stopped me in the streets and sidewalks to say: “Prime Minister, there are too many foreigners in Luxembourg”, which clearly shows that the integration of Portuguese citizens in Luxembourg is very successful. (Laughter) Furthermore, I cannot forget that it was the Portuguese people who, in April 1974, put an end to almost half a century of oppression and dictatorship, thus paving a peaceful path to democracy. An event that sparked relief and hope throughout our continent. Second anecdote: young man, i participated in demonstrations in front of the portuguese consulate. Towards the end of the dictatorship in your country, until now, the Grand Ducal Police investigates the following case: someone threw a stone on one of the windows of the Consulate General, the police did not find the responsible: he is in front of you. (Laughter) Portugal, after the carnation revolution, immediately and logically turned to Europe, under the inspired leadership of Mário Soares to anchor its young democracy in a solidarity ensemble. We share the same ambitions, peace — which is too often forgotten and without which nothing else would be possible — and respect for the rule of law and fundamental rights. These are values of universal vocation on which our Union was built, and it is on the preservation of these values that we must build the future of our Union, for let us never forget that none of these values, peace, democracy, the rule of law is obvious. We must constantly defend them, and I know that we can count on our Portuguese friends who have always shown that they know how to give life and colour to our common values and in particular European solidarity. The reception of refugees by the Portuguese and the Portuguese Government demonstrates this very clearly. Portugal, doing more than its share, had relocated many refugees from Greece and Italy, which for the rest is an example some should draw on. (Applause) In recent years, Portugal has been particularly affected by the economic and financial crisis and I am pleased to see that Portugal is now showing good economic performance. Portugal left the excessive deficit procedure last year and last week the Commission concluded that macroeconomic imbalances are no longer excessive. Who would have believed it a few years ago? Who would have believed it? The truth is that the country has gone from one level deficit of 10 to 11% at a level of less than 2%. Unemployment is being corrected downwards and the employment rate is increasing dramatically day by day. The truth is that this progress has demanded from the Portuguese throughout these painful years considerable efforts that other Europeans do not always measure to their proper value. It is a beautiful collective performance that honours every Portuguese. I would therefore like to pay tribute here to the Portuguese, to those who have led the country throughout the years of crisis and who led it to the correction of imbalances and especially to the Portuguese people, especially the most modest. (Applause) Especially to the most modest Portuguese who contributed with admirable courage and with definite success to this great national effort. I would also like to point out that these remarkable results are wrong for those who criticized the European Commission for applying the Stability Pact with greater wisdom, even intelligence and heart by giving it a reading grid taking into account the many social challenges in Portugal. The situation has improved, but of course there is still a lot to be done. It is now a matter of consolidating efforts to permanently close the page on these dark years and resolutely turn to the future. Yes, Portugal is still experiencing imbalances, but which, in my view, are controllable. Greater productivity growth remains critical to improving competitiveness and debt reduction. Portugal knows that it can count on the Commission and our programme of support for structural reform to carry out its necessary reforms. In particular, I am working with the Prime Minister to define a pilot project to improve the qualifications and skills of adults with low levels of training. And I have confidence in the determination of the Portuguese authorities, responsible political forces to address the remaining structural weaknesses that may still hamper the full economic development of the country. These are issues that I have always discussed frankly, openly, amicably with the Prime Minister and I intend to continue this sometimes difficult but always frank, friendly and open effort because I have always thought that the future of Europe is not built by humiliating countries and not respecting the dignity of the peoples. I wanted, in the case of Portugal, as in other cases, to replace the anticipatory sanction with the constant dialogue which, moreover, leads, as Portugal's case shows, to better results. (Applause) The Prime Minister's speech before this Assembly showed that we share the same dream and love for Europe and that we all believe that the European Union remains the best future for ourselves and for generations to come. It will therefore be appropriate, in the coming months, that we together complete the work begun in recent years on the energy union, the digital union — the Prime Minister has mentioned this — on capital markets union and of course on the deepening of the economic and monetary zone, a subject on which we in the Commission have a broad intersection of views with our Portuguese friends. This is true, in particular, with regard to the need to put in place new instruments to ensure the stability, resilience of the euro area and to strengthen its internal convergence. The Commission has made very specific proposals on this subject, including a new instrument to support national reforms and a stabilization mechanism which allows us to deal with major asymmetrical shocks because it will be our duty, ladies and gentlemen, to give the next financial perspective the necessary resources to the future financial perspective. height of our ambitions. As António pointed out, we have many responsibilities, old or new, whether it be in immigration, defence policy, research, innovation or education. I understand that in Portugal the national budget represents 43% of gross national income and the share of that of the European Union is 1%, which means that out of 100 euros, 43 euros go to the Ministry of Finance in Lisbon, of which only one euro is for Europe. I welcome the Prime Minister's affirmed desire, reiterated today, to increase the Portuguese contribution to the European budget so that we can live up to our responsibilities. This is another Portuguese example to follow by — I hope — many others. But we know that often difficult choices remain to be made. The Europe we leave to our children will depend on these choices. It is up to us now to decide what Europe we want for tomorrow. Let me take one example: the Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme, which is not entirely innocent since Commissioner Carlos Moedas, who is lucky and happy to have Portuguese nationality and is proud to be Commissioner, is responsible for it and he is doing a job — I wanted to say — absolutely remarkable. But it is also a key programme for the growth and development of European enterprises. (Applause) We are devoting EUR 80 million, ladies and gentlemen, to this programme — the one I have just mentioned. If we decided to increase that amount to 120 million in the next financial framework, it would create an additional 420,000 jobs by 2040 and increase GDP by 0.3%. If we were to go — I dream — up to 160 million, that would result in the creation of 650,000 jobs by 2040 and an increase in GDP of 0.5%. If we do — in fact, I think we should — the European Union will become one of the world's leading players in the field of research and innovation. Finally, there is no need to say that the coming months will be crucial for the future of Europe. It is on the facts and not on the words that we will be judged, and Portugal, which, since its accession and even before, has been of all European progress, has largely demonstrated that it respects what it says, whatever the difficulties and they were great. The future of Europe also goes through Portugal.

Dear Prime Minister, welcome to the European Parliament. Because the President has pointed out that the number of topics is so great, we too will always focus our speeches. The last time Andrej Plenković was here, the Croatian colleague, I spoke on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party about the Christian values of this continent. Today I would like to talk about another issue on this continent, namely the feeling of anxiety of people on this continent, the fears of loss that are there, towards migration, globalisation, climate change, the changes that people are facing. Europe is in the midst of a debate between hope and fear, between partnership and selfishness, between Europe and nationalism. It is the debate we have on this continent. Portugal's history actually gives us a good indication. 500 years ago, when the Chinese burned their fleet and got involved, Portuguese people like Vasco da Gama set out into the world, discovered the India route and benefited from it for centuries. Your country has benefited from this for centuries. Even in the short period of history of recent years, Portugal has shown that the start of shaping, that bridge building is the right way forward in the financial crisis. Jean-Claude Juncker has already mentioned whether Portugal has given the right answers. I would like to mention a name that helped shape this, namely your predecessor, Pedro Passos Coelho, who played a major role in getting Portugal on this path today and has this economic data, that economic growth is there. The fact that Portugal is on this path of success is a common success, and therefore congratulations! Setting the sails right is the task. If we come back to this question of fear again, I'll take a look at back to the history of the continent how we dealt with the great anxiety issues of people. With the question of having poverty, with the question of getting poor in old age, with the question of not having insured the disease. 150 years ago, ladies and gentlemen, we developed the idea of a social market economy that the state should take care of taking up people's fears. I believe that today we have a duty to rethink how we can realise this social market economy in a globalised world, in a European world. We believe in the social partners. We are witnessing, however, that the companies are European and that, unfortunately, the trade unions are not yet organised in Europe to really form a counterbalance. Ladies and gentlemen, in the European budget we are alloying more than EUR 86 billion to the Social Fund to combat youth unemployment. For us as the EPP, social policy does not primarily mean supplying, but enabling it. That is why it is right that we are investing the money towards education, towards training, skills — not only for young people, but also for the 50+, for the older generation, which often has a hard time in the labour markets, for the disabled, for all the people who need support. Modern social policy is also a modern tax policy when craftsmen pay their bills, pay their taxes and large corporations stay out of it. Prime Minister, the issue of unanimity in tax policy in the Council is one of the major problems, one of the major challenges. The fact that we are regrasping social policy means more common legislation in tax policy. Almost 9% of workers in Europe currently do not have enough to live, they are at risk of poverty — people who go to work. That is why every worker of what he earns must also be in Would be able to live. That is why either the social partners or the state, if necessary, must provide the appropriate framework. Finally, let me say that the biggest social issue for us Europeans is perhaps not even the internal European issue, but the global issue. Pope Francis once wrote in one of his first encyclicals that kills this economy that we have today. A very strong charge of what we currently have as an economic system. That is why, if we move into the future, we Europeans need to consider how this economy will evolve and how this economic model will evolve. I would advocate not only talking about tariffs or tariffs on trade issues in future, but also about minimum social standards for trade contracts. If we can ensure that European supermarkets no longer sell a product for which children had to work, then it would be a big deal for Europe.

Mas, com o seu discurso, também provou que tem uma visão ambiciosa e progressista para a nova fase do projeto europeu. Por isso, bem-vindo, em nome do Grupo S&amp;D, o único grupo do Parlamento Europeu que incorpora delegações dos 28 Estados-Membros. In fact, the European Union is confronted with new challenges. In this polarised world we are surrounded by nationalistic tones, and we need to make sure that the European Union is asserting itself as a beacon of international cooperation and of a progressive agenda. We need European-scale action to respond to climate change, to set new trade agreements, to make sure that we respond properly to the digital revolution and to the migration and refugee crises. For this, yes, we need a European scale. But in order to respond properly, we need to ensure the unity of European citizens, and this unity can only be based on implementing the European Social Pillar in such a way that children, young people, women and men can comply with their new needs. What is happening with the Social Pillar is that, if you really want to implement it, we need also to count on a powerful social-fairness package, which was presented yesterday by the Commission. But we really want to implement it. But this is not enough, because if we want to sustain the welfare system, we also need to push for investment turned to the future, creating more and better jobs. And let me come with a powerful truth: this will only happen if we have the proper means, and the proper means will be (and you have referred to this) to have a budget turned to the future, to have a eurozone coming back to convergence, and financing this with new resources. The new resources should be based on tax fairness. We, the S&amp;D Group, want to go to these new sources of taxation, and they must be based on whatever is producing added value and is not benefiting the European Union as a whole. This is the case with large-scale companies, the digital economy, financial transactions. So this is our expectation. Today in Parliament we will vote on the Parliament position on the European budget for the future, and we are pleased to count on clear support from the Portuguese Government. But let me tell you, since we know that Europe needs to connect with European citizens: we intend to launch a large-scale debate across Europe at all levels – local, national and European – to connect with citizens, to come with our proposals and to listen to them. We, the S&amp;D Group, will deploy our instruments to provide these large debates, because we have a democratic deficit, and a democratic deficit can only be reduced with large debates and delivering in the direction of what citizens really need.

Prime Minister Costa, I learned today that we agree that the EU and the euro system are not working very well at the moment. But I'm afraid this is where our similarities end. While the grand coalition of pro-Europeans here wants centralisation, common coffers and, in the end, the EU superstate, I believe that this path is wrong. Centralization damages ownership and creativity. Europe needs ownership and creativity, not only in the product markets. Unfortunately, we see that the market economy players are being burdened by an increasing number of regulations and, at the same time, more and more state industrial planning is being carried out from Brussels. Europe also needs political competition. That's why Brexit is not just a threat. He's also an opportunity because the British need to get creative to solve their problems. This creativity can be a positive example for us and thus benefit us all. It is important that Switzerland, which sits at the heart of Europe and is not a member of this EU, shows our citizens every day that we can achieve exceptionally good economic results without the EU and without the euro. For us in Germany, Switzerland is now even important because there are German-language media that have not submitted to the ubiquitous political correctness in our country and which draw a different picture of reality. Alternative facts may be verbally an invention from the United States, but we have had to endure them in our countries for a long time, for example on the subject of the euro or even on the subject of migration. It is good if we keep many different voices in Europe, which will also receive media competition against the supersist of the state media. As you hear, I've talked about competition three times. On competition in product markets, where Europe is not innovating enough. About competition to better political solutions where equality from Brussels covers ownership and creativity. And on competition for better information and media, where too many journalists still adapt to the prevailing mainstream. However, so-called pro-Europeans, who are doing more harm to our continent than they may be aware of, are coming under increasing pressure, as the elections in many countries have shown in recent months. And we are very pleased that resistance to this centralisation is forming in the EU under the leadership of the Netherlands, Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Sweden and the three Baltic States. This really encourages me. Prime Minister Costa! I am and always will be an incorrigible optimist.

Also last week, it was Donald Trump who started an old-fashioned, but, I think, dangerous trade war. And also last week, Vladimir Putin gets away with murders of former Russian spies on European soil. I should say: welcome back to the future. Welcome to the new world order, a world order based on empires and no longer on nation states, on the 196 nation states we count. It is clear that, in such a world older, we have to look to one thing if we want to talk about a reform of Europe. What is our interest? How can we defend our interests in this new world order? And how can we defend also our security? Because in the future we will only count on ourselves in this new world order. In such a new world order, the key question is: are we ready now with the European Union? My answer to this is: no! We are not ready for the moment, and I give always the example of how the Americans reacted to the financial crisis, Prime Minister, and how we reacted to the financial crisis in 2008. They, in nine months, Democrats and Republicans, decided a three-stage rocket: cleaning up the banks – 400 billion TARP; an investment programme three times bigger than ours – 900 billion (they are the capitalists and we are the so-called Keynesians, but the opposite is true); and at the same time, a quantitative easing programme of 1.2 trillion. And we, after nine years, are still discussing the banking union inside the European Union. And we have still not cleaned up all our banks in Europe. And that’s not the only example; the example is also valuable for other fields. The real problem we have is that we are still not a real Union as our founding fathers wanted. We are still a confederation of nation states that is based on the unanimity rule. So what we need as reform – and you have indicated in a lot of your interventions – are three things. First of all, a European Defence Community. We are alone in the world of tomorrow, so we need to do that homework. We are spending 40% of American military expenditure and we are only capable of doing 10% of the operations of the American army. So there is a field where we need absolutely to create that community as fast as possible. My second point – you have indicated it and I agree completely with you: the new euro governance, a euro budget, a fiscal capacity. It is completely ridiculous to have a single currency and not behind that single currency a fiscal capacity and a full authority. It is not only with the Stability and Growth Pact that we can do the business. Finally, and that’s my third point (and here I’m in disagreement a little bit with you and with the tone of your intervention): we need also institutional reform, a renewed European democracy. We need, for example, a European Parliament that is not only responsible for the expenditure but also for the income, as in any normal European democracy. We need also, in my opinion (as I said already to President Juncker) not a Commission of 28. Let’s bring it back to a real European government of 12 or 15 people. And we need to get rid of the unanimity rule. Let’s be honest, also in matters of foreign policy. I give the example now of what is happening in Britain: this attack on European, on British soil. We have still no opinion of the European Union. Ms Mogherini is completely silent about it. Why? Because she needs, for example, 28 agreements before she can take a position on such a crucial issue. I think it’s time that we did this reform now. Why, Mr Prime Minister? We have a window of opportunity of two years to do so. After Brexit there was no Nexit, no Frexit, no Dexit, fortunately. But it’s not won. There could be a Frexit, a Dexit and a Nexit if, in the coming two years, we don’t succeed. And that’s your responsibility, and that’s our responsibility, and that’s in fact our common responsibility.

You have demonstrated, on the one hand, that right-wing parties do not have a monopoly over the responsible management of public finances and, on the other hand, that responsible management was not necessarily antinomic with progress towards greater social justice. This is evidenced by the measures taken in favour of small incomes and the upgrading of public services. If only for that, you deserve all our encouragement. Likewise, we share your determined ambition for the European project, the only way — as you have said — for Europeans to face the challenges of this century. If the European Union wants to regain overwhelming support from its citizens, it must resolutely change course and turn its back — and you have done so — on the austerity obsession with putting the package on investment. But be careful, not any investment: all investments that promote the possibility for everyone to live a dignified life while respecting the physical and biological limits that nature imposes on us. From this point of view, Prime Minister, it cannot be said that Portugal is, at this stage, a leader in the ecological transition. The proof of this is the oil exploration off your coast or the intensive sardine fishing methods. We are convinced that it is crucial for Europe to be at the forefront of the ecological transition of the economy, not only to meet climate imperatives but to become a solution provider to the rest of the world. These investments must be made both from the private sector, of course, but also from the public sector, including at European level. Here too, we share your ambition for a robust and ambitious European budget, fueled in particular by own resources. You talk about taxation on digital platforms, you also talk about all forms of pollution taxation, and the tax on financial transactions belongs to this category. Let me conclude with a downside: I never understood how your coalition spontaneously joined in support of a trade treaty like CETA.

After reversing some of the measures imposed by the troika, Portugal is not only growing at a good pace, but also reducing unemployment and inequality. Portugal is tangible proof that austerity policies exacerbated the 2008 economic crisis, rather than alleviated it. From Spain, we look with envy at the pact signed in Portugal between the Socialist Party and the progressive forces, and we wonder why socialists in Spain have preferred other avenues, letting the People's Party rule rather than understanding themselves with the forces of change. However, Mr Costa, we do not lose hope and we are confident that, sooner than later, the obstacles that prevent us from following the same path as you will will be cleared. The economic recovery of southern Europe needs a different European Union — as I said — at the height of its responsibilities, more concerned about the well-being of its peoples and less about the profits of large financial institutions. When we witnessed the process of European integration, Europe was synonymous with well-being and prosperity. Today, following the implementation of austerity policies and social cuts, that perception has changed greatly. Three major reforms may be the pillars for building a Union that puts the equality and security of our populations at the centre of its business: a tax for financial transactions, the restructuring of the debt of the countries of the South and the transformation of the European Central Bank into an institution at the service of the economy real.

Everything changes, we have no idea what's coming in a few years. We don't know what Europe will look like and propaganda of all sorts is spreading in this uncertainty. On the one hand, it is the fundamentalists of the European and Europhile politicians who say that with the European Union we must remain for eternal times, that the European Union is the only institution in the history of mankind, that will last forever. That's an irresponsible policy because that situation is very precarious and we really can't predict what will be a few years from now. Similarly, propaganda from other politicians who say there is a need to leave the European Union immediately, preferably tomorrow, whatever it takes, even if collapse and disaster were to follow. This is also irresponsible politics. Both are fundamentalism of the same kind. Perhaps there are also people who benefit from staying in the European Union as long as subsidies come in. All these approaches are wrong because the duty of a politician is to properly evaluate the current situation and make decisions accordingly every day. We can't start from fundamentalist notions that we know what's right. It is in times of politics that is more important because there is no standing answer for us to rethink the situation. The European Commission has indicated that the Lisbon Treaty is ending in principle. It presented a White Paper on the future of Europe and presented several scenarios for what the project might look like next. It calls for discussions on these alternatives and it is clear that the likelihood of maintaining the Lisbon Treaty is very limited. This uncertainty is also deepened by the unclarified position of Russia, the unclarified situation of China, the situation in North Africa, the Middle East, migration, weakened NATO, which as a result of the policy of the European Union He's still losing his weight and authority, and that's putting all of us at risk. The murders of journalists, the murders of former spies are contributing to this, and in this precarious situation, calls for democracy to be strengthened increasingly. Citizens of European states feel that the decision is made about us without us, that they have no influence whatsoever on what takes place in Brussels or here. There are voices calling for a real alternative to replace the Lisbon Treaty with some democratic establishment. It's not about creating conflicts, we all want cooperation from European states, but based on completely different principles than what we see here today. We're really looking for a different path. Prime Minister, we have described one such alternative, and you have received it through your embassy in Prague.

Its inexplicably and intolerably tolerant attitude has seduced Turkey, which is behaving like a pirate state. It invades the territory of Syria undisturbed, violates the EEZ of Cyprus, arrests citizens of various countries (United States, Germany, Czech Republic) and in order to release them requires them to accept its unreasonable demands and its latest challenge is the arrest of two Greek soldiers, whom he imprisoned in the highest security prisons in Adrianople, in order to blackmail Greece, which is indifferent to Turkey's other threats. I would ask you to condemn this attitude unequivocally and to demand the immediate release of the two Greek military troops. However, this seemingly inexplicable behaviour by Turkey has an explanation. And this explanation lies in the fact that Turkey has signed agreements on the purchase of military equipment with various countries of the European Union. He recently signed 31 such agreements with Germany. With Italy since 2007, under the Prodi government, the delivery of EUR 1 billion of military material to Turkey has been approved. In 2016, under the Renci government, Magusta surrendered 51 offensive helicopters to Turkey, worth 134m euros. But Spain also has similar agreements with Turkey. It builds a landing vessel on behalf of Turkey and is likely to build or build a helicopter carrier or Juan Carlos type aircraft carrier.

Firstly, in fact, the great challenge facing the European Union today is for hope to overcome fears that undermine confidence in Europe's future. In that battle, it is absolutely essential that we focus on concrete responses to the citizens, because either the citizens believe that, in European policies and the decisions we take, they materialise and respond to their desires, or we will indeed feed exclusively those who are against Europe, the speech populist and those have a protectionist view towards the future. In order for Europe to be more effective, we must first of all consolidate what is the most important we have ever achieved and which is the basis on which we can build our future: Economic and Monetary Union. Secondly, we must provide the Union with the necessary means so that the Union can do what we ask the Union to do, and that does mean strengthening the Union's budget. This means that we must have a vision that fooses convergence, because convergence is the key in the European Union as a whole. Convergence must be present in everything. It is true, we need a new industrial policy, and Horizon 2020 or structured defence cooperation is, moreover, a good opportunity for us to develop this industrial policy. But this industrial policy must not be used to aggravate the asymmetries. On the contrary, it must also bear in mind this objective of convergence and make us all participate in this joint effort. Certainly, some of the economies are good competitors in submarine production. There are others who will certainly be excellent competitors in the production of textiles or technical footwear. If we can gather the capacities of each one, we will strengthen convergence and we will not be weakening cohesion and the convergence. For this new Europe, I do not believe we need an empire. We will not be China, we will not be Russia, and I believe that we do not want to be China or Russia. Each has its own history and our history is a history of states and nations. This history of nation states has proved, since the post-war, that it has been able to build the most original and creative political creation that humanity has ever produced, which is the European Union. This must be done with respect for identity, with the resources necessary for the Union to be effective. The delay in responding to the 2008 crisis and the sovereign debt crisis in 2011 was not because the Commission has 28 Commissioners. This delay was due to deep political division and that we failed to realise in time that we had structural problems in the euro area to which we needed to respond. Now that we have learned our lesson, we cannot waste any more time, and now that there is no crisis at the moment on the table, let us make the right decisions to prevent any new crisis from coming. What Europe needs is not to close itself to the world, nor is it to do ethnic cleansing within Europe. Europe is a continent of diversity, and that diversity has been a factor of wealth. I believe it was Mr Weber who invoked Vasco da Gama's trip to India and how it benefited Europe. I would even say that I must be the biggest beneficiary of this trip in this Chamber, since, from Indian origin, I might not be here if Vasco da Gama had not gone to India. What has distinguished Europe and gives strength to Europe is indeed that we are a community of values. First of all, a fundamental value, which is that of tolerance, that of the capacity for inclusion, without multicultural relativism, because, of course, there are human rights which, being fundamental rights, are not likely to be discussed either in the name of the place of origin or in the name of religion. Gender equality is a value and there is no religion or religious value that can weaken Europe's defence of gender equality. (Applause.) But that does not mean that we sacrifice these values, which are also the founding values of Europe. Finally, I would like to say to Mr Verhofstadt the following: perhaps it does not distinguish between us whether or not we need institutional changes. It distinguishes us what should be the starting point. What I say is this: starting by discussing institutional changes divides us, paralyzes us and prevents us from making the essential decisions. Let us start with what is essential. Can we move forward in defence with structured cooperation? Let's move forward. Can we move forward with strengthening budgetary capacity, creating budgetary capacity in the euro area? Let's move forward. Let us not start by discussing whether a finance minister is needed. Let us begin by discussing and realising what is essential: having a budgetary capacity for the euro area. Once we have the budgetary capacity of the euro area, then perhaps there we will draw the obvious and necessary conclusion that we need a finance minister and we need greater control by the European Parliament over the implementation of economic policy across the euro area as a whole. Let us not start at the end, let us start at the beginning, and the principle must be to respond and resolve the problems of the citizens.

The solution is not only, albeit with new clothes, because it exists in the old promises and illusions that life has laid down, it is to boldly break with the bonds that hinder the sovereign development of the country and this is the best contribution that Portugal can make to the construction of a Europe of cooperation, peace and progress.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "aws", "politicalGroup": "GUE/NGL", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 85, "date": "2018-03-14.json", "name": "Gilles LEBRETON", "mepid": "124738", "text": " — Mr President, supporters of federal Europe are less and less often invoking peace to justify their plan, and for good reason their beautiful European Union has managed to blur us with great powers such as Russia and the United States, with future former members, such as the United Kingdom, and even with current members, such as the Poland.

And my question is this: having now an opportunity to reprogramming European funds, is prepared to do so in a way that the prevention of fires and support for affected areas are highly privileged, because the tragedy of the fires which has no precedent in Portuguese history and does not has precedent in European history - it has certainly only been possible because there has been a great divestment over the years, but also in these means, and so are you prepared to do a reprogramming that takes into account precisely the care of these people and care for these regions?

Your words encourage us and strengthen our energy to continue the success and outcome of these policies. I would like to stress something important here. The change of policy has not only had economic relevance. It has also shown that within Europe we are not doomed to a single thought and there is the freedom to develop political alternatives. This is essential for strengthening democracy and citizens' confidence. If, today, Euroceticism in Portugal has lowered again, it is a great deal for the Portuguese to understand that it is possible to be in Europe in different ways. Mr João Ferreira raised a question which has to do with the difficulties that the euro poses for countries such as Portugal. We know, at least since monetary union in the United States, that monetary unions do not diminish asymmetries — on the contrary, they accentuate them. All the preparatory studies of the euro, from the McLaughlin report to the 1989 Delors Report, clearly stated that, in order for the euro to have an asymmetrical effect, the euro area had to be given budgetary capacity. Two years ago, some thought we could not get out of austerity without leaving the euro, and others felt that we could not be in the euro coming out of austerity. Today, we know that it is possible to be in the euro without austerity. But what we also know is that everyone who said that budgetary capacity was needed were right, are still right, and that is what I hope — is that there will actually be budgetary capacity. What is not possible is to come to each of our countries and say that we want more money from Europe and then say, at the same time, that we want to give Europe less money. Europe does not produce money on its own. Europe's money comes from Europeans and comes in one of two ways: either because the Member States increase transfers at the expense of their national taxes, or we increase the European Union's own resources through taxes on the whole European economy. Or we find the right balance between these two sources of funding. I want the next budget to be a more robust budget, and to do that, you must have more resources. So I am not afraid to say: Portugal is available to give more money to the European Union. But we also support that, in addition to the reinforcement that is done at the expense of Portuguese taxes, there are new resources at European level, which, incidentally, will only be effective if they exist at European level. Or will a country be able to effectively tax American digital multinationals if we do not manage to do so on a European scale? Are we going to be able to tax anti-environmental products better at European or national level? Are we or won't we definitely have the courage to approve the tax on financial transactions? We must have courage and tax, and this is the real speech we must make to our citizens. Migration: Schengen is a major acquis of our Union. It was Schengen that gave freedom of movement within the European Union. Twelve years ago, I was Minister of the Interior and I prepared, in the Portuguese Presidency, for the extension of Schengen to the then new Member States, and I am very proud of the awards I received, from Poland to the Czech Republic, for extending Schengen to the new Member States, giving back the freedom of movement that these peoples have not had for decades, because they were closed beyond the iron curtain. It is this heritage of freedom of movement that we must be able to defend and which we must be able to continue to assert. I am asked whether Europe should be built at two speeds or, as I prefer to put it, in variable geometry. No. As far as possible, we must continue to build Europe at 28 or 27, but we must respect the freedom of those who do not want to do what others want to do. There's no way we can stick together without respecting freedom. But the freedom of those who do not want to go further cannot limit the freedom of those who want to go faster. So long as this variable geometry is not exclusive or definitive and always keeps the door open to which anyone who wants to join — as is the case with the euro, as is the case with Schengen — there is no reason to remain paralysed, just because some do not want to walk at the same pace, and that freedom we must also respect. Energy is a key issue. In Portugal, we have already reached 60% of renewable energy production and 30% of renewable energy consumption. We are well aware that we have natural conditions that others do not. But if we are to share these natural conditions, it is essential that we no longer delay the process of energy interconnections. We need to connect the Iberian Peninsula to the centre of Europe, connect France, France to Germany, and the whole of Europe, so that the whole of Europe can benefit from the excess capacity to produce renewable energies which naturally exist in the Iberian Peninsula and which can hardly exist, for purely reasons natural, in other regions of Europe. I would like to end with two specific questions. First of all, regarding the fires. I would like to thank Mrs Miranda for speaking in a magnificent Portuguese inspired Galician — I cannot give back in Galician, I will pay you back in Portuguese — and tell you this: the fires are a tragedy and the steps that the European Commission has already put forward to improve the European Civil Protection Mechanism are important. The existence of a European reserve that complements the national responsibility of each Member State in order to be able to take place in a situation of tragedy is absolutely fundamental. But more important or important, at least, is that we can act on the causes of fires, and what we need is for the next common agricultural policy to take account of the need to adapt the forest in southern Europe to the new climatic conditions and to make a significant change in the our forest composition. We need less eucalyptus trees, we need less pine and we need more cork oaks, we need more oaks, we need more olive trees, we need to have trees that are resilient to fire and that are able to contribute to sustainable rural development. This change, agricultural policy must also contribute to making. (Applause.) The last question I want to answer is the question of Catalonia. The issue of Catalonia is an internal issue of the Kingdom of Spain, which must certainly be managed by dialogue, but with respect for the value of the rule of law, the Spanish Constitution and the sovereignty and unity of Spain. What we must do, those who are defenders of the rule of law, is always to defend the rule of law, whether it is the autonomy of the judiciary, or when the dignity of the human person is at stake, or when it comes to the sovereignty of the Spanish Constitution, which we must all respect as a democratic and legal state which is an integral part of this Union of ours.

If we do not proceed with this vote and give an opinion on the proposal that has come from the Council, it means that the Council will not be able to make the appointment and a vacancy will continue. A vacuum will establish itself within the ECB. And I don’t think any of us support that principle on the basis of the independence and the credibility of monetary policy within the ECB. I would remind colleagues on all sides that the ECB has already given an opinion on this matter. The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON) has supported the nomination that is before this House today by a significant majority. We have had two hearings, one in camera and one public hearing, where the candidate has demonstrated an excellent understanding of monetary policy and also demonstrated a commitment to the European Union. So it is our view that we should proceed with the vote because, if this House wants to be taken seriously, we should jealously guard all of the procedures that we have.

Almost daily there are incidents that provide dust for a good film scenario. Recently, for example, hackers remotely locked the electronic locks of all rooms of an Austrian hotel in exchange for ransom. We will increasingly be confronted with all kinds of cybercrime. Unfortunately, sometimes foreign authorities are also involved. We're much more vulnerable than we think. That is why national and European authorities must work together to ensure our safety online for today, but also for tomorrow. We need to invest much more in prevention, detection and response. We have already strengthened our legal framework. The new data protection regulation will increase data protection standards. The Commission's proposal on EU certification for safe ICT products is also included. We prefer to pursue a high and international security standard across the board. However, we will not come up with legislation alone, because it cannot always keep up with the rapid technological developments. Europol, the European Police Cooperation Agency, will soon have a Centre of Expertise for Decryption. That's good news. This should support smaller Member States in cracking encrypted messages. It allows them to track down cybercriminals who try to remain anonymous faster and to address. To do this, they will receive EUR 5 million in additional funds from the European Commission. The new Europol boss Catherine De Bolle already stated that the fight against crime and terrorism cannot be seen in isolation from the development and use of new technology. National authorities must also realise that old-fashioned police work must go hand in hand with the embrace of technological innovation. That concern also applies to justice. While criminals use the very latest gadgets, police and justice are often dependent on pursuing with dated material. But we also need to look at the citizens. Governments need to raise awareness of the risks posed by the Internet, so that they are more alerted to various forms of cybercrime. They should also be encouraged to always file a complaint if they become victims of cyber bullying, fishing or hacking, for example. That happens far too little, but without that notification the police cannot act. Notifications are therefore needed to better understand cybercrime, so that we can address them more specifically. Finally, I would like to point out that data is a valuable asset not only for the private user who wishes to protect them, but also for the police forces. Our police and intelligence services need access to data to detect crimes and detect terrorist conspiracies on time. A too dogmatic view on privacy prevents the police and the courts from doing their job. That is what I learned during my work as co-rapporteur in the Special Committee on Terrorism. Colleagues, in the interests of our citizens, we need to strike a good balance between privacy and security. It's not an or—or discussion, it's an and—and discussion. Both privacy and security are important. Police forces must be able to do their job, protecting us from terrorists and criminals, both offline and online.", "language": "en", "original_language": "nl", "translation_provider": "aws", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 154, "date": "2018-03-14.json", "name": "Monika PANAYOTOVA", "mepid": "116663", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Mr President, in 2017, internet access reached 51% of the world’s population. Devices connected to the internet reach 8.4 billion worldwide. With the number of targets expanding at such rates, cybercrime is likely to become the world’s number one threat, capable of causing serious economic damage estimated at no less than USD 6 trillion over the next two years alone.  Cybercrime and the criminal use of the internet violate privacy and human rights. They jeopardise the integrity of our data, attack the security of our critical infrastructures and seek to disrupt the provision of services vital for our security and economy. These are serious threats and they require our full and immediate attention. Already in 2013, the first EU Cybersecurity Strategy prioritised the fight against cybercrime. Since then, we have been constantly expanding the efforts we make to improve our resilience and our preparedness to counter these threats, so that citizens and businesses can fully enjoy the benefits of cyberspace. Allow me to briefly outline some of the efforts which demonstrate the prominent place that the matter occupies on our political agenda. The ambitious Cybersecurity Package presented by the Commission on 13 September 2017 was followed by a set of Council conclusions and an action plan for their implementation. They emphasise the need to enhance the EU’s capacity to prevent, deter and respond to cyber—attacks. In this regard, they encourage the exchange of best practices, investment in cybersecurity training, awareness raising and cyber hygiene. As part of this package, the Council has also started examining the proposal for a Cybersecurity Act that addresses the need for a strong and permanent mandate for ENISA, referred to as the EU Cybersecurity Agency, and for enhancing the EU cybersecurity certification to promote the availability of secure products and services. We are happy that the work on this file is progressing steadily in parallel with the work in Parliament. We are confident that the constructive dialogue will allow a swift closing of the negotiations and the timely adoption of the act. I would also like to recall that in September last year, the very first Digital Summit took place in Tallinn, allowing our political leaders to give strategic directions for future work in the digital domain. They confirmed the strong commitment of the European Union to fight cybercrime and the criminal use of the internet. This is part of the overall aim of making Europe a global leader in cybersecurity by 2025, in order to ensure the trust, confidence and protection of our citizens and businesses online. Thus, it is not surprising that discussion has concentrated on the need to achieve the highest level of resilience for digital infrastructure, industries and services, to create a competitive advantage and to attract investment. This was further developed by the October 2017 European Council, which placed combating terrorism and online crime among the prerequisites for successfully building a digital Europe together with a common approach to cybersecurity. I do not want to prolong my intervention, so I will limit myself to mentioning a number of other relevant initiatives including the EU Internal Security Strategy 2015—2020, which also prioritised the prevention of and fight against cybercrime as one of the three priorities of EU internal security. Secondly, the EU Policy Cycle, which is aimed at tackling the most important threats to the EU posed by organised and serious international crime, including cybercrime. I could also mention cyber dialogues between the European Union and key international partners, as well as cyber diplomacy on which the Council adopted conclusions in June 2017 towards a joint EU diplomatic response to malicious cyber activities. Very positive news is that, on 9 March 2018, Ministers reached a general approach in the Council on the directive on combating fraud and counterfeiting of non-cash means of payment. The Directive aims to update the current rules to ensure that a clear robust and technology-neutral legal framework is in place. It also eliminates operational obstacles that hamper investigations and prosecutions and provides for actions to enhance public awareness of techniques such as phishing or skimming. Trilogues are now ready to start as soon as you have your mandate from Parliament’s side.  Finally, let me conclude by briefly mentioning that in May this year, we expect Member States to finalise the transposition of the 2016 NIS Directive. It is the first legislative act that seeks to achieve a high common level of security of network in the information systems within the European Union and to improve the functioning of the internal market by creating trust. Let us keep in mind that strong and trusted encryption is of high importance, not only for establishing and maintaining such trust, but also for assuring respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. Their protection, including in cyberspace, is our paramount task and joint responsibility.

So we have to take cyber-attacks against our systems very seriously. They can have a huge economic impact. We have heard some of the examples. Bank and credit card fraud in the eurozone alone amounts to some EUR 1.5 billion a year. Every month, one in five industrial computers are attacked. Aviation systems are subject to an average of 1 000 cyber-attacks a month. But the threat continues to evolve and change. It is becoming more strategic. Cyber means have been used to undermine democratic institutions, to spread disinformation and to cast questions over elections. The internet of things means that tens of billions more devices are going online. This will inevitably create a huge number of extra potential vulnerabilities, and at the same time potential new tools to perform cyber-attacks. So what from the Commission side are we proposing to do about this? First of all, we continue to support Member States in the implementation of the NIS Directive, as we have heard, ahead of the transposition deadline in May. This will ensure operators of essential systems assess risk, prepare a strategy, and properly protect their systems. Some Member States are also extending these measures beyond the critical sectors already set out in legislation to other sectors at risk, in particular public administrations. The NIS Directive will also boost national capabilities and competence to promote the exchange of information about threats and incidents. In parallel, we are continue the implementation of the action set out in the cybersecurity package presented last September, based around strengthening resilience, creating effective deterrents and reinforcing international cooperation. The Cyber Security Act, which this House and the Council are currently discussing, focuses on making us more resilient. It aims at giving ENISA a permanent mandate and it is setting up an EU-wide framework for cybersecurity certification systems, again as we have heard. From the Commission side, we are convinced that a European certification process is an important step towards creating security by design. The Commission, the European Parliament and the Council have agreed that this is a priority file and it is of paramount importance that negotiations are concluded within the current mandate of Parliament. Making us more resilient also means making sure the EU retains and develops essential capabilities to secure its digital economy infrastructure and society and democracy. To this end, we have announced the creation of a network of European cybersecurity competence centres to reinforce capabilities across Europe and overcome the current fragmentation of research, with the cybersecurity research and competence hub at the heart of that. The network should bring together research and expertise in cybersecurity from across the European Union and lead to the scaling-up of existing research and technological capacities in the competence centres in Member States, while making sure that research is transformed into specific products and services that will directly increase our cybersecurity. On 1 February, the Commission launched a call for proposals for a EUR 50 million pilot project to support the creation of this network, an important step in its development. However, as we stressed in our joint communication last September, it is crucial to complement our efforts to build resilience with efforts to build effective deterrents. We need to make sure that cybercrime does not pay. That means making it easier to detect and easier to prosecute. As long as there is little or no chance of getting caught, cybercrime will remain an all-too-attractive option for criminals and hostile governments alike. We have already proposed a directive to strengthen the ability of law enforcement authorities to combat fraud and the counterfeiting of non-cash means of payment. To tackle barriers to prosecution, we are also working on a legislative proposal on obtaining electronic evidence for criminal investigations and prosecutions. Over the last two years we have carried out an extensive consultation process and conducted an impact assessment. This issue is complex and requires a carefully balanced approach, having an efficient instrument from law-enforcement point of view, while ensuring full respect for fundamental rights, data protection and ensuring legal certainty for business. I am confident that we will soon present a solid legislative proposal for consideration by the co-legislators. In parallel, we are advancing work on our practical measures to simplify cooperation between judicial authorities and cooperation between our law-enforcement authorities and service providers, based on the existing legal framework. This includes cooperation inside the European Union and with our key international partners, notably the United States. The Commission also actively participates in the ongoing preparatory work in the Council of Europe on the possible additional protocol to the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime, which will deal with cross-border access to e—evidence. On the side of operational efforts that have been underlined, we are beefing up capacity at Europol’s Cybercrime Centre. Law-enforcement capacities need to keep pace with fast-changing technological tools and cybercriminals’ ways of working. This means more cooperation and sharing of experience and reinforced cyber-forensics and detection capabilities. A strong cooperation framework with external partners is of the utmost importance, given the global nature of the threat. The Europol Cyber-crime centre provides technical and forensic support to a number of international investigations which have led, for instance, to the take-down last summer of two of the largest criminal dark web markets. Aside from making ourselves more resilient and building more deterrents, we need stronger international cooperation to make cyberspace stable and secure. This is why the cybersecurity package has an important international dimension. In order to shape this international cooperation, the EU has ongoing cyber-dialogues in place with the United States, Japan, India, South Korea, China and Brazil. Through these cyber-dialogues, the EU promotes the application of existing international law, the implementation of universal norms of responsible state behaviour, and regional cyber-confidence-building measures, as well as the international cooperation through the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime. The dialogues allow for the enhancement of cooperation with third countries to strengthen global cyber-resilience and the multi-stakeholder model of internet governance, as well as to advance the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms. They contribute to global cyber-stability, including through the exchange on responses to malicious cyber-activities that should encourage cooperation, facilitate mitigation of immediate and longer-term threats, and influence the behaviour of potential aggressors. On all these proposals my colleagues and I are actively working with you for the speedy adoption and implementation of initiatives on the ground, and look forward to continuing this fruitful cooperation, to the benefit of all our citizens.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 156, "date": "2018-03-14.json", "name": "Roberta METSOLA", "mepid": "118859", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, let me start by thanking you, Commissioner, for your work on this issue. You will find us as a strong partner to continue to work forward on such an important subject, because the spike that we witnessed in online crimes over the last years should concern us all. Cybercrime and criminals have become more organised, more brazen and more serious. They are using the very tools that we have created to make people’s lives easier against us. We have seen computer systems that we thought impregnable hacked. We have seen the spread of government-controlled social media trolls blur the lines between propaganda and views. There are still too many credit cards and identities stolen and far too many children remain exploited. Tools created for the good of mankind, and which are largely used for good, are being abused, and we must respond by closing the loopholes. With the increasing number, nature and gravity of cybercrime, with the increasing prevalence of the dark net, we need more and better coordination between Member States at international level, as well as with the private sector, to protect EU citizens, companies and our critical infrastructure. We need to ensure that our law enforcement authorities are provided with the necessary tools, resources and staff in order to effectively investigate and prosecute cybercrimes, and that this is done in full respect of fundamental rights and privacy expectations. From here, let me call on the Member States which have not yet done so, to ratify the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime – as we call it, the Budapest Convention. We have to work together and, of course, we need Europol, CEPOL, Eurojust and ENISA to be granted sufficient resources and tools in order to allow them to build the necessary capabilities to cope with the increasing workload and to continue their valuable work in the area of cybercrime.

Really much needed discussion at the right time. The right time is because the European Commission has tabled its proposals, especially with regard to the mandate of ENISA, the European Cyber Security Agency. It is ambitious, it makes this mandate permanent. On the other hand, I would say a lot more could be asked for. I am very impressed that we are almost in the paradoxical situation in which Member States that are first in their cybersecurity are preventing the European Cyber Security Agency from being stronger. We have Member States that have their offices with 600, some with 1000 employees in this area. At the same time, the European Cyber Security Agency has 50 people, and with this proposal to double the budget, I suppose the most can reach 100 people as capacity. On the other hand, who else could organise the response at European level when there is an attack, a cyberattack on more Member States? Who, Commissioner, is currently responsible if we have a “Wan'a cry” attack on twenty Member States? Or we will let each country solve it individually and be rescued individually. We currently have individual Member States that have well-developed structures, and there are other Member States that do not put serious attention at all on organising their cyber services. The next question that stands is the question of standardisation: will European countries be able to agree to have their own certificate based on serious international standards, and whether this certificate will be so well opened that it can be enjoyed not only in the European Union, but also among our partners in the United States, India and other countries.", "language": "en", "original_language": "bg", "translation_provider": "aws", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 158, "date": "2018-03-14.json", "name": "Monica MACOVEI", "mepid": "96824", "text": "on behalf of the ECR Group. — Mr President, the gradual increase in the popularity of digital currencies has led to an increase in cybercrime, because it gives hackers control of these virtual accounts.

Cybercrime is multiplying — colleagues have recalled — and in very large numbers. This affects us all, in public services. I am thinking of the attack on WannaCry, which was an example that mobilized us and which is therefore to be followed when it comes to protection. There are no borders for cybercrime. What is our role? Firstly, in the face of the Member States, perhaps ask them to implement the European data protection framework very quickly. This will allow us to restore the confidence of citizens. Secondly, to raise awareness among citizens about small gestures, but also to the awareness of the importance of protecting themselves on the internet and protecting the Internet of Things through so-called cyber-resilience and, thirdly, to provide judicial and law enforcement authorities with sufficient economic and human resources and capacity to protect themselves on the Internet of Things. effectively combat this threat, notably through Europol's European Centre for Combating Cybercrime. In this respect, Commissioner, I welcome the Cybersecurity package presented by the Commission. It is also necessary to reform the ENISA agency, as you said, to establish a strong cyber defence agency in Europe and, finally, to protect our infrastructures, networks and content. In this regard, the role of enterprises is major. Alone, we cannot act solely at the public level. Companies need to build secure objects, assess, secure, understand vulnerabilities that threaten products or services, and also systematically report cyber attacks. It is also crucial to work on encryption — i know this is a sensitive theme — in building the tools to ensure the security and integrity of networks while respecting freedoms.

This is not the first time we are discussing cybercrime and cybersecurity. The debate has been going on for some time, and we have adopted many resolutions in this House with a whole range of requirements. We have also put in place many laws that are important and which are making great progress. Nevertheless, in the recent past and all the time, even well-protected networks of government institutions and authorities are constantly being hacked, and it is quite obvious that we have a huge backlog. I would just like to briefly summarise ten demands, where I believe that we really have to do something at last. Firstly, as part of the ENISA reform, the common regulation on a cybersecurity act, we need mandatory minimum requirements for IT products. Every year on the European market, we get a whole load of products that do not meet the minimum level of safety standards at all. We do not have such mandatory standards. This has to change! We need liability. If gaps are not closed at all, it must be clear that there is also liability for the companies that put such gaps on the market. There must be no government-sponsored uncertainty. Our authorities cannot buy up vulnerabilities to exploit them, but it does not conceal gaps and thus prevent the infrastructure from being improved. A secure infrastructure comes first. We have to open up gaps rather than conceal it, and it does not always have to go to the Internet. I believe that when we evolve technology, we need to think very much about whether you really need to connect everything to the Internet at all times, or whether there are also opportunities to prefer separations. In addition we need to make products verifiable. We need recruitment professionals who are affordable. These are the points that we definitely need to address. We need a cyber strategy that also significantly revises the network competence of the police and the judiciary. We need open, auditable standards that our regulators can verify.

Where you used to access the Internet only with your computer and an annoying dial-up modem, our coffee makers, our thermostats and our toothbrushes are connected.

On the other hand we are facing ever-increasing cyber security challenges, and one of them is the cyberattack WannaCry mentioned by many of you. These challenges ahead of us can be faced, and the ambition of making Europe the leader in cybersecurity by 2025 can be achieved, through multidimensional cooperation, a comprehensive approach and strengthening the legal framework. In order to increase the preparedness at national and EU level, the key word to overcome those challenges is cooperation and the multidimensional aspects: public-private cooperation, cooperation between Member States, economic cross-border and cross-sector collaboration, cooperation between the relevant services of the Member States, the EU institutions, the new agencies as well as third countries and organisations. As the Presidency, we are determined to advance the legislative work as much as possible. We consider the Cyber Security Act as a priority and hope to reach a general approach before the end of our term so that the trilogues can start under the Austrian Presidency. The aim is to give a stronger and permanent mandate to the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA), the new EU cyber security agency, and to avoid fragmentation of the cybersecurity market of services, goods and processes by establishing a framework for certification schemes at EU level. Discussions are still ongoing, notably the task and mandate of the ENISA as well as on certification.

First of all, I would like to offer my sincere condolences to their families, friends and colleagues. The Council strongly condemns this crime and expects the perpetrators to be brought to justice. Mr Kuciak was a journalist who was not afraid to investigate serious crime. He wanted to shed light on what needs to be eradicated in our societies and devoted his life to fighting corruption and the abuse of power. Mr Kuciak’s courageous behaviour deserves our respect and recognition. The work of journalists like him is a truly vital part of any healthy democracy. Media freedom is an indispensable pillar of any democratic society. Journalists are among the guardians of properly-functioning democracies. Where there is no freedom of speech and people fear for their lives every time they express a critical view, there is no democracy. It is for these very reasons that freedom of speech, media freedom and pluralism are guaranteed under the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. They are among the core democratic values on which the European Union is founded. These freedoms are an obligation on our governments, and all democracies must make it an absolute priority to protect journalists from financial or political pressure. Let me be clear: in our Union, attacks designed to silence media representatives are completely unacceptable. If they happen, we must act immediately: we must condemn the crime, find and punish the perpetrators and re-establish public trust in the ability of our democratic institutions to function. We are all conscious of the responsibility our governments have to protect journalists and defend media freedom. The Slovak law enforcement authorities, together with international experts, are investigating the crime. A delegation from the European Parliament was in Bratislava last week. I look forward to what they will have to say. The Council welcomes the timely initial response of the Slovak authorities, including their initiative to provide a detailed briefing during the February session of the General Affairs Council in Brussels, on 27 February. It signalled a clear commitment on the part of the Slovak Government to ensure a quick investigation. The Council stands ready to provide any assistance to the Slovak authorities in investigating this appalling crime.

We strongly condemn it and express again our deepest condolences to their families and loved ones. Last week President Tajani made a strong call for a detailed, in-depth international investigation. All of the political groups requested an independent inquiry commission to investigate what happened. As President Juncker said, the killing or intimidation of journalists has no place in Europe, no place in any democracy. On behalf of President Juncker and all my colleagues in the Commission, can I say that we fully agree that the top priority for all of us must be to carry out an independent and thorough investigation of the facts and bring those responsible to justice? We call upon the Slovak authorities to do this quickly. We are aware that their investigation relies upon the cooperation of Europol and the Italian authorities. Europol is ready to support the investigations with all the instruments and expertise at its disposal. The EU also provides several additional tools to support police and judicial cooperation between Slovakia and Italy. We encourage the authorities to make full use of this extra support. This cooperation should be put in place as rapidly as possible in order for justice to be done. In order to find out whether this case involved misuse of EU funds and had a cross-border dimension, we invite the authorities to cooperate fully with the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF). If misuse of funds were proven this case would illustrate again why we need the European public prosecutor. The murders of Ján Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová, as well as that of Daphne Caruana Galizia five months ago, show that investigative journalism remains a dangerous profession everywhere in the world, including here in Europe. We can’t accept this. As First Vice-President Timmermans stated, no democracy can survive without the free press, which is why journalists deserve respect and protection. We have to do our utmost to ensure journalists’ safety and to stop such crimes from happening again in any EU Member State. Media freedom and pluralism are essential pillars of our modern democracy. They are guarantees of an open and free democratic debate. They are fundamental rights, as enshrined in Article 11 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. They’re intrinsically linked to the values which we treasure and which we can never take for granted. Journalists have the right to investigate, to ask uncomfortable questions and to report effectively. This is what Ján Kuciak was doing. That, it appears, is why he was murdered. Every day we witness the challenges that political, technological and sociological changes pose to pluralism, to the status of facts and investigative journalism throughout the world. In 2016 the Commission dedicated its annual colloquium on fundamental rights precisely to these issues – media pluralism and democracy. Several Members of this House took part in those discussions actively. They explored the multiple links between a free pluralistic media and democracy and agreed to promote and protect that pluralism and freedom of the media in the EU. The assassinations in Slovakia show that we need to continue to be vigilant, including in Europe, and do more to protect these fundamental rights on a national as well as an EU level. Member States have a duty to make sure that press freedom and journalists are protected on their territory, in law but also in spirit. It is up to national governments, in this sad case Slovakia, to make sure that their citizens are protected and to bring those guilty of crimes to justice in accordance with their constitutional legal order and with international human rights obligations. Under the Treaties, the Commission has limited powers concerning media freedom. However, we can and do monitor, encourage and guide. For instance, we are acting to make sure that journalists can do their essential work in safety. Journalists are the watchdogs of our democratic societies. With their relentless work and investigations they enable a free and independent media to hold those in power to account. In this context, we are completing our work on an initiative that we announced in our work programme last October to strengthen the protection of whistleblowers. Whistleblowers who unveil illegal activities are an important source of information for journalists. Protecting them from retaliation is, therefore, a vital part of safeguarding investigative journalism. The best guarantee of media freedom and pluralism is to ensure the independence of media regulators. This is why the Commission has proposed strengthening the rules for the independence of national audiovisual regulators as part of the revision of the Audiovisual Media Services Directive. This includes requirements of independence that relate also to budgetary and structural provisions. But it is not only about laws. We also monitor risks to media pluralism across Europe and map violations of media freedom. We support journalists under threat as well as investigative journalism. We have recently begun funding a scheme dedicated cross-border investigative journalism. Many of these initiatives, and I salute this, are independent projects financed by this Parliament. One particularly useful instrument is the EU-financed media pluralism monitor, which aims to identify and highlight risks to media pluralism. Unfortunately, the results show that no Member State is immune from risks when it comes to media pluralism. I can assure you that we will continue to monitor the situation in all Member States, including in Slovakia. As this case demonstrates, both the EU and its Member States need to do more to protect investigative journalism across Europe. The murder of this young journalist and his partner is an attack on all that Europe stands for, our values, our right to freedom of speech, our right to ask difficult questions, our rights justice and our capacity to hold those in power properly to account. This is what distinguishes our democracies and keeps them healthy and vibrant. Mr President, if you’ll permit me, two words on another matter. We live in extraordinary times. Various forces seem intent on attacking the rule of law, the very values that lie at the heart of our open societies. We have seen recently the first offensive use of nerve agent on European territory since World War II, something that the Council of Europe called a ‘dangerous breach of the rule of law’.

Citizens of the Slovak Republic, who have been slowly accustomed to daily reports on millions of millions of casuals and to the miraculous phrase “deed did not happen”, took a huge number to the streets. These protests were not carried in a sign of hatred and violence. Were and are in favour of decent Slovakia. For Slovakia, where contacts and acquaintances do not decide, where the international mafia does not rule, but where everyone has the same chances and where honest work leads to a decent life. For such Slovakia as Ján Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová wanted. What can we MEPs do to make Slovakia and Europe more decent? Very much, I think. First and foremost, we must continue where Ján Kuciak had to end up with the hands of the killer. We can uncover the schemes and ways in which European money gets into the hands of the mafia. We can improve legislation to protect journalists and send a clear signal that we will simply not allow such practices. The name of Jan Kuciak must not be forgotten.

This was a difficult delegation, and I think we both express our shock and sympathy to the family and friends of Ján Kuciak and his fiancée, Martina Kušnírová, for their loss, and we did so at their residence, which was a very moving moment. I think the entire delegation understood, in that moment, that this attack to silence journalists has shocked the entire country, and it is right that the European Union sends a delegation and tries to understand why this silencing of journalists anywhere in the EU is in fact an existential threat both to that country and to the European Union, as has been expressed. Together with my colleague Ms Gräßle, we had the task of trying to understand what was happening in the country. We spoke to journalists, to NGOs, to representatives of the protesters, right through to the Prime Minister, President and all of the Ministers and, as Ms Gräßle will say, to the highest audit and agricultural payment agencies’ authorities. We tried to understand what was happening. But this debate centres very much on the question of press freedom. What I would have to say is that from the journalists we understood that they regard themselves as free to express what they want to express. But also in our investigation we understood that there were also threats existing before Ján Kuciak was murdered, and this investigation is an urgent one. For this reason, as Commissioner King has mentioned, there is a lot of cooperation with outside agencies. But we would urge not just assistance from Europol, but we would request – and we did request in Slovakia – that there is a joint investigation team and that there is that level of urgency and an opening of the investigation so that there is maximum trust and people see that the investigation is as open and as trusted as it can be. The question of fundamental rights and press freedom is one for this whole House and indeed for the Commission and Council to consider. What happened to Ján Kuciak is something that we will investigate over the coming days: the connections between the allegations of corruption that we investigated without fear or favour. I would say that the entire delegation were not fearful of asking those difficult questions. In the final sentence, if I may, I would just say that we will make those observations clear in our report. Please read our report.

A journalist who dealt with anti-corruption investigations. They paid the biggest price, with their own lives. Ján Kuciak exposed corruption political cases and mafia crimes. But I will tell you that we also have other journalists: Pavol Rýpal and Miroslav Pejko have fearlessly revealed various scandals and are still missing today and hope is lost whether they are still alive. People were blunted by indifference, from which they were taken up by shots of the execution of Jan Kuciak and his fiancée. And Slovakia really came to life. Slovaks and Slovaks came to many of our cities to demonstrate to light candles and express clear opposition to the direction of our country. There are also various concerts and artists canceling performances to make it clear that this cannot remain that way. It is a disgrace to the government of Robert Fico and his ministers to where our society has caught up. Slovakia is getting out of lethargy, and until now the octopus of corruption has stretched its tentacles to the highest positions of governance of the state. I firmly believe this is the end. Dear colleagues from the Monitoring Committee, I thank you for the work you have done, because we also needed such intervention. I am grateful that you have mentioned the specific problems that Slovakia has to deal with.

Was he killed because of his work? Because exposing wrongdoing is likely to get some very powerful people really upset, maybe even upset to kill for. Just months earlier, Daphne Caruana Galizia was also killed. Two journalists killed in the European Union because they did their job: scrutinising those in power. Those killings are an attack on democracy, and it doesn’t just affect Maltese or Slovakian democracy but it affects the European Union as a whole. We saw a kind of double reality in Slovakia. On the one hand, the legislative framework is solid. The basic democratic institutional structures are in place, and media and civil society are vibrant and critical. On the other hand, there is a parallel reality of corruption, fraud, state capture and organised international crime. In this shady world it’s very difficult to distinguish between truth, half truths, lies and imagination. This uncertainty creates a climate of deep distrust and frustration of citizens with the public institutions. It’s therefore crucial that the murder investigation is independent. I strongly advocate the full involvement of Europol – and not just to provide technical expertise, but with full access to the files. Then, Commissioner, I hear what you’re saying, I’ve heard it before: the European Commission has very little powers to intervene. Well, I disagree with that. We have discussed it often. But this would finally be the opportunity to put forward a legislative proposal for a really strong mechanism for an annual health check for democracy, the rule of law and fundamental rights, because I am convinced that in Slovakia that would have really been support for the ‘good’ people.

But we also have lessons to learn at EU level. The first is that the media freedom situation of investigative journalism and journalists must be an issue for the EU as well. We cannot hide behind the mantra that media issues belong to the Member States and are Member State competences. We need better legal protection for journalists and journalistic sources, including whistle-blowers, now. We have to analyse the situation in the Member States regarding access to information regimes in the Member States and the possible protection of investigative journalists’ personal data in requests for data procedures. We must step up against practices to intimidate journalists by threatening them or by strategic law suits. We have to have European anti—SLAPP measures today and we should invest financial resources to support, strengthen and protect independent media in the Member States in the next post—2020 MFF at the latest.

Two young people who wanted to live together were murdered. They planned to start a family and believed in the values of a common Europe. This brutal act needs to be investigated so that we do not take away young people hope that we live in democratic countries where laws apply. I live in Slovakia, where this heinous act happened. I am immediately experiencing the atmosphere that this act has created in humans. It's fear, uncertainty, perhaps up to the hopelessness that the perpetrators won't reveal themselves. I do not want to take this hope, and I firmly believe that this murder will also be punished because foreign experts also help our criminals. Last year we witnessed the murder of a journalist in Malta. Please, together, let us do our best so that we don't have similar sad cases anymore. This time it was Malta and Slovakia, but they could have happened anywhere else as well. Journalists have an irreplaceable place in our society. The protection of journalists must be clearly declared, they must have conditions created for their work that they are not intimidated, so that they do not have to work and live under police protection. However, this sad event raises many questions. The legitimate question is what we have done to ensure organised crime has no place in the European Union. What we have done to avoid the rampant movement of terrorists in the European Union. Have we taken sufficient measures to establish effective mechanisms for controlling the drawdown of Eurofunds with the possibility of prosecution if fraud is found? In tax evasion and tax avoidance, the EU loses EUR 1 trillion per year. Repeat, 1 trillion euros. These are the topics investigative journalists are devoted to. That is why I join the call that 17 journalistic organisations have written to the Commission so that the high-ranking representatives of the Union do not waste their time and follow up on their words with actions. Commission, according to this letter, must take the leading status and require civil servants and public figures to create an environment in which the fundamental role of journalism is respected. The first step towards this is the rapid functioning of the European Public Prosecutor, the establishment of a European Investigation Office of the European Intelligence Agency. And let us be honest that the elimination of tax havens within the European Union and the adoption of European legislation that will prevent tax evasion and fraud. We owe it to Jan Kuciak and his girlfriend, but also to EU citizens.

I very much welcome Parliament’s support – the support that all of you have expressed – for getting to the bottom of this case as rapidly as possible. I recall that Europol deployed its support team to Slovakia on 28 February. They are there to provide on the spot support and assistance to the Slovak investigation and to share their specialist knowledge of investigative, technical and forensic methods. I reiterate that we call upon the Slovak authorities to engage fully with OLAF in order to find out whether this case does indeed involve misuse of EU funds with a cross—border dimension. These are very important matters and we will not rest until we get to the bottom of them. I have heard the calls from several of you to look again at the arrangements for scrutiny on rule of law matters and indeed, in some cases, to look at potential legislation. I will pursue that with colleagues, but the Commission does remain completely committed to the fight against corruption through a series of targeted initiatives, through the scrutiny that we carry out in the European Semester, and through our practical and financial support for a wide range of projects in the field of anti-corruption. I repeat again that we will be coming forward with a legislative initiative to strengthen the protection of whistle—blowers at the EU level. We agree that whistle—blowers who unveil illegal activities play an important role, including as sources of information for journalists, and we agree that protecting whistle—blowers from retaliation is crucial for safeguarding investigative journalism. So we will return to that.  This horrible crime is, as a number of you have said, unfortunately not an isolated case. There have been other attacks against journalists, in particular investigative journalists, and that clearly calls for a collective response from all of us, because freedom of expression and a free media are anchors of our democracies. So to all those who seek to undermine our democratic values and to those who want to silence independent voices, in particular in the media, we need to send a strong signal. We will not be intimidated or silenced. We will speak up and protect the values that we hold so dear.

As a former journalist, I am therefore particularly struck by the murder of Ján Kuciak and his partner Martina Kušnírová. Kuciak had information about a network of Calabrian 'Ndrangheta, which is supposed to reach the highest Slovak government. The murder is in all likelihood due to his research. Unfortunately, this is not an isolated case, because in the recent past there have been some such cases. This fact once again reflects the importance of protecting journalists. Until the double homicide, Slovakia was also considered a flagship country from a political point of view with regard to the neighbouring countries of Poland and Hungary.

For businesses, it offers a single tax space for the most important tax. This means simplicity, justice, equal conditions of competition. For the Member States, this is the only way to put an end to the temptation to see some reinvent national laws which amount to stealing tax matters from neighbouring countries. Tax competition is legitimate. It must also apply the rules and principles that we apply in all the other areas of the single market: transparency, loyalty and fairness. Regarding taxation, the European Parliament, unfortunately, does not have the right of amendment. That is why the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the proposal of Paul Tang and myself, wanted to focus on three major policy recommendations. First, the project needs its two legs: harmonization, consolidation. All the companies we consulted are categorical about this: the single common basis would bring more complications without the advantage of the common tax space. Secondly, if there is a common European system, it must apply to all companies, regardless of the sector, regardless of size. Finally, thirdly, this project is an ideal opportunity to address the problem of taxation of digital activities and, in particular, the particular economic model of service platforms. These platforms have been around for ten years now. The time has come for tax law to take into account their existence and peculiarities. For example, Google and Facebook have tens of millions of subscribers in my country and pay no taxes. Our European Parliament will be the first political institution in the world to put concrete proposals on the table. We look forward to what the Commission — Commissioner, next week — and the OECD will then propose. I would like to make a political clarification. At the initiative of France, another digital taxation project currently occupies specialized media and services. This is another, simpler and faster approach, a tax on sales or some of the commercial revenues of digital companies. Careful! This project, presented as having the flexibility and speed of a feline, will still have the duration of gestation of a pachyderm and it will give birth, at best, a mouse, bringing a handful of billions of euros a year. In addition, like any indirect tax, the actual burden will be borne not by the taxpayer company, but by its customers, with a risk of double taxation. Let no one be mistaken! The real tax revolution will not be a short-lived pocket recipe, but the harmonization of the whole of corporate taxation.

This week, the Financial Times reported that corporate tax rates have been falling ever further since the crisis, and it raises the question of sovereignty. The only sovereignty the Member States currently have is to lower the tax rate, whereas I would think that if countries had a choice, they could not just decrease, but also increase the tax rates. The proposal that the European Parliament discusses today is a real game-changer. It changes the nature of tax competition. Let’s start with consolidation. Consolidation is the principle that firms no longer decide where to make profits and pay taxes, but it is up to the countries to decide where they make profits and where they pay taxes. It puts an end to profit-shifting. This reduces the pressure towards lower tax rates within the EU. But we also need a profit border control, and that has been included in a proposal by the European Parliament as well. Controlled Foreign Corporation (CFC) rules and switch—over rules – it sounds a bit technical but what it amounts to is very simple: if a tax rate in a country outside EU is lower than 50% the Member States have the right to tax extra, according to the statutory rights. This is a border control that we need to have in place. Reducing the pressure on marginal tax rates and making sure that we let multinationals pay their fair share. That’s what people ask from us. The second important element in the proposal is taxing the digital economy, which has long been overdue and should have been done much earlier. We have made calculations that Google and Facebook didn’t pay 5 billion in taxes over a three-year period, because we are working with an outdated corporate tax system. That is a problem. The current corporate tax systems are outdated. They come from a time with chimneys and blue-collar workers. But globalisation and digitalisation has changed things. And location has become a choice, something that is particularly true for the tech giants, which have no physical presence but are very present in our lives. And in this way, they avoid paying taxes in large, high-tariff countries and reduce their tax bill. Third, and I think this is a very clear statement from the European Parliament, we think that the current proposal amounts to a simple and robust corporate tax system. It should not just apply to the large corporates, but should be extended to include all firms. So we need a lower threshold to give benefits and bring a level playing field to all the firms within Europe. I hope very much that the European Parliament will tomorrow give a very clear signal that, despite all the political differences we have, we can agree that we want a fair, efficient and modern corporate tax system for the 21st century. That could be the signal for the countries to start debating this. I very much hope that especially the large countries, Germany and France, will put pressure on the smaller countries, countries like the Netherlands, Ireland, Malta, Luxembourg that are the pirates within the European Union. They come to another country and try to appropriate these countries’ tax base. These are not the actions of a European partner. A fair and efficient tax system in the 21st century is what we need.

A debate that is the culmination of Parliament's truly remarkable work on this subject. I would particularly like to stress the unwavering commitment of rapporteurs Paul Tang and Alain Lamassoure to explain, to promote the benefits of the CCCTB throughout Europe. They did not just do it here in this chamber, they have, as they say in French, “wet the shirt”. CCCTB's proposal is much more than just a technical adjustment. It raises the question of the taxation we want to build in Europe for the years to come and, as Paul Tang has just said, in truth, corporate taxation in the 21st century that we are now going to debate, namely fairer taxation, more effective taxation, more attractive, rather than maintaining divides national and administrative burdens, and in the end a race to the least tax, of which no one ever emerges as a winner. There is an urgent need because other economies, we know them, are developing their own tax strategy — to put it frankly, we have seen it with the US tax reform. What will Europe's reaction be? Are we just going to rely on the Member States, in the name of the principle of fiscal sovereignty? If we do, we may lead to contradictory national reactions without a long-term vision, and again everyone loses it. Rather, I think that we have everything to gain and all to gain from defining a collective strategy at the level of the European Union with a real impact on the international scene. This is what the readjusted CCCTB project I presented in October 2016, a fundamental project that breaks down, as you know, into two proposals: the establishment of a common corporate tax base and its consolidation. In saying this, I immediately reply to Alain Lamassoure that I agree with him, that doing things in two stages does not mean that we split them but that one precedes the other and that one cannot go without the other. These are the three “C” of CCCTB (CCCTB, in French) that the Commission proposes. If this breakdown has been done for pragmatic reasons, I would like to point out that it is crucial to move forward on both fronts at the same time and that is very clearly what companies want this modern tax system expect from us. The CCCTB will, above all, promote the growth and competitiveness of the European Union, which is what it is about. It will support and attract businesses and investors into a genuine single tax market by removing national barriers and simplifying administrative procedures. It will also offer fairer taxation, in which taxes will finally be paid where the profit is generated, and we know that this demand for fairness is absolutely major and massive for our fellow citizens. Finally, it responds to the legitimate concerns of all those who, for years, have been revolted by scandals created by repeated tax evasion and also by condemnable tax optimization practices. The CCCTB will remove asymmetries between national systems, which are currently being exploited by those engaged in aggressive tax planning. It will also eliminate — Paul Tang pointed out — transfer pricing and preferential regimes, which are today the main drivers of tax evasion. Of course — and Alain Lamassoure made this link — I cannot introduce this debate without mentioning the taxation of digital companies, a subject that is in all minds. We will indeed talk about it at the end of week in Buenos Aires at the G20 Finance. We will look at the OECD's work in this area. What is it about? Companies offer more and more online services, while our tax system is always based on the principles of a national, industrial economy, where we know the centres of decision making, where we locate physical presence. This is a pre-Internet era that is now largely bygone and let us be aware that more and more the information economy, the technological economy and the economy are going to be confused, as our companies are incorporating more and more data into their business. That is why I very strongly welcome the European Parliament's proposal to define the digital permanent establishment, which is a necessary move towards modern and fairer taxation. I also welcome your willingness to introduce a numerical factor in the tax allocation key. We will naturally have to analyze its definition carefully, but the direction seems to me good. As I have already said before this House several times, I remain convinced that with the CCCTB we have the powerful tool and even the optimal tool to introduce, in a structural way, this taxation of digital businesses into the corporate tax rules of the 21st century. At the same time, other more targeted measures are also being studied, although — I tell Alain Lamassoure and I echo what he said — I still believe that the real reform is structural reform, it is the introduction of the digital presence in the consolidated common corporate tax base. But on 21 March, I will also make more specific or more targeted proposals on digital taxation by presenting two texts simultaneously. On the one hand, a proposal to revise the corporate tax rules, to take into account the new forms with the objective of incorporating this new text into the CCCTB — i mentioned it — but also a more specific proposal, which will apply until a revision of the corporate tax rules allows profits to be taxed where value is actually created. I will nevertheless have at heart — I tell Alain Lamassoure — to avoid the risks of double taxation and also this pachydermal approach that gives birth to a mouse of which he spoke nicely. We have to find and there are ways to find a smart third way, and that is what the Commission will try to propose next week with enough ambition to, indeed, reach digital companies and also enough finesse to reach consensus, because a good tax proposal is the one that makes it possible to to create a consensus so that it can be adopted under the conditions we know, that is, at 28. In conclusion, I call on the Member States to remain ambitious in this rostrum because the challenge is considerable: it is nothing less than the definition of a true European tax model. I am glad that the Bulgarian Presidency is treating this subject with priority, not in this Chamber but in general. A good advance in the discussions could lead to an agreement before the end of our joint mandate, the mandate of this European Parliament and the mandate of the European Commission. I hope that after solid work under the Bulgarian presidency, we can reach an agreement under the Austrian Presidency, so before the end of this year. That seems to me a reasonable and desirable objective. You can count on my determination to do everything possible to ensure that this goal is met. I hear here or there the Cassanders announce that this project will never succeed, that it is a sea snake that has already been blocked for seven years. To these pessimists, the optimist I am would like to give an example taken in the latest news to restore hope. Yesterday, at the Ecofin Council, the finance ministers agreed — yes, at 28! — to impose new transparency rules on intermediaries, such as banks, lawyers, other advisers on the tax arrangements they create, and the European Parliament voted on this subject by an overwhelming majority a few weeks ago. This is a major step forward for the transparency revolution that I have called for since taking office and for which I am fighting alongside you. This is one more step, it is another victory that reinforces my determination to reach an agreement on the CCCTB, but if I mention that it is not to highlight a success, it is simply to say that we did it in nine months, not nine years, but nine months. It means that when you want and when you put some political energy on a subject, you can. Dear friends, ladies and gentlemen, I am convinced, listening to your rapporteurs, that you want it and, whenever you want, we can.

One of the key points that makes it easier for companies to operate aggressive tax planning within the European Union is simply the fact that we still have 28 tax systems. That is why it is right to start with the authorities with a uniform tax base in order to help ensure that the tax is actually paid and that trickery is made more difficult. Taxation of digital companies has already been mentioned. I think this is very, very important, because our corporate tax law still comes from a physical establishment where something is produced in real terms. In the digital age, however, this is not always the case. The plant is somewhere, where a server is located, but not necessarily where the value is added. And I think it is very worth mentioning that we are going ahead here and not waiting for the OECD to make proposals. However, I would also like to point out for tomorrow's vote that we will keep what we worked out together in committee — for which I am also really grateful to the rapporteurs — so too. I don't think we can move forward with ideology here. The fact that research costs can be deducted, but not from financial institutions, is very driven by ideology. I believe that we cannot agree to a lowering of the thresholds. And it is also clear that we should restrain ourselves on the issue of tax rates, which is the competence of the Member States.

All these scandals have one thing in common, that is the fact that large multinationals do not pay taxes by playing on the 28 tax systems in the Union. However, whether we are a citizen, an SME or a multinational company, it is normal, fair and ethical for everyone to contribute, according to their income, to life in society, because it is tax that finances social security, health care, schools, public transport, infrastructure or, even, the development of our economy. This was evidently and outrageously forgotten by many multinationals. The result is that, every year, European states lose 1 trillion in tax revenues. It is, of course, unbearable! The aim of the two directives we are discussing today is to achieve an identical definition of taxable profit in European countries, in order to put an end to the play of multinationals who seek to take advantage of the differences between our tax systems in the Union. Specifically, this CCCTB project proposes that there should be only one place of taxation, one contact with a tax authority for all multinationals operating in the Union. Initially, only large companies with more than 500 million turnover will be affected, but Parliament strengthened the directive proposed by the Commission, extending the scope of this directive to all companies within seven years. I think it's a good thing. With this text, companies engaged in cross-border activities will have to comply with a single European system to determine taxable income, rather than different national regimes in which the activity is carried out. We have also introduced measures to tax digital businesses, which, too, must contribute to their fair share, given the enormous profits made. These two directives should therefore, in part, address current concerns about corporate taxation. One downside, unfortunately, is the fact that we are not able to agree on a minimum tax rate. However, this tax rate would allow for real tax harmonisation at European level and should reduce intra-European competition, which is too strong at present.

The CCCTB is a very important step in this direction. So today I would like to ask you to support this report. Finally, the taxable base will be the same throughout the European Union, with one aim in mind: taxing value where it is created. However, it is not our intention to eliminate competition between Member States. On the contrary, creating a level playing field will lead to competition in mainly three areas: workers, infrastructure and tax rates. This will strengthen the competitiveness of our Member States and, ultimately, that of the whole European Union. As an icing on the cake, our companies will have to take into account only one system, rather than 27 different ones, which will significantly reduce the administrative burden. This single system is also a strong basis for taxing digital giants such as Facebook, Google and Amazon. Moreover, it creates a framework to arm ourselves against attacks on our European tax revenues by third countries. To sum up, the CCCTB represents more revenue that will be borne by a broader base and a stronger Union in the world. It's a historic opportunity.

We need simpler taxes that can be set at a national level and encourage competition, not an effort to stifle competition. By removing the chance for nation states to compete on tax, you inevitably increase tax levels and make us all less competitive.  What is the impact of this? Companies fleeing the high-tax, regulation-filled EU could move elsewhere. Smaller EU countries which currently manage to actually prop up their economies by being competitive on tax, such as Ireland, will be penalised. Of course, when tax is increased, the whole economy of all of the EU will be suppressed and held down by this wet blanket of desire to control and to tax all the time.

I would like to see us competing as an island off the coast of the EU that gives a real competitive advantage to business, that says: we want you here; we want wealth creators here; we are a friendly nation to people who want to make money and we are not like the EU, which is addicted to endless taxation so that they can spend on huge schemes.

The Irish Government has signalled its concerns over this proposal and, no doubt, will continue to do so.

Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking the two rapporteurs, Paul Tang and Alain Lamassoure. I do not want to repeat everything that has rightly been said, but I would like to focus on four points. Firstly, in my view, this is not a law that now wants to punish a certain type of company, but it is a law that seeks to establish equality — equality between small and medium-sized enterprises that are based in Europe or anywhere else in the world, and the large companies that have the chance to learn about tax arrangements to take advantage of the freedom that Member States have given them. Secondly, that is why it is also important to make it clear that this law does not restrict the freedom of the Member States — and no matter whether they are large or small Member States — but that we regain sovereignty so that we can actually achieve a consistent balance in Europe in tax law, in which the Member States are large or small. the individual Member States will then be able to once again allow fair competition with different tax rates. This, too, seems very important to me. If we get this common corporate tax base, there will be competition between Member States, but it will be competition that will be fair. That is why I believe that this proposal will help us to increase tax fairness, and I am grateful that we will be able to follow this path.

I do not want to prejudge this, but I am glad that we are moving together in a largely transpartisan way to call on the Member States to act quickly, as they have done on intermediaries, because our fellow citizens are asking for it, and it is true that this debate gives rise to the very broad ambition of the proposal. I would like once again to welcome the work of the rapporteurs who have been able to mobilize, convince and promote the CCCTB project across Europe. I hear the questions that arise, and it is normal for such an ambitious reform to give rise to questions and debates of ideas, but we are at the time of political choices. It is time for Europe to be ambitious in its tax reform to attract businesses, remain globally competitive, fight against tax evasion and evasion, and with CCCTB we have a unique response to the concerns of both businesses and citizens, and that is why this reform is so important. For businesses, we offer a genuine single market, with simplified, uniform rules and fair and fair conditions of competition, and to citizens, we show our determination to fight tax evasion, which feeds precisely on asymmetries between national tax systems. Thanks to the proposals I will make next week with your support in the future, digital business taxation will also — if the Member States decide — will be an integral part of the CCCTB project and therefore we will really have this corporate tax architecture for the 21st century which will affect the whole economy, whatever be its strata, its sectors or its forms. Facing cleavages in view of the current administrative burden, i think we have the cornerstone of the modern, competitive, transparent tax system that we want. I am counting on the two coming Presidencies, the Bulgarian Presidency at the present time and the Austrian Presidency to complete the work. I would also like to respond to a few points raised by Members of Parliament. First, no, this project is not an attack on the sovereignty of the Member States. This is never the case in the projects we are formulating because the European Commission, as you know, has no form of competence, for example, over rates. It is just a question of harmonising the operating conditions in the single market for the benefit of companies and this is not only a national level but also, of course, the national level retains most of its prerogatives. Obviously, it is also a question of combating tax evasion, which is fostered by the complexities linked to fiscal borders, but again the answer is European. Mrs Joly referred to the use of Article 116 to deal with distortions of competition in the domestic market. I do not think it can be used as a legal basis for a legislative proposal such as the CCCTB, but you know that the European Commission is thinking about reverting this issue of unanimity in tax matters, which we find is at least a source of complexity, especially when we have plans as ambitious. Finally, on the question of whether there is a basis for a own resource in the future or on the question of tax rates or tax harmonisation, I repeat: by creating a common basis, we are undoubtedly moving towards fiscal convergence. Fiscal harmonization, which I share, also depends on the will of the States members, because there is no return on tax sovereignty. I do not think there is any additional tax weight — at least that is not included in the proposal — and therefore I think that with all the sensitivities that are expressed here, you can move confidently towards the consolidated common corporate tax base which is consistent with much of the visions I have heard here. . Moreover, the rapporteurs do not seem to me necessarily come from the same political families, and yet they have done an extremely close job, since we have a proposal here which can really bring together because it is a question of modernising, making our tax systems transparent and combating aggressive tax optimization.

However, we know — we have seen other examples and, on this subject, an example a few years ago — that the Council knows perfectly well how to get rid of texts that embarrass it, without having to vote formally against it. The first way is to say “There are other emergencies” and, in 2011, it is true, we were in the middle of the eurozone crisis, there was fire at home, maybe it wasn't the time to take care of changing the furniture. Another method is to let the file get bogged down by postponing it from meeting to meeting, and this is where the priority over time, which the Council could give to a limited solution to digital taxation by indirect tax, could be harmful. Finally, there is another method of emptying the draft of its substance, and what we can know about the work of the working group, which operates under the authority of ECOFIN, is very worrying, since they have completed a first reading of the first draft directive, simply deleting most of the provisions proposed by the European Commission, making the original proposal meaningless.

Special thanks also go to the rapporteurs and the shadow rapporteurs for working together on these files, as well as to Alain Lamassoure and also to Pierre Moscovici. I think we worked together very productively. I very much appreciate it. We have the vote tomorrow, but it doesn’t mean our work ends after tomorrow. We can’t just have a vote in the European Parliament. We still have to reach out to national parliaments, national governments and the public to put pressure on for this reform. I also expect that from Members of the European Parliament, and I am sure that Alain Lamassoure and I will continue to work outside this House to press for this reform, because this year will be the moment of truth. I am very pleased when Pierre Moscovici says that this year we should have the discussion in the Council and this year we should put the pressure on. This is the year when the Member States have to show their true colours. In the end, I think that, even if we don’t have the 27 on board, we should push this, because it puts pressure on the countries that remain outside an agreement. Currently, the situation is that Google and Facebook are in Dublin, but the tax reasons for being there become much less if other countries already start to tax Google and Facebook. This will change the dynamics. Hearing this debate, another point came to my mind: first of all that reform is very difficult, especially for countries on their own. They fear losing competition, so the best option for reform is to do it together. So we need to restore sovereignty for Member States as well, by trying to reform together.

The time has come at a pan-European level to create a fair tax system with a common corporate tax base, without grey areas, to stop the tax dumping of multinational companies and to tax their profits in the countries where they are reaped. In addition, all legislative “windows” that legitimize the practice of intra-group transactions and lead to tax avoidance that deprives state budgets of huge tax revenues.

Dear ladies! Processes occurring outside the borders of the European Union have an increasing impact on the situation of the EU agri-food sector. Another example of external conditions affecting the situation in our agriculture is American trade restrictions on Spanish olives, although in the future it can be expected that various products from other countries may also be affected. Growing protectionist trends in the world could pose a serious threat to our producers. I would like to present the letter now. On 13 July 2017, an anti-dumping and countervailing duty proceeding concerning mature olives from Spain was initiated after it was concluded that the aid maintained by olive producers in the Union resulted in olive products being imported into the United States at prices lower than market ones. Given that the increase in exports from Spain has very little impact on the situation of the two US olive producers, the most worrying aspect of the case is that some of the support measures applied under the common agricultural policy are examined in the countervailing proceeding, even though they fully meet the criteria for payment of the green category applicable to the WTO. The measures under consideration for countervailing duties are the basic payment scheme, aid for young farmers, etc., which have no connection to production. They do not affect the level of prices in particular agricultural markets. They don't disrupt international trade. On 19 January 2018, the Department of Commerce imposed an unreasonable countervailing duty on Spanish olives in excess of 17%. What action has the Commission already taken on this? How does the Commission support Spanish companies? What actions are planned in response to the threat in which the Common Agricultural Policy has been found? Is the Commission considering the possibility of bringing a complaint against the US to the World Trade Organization? It is end of the question.

We are, of course, the subject of two subjects on the issue of olives from the United States, others would say under attack. One is anti-dumping investigations against individual producers of olives. Here too, one can indeed be very critical of whether this is a justified subject of investigation, because we undoubtedly do not allow dumping proceedings in the EU. We will probably see a result of these anti-dumping investigations by the United States in June. I can also, in some ways, sympathy for launching this anti-dumping investigation. But the second line, anti-subsidy measures: the accusation of subsidy fraud being carried out in the European Union — I have no sympathy at all. This is not against individual companies, but, as the previous speaker said, it is against European agricultural policy. This is a mockery because, with the last reform of the European agricultural policy, we are clearly fulfilling the criteria of the green box within the WTO. In this respect, this is an attack on the structures of the WTO, and of course we know this from other contexts. We discussed this this morning as far as steel is concerned. Structures accepted by 164 countries are deliberately questioned here. That is why we must also make it very clear that we cannot accept these anti-subsidy investigations and the impose of duties. This is ultimately pure protectionism! We have already asked the Commission three times what is the state of play on the olive issue, that is, what action the Commission has taken so far.

So we have been actively involved in those investigations from the very beginning, and have provided all the necessary assistance to the Spanish Government and the exporters concerned.

And they announce a trade war on our export sectors. Research has been opened — as they have already referred — since last June, in one case, and in July, in another case, to several Spanish, Andalusian, and Seville companies, specifically, three companies that have a high competitiveness in this field of table olives, namely black table olives. One of them is a cooperative. These are the olives that are so critical and apparently so much affecting Californian companies in the marketing of their products. This has already meant that, on a provisional basis, an increase in tariffs of an average of 22% has been imposed on the companies concerned. The final decision will be determined next June. If the result is negative, important tariffs would be imposed on imports of black table olives from Spain, for a duration of up to 10 years. We are clear what is the goal of Americans: to weaken the export capacity of these companies, which are already heavy-implanted in the US market, to clearly benefit two Californian companies. The Commission is doing well, it is supporting the sector and the Government of Spain. I encourage her to stay like this.

I would therefore like to point out that this intensive cultivation of olive groves is also responsible for a real environmental crime due to pressures on water use, soil depletion and contamination of groundwater.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "aws", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 321, "date": "2018-03-14.json", "name": "Nicola CAPUTO", "mepid": "124851", "text": " Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the most worrying aspect of this affair is that the United States investigation into the countervailing duty targets the support measures envisaged by the CAP.

We share your concerns and I do not accept the accusation that the Commission has been silent on this. Since the very first day, we have raised it with our American partners in different ways. There have been letters and personal meetings where we have raised it with the relevant ministers. We have raised it over the telephone. We continue to raise it, and some of my colleagues are doing the same because we share the view not only that this is a disaster for Andalucía, and the producers there, but also that the anti-subsidy part of those investigations raises serious systemic issues, which might affect not only Spanish farmers but also the entire EU support granted to farmers across the EU under the common agricultural policy. We have made that point, very clear. So we will continue to defend EU agricultural policy until the end of this investigation, at both the technical and the political level. We have worked very closely with the Spanish Government on this. Only this morning I had contact with the Spanish Minister. We have also worked with the authorities from Andalucía. We offered support for the written and oral intervention that Spain made on this. We also offered assistance during the US verification. That was declined, as it was not needed, but we continue to work very closely with Spain and with Andalucía. We will continue to exert pressure on the US authorities until the end of this because we firmly believe – as you too have said, honourable Members – that these subsidies are totally in compliance with the rules of the World Trade Organization (WTO). As you know, we also had a discussion this morning on steel. This discussion is not easy, given the US administration’s protectionist attitude towards international trade. If our efforts should fail we will carefully analyse the situation. We expect a final decision in June and we will weigh all possible options to challenge a measure, including in the WTO.

It’s an issue that is dear to my heart personally and to this Commission especially, and I know that many European citizens that you represent also attach great importance to this. I’m happy to update you where we stand on this. The European Union, including the Member States, have a great track record on corporate social responsibility. I would say that it’s one of the best track records in the world. We have led, our Member States have led and a very large number of our businesses have led, including our small and medium-sized enterprises. And this is not only about ethics and respect for others and the environment, it is about long-term sustainable growth and profits for business: shareholder value. The Commission has recognised from the start that the EU has a valuable role to play here. We can facilitate the implementation of CSR principles, bringing together companies from across different industries and individual sectors to find common solutions. We can incentivise it, including by setting benchmarks and other requirements, and we can also, if necessary, legislate. In 2011 we issued a communication setting out a range of actions. Among others, these actions have aimed to enhance the visibility of CSR and disseminate good practices; improve company disclosure of social and environmental information; further integrate CSR into education, training and research; emphasise the importance of national and sub-national CSR policies; and better align European and global approaches to corporate social responsibilities. We have adopted policies right across our work, from development to agriculture, to labour rights, to justice. A major step forward was the 2015 Directive on non-financial disclosure. This allows shareholders to have proper disclosure and put pressure on companies to change practices if necessary, and I would say that our work has delivered results. In 2014 we carried out a major consultation on CSR. It showed that over two thirds of the respondents were happy with what we have delivered, and that is not just only public sector engagement. Of course there’s always more to be done, and that’s why during this mandate the work has continued. We have continued to mainstream CSR across our policies. In the last year we adopted a revised shareholders’ right directive. We have been giving effect to our new public procurement legislation, paying attention to social and environmental elements, and we are working to finalise guidelines on socially-responsible public procurement. And of course, we adopted here the conflict minerals regulation – we will discuss that tomorrow; I’ll be happy to give you an update then – to ensure responsible trade in four minerals: tin tantalum, tungsten and gold. And only last week we adopt an action plan on sustainable finance. On the basis of the recommendations set out by the high-level expert group on the subject, the Commission is setting out a roadmap to boost the role of finance in achieving well-performing economy that delivers on environmental and social goals. That is just the tip of the iceberg of what we have been doing. We are continuing to engage with business and stakeholders. Whilst public authorities, of course, have a role to play, the final responsibility must always be with the businesses themselves. CSR must be in their DNA. And we are continuing to engage internationally, both through multilateral fora such as the UN and OECD, and of course bilaterally. We have been developing a good dialogue with Japan, for instance, on these issues, and I expect us to develop more such dialogues, because we want other countries to come up to our levels. It has been increasingly clear that there is no dividing line between CSR and our wider work on implementing the United Nations sustainable development goals. If you act against companies using timber that has been illegally logged, that is an issue both of the CSR and the SDGs. If you act against the import of materials produced in sweatshop conditions in a third country, that is an issue of corporate social responsibility and sustainable development goals, and it’s true of our work on business and human rights as well. So under this Commission, we are taking a holistic and integrated approach. We are putting our work at the heart of our implementation of the SDGs. Whether you label them CSR or SDG doesn’t really matter; the matter is of course that you take the most effective and proportionate action to address a situation. That can be through legislation, but it can also be through promoting industry-led standards. Under our 2016 communication on SDGs we have set up a multi-stakeholder platform, made up of stakeholders from business, trade unions, NGOs and others, and I expect that within this platform there will be a working group on CSR. That started its work in January only, and it continues to meet. It will give us valuable input and ideas how to take this work further. We have encouraged it to look at the progress we have already achieved and give us advice on what more needs to be done. So we are looking very much forward to receive the input, carrying on also our own stocktaking exercise of what has been done and what more can be done, and the result of this work will feed into the autumn communication of the SDGs. So with this, I hope I updated you on an issue I know is very important to you as well, and I’m looking forward to the discussion.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 329, "date": "2018-03-14.json", "name": "Alberto CIRIO", "mepid": "124772", "text": " on behalf of the PPE Group. — (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you Commissioner for the report. I just wish, Commissioner, that you had very clear that today's argument on corporate social responsibility was prompted by a specific case, which was the subject of an oral question co-signed by 69 Italian MEPs, on a specific case called the Embraco case. I also say this by thanking the delegation of Embraco workers, who joined us after fifteen hours by coach from Italy this morning, who are following our work. Why, Commissioner, the situation is this: Embraco is a company that is in Italy, which is in Piedmont, is a company that is part of the Whirlpool group, and it is a company that, despite the fact that it is not going through a moment of crisis, but has the favorable economic situation, decides to move and decides to relocate. The problem is that it decides to move not outside the EU, but within the EU, and precisely Slovakia, where labour costs are lower. Then we must understand, Commissioner, what the Commission's position is. One, if it's acceptable that a company that is well can move around and put the 500 workers who are laid off to move elsewhere in crisis. Two, if this elsewhere can be in Europe. Europe was born to create wealth, not to move it from one country to another. And three — and I will close, Commissioner — we must understand whether these European countries have used European funds to create situations of facilitating these companies to move, because this would really be very serious, because this is money from European citizens, even those citizens, of those 500 workers, who are now in danger of losing their place. Like them, the Italia Online group, also in Piedmont, is putting 500 more jobs at risk.

It refers to companies voluntarily going beyond what the law requires to achieve social and environmental objectives during the course of its business activities. The Commissioner has told us how well companies of all sizes across the EU are leading the way in the development of CSR policies. Many companies are progressively integrating CSR into their company strategies on a voluntary basis, and businesses which acknowledge that they are a part of the community where they employ people are to be welcomed and encouraged. In my own region of the West Midlands we have a brilliant example of CSR: Cadbury’s, the well-known chocolate company developed Bourneville, a model village on the south side of Birmingham for its factory workers to live. It was described as one of the nicest places to live in Britain. They put social responsibility at the heart of their company’s ethos.

The reality that no agreement has been reached to vote tomorrow is that all the groups, which have had 72 hours to work on this issue, have seen that there was a possibility of reaching agreements if they let us work a little longer. Obviously, the ALDE Group's position is that Parliament is not here to deal with a particular problem of a company — imagine how many companies there are — but to talk about strengthening, improving that win-win situation, which is corporate social responsibility. This is an excellent tool for enterprises which creates a win-win situation because it allows for improved social dialogue, allows companies to undoubtedly improve their productivity, competitiveness and image, and, at the same time, obviously, has very favourable social repercussions. We are therefore going to develop, adapt, to improve what the Commission said, for example, in 2013 on corporate social responsibility. I must say that it is not appropriate to transform the concept, and that is where we are going to debate how far it can go. It is an instrument in the hands of companies and is an instrument for socially reacting to the strategic decisions of enterprises, but it is not an instrument that has to set business strategy, but is it going to be adapted in the most socially way; nor is it an instrument that can never be used to prevent mobility or free installation of companies or their long-term strategies and less when it comes to going from Europe to Europe.

And it is useless to find palliative solutions, you have to solve the problem at the root. Perhaps Bratislava used European funds to favour tax relief, but that wouldn't be, and that's not the point. Slovakia is more competitive than Italy because, while part of the euro, it has lower taxation and lower labour costs. If Europe incentivizes the movement of capital between such different states, it should at least assess its impacts on employment and the economy, and of course implement concrete countervailing measures for people who they lose their jobs.

Please, you are only listeners here and should not interfere with the discussion. I will be very grateful to you. Mr President! Creating incentives for business to be socially responsible is extremely important. Especially these days, when the pursuit of profit messages other equally important aspects. Businesses, and particularly larger ones, are often an integral part of a particular geographical area and become one of the relevant sources of employment and income. Fortunately, businesses are creating various programs within the social responsibility of business. I have examples of this in my region as well. However, I am convinced that the creation of a programme within the social responsibility of business should be due to the will of the enterprise concerned. No such obligation should be made by European legislation. Rather, we should focus on incentives for entrepreneurs that can take different forms — tax incentives, for example, as well as image incentives. It is necessary to increase awareness of consumers and convince them that it is worth buying products or using the services of businesses that promote good employment conditions, protect the environment or support the local community. I was surprised by the proposal that, as part of corporate social responsibility, introduce a ban on relocation of companies from one country to another. The decision on the business model and the place of business is a matter for companies. This is a fundamental, treaty-guaranteed freedom within the framework of the European Union. I believe that we should pay more attention to the instruments in which we are able to erode the effects of relocation and provide workers with retraining or other attractive employment. Europe has instruments to use for this purpose. One is a community fund. Its effective use can provide a balance between employee protection and the freedom to manage the company.

After all, individuals with far less power and wealth are expected to meet these basic benchmarks. The EU’s approach to corporate social responsibility is, in fact, not all that well developed. For many years the EU served effectively as a facilitator for tax-dodging by corporations, enabling smaller Member States, such as Luxembourg or Ireland, to strike sweetheart deals that eroded the tax bases of larger members. It is now attempting to construct a new system that will make profit-shifting and other aggressive avoidance more difficult within the EU, but this would be better done globally by the OECD. Other measures to improve corporate responsibility can be implemented at a national level, so long as governments are not shorn of powers to do so. For example, rules limiting the salary of the highest-paid employee of a corporation to a fixed multiple of the lowest-paid employee could be put to national electorates in elections. Too often in recent years, the corporate sector has taken refuge behind high-profile, politically-correct sponsorship schemes which provide a sheen of good publicity, which is then used to camouflage a generally ruthless approach on such issues as importing cheap labour rather than training local labour.

In principle, companies that are socially responsible are more successful in the market, offer better jobs and behave more responsibly towards protecting the environment.

In this area, positive results are shown in greater employee affiliation, greater motivation, less sick absences and this all of course again leads to an overall better result.

The subject of this debate, as communicated to the Commission, was corporate social responsibility. Now we are on a much wider agenda. As I said, the European Union does a lot on corporate social responsibility, inside and outside Europe. We can always do more, of course, and that is why we have set up this multi-stakeholder platform to give us input and ideas, and we are also carrying out an internal assessment to see whether there are loopholes or things we can do better. And I have taken good note of things you said. The granting of regional investment aid, however, that involves the relocation of jobs from elsewhere in the EU is subject to strict Commission control. The state aid rules provide safeguards to prevent Member States from using public money to incentivise the relocation of jobs from one country in the EU to another. That is at the heart of fair competition in the internal market, and it is why, as long ago as 2014, we introduced specific conditions to ensure that regional investment aid cannot be granted to incentivise the relocation of jobs and business activities from one country to another. Arrangements were strengthened in 2017 to ensure that these rules work well in practice. The company the honourable Members are referring to today has not received any support under regional development funds in Italy. We have contacted Slovakia to investigate whether any investment aid was given to Embraco from them, and we are still awaiting a response.

And, as I said, we are working constantly in a dialogue, not only with big, small and medium-sized companies but also with NGOs, with stakeholders and with trade unions and labour organisations, to see how we can endeavour to improve corporate social responsibility.

With more than 100 million CVs since 2005, Europass is a successful, cost-effective initiative at European level. It helps young and old to document skills, competences, qualifications, but also professional and personal aptitudes. Standardised forms are used to provide transparency and facilitate the evaluation process. Students and jobseekers are assured that qualified data will become an important cross-border decision-making tool, both for employers, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as for public authorities and institutions. Our aim was to simplify the Europass, make it more user-friendly and make it an even more efficient tool. In the European Parliament, we agreed that the transformation of the Europass into a completely new form would have been too radical. In the Council, too, 14 Member States had significant concerns. The European Commission reacted constructively so that a proposal initially heavily criticized gradually became a substantial portfolio for more European mobility. After ten months of work with many technical meetings, we agreed in the fourth trilogue in mid-December 2017. The use of the Europass will not be compulsory, it will remain voluntary. I thank the shadow rapporteurs and the members of the two Committees, Employment and Social Affairs and Culture and Education, for the climate of openness and fairness. Dear Mr Svetoslav Malinov, we as co-rapporteurs have worked together excellently, no doubt which, I believe, is a good basis for this report. The Council and the Commission have pursued consensus in the same way and achieved it with us. The result: the Europass is not overburdened, the administrative and financial expenses for the Europass will not be overburdened. Member States are absolutely manageable and the cost-benefit ratio is balanced. The continued existence of the national Europass Centres remains assured. This group of experts has existed since 2004. There is competence, there is know-how, everything is proved, it was never a prevention machine. We have succeeded in preventing the introduction of ESCO into the Europass. While we agree on the objective — better education, better qualifications and much more — a uniform terminology for determining professional aptitudes and key skills does not yet have the necessary maturity. We are looking at ESCO; at the moment it is a project that needs to be tested before it can really be used. The results of the fourth trialogue were agreed at a joint meeting of both Employment and Culture Committees. 64 voted in favour, four voted no, and none abstained. I think this is a good joint success. So we have a chance. A revised Europass — perhaps it can start early next year.

Every citizen needs this and especially when he is looking for a job and decides what and where to study. Differences in languages, definitions, document formats and evaluation and validation methods make it difficult for everyone: from students and jobseekers to employers and government institutions. Not to mention the additional problems posed by the growing mobility of Europeans by newly-joined countries and third-country nationals. The need for a clear common framework, common principles, common terminology covering all parties is unquestionable. Thus began Europass, primarily as a dossier of documents ensuring maximum transparency of citizens' qualifications and competences, used on a voluntary basis. From the outset, Europass has clearly stated objectives, valid until now: to help citizens present their skills and qualifications effectively to find jobs and training opportunities; to help employers understand and assess the skills and qualifications of the workforce; to help employers understand and assess the skills and qualifications of the workforce; to help of education and training organisations in the most reasonable way to define and present the content of curricula. No one can dispute the fact that Europass is one of the European Union's most successful and most popular initiatives. But although successful, the Europass initiative is no exception to the general rule that technology advances constantly require changes. Not only that, the Europass revision should reflect both changes in the labour market and new forms and practices in education and training. It should give people better and more user-friendly tools to represent their skills, as well as to obtain useful and up-to-date information on learning opportunities and the labour market. We are changing Europass to provide online services to European citizens, such as the creation of an e-portfolio and skill assessment, the so-called Skills' intelligence. We are changing Europass so that citizens easily provide information about their skills and qualifications acquired outside formal education and training, such as voluntary participation, in-work learning, traineeships, self-learning. Since the Europass changes are necessarily binding for all Member States, from the outset we searched and finally reached a consensus to defend the competences of nation states on standards for the different qualification systems. We were looking for changes to ensure easier access to Europass for people with disabilities and even better protection of personal data. We were looking for changes that would be bold and useful without, however, causing an excessive administrative burden on Member States, as well as excessive new organisational costs. I am confident that we have achieved these changes.

The skills that people have when they leave school should be a solid basis, but now more than ever before, people need to grow and upskill during their lives and professional careers. Working patterns more and more often mean a change of job or profession, working in new ways or taking on new tasks, some of which we cannot predict today.  People need to be able to easily show and present their skills, identify their skills gaps and easily find the right learning opportunities to fill them. For over a decade, Europe has helped people to showcase their skills and qualifications across Europe. Many of you might know the Europass CV, which has had over 100 million downloads since it was created. It has already been successful, but the time has come – as the two rapporteurs said – to modernise it. In doing so, we want to make the most of the new technologies to ensure that Europass continues to support the needs of those looking for upskilling, mobility and career opportunities. I would like to warmly thank the two rapporteurs, Mr Mann and Mr Malinov, for your very constructive approach to this during the interinstitutional discussions. The amendments from you strengthen the Commission’s proposal, for instance by highlighting the need for Europass to be fully accessible to people with disabilities or elderly persons. I want to thank the entire team in Parliament and the Council for the excellent cooperation, allowing us to reach a timely agreement on this Europass decision.  We have made progress on the implementation of the New Skills Agenda for Europe. The Commission has delivered on all its ten priority actions. Our aim, which is well reflected in the text that we have now agreed, is to provide an ambitious, forward—looking framework that offers modern tools for describing skills. The new Europass will include the electronic skills portfolio, which will allow users to create, store and share documents and information on their skills and qualifications. It will include a self—assessment tool that will allow users to identify new skills they may need, share the results, add them to their CV, store the results in Europass and map their progress over time by comparing with previous self—assessment results. It would also include skills intelligence, which is up—to—date information on trends and demands in different sectors, countries and professions across Europe. This information can help individuals in their career management. All these tools to support people’s careers and upskilling choices bring an added value to Europeans. The new Europass text lays the basis for the next step towards closer cooperation and easier communication of skills and qualifications across the labour market, education and training sectors. Let me underline the important role of Europass in helping to deliver on the European Pillar of Social Rights. The right to education, training and lifelong learning and the right to active support for employment is enshrined in the Pillar. The modernised Europass can now play its full part in actively supporting these rights.  Together, we can deliver on our commitment to making the most of people’s skills. This is good news for individuals, as better matched skills improve their work and life opportunities. However, it is also good news for employers – they can easily find workers with the skills that they need – and it is good news for Europe. Unlocking people’s talent is the key to competing and succeeding in the global economy. So thank you again for the work you have done.

The Member States will work together with different stakeholders to achieve this according to the agreement, perhaps the Commission’s new proposal for a European Labour Authority can also be helpful in that regard. We have nonetheless reached a compromise on skills intelligence, which was controversial from the start.

Our labour markets are, as has been said earlier here, changing very quickly, and the most important skill moving forward will be flexibility.

In a rapidly changing global world, our skills will be the driver of our competitiveness. Therefore, it depends on the readiness of graduates, because thanks to their application in the labour market, they will be able to perform interesting and skilled work and lead a better life. The new version of Europass tailored to new technologies and specific needs is the answer to how to boost and make people's skills even more visible. With the new Europass, they will be able to show their skills and qualifications more easily and choose from offers of work across Europe. Europass is an important tool to promote labour mobility. Travel for work is an important solution to reducing unemployment, especially among young people, which is alarming in some countries and some regions. I believe that the potential for labour mobility remains untapped in Europe. So we should encourage young Europeans more to gain not only study, but also work experience abroad.

But it is well known that the tools are not neutral or operate autonomously, but implement specific policies. In essence, they are the means to implement political guidelines. Europass is therefore called upon to support and technically support the neoliberal policies of the European Union on education and employment. So what is the centre of gravity of this platform to be created? Will it be easier for workers to look for jobs and ensure decent and quality jobs? Will it be the strengthening of all-round education and culture? I'm afraid it won't be.

A skill auction that will act as a means of pushing wages down and worsening working conditions, since we will have high skills with low pay.

With this amendment to the Creative Europe Regulation and this three-year European co-financing we recognise the value, we give a future to the Youth Orchestra of the European Union, founded 40 years ago by Claudio Abbado and Lionel Bryer, set up by the European Parliament. I would like to thank my colleagues, the Council and the Commission again for their fruitful cooperation. This orchestra is one of a kind, because it consists of young musicians from all Member States of the Union, selected each year according to quality criteria. A real workshop of young talents that transcend cultural boundaries and collaborate to achieve excellence in the musical field. In fact, thanks to this extraordinary experience, which I would call European musical citizenship, a large part of the more than 3000 musicians who have been part of the orchestra to date are today, in Europe and in the world, conductors, soloists and teachers, but they also grew the musical culture of many young people. The orchestra was conducted by the greatest musicians, from Claudio Abbado to Barenboim, Bernstein to Rostropovič, performed in the most important music festivals of Europe and the world, earning the respect of the whole cultural community. I would say a true cultural ambassador of the European Union, who has enhanced the richness of our musical heritage, fostered intercultural dialogue and really created the premises for greater culture widespread music. At a time when Europe is facing so many challenges, it is nice that in the European year of cultural heritage we have found this agreement, because we must remember that music was the first language European common. But adequate funding is needed to allow all this. We have a very troubled time behind us for the orchestra since, in 2016, risked closing due to shortage of resources. For this reason I have fought, along with many of my colleagues, whom I thank, to first save the experience of the orchestra, and now to secure it until 2020, the year in which the new will be approved European programme dedicated to seven-year culture. On that occasion, I hope, Commissioner, that the European Ambassadors of Culture will be reinstated, including other excellent European institutions. Of course, we call on the EUYO to develop a greater capacity for the involvement of musicians from all Member States, who must make selections as properly advertised as possible, and also to diversify their revenue in order to ensure with sponsors and other contributions — and of course with their shows and tours — to ensure their sustainability and reduce reliance on Union funding. But as an European parliamentarian and as an Italian, let me also say that after Brexit the orchestra, which is based in London, also risked losing its legal status as a European body. For this reason, together with the Italian government, the Rai and the municipality of Ferrara, but also together with other collaborations, we have offered the opportunity to the Youth Orchestra of the European Union to move in Italy, also obtaining financial support from our country, but also to continue the experience of the Summer School in Austria, in Grafenegg, Bolzano, and to have an antenna also in Brussels, thanks to Belgian government, so in a really European logic. So the orchestra, I would say — and this I say this with a lot of pride, and we should all be proud of it, I think — is the first cultural institution since Brexit that was experienced by the world of culture in that country with great apprehension and with great concern — it is the first to be hosted in another Member State, in a logic of solidarity and for safeguarding the freedom of movement of many young people, sharing a European cultural and educational experience.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "aws", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 396, "date": "2018-03-14.json", "name": "Tibor Navracsics", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, honourable Members of the European Parliament, the European Union Youth Orchestra was funded at the request of this House in 1976 and received the patronage of successive Presidents of the Commission, Parliament and heads of state and government.

So far, nearly 3,000 young musicians have come through its ranks, touring on four continents. The orchestra's long-standing contribution to developing musical talent and promoting European culture is unquestionable. Nevertheless, the exceptional treatment of this initiative by the Union institutions cannot come at the expense of new artistic endeavors, whose creators also solicit funds from the Creative Europe programme. For this reason, I believe that the negotiated text of the amendment, which calls on the Orchestra to diversify the sources of funding and stipulates that the appropriations are granted exceptionally by the end of 2020, is a good option and the document we have developed is a compromise that balances the interests of different parties.

The preliminary agreement reached with the European Parliament on 25 January will secure the financing of the European Youth Orchestra until 2020, which is certainly good news and I fully stand by this decision. Since its establishment in 1976, the youth orchestra has repeatedly proved its European added value. It is the only one of its kind within the European Union, the composition of which is entirely selected by the countries of the Union. However, securing these funds by 2020 does not solve the problem of the need for long-term funding and the need to reduce dependence on the European Union in financial terms. In addition, additional efforts are needed to improve the geographical performance of musicians. My country, Bulgaria, for example, is among those groups of countries that are underrepresented geographically. We must also work to increase its popularity so that there is an equal and fair participation of musicians, soloists, conductors from across the European Union. The activities of the youth orchestra will have to be in tune with the priority of the Culture sub-programme for attracting new audiences among young people. Young people's reach of culture must be a priority at both European and national level. Unfortunately, culture is not among the priorities of the European Union, judging by the negligible budget allocated to it. In Bulgaria the situation is similar. A survey by the Bulgarian Association of Employers in the field of culture shows that 53% of young people do not attend cultural events because they have no money, 41% do not go simply because there is nowhere and 33% are not encouraged by their parents. The data is more than eloquent. However, the Borissov government ruled that young people in Bulgaria do not need a cultural check, it is more important to patch roads and build highways.

The amended regulation aims at ensuring the financial survival of the orchestra until 2020, given its unique institutional nature and its history. However, it is important for the sustainability of the organisation that it diversify its revenues and increase its visibility and ensure full transparency and greater geographical balance in its selection process.

I think they have been touched... although some are gone, I would like to respond very briefly: subject of resources. I would like to say that we have strongly shared an approach which is not only European co-financing the only resource of the European Orchestra, it is a part of their revenue, because there are also some countries , differently, cooperating, there are sponsors, there is hospitality. But certainly having three years with a certain co-financing also allows you to plan and have other good opportunities. As far as visibility is concerned, it is very right: we have asked, we have made a commitment with the European Broadcasting Union to give more visibility to an orchestra that is precisely European and which needs to be more known and have performances there too. With regard to the very right balance required by various colleagues, between countries, this depends on two things: involvement and greater, let us say, not just transparency, but the ability to involvement of individual Member States making preselection, and then of course a focus and also a geographical balance in the final selection. I would also like to say that the orchestra also carried out this year — I say this to my colleague Bilbao when she said about visibility in the various countries — I would like to reassure you: this year, just for the European year, they will be thirteen European countries where there will be tours, as well as countries also outside Europe. Of course, there is an underlying problem — we have said that in conclusion too — which is that of resources. We know that creative Europe, as Mr Grammatikakis rightly said before, is only 0.15% of the budget overall. We are calling for an absolute doubling of this figure at least, even if we know that there are difficulties, but it is a matter of finding priorities: culture is what makes Europe Europe, and that is what can also reconstructing a response to the crisis, which is also an identity crisis, is a crisis of intercultural dialogue, but also of meanings.

Certainly this is the fact that has aroused so much attention and so many attendance by Members. This Parliament is called upon to discuss and decide on a proposal to denounce an existing fisheries agreement with a third country. Bilateral fisheries relations between the European Union and the Comoros date back to 1988, that is to say, for three decades the European Union has had some kind of fisheries agreement with the Comoros, which gives it access to fishing resources in that country. The Comoros are part of the lot of the least developed countries. The fisheries sector, the second most important in the country, right after agriculture, represents a significant weight in both the country's GDP and employment. All domestic operations are handmade and small-scale and involved, not so long ago, about eight thousand fishermen. The stocks likely to be exploited in the Comoros exclusive economic zone are mostly large pelagic fish, tuna and swordfish. Annual catches by local fishermen account for less than half of the estimated stocks. The remaining quantities of fish are exploited by foreign industrial fleets, which land them elsewhere, and fish processing is also carried out outside the Comoros, including catches, in some cases catches from the local fleet. This is a framework that we must bear in mind when examining the European Commission's proposal to denounce the fisheries agreement between the European Union and the Comoros. This denunciation becomes inevitable in the light of the involvement of the Comoros in operations that violate the regulation on illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, IUU fishing, in particular by allowing the flag to exchange vessels involved in this type of fishing activity. However, we feel that we should draw the attention of the European Commission, through the resolution we are discussing here today, to a few questions. The fight against IUU fishing should not, in our view, focus solely on the identification of non-cooperating third countries. An effective fight against all forms of IUU fishing involves finding ways of helping countries, particularly small island developing states, such as the Comoros, to improve their marine management policies. To that extent, it is regrettable that, over almost 30 years in which the European Union has maintained fisheries agreements with the Comoros, it has not been possible to achieve more tangible results in the development of the Comorian fisheries sector, particularly in terms of control and surveillance capacity, scientific development and technical training for fishermen and observers, among other areas. It is also with deep concern that we note that assessments carried out by UN bodies criticise what they call the position of power of the European Union in the establishment of fisheries agreements and in setting fish prices, while also saying that the partnership agreements have failed in the support for the development of local industry, moreover an evidence. This justifies that, in the context of this resolution, proposals should be made to contribute to the continued support for the development of the fishing conditions sector in the Comoros, to the improvement of fisheries related activities, to the improvement of the quality of life of fishermen and, as well as, to combat IUU fishing. These, among other things, are some of the concerns that are contained in the resolution we are discussing today and we will vote on tomorrow.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "aws", "politicalGroup": "GUE/NGL", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 415, "date": "2018-03-14.json", "name": "Tibor Navracsics", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, honourable Members, the Comoros was included in the list of non-cooperating countries in the fight against illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing on 11 July 2017, because it failed to comply with undertakings to combat IUU fishing. The decision to include the Comoros on the list of non-cooperating countries was taken after a thorough analysis of the Comoros’ stance on the fight against IUU fishing, and following its pre-identification in October 2015 and years of discussions with the Comoros. The areas of concern haven’t been addressed by the Comoros and the Comoros haven’t fully implemented the measures agreed. The main shortcomings leading to this listing were related to, firstly, the flag-of-convenience policy pursued by the Comorian authorities and lack of control over its foreign-based fleet register; secondly, evidence of illegal long-distance fishing activities by the Comorian fleet; thirdly, the poor or non-existent monitoring and control capacities of the national authorities, and finally, the outdated Comorian legal fisheries framework also played a part in the decision. According to our rules against IUU fishing, the Commission must propose the denunciation of any bilateral fisheries agreement with such a country. Therefore, the Commission proposed a denunciation of the partnership agreement in the fisheries sector between the European Community and the Comoros. We share the issues raised by Parliament in the draft motion for resolution and welcome your support. The Commission remains fully open to working closely with the Comorian authorities to guide them towards a better fisheries management framework, if they express the wish to do so.

It is the appropriate decision in the context of dossiers that I have been given to examine. But having said this, I would remind you that this small Indian island state is considered one of the least developed countries in the world and that its economy is very dependent on financial and technical assistance from other countries. Combating IUU fishing is quite rightly a priority for the European Union. Last year's FAO report shows that illegal fishing is growing in East Africa, resulting in losses of EUR 325 million in unloading and around 800 million in processed products. At the meeting of ACP Fisheries Ministers in the Bahamas in September last year, the enormous economic and environmental losses due to unregulated and unreported illegal fishing were recognised. But denunciation of agreements, although inevitable, is not the solution to end these practices. Following the implementation of the card system, the denunciation of the agreements and the inclusion of countries on the IUU countries list, the European Commission should make closer cooperation efforts in full reforms. Furthermore, the Comoros are home to a large population of celacantes, a relic of biodiversity and world value, a living fossil threatened by illegal fishing in the Indian region. Strengthening the need for the Commission to intensively promote aid for the development of management, fisheries governance and marine biodiversity in the Comoros. A history of almost 30 years of agreements between the European Union and the Comoros, with no visible improvements in activity, shows that something has failed and failed on our part.

The Agreement is part of the network of agreements of this nature which allow our fleet to fish for tuna in Indian waters. This measure responds to the Union's strong will to maintain its global leadership in the fight against illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, and leadership is consistently acquired between what we say and what we do, and it is based on our credibility. The Comoros Islands are engaged in a “red card” procedure which could identify them as a non-partner country in the fight against illegal fishing. This is due to the fact that vessels with this flag have been found to engage in illegal fishing practices. Its authorities put very little energy and means to monitor and control fishing activity; they also do not update their obsolete fisheries legal system, which is in contravention of international law obligations. For these reasons, we propose this decision for the first time. Until now, the European Union has never terminated a fisheries agreement and, although the economic and social impact of this measure will not be great, we are obviously facing a failure, but a necessary failure, because to continue this is incompatible with the Union's values. The European Union advocates sustainable fishing based on clear rules, but it must also show its firm commitment to the fight against illegal fishing globally. Today we are turning this commitment into action and we do so with two objectives: the first, to contribute to stimulating other behaviour in the sector and fishing activities in the Comoros, but we also send a message to other countries that may fall into the same temptations: if they want to continue working with the world's first fishing power, they must assume their responsibilities, reform their fishing industry and take all legal and material measures to eradicate this type of fishing illegal.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "aws", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 420, "date": "2018-03-14.json", "name": "Younous OMARJEE", "mepid": "30482", "text": " on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. — (FR) Mr President, what we are being asked is to blacklist a poor, very poor country, which Europe criticises for failing to pay enough attention to the interests of the European fleets which, in the clean waters of that country, arrogate themselves the right, against a few euros, to plunder resources.

But beyond the Comoros, large countries such as Vietnam, China, Russia, Brazil and Thailand are also regularly involved in illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, and, for some, in slavery of seafarers, without being worried about it. For example, Vietnam has received only a yellow card, while the blue boats, mainly from that country, have long plundered the waters of the Indian Ocean and the Pacific. Pacific small island States are suffering from a deteriorating situation and witnessing the looting of their exclusive economic zones. This is also the case for our European and, more precisely, French outermost regions. In New Caledonia, for example, Vietnamese blue ships are regularly boarded by the French national navy. In Guyana, illegal fishing vessels are sometimes armed, and everywhere there is an increase in the number of mother vessels stationed at the border of maritime borders and supplied by smaller vessels.

This complaint should not mean the end of a cooperation relationship with the Comoros in the fisheries field, which is why we urge the European Commission to work to restore this relationship as soon as possible, considering fishing communities and small-scale artisanal fisheries as a factor central development of this cooperation, promoting investments and technical assistance in areas as different as the fisheries administration and governance system, monitoring, coast protection, surveillance and surveillance capabilities, the activation of structures to support the refrigeration sector, of the distribution and processing of fish, the construction of landing and safety infrastructures, the renovation of the Comorian small-scale fleet, strengthening safety conditions and the ability to stay at sea, in short, among many other aspects. The sustainable fisheries agreements concluded by the European Union with other countries, in our view, should bring mutual benefits. Strengthening the sovereignty of these countries over their resources, the development of economic activities associated with fisheries, the protection of marine resources and the promotion of the development of fishing communities should be central objectives of this cooperation relationship, and not, as has also been pointed out here, depletion of resources. If we go in this direction, it will be an effective way of combating IUU fishing as well.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "aws", "politicalGroup": "GUE/NGL", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 429, "date": "2018-03-14.json", "name": "Bogusław LIBERADZKI", "mepid": "23768", "text": " I'm closing the debate.
