It concerns patent problems in the area of biological progress, that is, in an area where the laws of nature are very important.  You have all received this question, so I will not read it here. Let me make some comments on my part. Agriculture is characterized by a specific manufacturing process, because in the production process we are dealing with living organisms of plants and animals. The representation of copa-cogeca farmers in its position to Parliament therefore rightly indicates that patent law originating in the technology sector of industry is difficult to transfer to biological processes. Nature, plants, existing genetic material are not inventions after all. Patenting plant features will not only reduce innovation, but will expand administration and inventive costs.  The main concerns concern the restriction of access in the plant breeding process to the biological material covered by the patent, since the new value contained in the improvement of plant quality should become a common good. However, the financing of agricultural progress must be borne in mind and taken into account if we want its effects to be a common value.  Our expectations of the European Commission impose extremely difficult tasks on it to reconcile different interests. However, we believe that food security, the preservation of biodiversity, the possibility for farmers to access and choose certain varieties are their right. At the same time, we want to maintain breeding work carried out in small and medium-sized enterprises, so that they are not forced out of the industry by large companies in this sector. To sum up, we therefore want the European Commission to explain the legal situation regarding patent matters in the area of plant breeding.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 1, "date": "2015-12-17.json", "name": "Pavel SVOBODA", "mepid": "96272", "text": "   author. – Mr President, the Committee on Legal Affairs, which I have the honour of chairing, was in charge of Directive 98/44 on the legal protection of biological inventions when it was adopted. The Directive contains, inter alia, certain exclusions from patentability. Article 4 of the Directive excludes plant and animal varieties and essentially biological processes for the production of plants and animals from patentability provisions, reflected in the implementation regulation of the European Patent Convention. Article 53b of the Convention itself prohibits patents on plant varieties and on essentially biological processes for breeding. However, as a result of consecutive decisions by the European Patent Office (EPO), the content of these exceptions has been eroded. Parliament already adopted a Resolution on this matter in 2012. Unfortunately, it did not have much impact on the decisions of the Patent Office. In two precedent-setting decisions of March this year, the enlarged Board of Appeal of the Office declared that, while processes for conventional breeding cannot be patented, plants and animals stemming from these processes are patentable.  Speaking on behalf of the Committee responsible in this Parliament for the application of EU law, I would like to emphasise the need to ensure that the EPO demonstrates appropriate respect for EU law. The EPO will play a central role in the implementation of the European Patent with unitary effect. It is, therefore, worth bearing in mind that Article 27c of the Agreement on a Unified Patent Court states that ‘the rights conferred by a patent shall not extend to […] the use of biological material for the purpose of breeding or discovering and developing other plant varieties’. I hope that this second attempt by this House to bring its concerns to the attention of the European Patent Office will help to convince the Commission to raise the matter with the EPO and will help to prevent, and possibly reverse, interpretations of law which erode carefully considered exceptions to patentability and patent protection.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE-DE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "PPE-DE"}, {"id": 2, "date": "2015-12-17.json", "name": "Christos STYLIANIDES", "mepid": "124688", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, on behalf of my colleague Elżbieta Bieńkowska, I wish to thank you for giving the Commission the opportunity to address Parliament on the important issues surrounding patenting and plant breeding rights.  Let me start by reassuring you that the Commission is well aware of these issues. More specifically, we are aware of the breeders’ concerns related to the patentability of plant traits that pre-exist in a plant obtained by essentially biological processes. We are aware that breeders fear having more limited access to biological material. The Commission has been closely following the discussion in both the Agriculture Council and the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development of the European Parliament following the rulings of the Enlarged Board of Appeal of the European Patent Office. In order to help address the concerns raised by breeders, the Commission is currently analysing this issue with the objective of finding a quick and workable solution for all the stakeholders involved. For this very reason, the Commission will be cooperating with the forthcoming Dutch Presidency that has supported such a pragmatic approach which does not entail the need to revise the Biotech Directive. Our wish is to avoid creating long-standing legal uncertainty for the biotech sector when revising or recasting the Biotech Directive. In particular, this could hinder the development of new biotech products for the benefit of European consumers. The re-opening of the Directive would not only put the specific breeders’ issue under the spotlight, but would also trigger discussions on issues that the Directive and subsequent decisions of the Court of Justice of the European Union have clarified. Examples of these issues are the limit on the patentability for inventions relating to embryonic stem cells and the scope of protection of inventions relating to genes.  The solutions brought forward by the Directive and the subsequent decisions of the Court have integrated ethical considerations. They are considered to offer the appropriate balance, by both researchers and the industrial sectors most linked to biotechnological inventions. Having said that, the Commission is highly aware of its task to monitor scientific and legal developments as well as their implications on current patent law in the biotechnological field in Europe. The Commission is also aware of its responsibility to report on these issues to Parliament, the Council and the broad public as well. Before concluding, let me stress that a Biotech expert group has been set up with a mandate to provide the Commission with expertise, analysis and comments on the rapid evolutions in this field. The Group is discussing, among other issues, the patentability of products obtained by essentially biological processes and the report that this Group will soon produce will further support our analysis. I wish to assure the House that the Commission is giving high importance to working on a timely and pragmatic resolution of this issue so that the current legal uncertainty is resolved in the interests of all concerned.

However, some recent decisions by the European Patent Office call for greater clarity on the legal interpretation of European patent law.  Innovation in agriculture and the development of new plant varieties are crucial to meet the challenges of food security and climate change and can at the same time give a significant boost to Europe's small and medium-sized enterprises. While patents serve precisely to stimulate competitiveness and innovation while safeguarding economic investment, in some cases they can act as a brake on innovative development, particularly when essential biological processes used by farmers freely over the years are involved.

With this, new flavours or colours are grown in tulips or tomatoes, for example. Recently, it has become possible to patent these natural properties. This is dangerous, both growers and consumers can bear the brunt of this.  When someone naturally grows a new property in a broccoli or tomato, you don't want someone to be able to apply for a patent on it. You create a monopoly on a property of fruit or vegetables and therefore also on our food supply. The natural properties of plants are no longer freely available to all growers.  This jeopardizes innovation and can have consequences on the variety of varieties. Our small and medium-sized growers, farmers and gardeners are among the world's top in improving plant varieties and developing new seeds.

These are of excellent quality in Europe and for centuries farmers and later breeders have kept the seeds and products every year to make new improved products.  For example, the breeding of these green varieties has led us to have hundreds of varieties of potatoes. Some are suitable for french fries, some are suitable for the puree and others are very suitable for growing on dry or very wet soil. We can be very proud of this sector and it is important that we keep those products, the seeds, freely accessible. This is important for biodiversity, which is important for innovation in this sector.  And that is not possible if agrofood companies apply for patents on products that have arisen from essentially organic processes. Characteristics of nature belong to no one or perhaps to everyone. But at least they don't belong to Monsanto and Syngenta. It would be bad if these multinationals were to decide which varieties we are going to grow or not in Europe. These companies do not want competition and the market has no ethics.  Mr President, it is crazy! Farmers should simply have free access to these seeds. This means, for example, an extensive breeders' exemption in European regulations.

I am one of the co-authors of the first resolution in 2012, which dealt with the issue.  In essence, we have said exactly what is also the subject of the new resolution today. We can hope that the Commission will finally wake up from its deep sleep and take seriously what we decided three years ago. It is incomprehensible– I must be honest – because we expressed the same fears back then. Innovation is being restricted, because it is small businesses, the small breeders, who are the ones who are taking things forward. Farmers' privilege is being jeopardised and the Commission should consider whether we will continue to accept what the European Patent Office has been doing in terms of legislation for years. We are talking about broccoli patents, patents for tomatoes or peppers, while processes are clearly biological breeding processes patented by the Patent Office. This is a legal practice that we simply cannot accept. The Commission must finally intervene, because this is contrary to Directive 98/44/EC, and that is, so to speak, the law. Then the question is: why does the Patent Office do this? The question can certainly be asked. Well, that is quite simple: the patent office earns money by granting patents, and it will not stop by itself. That is why the legislator must intervene. The second point is that, of course, more and more large companies are trying to keep the market free of competitors by securing patents. This will primarily affect the European seed industry or European farmers, because these are large companies that have nothing to do with the mass of breeders in Europe. That is another reason why the Commission should intervene. I have heard today that the Commission has said that it is monitoring the matter. She has also watched the discussion, and she is now analysing it. To date, they have failed to report on the effects. You have been asking for this since 2003, and since then you have not complied with this request.

Having farmed since 1971, I have witnessed all the improvements produced by fertilisers, pesticides and mechanisation.  In my opinion, though, the biggest single factor in increasing yields has been improved crop varieties. These provide the potential from which all else flows. For every successful variety there may be 10 expensive failures, and the winners must bear not only their own costs, but those of the losers as well. Our commercial plant breeders therefore need the assurance that their work will bring significant financial rewards and not simply provide a shortcut to others who can quickly build on a novel feature that took many years to isolate and consistently replicate itself within a stable variety.  In the past, it was usually safe to assume that by the time a competitor breeder had taken advantage of breeders’ privilege and brought a successor variety to the market, the original variety would have had its few years at the top of the hit parade, earned its royalties and been superseded. Skill and technology, though, is now so advanced and correspondingly expensive that occasionally a breeder can produce something that is a step change or a defining moment in the history of plant breeding. The implications of this need to be recognised and catered for. Having watched the EU make a complete hash of legislating on the topic of GM crops, I do not want this institution to spoil yet more innovation in plant breeding.  I would like to see my own country, Britain, take the lead in this field and consult with the whole agricultural industry, because a balance must be struck between maintaining the confidence of the breeders in the principle that a successful idea will yield a financial reward, but, on the other hand, the concern that the market will be permanently cornered and subsequent potential improvements discouraged. The debate then becomes a very straightforward decision on the amount of time a breeder can have the exclusive use of his variety. I believe the industry in the UK is more than capable of reaching a decision on this with minimal interference from politicians. A system may develop where the breeder of a high-flying variety may take the option of purchasing a longer period of purdah from the government, to the benefit of the taxpayer – a simple commercial decision, taken within agreed limits.  We do not need to get involved in semantic arguments about the difference between a discovery and an invention. We just need to let the plant breeders have their moment in the sun. Now, let us never forget that a farmer can always multiply up old varieties himself if he feels that this is a more economic choice, thereby waving two fingers at the perceived greed of big business.

Mr President, the EPO's decision to liberalise the patents and rights of seed breeders is a very bad thing. This is tantamount to giving a blank-seing to multinationals such as Syngenta, Monsanto, etc., by allowing them to take control, in reality, of our food. I think it's a very serious thing.  This is indeed a danger to our food sovereignty because this EPO policy will promote market concentration, increase farmers' dependence on a few multinationals, as you know, and will inevitably have consequences for consumers. In addition, we will have less control over manufacturing, which will be more and more standardized. With this project, industry groups will be able to organize the control of all seeds, including those that farmers take directly from their crops.  In addition, this new constraint will restrict access to the market for traditional local and organic seeds. In France and Europe, the seed sector is made up of many SMEs and cooperatives. Globally, on the other hand, ten companies share 60% of the market. This concentration, coupled with intellectual property issues, will hinder the maintenance of diversified agriculture.  On the contrary, the seed industry must be under control in order to avoid any monopoly and questionable practice, against which are filed, as in 2013 against a patent granted to Syngenta guaranteeing it exclusive rights to all peppers with resistance to white flies. This patent prohibited farmers and breeders from using these plants without paying a licence fee to Syngenta. However, this was not an invention, but a discovery by cross-breeding of species. Another appeal was filed at the end of May 2014 against a European patent held by Monsanto on mushroom-resistant tomatoes. Again, this was a discovery that the multinational has appropriated.  This privatization of the living threatens small and medium-sized seed companies, which are at risk of having their own varieties patented. This was the case, for example, of the French company Gautier, which has been obliged since 2013 to pay the Dutch seed company Zwaan to market a lettuce resistant to an aphid that it had itself long selected. It's still aberrant! Plant certificates were already questionable as they called into question the possibility for farmers to reseed their own seeds free of charge. But despite this constraint, these plant certificates still protected our seed companies and farmers from patenting. This even more expensive, and much more restrictive, practice is already in effect in the United States. Today, the EPO's scandalous decision and the incomprehensible silence of the European Commission seriously call into question what had been adopted, without enthusiasm, as an effective bulwark. Worse still, this decision raises, once again, the question of the alignment of European law with that of the United States, with the obvious aim of not holding back the ongoing trade negotiations.

Colleagues, i would like to thank you for your excellent work. I would like to remind you that the European Parliament did not so long ago, because in 2012, it adopted a resolution in which it expressed its position in an extremely clear and precise manner on the interpretation of the rules, both the European Patent Convention and the so-called Biopathy Directive. In 2012, just three years ago, it's worth remembering what was written there. The directive makes it clear: patentability is excluded, i.e. it is impossible, for plant varieties and animal breeds, as well as for purely biological processes of plant and animal production, for example through cross-breeding or selection. These are fairly clear and precise words, so it is difficult to understand the decision of the Appellate Council of the European Patent Office. I would point out that it was the Board of Appeal, which is such a kind of court, not the patent office, that took this decision – a decision that raises our concerns about narrowing the interpretation of the existing rules, which, as a consequence, can make it possible to maintain the widest possible biodiversity. Growers also express their serious concerns that this opens such a side door, a gateway, to patenting plant varieties and, consequently, to limiting the possibility of access to increasing crop yields.

Mr President, the recent decision of the European Patent Agency to patent characteristics of plant varieties developed through biological processes is completely unacceptable. This decision poses a threat to food production and food security, as it undermines their availability. It is a development that could lead to a monopoly of parts of the food market and give the real culprit of agricultural production to the multinationals in the agri-food sector, while crushing small and medium-sized farmers as well as farmers, for the benefit of the large producers in Germany and France. Large multinationals use patents to make super-profit and to determine economic developments in agriculture and livestock farming, ignoring the fact that they marginalise small farmers and deprive societies and citizens of useful agricultural goods, which they are now turning into expensive consumer products.

The European Union is built on freedom, rights and fundamental human rights, which are inscribed in European law. We expect the European Union to believe in those rights and to apply them, and equally we expect third countries with which we have a relationship to uphold those rights as well.  I ask the Egyptian authorities to take note of the fact that this Parliament is speaking with one voice today. I ask them, especially, to use Law 140 which, as I understand it, requires a presidential decree allowing Ibrahim Halawa to come home to Ireland, and which has been used in other cases. We need to speak with one voice, and I think the House has done a great service today in highlighting this case.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 51, "date": "2015-12-17.json", "name": "Josef WEIDENHOLZER", "mepid": "111014", "text": "  Mr President, I would like to make a mifful son, mr President, I would like to make a ido to the S&amp;D Group.

At the same time, we have sought to tackle the case in the context of a broader EU effort to address the human rights situation in Egypt.  Last month we resumed the political and human rights dialogue with Egypt, the first in five years. It is of particular relevance to the case at hand that we urge Egypt to meet international fair trial standards. This includes trials without undue delays and requires that Egypt refrain from mass trials and, consequently, handing down mass sentences. We of course noted our strong opposition to the use of the death penalty under all circumstances. We will be continuing discussions with Egypt on justice in the relevant dialogue, in the framework of the EU-Egypt Association Agreement. We will thus seek further improvements, including on judicial proceedings: not least with regard to minors who are detained with adults, rather than in juvenile detention centres, and who are tried as adults rather than by juvenile court judges. You will be aware that Ibrahim Halawa was 17 years old when arrested.  We also systematically address mass trials, which violate due legal process as they fail to determine individual criminal responsibility by bringing identical charges against groups of accused. In addition, such mass trials bring prolonged detention conditions which are in breach of Article 9 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. We are very pleased with the good cooperation with this House in our effort to improve the human rights situation in Egypt and count on your continued support.

We want an impartial judiciary, where people are equal before the law, where the law applies equally to everyone and where we do not see laws adapted to deal with particular individuals, most notably former President Nasheed. We also want to see a judiciary which is improved. It is widely recognised by all political parties in the Maldives that the quality of the judiciary needs upgrading.  Strong independent institutions are also important. We have seen the Human Rights Commission there under attack.

But it is not just the human rights of journalists and political opponents that are at risk. According to diplomats, the Maldives are sending more fighters per capita to Iraq and Syria than any other country in the world. More than 200 jihadists – from a nation of just 350 000 – are believed to be fighting there. This Parliament should be concerned that President Yameen’s call for increased reliance on Sharia Law, and the threat of punishments such as flogging, risk legitimising rather than combating such radicalisation.  In our last resolution in April 2015, we called on the European External Action Service and Member States to issue warnings about the Maldives’ human rights record on their travel advice sites, and to consider targeted sanctions should human rights further deteriorate.

Mr President, as my colleague has just said, when we see the image of European citizens in the Maldives, we say to ourselves: 'it is a paradise on the sea, with the floating villages of Club Med'. Yet there, for the people, it is hell.  Former President Mohamed Nasheed, the first and only democratically elected president, remains in prison. What for? Because he rightly accuses his rivals of instrumentalizing Islam.  We see that constitutional rights are being violated, that the justice system in the Maldives is totally corrupt. The death penalty has been reinstated and even children over the age of 7 can face the death penalty, imprisoned up to 18 years, the age of their execution.  In addition, a state of emergency was declared by the government for six days last month. But what can we do? First of all, as far as travel agencies are concerned, I think we have to tell them that it is imperative that we no longer offer this destination to holidaymakers. I also call for the responsibility of tourists: they must no longer go to the Maldives. Alone, we have the power to suffocate the only rent available to the power in place, which is precisely tourism. If we want to change this regime, we need sanctions. Sanctions are first and foremost us: it is up to us, the future tourists, not to go there. But Europe too can act, because it is the Maldives' second largest trading partner. We have to find ways to coerce power. In particular, we must put in place targeted measures against government supporters, from freezing their assets abroad to banning travel to Europe.  We must act, Commissioner. We are all responsible, also with regard to the situation in the Maldives.

We are here today to debate the human rights situation in the Maldives. Let me remind this House of the continued leadership of the Maldives in the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) in the context of the COP21 negotiations in Paris. What happened in Paris is an important example of the role the Maldives can play in the international community. The last debate in the European Parliament on the Human Rights situation in the Maldives took place in April. In the last eight months, the government of the country is increasingly pursuing policies that will isolate it from the international community – policies that are reversing the hard-won advances in freedom and democracy for which so many Maldivians have dedicated their lives. The increased intolerance of opposition and free speech breeds a climate of fear and anger, with the very real risk of radicalism emerging in the country.  The persecution and continued incarceration of opposition political figures undermines the credibility of the government. The lack of judicial independence raises serious questions about the rule of law in this country. Serious concerns continue to be expressed, not only by the European Union, about, firstly, political interference with the judiciary; secondly, the unconstitutional interpretation of laws; and thirdly, the overnight changes to the constitution aimed at consolidating power. It is essential that the government moves quickly to alleviate these widely shared concerns and restore the rule of law. Real independence of the judiciary is paramount in preserving trust in the system and equitable treatment of all Maldivians. On the positive side, the Maldives are applying a de facto moratorium on the use of the death penalty. We encourage the authorities to maintain it in all circumstances, particularly in cases that involve juvenile offenders, and to work towards abolishing the practice altogether. The European Union wants to make it absolutely clear that there will be a serious setback in relations with the EU if the Maldives restarts executions after more than 60 years of moratorium. It would be a backward step which would not go unnoticed by the European public at large. The European Union is increasingly concerned about the risk of radicalisation in the Maldives and about the number of Maldivians who are, unfortunately, joining Da’esh or other fundamentalist groups in Syria and Iraq. The EU is ready to work with the Government of the Maldives to further the fundamental values of democracy, human rights and the rule of law, but it is the responsibility of the Maldivian Government to ensure the safety of the hundreds of thousands of tourists who currently visit the archipelago every year. The Government of the Maldives has accepted, fortunately, the offer of the EU to send a legal expert to assess the legislative framework, the procedures and practices of the judiciary, and the implementation of the new penal code. We hope this will help highlight those areas where respect for rule of law should be improved, in line with international standards. Progress in the rule of law can be an important step for the government to show its willingness to cooperate with the international community on the critical issues of democracy and human rights. I hope to see this in practice.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 91, "date": "2015-12-17.json", "name": "David Maria SASSOLI", "mepid": "96864", "text": "   The debate is closed.

In the first half of this year alone, more than 40 people were interrogated, detained or charged with alleged activities that endangered the state. In October, for example, blogger and political activist Khalid Ismath was indicted by a court on the basis of the Communication and Multimedia Act and this Sedition Act for publications in which he criticized abuses of power.

Yes, it is modern and dynamic, but underneath the surface of its Western-style economy we see a state that is increasingly authoritarian, where politicians and commentators cannot speak freely. The spike in the number of people facing charges under the Sedition Act, and the recent passing of the National Security Council bill that gives sweeping powers to the Prime Minister and security forces, are prime examples of increasing repression. Ironically, Malaysia hosted the Global Anti-Corruption Conference in September. I would ask the Prime Minister: why not allow your own anti-corruption commission to conduct transparent investigations into corruption charges against you? Why not allow the media to report on it and allow people to peacefully express their views in the streets? Why not honour the pledges to repeal the Sedition Act and make sure security laws actually contribute to more security for people, rather than using them as a tool for repression? Why be afraid of open dialogue with the opposition and civil society, including Anwar Ibrahim and all the academics, activists and bloggers facing charges?

Malaysia currently holds the presidency of ASEAN at a time when important decisions are being taken towards creating an ASEAN Economic Community. Our bilateral ties have strengthened significantly through enhanced trade and investment, political dialogue and a variety of cooperation activities. But against this background, the European Union is concerned about some of the developments that have taken place in this country since 2014, developments which have affected freedom of expression and the rule of law. We are notably concerned about the increase of the use of the so-called Sedition Act, as well as about the judiciary decisions regarding Mr Anwar Ibrahim, the leader of the opposition. As regards freedom of expression and as you all recall, the EU regrets the increasing use since 2014 of the Sedition Act, despite the Prime Minister’s pledge to repeal it. In this context, I would like to recall that in April 2015 the High Representative expressed public concern that this step would have implications for the exercise of freedom of expression.  The High Representative raised serious concerns regarding the due process of law after the conviction by the Federal Court of Malaysia and the five—year imprisonment of the opposition leader in February this year. Mr Anwar had initially been acquitted before the decision was overturned. As a consequence he was deprived of his civil rights and lost his seat as a Member of Parliament.  On 8 December, the European Union concluded the negotiation of a new—generation Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA) with Malaysia. The European Parliament has repeatedly called for the conclusion of this negotiation, which started in 2011. The new Agreement includes specific provisions on human rights and the rule of law which will allow for an enhanced engagement on these matters, in particular through the establishment of a meaningful, broad-based human rights dialogue. During the negotiations, Malaysia agreed to recognise that respect for democratic principles, human rights and the rule of law constitute an essential element of the Agreement.

In other words, a vehicle within the current 80 mg per kilometre standards can actually emit 400 mg per kilometre. Nitrogen oxide is associated with asthma, neonatal malformations as well as the premature death of 500,000 people per year. Instead of forcing the automotive sector to comply with public health standards, the European Commission has taken recent measures which in practice promote the continuation of non-compliance. They allow more than doubling (2.1) the minimum value of 80 mg per kilometre by 2017 for new models and by 2019 for new vehicles. In a second phase, emissions also allow more than 50% of the standard by 2020 for new models and by 2021 for new vehicles.

The eurozone needs to not only support demand, but also address the issue of debt and fragile confidence. The European Central Bank must put in place monetary policy measures that can help support the eurozone's economic recovery.

If every eurozone member state speaks for itself, or worse if they contradict each other, the eurozone will never have the weight it should be given.

It is not the optimal currency range. The five presidents' plan further exacerbates the economic and political problems caused by the single currency.

It is our duty to respond to the various human rights challenges: to combat the root causes of migration flows, against all forms of religious discrimination, for respect for LGBTI rights, for the rights of women, girls and children, or for freedom of expression and the strengthening of civil society.

Although the Dayton Accords officially ended the deadly conflict between Bosniaks, Croats and Serbs in December 1995, they mark above all the inability of Member State governments and European institutions to resolve this ethnic conflict. These agreements have carved into stone ethnic-religious divisions, which are the source of many tensions between the different communities.  Under the aegis of the Americans and without any democratic consultation, the ultimate authority of that state was entrusted to a high representative of the international community. Through the IMF, austerity measures have been imposed on them that have continued to increase poverty, social inequality and youth unemployment.

The failure of the international community to recognize the causes, motives and protagonists of the war in BiH in time has crucially affected the character and course of the conflict and the circumstances of the conclusion of the peace agreement. The consequences of what has been done and missed are felt to this day. However, the real political challenges for BiH right now are in the country itself, not coming from its immediate surroundings. Unlike twenty years ago, clear support comes from her neighborhood today. The perspective of membership, as we well know in Croatia, implies a serious business of change and adaptation to European standards and acquis. Especially in a multinational, highly complex state union with democratic regulation, there is always a need to talk about upgrading the system. Especially if it's obvious flaws.

There are still many people left in the country who have been displaced by the war, and to this day it is difficult to ensure their safe return to their homes.

This, of course, is compounded by the ethnic division of the country, which consists of three national groups: Bosnians, Serbs and Croats.

This initiative is very important and follows the worrying decision taken in March 2015 by the European Patent Office that the origin traits of plants could now be patentable. Specifically, this decision was for tomatoes and broccoli obtained by conventional breeding techniques. As a direct result, small farmers and gardeners would now have to pay to continue to have free access to plant seeds. I have obviously voted in favour of this resolution, which is based on the strong principles of equity and the fight against monopolies in the food chain.

The issue concerns food safety and it is therefore important to regulate it at European level. I believe that innovation and R&amp;D should not be hindered in any way if there is no risk to human or animal health. Therefore, the European Patent Office should assist this process, and the IPR system is also an important market incentive and competitive tool. Let us not forget that as a result of breeding work, we also produce public good. It is important that the plant breeding sector has unrestricted access to biological agents.  In order to ensure food security, biodiversity and adaptation to environmental change, I believe that farmers should even be allowed to produce their own seeds adapted to local conditions (if they meet certain criteria). This may also be important in special cases such as organic cultivation.

Since this Resolution calls for legally binding measures to bring to justice companies that have circumvented national laws and international treaties, and calls for the development as much as possible of a comprehensive protection strategy for this park, including the fight against corruption and the investigation of acts of violence committed against active human rights defenders in the DRC , I voted in favour.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "GUE/NGL", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Left-wing"}, {"id": 1273, "date": "2015-12-17.json", "name": "Tim AKER", "mepid": "99650", "text": "   in writing. – UKIP abstained on this non-legislative and non—binding resolution.

I call on the Congolese authorities to investigate and bring to justice the threats and violence against the rangers. In my opinion, the Congolose government must do everything in its part to stop and prevent irreparable damage to the Virunga National Park as a result of the exploration and exploitation of oil or other illegal activities.", "language": "en", "original_language": "nl", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Liberals and centrists"}, {"id": 1388, "date": "2015-12-17.json", "name": "Miguel VIEGAS", "mepid": "125100", "text": "  in writing. Two-thirds of the world's known oil reserves are in the Middle East. But dependence on this area is unacceptable from a strategic point of view, according to the imperial powers. Thus, major multinational oil companies are clearly involved in the search for new oil reserves. In 2010, the Government of Congo signed oil exploration contracts in areas covering 85% of the Virunga park area, although the Democratic Republic of Congo Act prohibits any exploitation in this park, which is considered a world heritage site by UNESCO. This park is now threatened, in particular by concessions given to multinationals Total and Soco, among others. With respect for the sovereignty of all the countries involved, and in particular the Democratic Republic of congo, it is our duty to seek to ensure policies for the exploitation of resources at the service of local populations and not at the service of the accumulation of profits by multinationals, which do not look at ways to corrupt governments or destabilise entire regions to reach their ends.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "GUE/NGL", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Left-wing"}, {"id": 1389, "date": "2015-12-17.json", "name": "Harald VILIMSKY", "mepid": "125001", "text": "  Writing.

Virunga National Park (PNV) is the oldest national park in Africa. Classified as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1979 and a world heritage site in danger in 1994, it is the park with the greatest biodiversity on the African continent. For decades, the PNV has been under threat from armed groups. In 2007, the threat of danger to the PNV increases with the allocation of oil concessions by the GOVERNMENT of the DRC, which cover 85% of the park, despite existing legislation, which prohibits the practice of activities harmful to the environment in protected areas. However, the prospecting licence granted to SOCO International plc benefits from an exception provided for by law, which allows the performance of \"scientific\" activities in protected areas. A report by Global Witness, published in September 2014, stated that there are allegations that SOCO and its contractors made illicit payments. The situation experienced in the PNV is another painful demonstration of the inhuman, exploitative and aggressive character of the capitalist system. Despite condemning SOCO for the activities of prospecting and exploiting PNV resources and asking it to publicly commit to cancelling them on a permanent basis, the resolution proves much tougher on the DRC Government than on the British-based company.
