Everywhere else, across Europe, millions of people have made it a tremendous popular tsunami.  That is why 11 January will remain the birth date of the Europe of peoples united in diversity, united in adversity, united for our values and against hatred. United not in books, not in treaties and not even in speeches, but in the streets and in hearts. Because the victims of Paris are the same as those who fell in Madrid, London, Oslo, Brussels or Toulouse. You said it, Mr President: journalists killed because they were journalists, policemen killed because they were policemen, Jews killed because they were Jews, Muslims killed because they had read in the Koran that peace is the most beautiful of the names of God and comedians killed because they dared to laugh. The real targets are our universal values, which Europe proclaimed first and around which the whole European project is based: freedom of expression, freedom of belief, tolerance, the right to all differences, the dignity of the human person and, of course, the value of peace - the supreme value. Peace as a goal, as a means of resolving all disputes while preserving all differences. This is the miracle that Europe has achieved. This miracle is under threat. Already hatred had come back insidiously in speeches, it now returns in deeds.  It is up to us to be worthy of this formidable cry of brotherhood, which was taken yesterday in immense silence by all the crowds in Europe.

European citizens have made their voices heard en masse, a voice that says: \"We stand for freedom, we stand for tolerance, we stand together.\" This week has shown Europe and the world that, whatever happens, our values remain unchanged. We believe in the freedom to experience religion, the freedom to think and say what we want, but especially in a society free from fear. The tragedies and suffering in France must strengthen our resolve. We must not fight among y's or point the finger at each other. The challenge is not only to ensure our safety, but also to connect our society. Only together can we come out stronger. In addition, no one is more or less because he or she has a different background. For us, it is not the past, but the future that matters. And that will be a future based on fundamental European values and freedoms. We all share in the pain of France and offer our deepest expression of sympathy.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is not the first time that terrorism has been killed in Europe, but never has an attack caused such a shock, as demonstrated by yesterday's demonstration in Paris where Mahmoud Abbas and Benjamin Netanyahu were seen side by side. A symbol of freedom of expression, the primary value of our democracy, has been targeted, and if we are all Charlie here in this Chamber, it is first of all because we are all Europeans and committed to the secular system of the rule of law that we have built. Let us not forget that among the three policemen murdered were a black woman, a Muslim and a native Frenchman. This proves that our societies are multicultural and that our rule of law is intended to give everyone a chance. Yet, from Madrid to London, and today to Paris, we must also acknowledge a failure. These terrorists are our children, born, raised and dead on our soil. Of course, the sectarian confinement that afflicts part of the youth and the jihadist indoctrination of some is a phenomenon that affects the entire Muslim world, but it also raises the question of our European role and responsibility.  For far too long, Europe has believed that it can turn away from the world's problems. Entry into Iraq and indifference to Syria are sources of terrorism. They have a huge impact on our daily lives and together we must create an ability to act in our neighbourhood instead of, Mr President, to confuse Islam and Islamism, this theocratic ideology. Islam has as much place in our societies as Christianity, Judaism or any religion or philosophy, and the vastness of the crowds of all origins who have demonstrated in recent days is living and vibrant proof of this.  Finally, we will need to take further action against terrorism at European level. This response cannot take the form of a limitation of civil liberties, but must be used to preserve them. Restricting these freedoms is precisely the aim of terrorists. Perhaps there is something positive about this whole tragedy, ladies and gentlemen. Last week, for me, another Europe was born for the first time: the Europe of peoples, the Europe of citizens and above all the Europe of values.

Mr President, Minister, we welcome the powerful outpouring of solidarity of the peoples of Europe and around the world with the french people in mourning, but standing and determined in the face of the executions of journalists, many of my personal friends, police officers and Jewish citizens. Yesterday, in every city and village, the people of France, united, came together to build a front, a solid roadblock against fundamentalist fundamentalism, against barbarism. And he did so with the knowledge that elsewhere in the world, from Baghdad to Kabul, from Aleppo to Kobane, the same terror floods the streets with blood. Those who were murdered were murdered for what they represented. Some the Jewish religion, the police the public service of the French Republic, and our journalist friends because they represented the free spirit and slinger, the refusal of the spirit of barracks.  In keeping with the ideals of these executed friends, we must avoid any political recovery and think about working more on ways to avoid this, on effective ways to eradicate terrorism. Clearly, the spirit of war does not allow it. What is the record of fifteen years of war on terror? We must do it differently and carry out a plan of co-development, of dialogue with the peoples of the Near and Middle East. The refusal to grant the Palestinian national movement for so long has only cast salt on the wounds of humiliation. The debate will certainly also arise between the dialectic of freedom and that of security. Security cannot be sacrificed on the altar of freedom. Freedom cannot be sacrificed on the altar of security. Both must live and progress together. We have a responsibility to build new bridges with the Mediterranean for a new type of dialogue and cooperation while drying up the financing of terrorist networks.  Finally, we cannot leave, as is the case today, so many abandoned neighbourhoods, children, teenagers suffering, young people with no future. That is why we need to move away from austerity choices to provide financial resources to school, culture, sport, training, early childhood, employment and aid to cities.  This must make us think at the same time. It is essential to get out of the amalgamations, the discourse of division and hatred that has been spreading for months. On the contrary, it is the spirit of popular unity that must take precedence, the spirit of the debate, the rejection of exclusion in order to make a common society, a common Europe. France said yesterday its spirit of brotherhood, of living together against barbarism, let us be worthy!

My thoughts are with the millions of citizens in France, Europe and the world who have expressed their sorrow and support, and who reminded us again yesterday that the camp of fear and hatred has not won.  However, in the aftermath of these attacks, when this huge shock in France and Europe was awakened, we still have to be careful not to fall into a double trap. The trap of the fanatics behind these terrible attacks, but also the trap of demagogues of all stripes who consider the events of recent days as a declaration of war of Islam to the rest of the planet. Just as we will not accept a war of civilization, we will not accept the nauseating amalgamations practised by identity and nationalist movements across Europe.  Another trap is also to be seen to see our civil liberties drowned out under a new security arsenal under the pretext of fighting terrorism. Remember the response of the United States after 9/11: the Patriotic Act led to many abuses that endangered the rights and freedoms of citizens as far as Europe, such as the CIA prison scandal and secret flights. Let's not fall into this trap. We do not protect human rights by denying them, we do not protect freedom with less freedom, as Mr Schulz said.  Let us act against the stigma and discrimination of children in Europe on the basis of their religion, name, origin or neighbourhood. Let us stop this spiral where the announced failure of our youth turns for all into despair and for some into hatred and barbarism. Since we are preparing a European investment plan, let us take advantage of it to give priority to education, training and public service for these millions of young people, to give Europe's children more love and less hatred, as a recent cover of the Charlie Hebdo magazine illustrated.

It was quite something to see millions of people on the streets of Paris and elsewhere – sincere, worried, and, in some cases, very frightened people. However, there were also 40 significant, important political leaders, and they too were using the language of unity and solidarity; but I am afraid, for them, ‘Je suis Charlie’ is simply not enough, because we need now to have an honest admission that, actually, our political decisions have led to much of what has happened. Just think about foreign policy: from Afghanistan, through Iraq to Libya, and even the attempt to seek to arm the rebels in Syria. We were told that all of this was done to make our streets safer. In fact, what we have done is to stir up very deep resentment within much of the Muslim community, and it has had the very opposite of the desired effect. We have pursued policies of mass immigration at a rate that has made it frankly impossible for many new communities to integrate. For that, I think, we have to hold our hands up. Perhaps worst of all, we have been guilty of weakness, of lack of courage and of a lack of assertion in who we are as people, and we have turned a blind eye within many of our minority communities to practices that would not be tolerated in the rest of the population. Indeed, we have allowed preachers of hate to go around saying things that are totally unacceptable. The result of all this is that we have, I am sad to say, a fifth column that is living within our own countries and is utterly opposed to our values. How we deal with that problem is vital for the future. We must embrace the vast majority of Muslims, who themselves are horrified at the civil war that is going on within Islam. But unless we are prepared to admit our own culpability in much of what has happened, we are not going to be able to find solutions. I would suggest for the future, however, that we are going to have to be a lot braver and a lot more courageous in standing up for our Judeo-Christian culture.

I have more sad messages to make to you.  On 19 December, our colleague Philip Bradbourn died at the age of 63 after a serious illness. Mr Bradbourn has been a Member of this House since 1999. He represented his region, the West Midlands, with great pride, he said. Philip Bradbourn began his political career after working as a city planner for more than 20 years. I have already expressed our sincere condolences to his friends on behalf of the European Parliament. I would like to do so again at this point. The European Parliament will not forget Mr Bradbourn. Leo Tindemans died at his home near Antwerp on 26 December last year at the age of 92. Deeply influenced by the brutal occupation of his homeland by the Nazis, who forced him to flee as a young man, as an eighteen-year-old, Tindemans worked tirelessly throughout his life for peace in Europe – as a member of the Belgian Parliament, as Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Belgium, as Foreign Minister of his country, and as a Member of the European Parliament. In the first direct elections to the European Parliament, Tindemans was elected in Belgium by such a majority that the newspapers even then named him \"Mister Europa\". I think Leo Tindemans was right to bear that name. He was certainly a great European. On behalf of the European Parliament, I offer my sincere condolences to his family. We will keep Leo Tindeman's honorable memory. I ask you, ladies and gentlemen, to rise from your seats in honour of Philip Bradbourn and Leo Tindemans.

Of course, the evolution of the price of petroleum products is, in this respect, favourable since it should restore some purchasing power to the citizens, but will this be enough to stem the deflationary risks? Indeed, once again, austerity policies are now demonstrating the full extent of their negative impact, both in human and social terms and on the economic front. A timid first step in reviving has been taken through the plan proposed by the President of the Commission, but I think that we clearly need to go far beyond that today. Two levers seem to me to be essential in this regard.  Firstly, productive public investment should be neutralised to boost the economy by changing the calculation of deficits, and therefore not just in the context of public participation in the European specific investment fund.  Secondly, the ECB must play a greater role in the European recovery, particularly in preventing the risk of deflation.
