On Saturday, Michel Rocard passed away at the age of 85. Death will have been the result of the bubbling of ideas and the constant commitment of our former colleague. Europe was one of his struggles and he demonstrated fully, by sitting in Strasbourg from 1994 to 2009, his commitment to free software, thus proving that Parliament and its members are committed to the divisions with tenacity, for a just cause, at the service of citizens. I remember more personally the tireless debater whose parliamentary office was next to mine. Despite being a former Prime Minister, he presented himself as a mere Member of Parliament and won the admiration of his colleagues for his work and personality, before becoming successive chairman of the Committees on Development, Employment and Culture. France loses a great European. She also loses a great statesman. We remember in particular the Matignon agreements, which helped to find a solution to the violence in New Caledonia. His commitment to environmental advocacy, particularly in the Arctic and Antarctic, confirms his high visionary quality. The French nation will pay tribute to him on Thursday. I ask you, ladies and gentlemen here in Strasbourg, to stand up and pay tribute to him today.

Among the victims are men, women, some of them children, soldiers and civilians, people of various backgrounds, with different religions and nationalities. The international terror of this group makes no difference. He is blind and attacks everyone. The Prime Minister of Bangladesh, Sheikh Hasina Wajed, rightly said shortly after the hostage-taking in Dhaka that this terror knows no borders, nor does it know any religion. We strongly condemn these hateful attacks. We face a common threat with the other regions of the world – a threat that we must repel with all our strength and certainly also by defending our fundamental values. No political objective justifies the use of such monstrous violence. This boundless terrorism and its murderous ideology can only be contained by a strategy of global cooperation.

In my opinion, the First Vice-President of the European Commission, Mr Timmermans, should be listened to on this point, saying that this situation will in fact be played out in Poland. At the moment, such discussions are taking place, and discussions are also taking place between the Polish authorities and the Authorities of the European Union. I think that such a push for such proposals and such a debate just after Brexit, which she also spoke of, would be perceived as a rather inappropriate interference by the European Parliament.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow we will vote at first reading on the agreement reached with the Council on 6 April on the regulation on emission limit and type-approval requirements for internal combustion engines for non-road mobile machinery. This new regulation for non-road mobile machinery will replace the existing directive, cover all types of internal combustion engines installed on different types of machinery, which include small portable equipment, construction machinery, generators, motor vehicles and locomotives, inland waterway vessels, agricultural machinery, such as cotton harvesting machines, and narrow tractors. New power bands and new types of machinery such as cranes have been included in this regulation, for example in relation to the old regulation.  I have to say that work on this dossier has been long and demanding and it has also taken 6 trialogues – 4 with the Luxembourg Presidency and 2 with the Dutch Presidency – to reach this agreement. But I believe that we have reached a good agreement, indeed a very good agreement. The work was lengthy because the dossier was technical but also because we had to wait for the conclusion of other dossiers, such as the regulation on emissions under real driving conditions and the interinstitutional agreement 'Better lawmaking'. But in the end the co-legislators did an excellent job and I would like, of course, in addition to the Council and the Commission, to thank all my fellow shadow rapporteurs from the other political groups for this fruitful cooperation which we have been able to establish from the outset, and I believe that the sign of how fruitful this cooperation has been was also the vote in the ENVI Committee. , where our work received almost unanimity. Thanks to this fruitful work, I believe, we have also obtained a negotiating package where Parliament's priorities are clear and I believe that they have improved the Commission's original text.  I would also like to thank my colleagues in my group who supported me in my role as rapporteur and the chairman of the ENVI Committee, Giovanni La Via, for their support in the final trialogues and, of course, also all the staff of all the institutions involved in the work, because they had to do a great deal of work, precisely because of the technicality of the dossier. I would also like to express these thanks with a rather melancholy vein because, over and above the fact that we have worked at the turn of various presidencies which we are greeting right now – the Dutch Presidency to welcome and thus wish the Polish Presidency well in its work – I would remind you that two of the shadow rapporteurs who have worked with us are British, and therefore on this point. , so to speak, there is the melancholy of the vote of 23 June.  I think that the final agreement is extremely positive and I explain why: very briefly, without going into technicality, because I want to leave time for the debate perhaps to reserve a few minutes to reply and then conclude. I believe that we have found a truly important balance between protecting the environment and protecting the competitiveness of European industry. In fact, we in Europe will have the strictest emission limits in the world from 2019: we are talking about nitrogen oxide emissions, particulate emissions, therefore air pollutants responsible for 15% of emissions globally in this sector.

A fairer and deeper single market should also care about environmental protection and health. This regulation demonstrates that the Commission is delivering. In simple terms, this new regulation has two main goals: cutting emissions and cutting red tape. The new regulation provides for more stringent limits for pollutant emissions for engines installed in non—road mobile machinery. At the same time, it sets out harmonised rules for the EU markets and aligns with international standards. In this way, it is good for the environment and good for jobs and growth. It is thus not surprising that this proposal received – and still receives – broad support from the entire stakeholder community. Member States count on it to fulfil their obligations on air quality targets, industries rely on it to increase their competitiveness and to gain investment and legal certainty, and social partners and NGOs call for it to improve workers’ health and to protect the environment. Last but not least, the European citizens deserve it as they can legitimately expect their health to be protected to the best extent possible. Indeed, engines installed in non-road mobile machinery contribute significantly to air pollution and account for roughly 15% of the nitrogen oxides and 5% of the particulate matter emissions in the European Union. Recent studies indicate that their relative contribution to total NOx emissions could become bigger over time if nothing is done. The Commission has acted to propose stricter emission limits, resulting in a very significant emission reduction overall. The new regulation addresses the major air pollutants: nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and particulate matters, including limits for the so-called ultrafine particles, taking up the most recent conclusive evidence on their adverse health effects. Let me also address briefly an important aspect for the internal market: jobs and growth. With this regulation the competitive position of European industries is strengthened in many regards: additional business potential through access to a genuine European internal market, reduced costs through reduction of administrative burden and new business opportunities through harmonising technical requirements, which give industry access to other important world markets such as the US and Japan. In this way the regulation contributes to maintaining a leader position in the field of technologies through the supply of products of highest quality standards. Hence, in this way we lay the foundations to create more jobs and boost growth. The adoption of this regulation will have a positive effect on the environment and on health, as well as on entrepreneurship and competitiveness in Europe and this is, of course, good news.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 3, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 19, "date": "2016-07-04.json", "name": "Jiří POSPÍŠIL", "mepid": "125706", "text": "   draftsman of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection. – Mr President, this proposal for a regulation was also discussed by the Committee on the Internal Market (IMCO), and although we are not a guarantee committee, we supported the proposal as such.

I would like to thank the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs for all their work on this important file. Emission limits for non-road mobile machinery (NRMM) might not sound like the sexiest subject, but it is an important piece of the jigsaw when it comes to tackling air pollution.  In cities, non-mobile machinery such as construction equipment on building sites, trains and generators can significantly contribute to air pollution in the EU, and NRMM contributes around 15% of total NOx emissions and 5% of total PM emissions. These harmful emissions are linked to low birth weights, asthma, pulmonary heart disease, strokes and a variety of cancers, and are estimated to cause 50 000 premature deaths across the UK alone every year, and 10 000 in London.  This proposal is a perfect example of how trade in a common market can also deliver environmental and health benefits for citizens. Rather than allowing manufacturers to undercut each other in a race to the bottom on environmental standards, these ambitious and binding measures on NRMM will ensure industry is manufacturing progressively cleaner engines for these machines, which will go a long way to cleaning up toxic air pollution in the EU. Of course, should a post-Brexit UK want to remain a part of the EU common market, which many proponents of Brexit have said they support, the UK manufacturers will continue to be bound to these same rules, but without any national democratic representation having a say on how these rules are made. The inconvenient truth for those who sought to argue the environmental benefits of a Britain outside the EU is that air pollution has an unfortunate habit of not respecting borders. Over one third of the UK’s air pollution is blown in from across the English Channel.  Cross-border cooperation and common laws across European countries will be crucial – whether Britain is part of the EU or not – in ensuring we do not end up with a race to the bottom on environmental standards. Any new regulations in the UK must reflect this reality.

Thank you very much, Mr President. First of all, on behalf of my colleague Jan Huitema, who is unfortunately not here today – and that is why I am speaking for him – I would like to thank the rapporteur very warmly for her cooperation. He told me that was very good. It has already been said, as the previous speaker said, that this is perhaps not the sexes issue, but it is very important when we talk about reducing emissions to also look at those areas that are not so in focus. We are all talking about road, about ships, about aircraft, where emissions can be avoided, but of course this also applies to tractors, to snow shovels, to barges, to everything that has an engine, and that is what we are talking about in this case: to improve the environment, not only with a NOx, but also with CO2 and other emissions that we have. if they are there too much, can make them sick. That is why this is a very good result that has been achieved, and I would like to draw particular attention to a few things that have not yet been discussed in this way: firstly, there is a clause practically for retrofitting engines during repairs. Especially in the case of small, medium-sized enterprises or companies, it is good that you have the opportunity to improve something before you can perhaps afford a new engine or a new machine. I think it is good that this has come in. This was also co-initiated by the ALDE. Then it is the case that the inland waterway vessels have been discussed for a long time. Inland waterway vessels are also often family businesses, small businesses that are not easily able to buy a new machine and which at the same time are also in competition with the USA, for example. That is why it is good that we have indeed achieved a synchronisation with the standards of the United States, because in this way we have both environmental improvement and competition where we can keep up, where we can stand up and not have to accept a worsening situation.

I think it is important that we also have a say in the tests of the machines. Finally, there are a few exceptions.

But every time we try to address the sources, there is a huge lobby saying ‘yes, but not our source, the other sources maybe, but not us’, and that was exactly what was at hand here and therefore the result is an improvement to the existing situation, but the snowploughs are exempted, we have replacement engines that stay on very long, even cotton harvesters are exempted... so it is a bit of a Swiss cheese as a result.

Mr President, there is no doubt that the will of the majority of citizens is to drastically reduce gas emissions within the European Union and to establish strict upper limits.

Germany cannot be burdened by car manufacturers, which are proven not to respect the current legislation and deceive consumers, as much as smaller countries, such as Greece, are burdened. Thus, the principle of historical participation in gas emissions must also govern Community legislation as regards emission limits for non-road mobile machinery.

In setting out harmonised rules for the European markets and aligning with international standards, it will promote competitiveness and clear red tape. Replacing the directive by a regulation will make life less burdensome for engine and machine manufacturers. From now on, they only need to look at one text and not at 28 national transposition laws.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, very briefly, I believe that the debate we have witnessed has been a kind of small summary of the very thorough discussions we have had all these weeks and months. With Eickhout there is a relationship that has also become quite joking. When you tell me, Bas, the machines that collect cotton, we talk about 200 machines that work a few weeks a year, we know that. But, as you said, it makes a certain impression, but it's there.  I believe that this debate really represents the great effort, the great work that has been done and an example of how, by pooling our energies, listening to us and trying to achieve the common goal of improving the quality of the environment, of protecting the health of citizens, of making all possible efforts in the real world, we arrive at a result that is ultimately the best. They say that the best is the enemy of the good: for good we have achieved it, for the better we are equips ourselves with the next revision of the regulation, because small and medium-sized enterprises certainly have a wider transition period, because they will have much less bureaucracy, because there are so many positive points, in many respects and, I repeat, we will have the strictest limits in the world , because the other two most regulated markets, japan and the Us, will also lag behind the European Union.  Then we also introduced a new monitoring system to assess engine performance in real life, which will therefore close the gap between laboratory engine testing and real-world emissions, and we have also included – this is a technical thing, but we understand each other – thanks also to the interinstitutional agreement on better regulation, a substantial number of delegated acts. That is why, for this reason too, I believe that Parliament's role will be strengthened, another point that I am in favour of.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am sincerely honoured to have the opportunity today to present my report, on social inclusion and the integration of refugees into the labour market, in this House. This is clearly a very serious issue, which is one of the most complex challenges to which we are called upon to respond.  I will not conceal from you that I have approached the drafting of the document with some apprehension, fully aware of the complexity and importance of the subject. That is why I would like to begin my presentation by extending my sincere thanks to my fellow shadow rapporteurs for their extraordinary contribution to the drafting of the text, especially for their excellent cooperation throughout the parliamentary work. Only the ENF Group has been opposed to our work, the group of Marine Le Pen and Matteo Salvini, which, for a change, is not even present in this House now, when we talk about an issue such as refugees, which is often over-talked about on television.  As the European Parliament, we are called upon to present an analysis of the situation, policies and practices for integrating refugees into the labour market and into society. In drawing up the document, I based my reflection on some of the starting assumptions. For example, the fact that all humanitarian migrants are people forced to leave their country and are therefore an extremely vulnerable group. I have highlighted the current state of health of the European economy, which is still trying to emerge from a serious and protracted period of crisis, with record levels of unemployment, particularly among young people. I have pointed out that all too often the public and political debate on support measures to be given to refugees and asylum seekers is poisoned by false myths, prejudice and discrimination, various forms of populism and, at worst, racism.  Allow me to list a few key points in the report. Granting refugees access to the labour market is necessary to restore their human dignity and self-esteem, as well as being an effective measure in terms of public costs, as it allows them to be self-sufficient and achieve economic independence. Intervening with social and work inclusion policies in a timely manner is essential to enable these policies to succeed. In addition, labour market conditions in host countries are a key factor in the success and sustainability of refugee integration. The Commission and the Member States must therefore continue to give priority to policies and investments aimed at creating jobs and generating economic growth.  Integration and inclusion measures in favour of refugees and asylum seekers cannot and must not take away financial resources already allocated to programmes for other disadvantaged groups, but instead require additional social investment: it would be a serious political mistake and would create competition between the weakest, which would only lead to further social injustice. It is therefore necessary to bring the European Social Fund back to 25% of the cohesion policy budget; the reception conditions directive must be amended, allowing applicants for international protection access to the labour market within six months of the date of submission of the asylum application; we need to increase the public investment available and provide additional financial resources for local, regional public administrations and civil society and voluntary organisations. It is these who are at the forefront of the reception of refugees in our society and therefore deserve adequate support as well as greater recognition in policy-making.  Therefore, I hope that the House will be able to support the report voted on in the Committee on Employment, which I believe can be a useful document in identifying the social and employment integration of refugees as a challenge, but also an opportunity for our society, our economy and our European Union.

Education is the key to both economic and social inclusion of refugees and asylum seekers, in particular young people, and that is why the Committee on Culture has put forward the notion of education corridors, and why it calls for further supporting the cooperation between EU universities and universities in places of conflict to ensure that children and young people who have to flee their country can pursue their education , which is a human right. It is not only important for welcoming countries, who will benefit from the economic contribution of educated newcomers, but it is also a moral and human duty for European societies to guarantee that these young people have the opportunity of a brighter future. I also want to highlight the role of informal learning, including lifelong learning, sport, volunteering, culture and the arts, which – by providing spaces for intercultural dialogue and exchange – not only facilitate the social inclusion of refugees into their new communities, but also address stereotypes, prejudices and discrimination by the majority. Too often, the dominant narrative says that somebody else is always to blame for the world’s problems. This results in a culture of fear.

Many of these recommendations have already been taken into account, which proves that we share the same concerns and that we are on the right track. Two weeks ago we organised a thematic event on measures to support the integration of asylum seekers and refugees in Brussels. The rapporteur was also present there. I think we all share the view that, not only do we have a moral duty as a society to welcome these people who are fleeing wars or other situations of extreme pressure in their countries, but also, from an economic point of view, the cost of non-integration would be much higher than the investments in integration. It is clear that the ongoing refugee crisis has put the European Union and its Member States to a test. Beyond meeting the immediate needs of refugees, it is essential to promote their integration in the host society and in the labour market. We know that the integration challenge comes at a point when Europe is recovering from a prolonged crisis with the impact still being felt on large parts of our societies. Mainstreaming the integration of refugees should be an integral part of our efforts for better coordinated and more inclusive social education, labour market and health policies in the European Union. It is about offering meaningful opportunities for all to participate in society and in the economy so it is not about taking from Peter to pay Paul. While integration is of course a Member State’s competence, the European Union has an important role to play in providing support to them. We promote the exchange of good practices to ensure early integration and facilitate the better use of available European funding. I am pleased to note that many of the points stressed in your report were also reflected in the Action Plan on Integration of Third-Country Nationals, adopted on 7 June, as you know. I refer in particular to the notion of a multidimensional and two-way approach to integration. I also welcome the focus on early and effective access to the labour market, vocational and language training, education, and basic services such as, for instance, healthcare and housing. Early integration into vocational training can provide third—country nationals with the basis for successful integration into the labour market and progression towards a high level of qualification. Refugees come with a diversity of skills and they can contribute to our economies. I welcome that your report highlights the need for better assessment of formal and informal skills and recognition of third—country qualifications. This step is important to releasing and employing the potential of third-country nationals. As I presented to you on 7 June, the Commission has put forward the New Skills Agenda for Europe and this Skills Agenda has specific provisions to address this challenge. In particular, in the context of the Skills Agenda, we have proposed the following specific elements: improving transparency of third-country qualifications through the division of the European Qualifications Framework; supporting frontline services and identifying and documenting the skills and qualifications of refugees through the launch of the skills profile tool for third—country nationals; promoting the upskilling of low skilled third—country nationals to the proposal for a Council recommendation establishing a skills guarantee; and assuring that better information about qualification recognition practices in different countries is collected through the new Europass framework. Furthermore, let me mention the Blue Card Directive, which aims to attract highly skilled third—country nationals to the European Union to work. In the revision of the directive the Commission has also proposed to open it to highly skilled beneficiaries of international protection. I know that the Parliament had been advocating in favour of such a measure. As I mentioned earlier, the Commission has a key role to play in facilitating the use of available EU funding. I welcome that your report acknowledges the Commission’s efforts to simplify and increase synergies among the available funding instruments. Furthermore, I take note of the fact that your report advocates for introducing a minimum share of 25% of the cohesion policy budget for the European Social Fund in the revision of the MFF in order to ensure adequate resources for labour market integration. However, this cannot be taken on board at this stage as it will necessitate a revision of the cohesion policy legislative package. As regards the ESF and field resources, we consider that relevant programmes are broad enough to accommodate the needs of refugees, but we stand ready to swiftly process reprogramming requests should these be made by the Member States. I welcome that your report also stresses the importance of better analysis and enhanced knowledge in the realm of integration. For this reason, over the past months the Commission has reached out to its networks of experts and stakeholders, Eurostat and partner organisations. We exchanged views on the collecting of data, on the outcomes of third—country nationals and how to map the implementation of the relevant policies across Member States. We also organised peer-learning events and activities involving different stakeholders such as the ESF managing authorities, the public employment schemes, network and civil society, to see various perspectives. In its action plan the Commission announced that it will reinforce exchange of practices notably to a revamped European integration network. The European website on integration is already a Europe—wide platform for networking on integration, supporting exchanges about policies and practices, but to facilitate mutual learning in tackling the challenges of the refugee crisis we have also developed an online database of promising practices, especially for the integration of asylum seekers and refugees. To conclude, investing in integration policies today will contribute to a more prosperous, cohesive and inclusive society in Europe in the long run, and I am pleased to see this view is reflected in your report, as well as in the recent Commission initiative.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 1, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 38, "date": "2016-07-04.json", "name": "Thomas MANN", "mepid": "1922", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Mr President, I would like to thank the It was a hard piece of work to create 36 compromises out of 377 amendments.

The hearing that we had – well staffed – was worthwhile and the months of intensive negotiations paid off. We want today's refugees and asylum seekers not to become the long-term unemployed of tomorrow. We want early intervention to prevent social isolation. This requires that the skills and knowledge acquired at home be reviewed and improved. In many EU Member States, we already have exemplary performance through small and medium-sized enterprises that offer traineeships. Learning the language in the host country plays a key role in finding your way around everyday life and in the world of work. This also avoids exclusion, ghettoisation and parallel societies. It is up to the Member States themselves to decide how the courses are designed, whether mandatory as in Germany, or voluntarily. We have agreed to reject the establishment of special labour markets for refugees. However, the national minimum wages must also apply to them and must not be stopped. Instead of setting up a new fund, we already have the AMIF, the EUR 3 billion fund for asylum, migration and integration. The use of the European Social Fund is controversial. I know that the current budgetary rules do not make it possible to increase from 22 to 25 per cent. Nevertheless, I am in favour of sending out a signal, if not immediately, then as soon as possible. How long will it take for refugees to have access to the labour market? In some Member States the waiting period is three months, in others six, in others nine. So there is a highly sensitive issue on the agenda and we cannot have a one-size-fits-all solution. That is why respect for the principle of subsidiarity is particularly important.

Unfortunately, the report is in favour of an approach that is not sufficiently balanced.  Let me first of all stress that integration must be a story of rights and obligations. After all, governments need to invest heavily in the integration of refugees, so it is only natural that they should expect commitment to this. Only when both parties take their responsibility can integration succeed.  Secondly, and subsequently, I defend the principle that social rights must be built up. We must dare to think about this if we are to guarantee the sustainability of our social security. Credulity would allow us to bring down social protection in Europe.

There is no place for petty political arrangements or a populist agenda when it comes to refugees and their integration into our society. Not prioritising today would meet not only indifference but also irresponsibility for our society in the future.  We should not spare any efforts to ensure a proper social, cultural, linguistic and economic integration of refugees, and we have many reasons to do so. The first should be an understanding of the phenomenon, keeping in mind that we Europeans are what we are today as a result of different waves of mass migration. The second one should be humanity. No one under any circumstances wants to live in war. No one wants to leave their homes, families and countries and undertake an exhausting and dangerous journey if they can choose otherwise. It is an act of pure despair and we Europeans should stand by our values of humanity and tolerance.

It was a key point when we were renegotiating the Qualifications Directive two or three years ago, and of course the possibilities in that regard in the Receptions Directive. We have a wealth of experience in Member States dating from the Equal Programme and, indeed, beyond that. And for those who talked about integration being a two-way process: that is true. One of the conclusions from the Equal Programme was that integration starts on the day of arrival for asylum seekers, and the day before arrival for receiving countries. It is important, as others have said, for local and regional government and other institutions to have additional resources – additional, not replacing existing training for host communities, but in order to take account of the special needs of those arriving. That investment in people is crucial, and it certainly repays in many ways. Language acquisition and access to education are crucial and we know this can be a real challenge for teenagers and adults who may have had disrupted, or no, access to education.

Madam President, another report of ideas and ideas is coming up for debate in the European Parliament. Without yet specifying how many refugees and how many illegal immigrants there are and having left thousands stranded in Greece and Italy, with the closure of borders, you are incentivising Europe to flood even more migrants. Is someone so naïve as to believe that these people can join European society? Do you want to integrate them into the labour market when unemployment in Europe and especially in the countries of the South is galloping? Have you asked European citizens if they want them? It's a nice tale, but it's got a lot of dragons.  Those who have blooded Belgium, France and sown fear at airports, the metro and even sporting events and jobs have had their European education provided. But you have not been able to integrate them, because there is one factor that you refuse to admit: the religious hatred they have against us, because of religion and because of culture, and that prompts them to exterminate those they consider unfaithful.  Stop wars and interventions in third countries and seek to live in peace in their countries. Strengthen the institution of the traditional family in Europe in order to increase the workforce and, finally, let European citizens decide, not capitalists and appointed technocrats.

Madam President, it has so far been shown that the operation to integrate refugees and migrants has led to even higher unemployment, lower wages and the dissolution of the social state. When, last year, Germany's Committee of Wise Men proposed to set up hunger wages, supposedly to better integrate refugees and migrants entering Germany en masse, it aimed to chineseize wages in the European Union. As long as the countries of the European South are plagued by poverty and unemployment, refugees and migrants cannot enter the labour market.  That is why I have called for the distribution of refugees between Member States to calculate, in addition to GDP and population, both the rate of growth of the economy and the level of unemployment. Also, real integration means accepting and respecting the constitutional framework and laws of the host State and abandoning various antiquated social practices and perceptions.

Your rapporteur, Mr Benifei, has completed a very comprehensive and in-depth report, and I would once again like to thank him sincerely for that. Several of you have said it: there are more people on the run than ever before. These are people who seek protection from us, who see a beacon of hope in the European Union and who hope and count on our solidarity.  We have a legal and ethical duty to give that protection to those who are entitled to international protection, and I am personally convinced that it is best for everyone to integrate the people who receive protection as quickly and as well as it can, both in our society and in our labour market.  We all know that's not an easy task for anyone. The efforts must come from two sides. We live in a society of rights and obligations. That's the way our society works. But having said that, we also know that refugees are a group of very vulnerable people. If we look at their situation, of course they have traumas that some people have already spoken about, but we also know that they have qualifications that have been acquired elsewhere, qualifications that have been acquired elsewhere. It is often very difficult to compare their skills, if they are already documented, with what is needed in our labour market. They are often also low-skilled. We must give them the opportunity to learn and to develop basic skills. We try to do this with a number of elements of our skills agenda. We must give these people the opportunity to learn languages, which we have also included in our action programme for the integration of migrants. There are already a number of budgets in there that will be spent to give those people the opportunity to learn the language of the host country. I do not think we should deny that there is still pure discrimination in our society, including in our labour market. We must also oppose this, and we must also do something about it.  What are we doing from Europe? This semester we are looking at, among other things, the situation of migrants in the labour market. A number of Member States have received specific recommendations because they could perform better in terms of integrating people from migrant backgrounds, sometimes even the second or third generation. And that is also the case for countries other than those that have received specific recommendations. Furthermore, we are using everything we have at our disposal, because some of you have rightly said that it is primarily a task of the Member States. But we in Europe can help the Member States in this difficult task. We do that with everything we have at our disposal. We do this with our action programme for the integration of people from third countries. We do this with our skills agenda which contains a number of specific elements to increase the chances of integrating refugees. We do the same with our approach to the blue card.  We also use our funds: the European Social Fund and the FEAT are funds that can also be used for the integration of refugees and are used for this purpose. We exchange best practices and we ensure that there can be capacity expansion in the Member States. Because in this area too, our countries can learn from each other. We also use, once again, the instruments we have at our disposal during the semester. I was already referring to the country specific recommendations. However, I would also like to point out that the additional expenditure associated with this refugee crisis in the evaluation of the budgetary situation of the Member States is also effectively recognised as extraordinary and that these expenditures are not taken into account to see whether Member States are covered by an excessive deficit procedure. Dear Members of Parliament, integration of newcomers is not an easy task, not for the people who have fled the horror in their own country and who need to build a new community in a new Member State. Nor is it always easy for the people in the host Member State. But one thing is certain. We all have an interest in taking care of the people who come to us as well as possible and integrating them as well as possible into our society and in our labour market. And if we succeed, we can all benefit from it: economically, but the cohesion of our society can only benefit from that.  I would like to repeat the words of one of the Members who said earlier: 'It cannot be the intention to make it all the long-term unemployed.' I think that's something we don't want. So we have to go for the opposite and I am very grateful for all these recommendations and for the things we share to give those people the opportunity so quickly. possibly become integrated.", "language": "en", "original_language": "nl", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 82, "date": "2016-07-04.json", "name": "Ildikó GÁLL-PELCZ", "mepid": "102886", "text": "   I would like to inform my fellow Members that Members who were unable to speak in the debate because this was not possible – we all know that a written statement of up to 200 words per session can be submitted, which will be attached to the literal minutes of the debate and constituted a speech.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hu", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 83, "date": "2016-07-04.json", "name": "Brando BENIFEI", "mepid": "124867", "text": "  Rapporteur. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank all my fellow Members for this in-depth debate and also Commissioner Thyssen for her participation and for the important words that have been spoken. On the one hand, it is clear that this is a very complex issue; there is a need to take a balanced approach, as we have said, we need to make choices in the direction of integration, which is integration not to the detriment of the inhabitants of the receiving countries, against social dumping, for truly real integration into the world of work and into the refugee society.  Thank you for the joint work and thanks to the Commission, as I said, for the clear words, I also respect, it is true, the clear progress that we see in the proposals of the Action Plan for third-country nationals, in the news skills agenda, indications and proposals that go in the direction of what the report calls for. So let us continue to work in this direction, with constructive work, as this debate in Parliament has been constructive, in order to find balanced solutions for everyone: for refugees and for citizens who have legitimate concerns and fears but who must be reassured in the Union's desire to build integration solutions that are useful for all, so that, as I said in my speech, we can , refugees, whose acceptance is our humanitarian duty, find their dignity and find meaning for a life that is often traumatised precisely in integration into our society.

Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the Commissioner for her excellent work and for the work she has done. The Youth Guarantee and the Youth Employment Initiative are essential instruments for combating youth unemployment. We have initiated a lot to put an end to this misery, but the effect is still modest. I am convinced that more is urgently needed. Allow me, however, to comment on yesterday's interview. The German Finance Minister, Mr Schäuble, yesterday strongly criticised the Commission. If it is unable to solve problems quickly, national governments would have to take it into their own hands – without Brussels. The press has also interpreted this criticism to the Commission's work on youth unemployment. I am really the last person to make a saving by criticising the Commission. But it is not only on this issue that Europe's chief thrift apostle should take a look at his own. Those who are unwilling to give up the austerity in Europe that has driven some Member States into a situation where their budgets are barely able to act, should better refrain from bouty Brussels bashing. It is true that the elimination of youth unemployment is primarily a matter for the Member States, including those with lower youth unemployment. Schäuble is now proposing a European training network. The idea is not entirely new. Nevertheless, Commissioner Thyssen, the Commission should take him at his word, but also talk to him about a training fund in which the rich Member States in particular participate. He is meeting with initiatives that we have already discussed in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and which I personally started in Thuringia and Bavaria. What is clear is that EU levels can initiate, support and coordinate financially. However, the Member States must implement it. There is obviously a lack of that. It should be noted that the Member States launched a Youth Guarantee as early as April 2013: all young people should receive a high-quality job, training, further education or training within four months of leaving the school.  be offered an internship. The Youth Employment Initiative aims to support young people under the age of 30 in regions with particularly high levels of youth unemployment. In order to achieve greater impact, the financial resources have already been made available in the first two years of the medium-term financial framework. Substantial pre-financing was made available to Member States, which was increased to 30% in 2015. But paper is obviously patient. Youth unemployment is still unacceptably high. Something has happened, but too little and too slowly, and the regional differences are glaring. Opinions and reports from the European Court of Auditors, the Council of EU Labour and Social Ministers and the Member States are now available. We now need clear facts and foundations for the future path and for the revision of the Multiannual Financial Framework. Can the Commission inform Parliament of the main results of the evaluations? Is the implementation of the Youth Guarantee Programmes correct? What is the quality of the offers and the sustainability of the results? Are the programmes and the use of funds on the right track? Has the increased pre-financing accelerated the absorption? How can access to funding from the Youth Employment Initiative and the ESF be accelerated and simplified? Does the Commission believe that further investment in the Youth Guarantee is needed and that the Youth Employment Initiative needs to be extended? I would like to reiterate here what I have said on several occasions: we are losing an entire generation, and an entire generation is losing faith in Europe. This is an existential question for the future of young people, but also for the future of the European Union. I don't think everyone has yet to see that.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "GUE/NGL", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Left-wing"}, {"id": 89, "date": "2016-07-04.json", "name": "Marianne THYSSEN", "mepid": "1832", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, Europe is on a path to recovery. We see that employment figures continue to rise and that unemployment is starting to drop. But, as we all know, the effects of the crisis are still being felt in many Member States and regions, and young people in particular have borne the worst of it. Fighting youth unemployment remains a top priority for the Commission. Therefore, I want to thank Thomas Händel and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs of this House for their question on the Youth Guarantee and Youth Employment Initiative. As you know, we have acted by adopting a solid policy framework on youth employment, the Youth Guarantee, and by dedicated funding to the Youth Employment Initiative for those young people not in employment, education or training. This funding comes in addition to substantial European Social Fund (ESF) intervention and on top of national funding, which is equally needed to fight youth unemployment. The Youth Guarantee is a driver for real reform. It is the central plank in our efforts to improve access pathways to the labour market and facilitate the transition from education to the job market, and it has already started to bring results. As regards the Commission’s findings on the Member States’ evaluations, it is important to stress that Youth Guarantee implementation has started in all Member States following the planning phase. In 2014 all the Member States presented their Youth Guarantee implementation plans, which identify precisely the measures to be taken to implement the Youth Guarantee. They outline the timeframe for youth employment reforms and measures, the roles of public authorities and other organisations and how the measures will be financed. The implementation of the national plans is now underway. Member States are making substantial efforts to implement the Youth Guarantee, which has proven to be a driver for structural reforms. The Joint Employment Reports for 2015 and 2016 list promising steps, with concrete examples in many countries. For example, Member States are strengthening their public employment services to improve the outreach to those furthest from the labour market. In addition, they are building closer partnerships with the private sector to increase the number and improve the quality of job offers, apprenticeships and traineeship opportunities. The Youth Guarantee has also accelerated progress on delivering the skills that employers are actually seeking. The substantial European financial support available underpins the successful implementation of the Youth Guarantee. Three years into its implementation, the Youth Employment Initiative, worth EUR 6.4 billion when including the ESF contribution, is proving to be a key lever for those Member States worst hit by youth unemployment. There is an indication that the Youth Employment Initiative and the ESF have an important influence on the design of youth employment policy in Member States. For instance, the Youth Employment Initiative and the ESF have supported a shift to demand-based delivery of active labour market policies for young people, with a much stronger focus on individualised assistance. Furthermore, the Commission urges Member States to continue paying special attention to the quality of offers delivered. Over the past three years, Member States have allocated Youth Employment Initiative resources to concrete measures such as traineeships and apprenticeships, first job experiences and support for youth entrepreneurship. As a result, more than 1.3 million young people in Europe have benefited from work and training opportunities. These are strong indications that the Youth Guarantee schemes are on track now, even if much still needs to be done. As regards uptake of the Youth Employment Initiative, the additional pre-financing swiftly decided on by the European co-legislators in 2015 concretely helped to increase the work opportunities for young people on the ground. It is therefore of the utmost importance to use the available European money swiftly. In this context the 2017 draft budget includes a technical adjustment of the cohesion policy national envelopes for 2017-2020 in line with Article 7 of the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) regulation. All Member States’ allocations under the investment for growth and jobs goal of cohesion policy for the years 2017-2020 were reviewed and compared to the actual evolution of GDP. The effect of the adjustment is an increase of EUR 4.6 billion, at current prices, in the 2017-2020 ceiling for commitments under economic, social and territorial cohesion – Heading 1b – and concerns Member States particularly affected by the economic slowdown of the past few years. We urge these Member States to use the additional funds for stimulating youth employment as well as for the integration of refugees and promoting investment. I believe that all Member States have to pursue the Youth Guarantee including by directing the necessary national resources to those dedicated actions. As regards a possible extension of the Youth Employment Initiative, the upcoming report on progress with the implementation of the Youth Guarantee and the Youth Employment Initiative and the midterm review of the MFF will provide the opportunity to consider how further to provide financial support for youth employment. Addressing youth unemployment and embarking on reforms in line with the Youth Guarantee remain a key political priority of the European Union. That is what our social market economy is about. As I have said many times before, it is the Commission’s firm intention to steer the European Union more strongly towards social fairness. This means that no one should be left behind, in particular our youth. Europe cannot afford to let the human resources that our young people represent go to waste. Therefore, together with Member States, we should continue our efforts for the implementation of the Youth Guarantee and provide the appropriate financial support.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 90, "date": "2016-07-04.json", "name": "Elisabeth MORIN-CHARTIER", "mepid": "38596", "text": "  on behalf of the EPP group.

We had sounded the general mobilization of all European states, through the arrowing of the European Social Fund, on youth unemployment: through the youth guarantee, on the one hand, through the youth employment initiative, on the other. These two levers are absolutely essential to succeed in the fight against unemployment and we have deployed all the energy possible, at the level of the European Parliament, to make frontloading, that is to say to load the available funds so that we can start action very quickly; last year, we spent the pre-financing of youth employment initiative projects by 1-30%, even breaking Europe's efficiency records on that day. Being effective is what we are all looking for together. And so, to be effective, we must first measure the effects. This is what we are asking the Commission: what are the effects of the funds and policies we have arrowed into the European Social Fund? The second point: if we want to measure, it is to adjust these policies. In particular, Commissioner, I am asking myself the question of the 25-30 age group. What happened to these young people?

I would like to use my time to express one concept: the Youth Guarantee and the Youth Employment Initiative are essential instruments in the fight against youth unemployment. It is precisely for this reason that we have been promoting this parliamentary initiative, calling for detailed information and a continuous commitment, not just a political one, to carry out two potential programmes.  This situation is confirmed as an emergency but the emergency logic in the management of the problem must be overcome today. The European Parliament is well aware of this, as are the organisations operating on the ground, on a daily basis, including the European Youth Forum, Age Platform, Coface, the European Disability Forum, ISPD, Eurocities, the European Trade Union Confederation. It is precisely these that I have listed that have published a joint declaration this morning on the Youth Guarantee, calling for the immediate extension of the Youth Employment Initiative, continued financial commitment and the development of new methods to improve access for all operators to the funds available. A decisive step forward is called for in verifying that the offers are of quality, the only real path to ensure its long-term sustainability, together with a reduction in the bureaucratic burden for the participating companies.  It is regrettable to read in the preparatory documents for the 2017 budget that the Commission does not plan to include new appropriations for the Youth Employment Initiative for the coming years because of front-loading, but I believe that the mid-term evaluation of the Youth Guarantee, together with what the Commissioner has also said today, will demonstrate that this instrument is essential for making the programmes work.  The European Parliament intends to keep the fight against youth unemployment as a top priority. We will enter shortly, as has already been said in the discussions on the multiannual financial framework, and I am sure that we will be able to do a good job together.

No, we must look at the causes! The causes are a false exchange rate within the European Monetary Union. That is the reason.

A guarantee is a very strong word. It means we provide a definite assurance, we promise, we pledge to young people that they will receive a quality offer of employment, a traineeship, an apprenticeship, further education within four months of becoming unemployed or of finishing education. When we make that pledge, we must deliver. In order to do that we must have evidence-based policymaking. It is certainly about adequate resources, but equally it is about effective spending. That is why we posed this question to the Commission today. The only information we have to date are the three comments from the Court of Auditors. They talk about having concerns about adequacy of funding, the definition of a good quality offer and how the Commission monitors and reports on the results of the scheme. I listened to the Commissioner here today and perhaps the information is not yet available. Yes, I hear positive comments but, as to the specific question, I am not a lot wiser. One of the questions asked was how we streamline access to the Youth Guarantee, and access is crucial. In this context, I made a complaint to the Commission that young people with disabilities in Ireland are not able to access the Youth Guarantee. I received a reply from the Commission saying that they are satisfied with the Irish Government’s response, which said there were alternative back-to-work supports for young people with disabilities. But the very point of the Youth Guarantee is that it is a guarantee for all young people and there must be no exceptions. In Ireland young people with disabilities are on disability allowance and not on jobseekers’ allowance and so cannot access the Youth Guarantee. We need to streamline our system to ensure that this discrimination is stopped immediately, and we need the support of the Commission in doing this.

Unfortunately, this is not the way. This is not the way to go because we know full well that, in view of the economic commitment allocated to this conflict measure, the results are extremely disappointing. I bring the experience of my country that has completely failed this implementation. We come from the same country, Mr Benifei, but we probably talk to different people.

So I have a number of questions, Commissioner. Firstly, what is the European Commission doing to simplify and make funding for youth employment accessible to as many people as possible? In France, due to the complexity of the procedures, the youth employment initiative often benefits the same structures without hitting new targets. Second, if the youth employment initiative is extended after 2017, how can we benefit those who are in the blind spot of our public policy? I am thinking, in particular, of young people from rural areas and the least qualified young people. Thirdly, despite the Erasmus programme, there are still few young apprentices crossing borders and I would say that cross-border apprenticeship projects, such as those we have in the Upper Rhine, are too rare.

Therefore, I truly believe that we have to do more to improve the exchange of best practices between the Member States of the Union in order to give the young people of Europe the opportunity to be part of the best programmes which exist in Europe, be it in their Member State or in another Member State. Therefore, also the question: what is the Commission doing in order to improve the exchange of best practices amongst the Member States of the Union? Secondly, we of course have to make sure that this programme generates stable and well-paid jobs. That is why we should in our evaluation go beyond just the quantitative evaluation of these projects –how many jobs were created – but really make sure that these jobs are stable and well paid.

The EU, as the Commissioner has just said, is slowly emerging from the crisis, but Brexit is creating new uncertainty about our economic prospects.

Madam President, the dysfunction in the implementation of the Youth Guarantee and Youth Employment Initiative programmes guarantees that these programmes will fail. This development is unfortunately inevitable, because at a time when youth unemployment is galloping in Europe and in Greece it has reached an unacceptable level of 67%, the leading circles of the European Union are not interested in giving decent work to the young people of Europe, so that they can make the most of their great qualifications and develop. They are interested in absorbing talented young people from third countries into the European labour market, as Mr Juncker said.  In other words, they are interested in securing cheap labour and to do so, they are destroying education in all countries, so that europe's young people are not educated and demand that their employers get a decent wage.

In the past year – I count from The Month of May this year compared to The Month of May of last year – there have been 503 000 fewer young people out of work. That is the lowest unemployment rate for young people since March 2009. That is why I believe that something positive can be said. But does that mean that I'm satisfied, that I think we're there and that everything goes perfectly? Far from it! Because if we look at the rate of youth unemployment today, we see that this is still 18.6%, although two full percentage points better than last year, but 18.6% of young unemployed, with 4 197 000 young people looking for work behind it. That is 4 197 000 too many, so we must continue our policy. What I am not very positive about is the fact that the budgets we have with our funds are being taken up slowly. Absorption is slow. There are all sorts of reasons for this that we hear from the Member States. They were still running the previous programs, the capacity was lacking. We have increased pre-financing, which has helped something. In the end, however, the uptake of the amounts was too slow. We're not really happy about that.  But what does that mean? That we need to continue to work on all fronts that can create more jobs for young people, and that includes macroeconomic policies to ensure that there is more growth and jobs. In this context, we have launched our European Investment Fund, and this is also proving to be paying off. Because investments have already been agreed for more than EUR 100 billion, and that is something. Having the right macroeconomic policies is one thing, but we also need to continue to work on social policy. That is a second priority. We continue to do this by passing on the youth guarantee. It is about structural reforms that are needed to get the young people involved, to have them registered, to be able to deal with them and to make them an offer that helps them get back on the path that can lead to a job. We need to evaluate that now. The Youth Guarantee and the Youth Employment Initiative, the special fund to evaluate the youth guarantee. We are not too late for that. Some of you suggest, \"Why too late? I'd like an answer.\" That evaluation will come on time! Member States were asked to provide us with the data by the end of May at the latest. That data has been more or less collected or it is on its way. They must now be processed and a report will be drawn up on that basis and we will be able to present that report to you in the course of autumn. If you invite me to do so, I will be happy to come here and explain it. That report should give us the right basis to see how we go. If we continue with the same thing, something needs to be changed, under what conditions can we do that: that has to be agreed.  An important question will also be: do we want to once again devote specific funds to supporting the Youth Guarantee, to combating youth unemployment? That is where, of course, we have to take into account the MFK, the multianne financial framework, and we cannot simply take the money out of the air. You know that the money comes from the Member States.  What we have already done in the technical adjustment, and with it, we know that we are coming to a budget of EUR 4.6 billion, which will ultimately have to be divided on several issues, but one of the priorities that the Commission will propose is that this amount be spent on combating youth unemployment. For the rest, we will have to wait until we have produced that report and, as I said, I am happy to come back to you for that.  But don't say, even outside this Chamber, that the Commissioner was so happy, because there is still 18% youth unemployment. I'm happy we're moving forward. We are seeing progress from month to month and we are talking about large numbers of young people who end up in the labour market and find a job. Let us be satisfied with that for five minutes. But being satisfied doesn't mean that we're sitting with our hands in our laps, that we think we've achieved our goal. I've called you the numbers, far from it.

However, it is difficult to assess whether the improvement is linked to the Youth Guarantee and the Youth Employment Initiative, or whether it stems from other circumstances. For example, the EU Court of Auditors' special report on youth employment measures estimates that the use of funds was not sufficiently focused on results. These two mechanisms were proposed at a time when the youth unemployment rate in the EU was extremely high and there was no indication that it was going to start to fall. As rapporteur for the EES Group for Legislative Opinion, I participated in last year's increase in pre-financing under the Yei Initiative.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, the energy label is a successful European story, which began more than twenty years ago and has been copied by everyone in the world. It is the passport recognized by all, which guarantees many products that are on the market and that enter the homes of 500 million citizens, to inform about the performance related to energy efficiency and other fundamental characteristics. Together with ecodesign, the energy label has allowed European citizens in a few years to be able to buy washing machines, refrigerators, ovens, light bulbs and boilers that are increasingly efficient over time, thus saving huge amounts of energy, harmful emissions and money, thus reducing diseases, environmental damage and, no less importantly, partially reducing the political dependence of our continent.  For some years now, however, the label's information capacity has lost its efficiency, it has to be said. Consumers are confused by too many different scales. The advent of classes with so-called \"+\" has made the difference between the steps less clear and therefore between products, in terms of energy consumption, price and more. So, quite rightly, the time has come to renew this passport, making it more effective, taking advantage of the advances in information technology, which are fundamental to representing and communicating the current and future market. In drawing up the draft report that I had the honour of conducting, I took on board the objectives of the original proposal with the aim of putting the '+' in order as soon as possible, digitising information and strengthening market surveillance. In recent months I have heard the voices of consumers, industries, small and medium-sized enterprises, supervisory authorities, shopkeepers, standardisation authorities, non-governmental organisations and citizens registered with various political actors. I have proposed a deliberately broad and complex report, with the aim of decisively strengthening the confidence of European citizens following the scandals in the automotive sector, which threaten, let us remember, the credibility of all our regulatory efforts.  I hope I have contributed to the proposal for a modern label, let us call it 2.0, in step with the times, capable of being not only a sticker, but also a gateway to a product database, which can be used by everyone, with more information, comparable and finally described in their own language. The negotiating work has made it possible to arrive at a vote in committee with a solid text, which I believe is shared and balanced, which was then unanimously approved in the ITRE Committee and which will, I hope, arrive in this House on Wednesday for confirmation with the same enthusiasm.  Among the various improvements found in the text, I would like to highlight, in particular, Parliament's desire to strengthen the mechanism for setting the standards underlying the allocation of efficiency classes; more transparency and more control and full consideration of the conditions of real use of the products; tests and inspections should be more frequent and information on the results shared with all European supervisors. We have agreed to set up a database divided into two sections, one public and one with access reserved for the competent authorities; a database that will enter into force as soon as possible and will also be accessible through a quercode present on the label and that will allow to evaluate and compare the data and characteristics entered by the manufacturers. We have identified an automatic mechanism to eliminate the \"+\" from the labels and therefore the A+, A++, A+++ classes in a certain and short time, with one exception represented by the group of boilers that, due to their peculiar characteristics and market dynamics, need a wider time.  We have also identified a general rule for so-called 'heating' according to the employment of the upper classes. A reassignment mechanism will be triggered...

One of the underpinning principles of the European Union is to empower consumers and citizens and allow them to drive the clean energy transition that Europe needs. It was in that spirit that, in July 2015, the Commission made a proposal to update the legal framework for the energy-efficiency labelling of products, and since its introduction 20 years ago, energy labelling has ensured that consumers are able to make more informed choices that will help them to save energy and money. More than 85% of us actually check the energy label before buying a new fridge or a new washing machine. Per year, energy-labelling and eco-design policies taken together represent a savings potential for consumers of up to EUR 465 million and can bring around EUR 55 billion in extra revenue for business, which goes to show that this is as much about energy security as it is about sustainability or competitiveness. The good news is that the labelling has accelerated the development of ever-more efficient products, and that should be applauded. Ironically, it also means that the label has increasingly become a victim of its own success. Today’s energy labelling needs updating: many models are in the highest classes and thereby no longer provide differentiation for consumers. As the rapporteur said, with the addition of A+, A++ and A+++ classes, the label scale became less efficient in persuading consumers to buy more efficient products. So these pluses have actually become minuses for consumers. Following extensive consultation, and responding to consumer requests, the Commission therefore proposed returning to the original A-to-G energy label scale and periodically rescaling it. Ultimately, this is about providing clear information for consumers to ensure that they are equipped to make the most informed and efficient choices. Today, consumers want to know about the energy efficiency of appliances as much as they want to know about the calories in food, and we need to make it as simple as that. That is why we very much welcome the support of the rapporteur and the European Parliament, which has allowed us to make significant progress on this important proposal.  There are lots of interesting ideas in the report, including on rescaling. However, there are two changes suggested in the report that I must flag because, in our view, they are likely to undermine the success of the planned product database and we must make sure that we know the impact of these changes. The provision to allow manufacturers to keep compliance information on their own service, while being centrally accessible for market surveillance authorities, will be technically very challenging and costly and we have profound concerns over its workability. The report also suggests giving less time to the Commission to establish the database: one year instead of two. This timing is not realistic. Rushing the establishment of the database could lead to a bad-quality database and we do not want that. The deadline could also turn out to be one that we cannot meet, and that should be avoided. So I look forward to working with this House and with the Council to ensure that rescaling and the product database can be implemented in practice without a high administrative burden. Ultimately, the new label has to work for consumers. They are the ones who drive the change in the way we consume energy and we must give them the tools to do so.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Liberals and centrists"}, {"id": 136, "date": "2016-07-04.json", "name": "Herbert REUL", "mepid": "28225", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report and for the way in which she has been rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has First of all a thank you for the good cooperation, it was damn exhausting. Secondly, the label is a success story – as all colleagues have said. After a long period of work, we have reached a compromise. I would like to say now that if this compromise is changed very much by means of votes on Wednesday, then we will no longer be able to support this compromise, then it will no longer be ours. So I think we should consider whether we are going to revisit the matter with amendments at all, or whether we are not leaving what we have achieved in committee, with advantages and disadvantages, simply now. I also have some major concerns, and I will also raise them. There are two big ones. The first of our group goes against the database. It is difficult to understand, at a time when everyone is supposed to focus on the big things and the governments of the Member States, in cooperation on really central issues, refuse to set up central European databases here. I don't understand that at the back and in the front. This audit report, which is to enter these databases, is approximately the size of a file folder. A normal manufacturer has 25 000 products on the market, so it has to add a quantity of 25 000 file folders to online databases. It's not particularly funny. The costs will also be higher. The Commission says EUR 1.5 million, and we expect that there will be much more – from people who need to work on it. And the question of whether the purpose is given is also questionable, because the market surveillance authorities have expressed no interest at all and do not want it at all. Then there is data protection, because in the end everyone knows that we have very careful, sensitive data here that does not have to be accessible to others.

Mr President, I would like to thank the I would also like to begin by thanking the rapporteur and my fellow Members – as Mr Roll has just mentioned – for the really good, hard cooperation. Energy efficiency is a key building block of the Energy Union, because by further increasing the efficient use of energy, we can conserve and save resources. Here I think there is also great potential that can help us to achieve our common goals for climate protection. In addition, the most efficient use of energy also strengthens our independence from third countries and, above all, protects the wallets of everyone, consumers and entrepreneurs. The energy label is a success. The designation of energy efficiency classes has now also made it possible for consumers to compare products and, above all, to make an informed purchasing decision. This has contributed significantly to the fact that the products covered by the energy label have been continuously developed and are now significantly more efficient than before. A good energy efficiency class is a crucial buying argument, and it is therefore also in the interests of industry to use this as a competitive advantage. The success has resulted in many electrical appliances falling into the best energy efficiency class today and is actually the worst efficiency class for some A+ products. This confusion is leading to increasing confusion among consumers. It is really high time that we provided clarity when buying electrical appliances and that the label finally became consumer-friendly again. That is why I am also proud that together we have managed to find a really good, strong compromise on the essential points. Firstly, the return to a uniform efficiency class from A to G across all product groups will provide clarity and will once again help consumers to compare products at a glance and to be able to decide at once how efficient this is. Secondly, it is good that the most common household appliances should be labelled within 21 months and that other product groups, with the exception of recently scaled heaters, should be added within five years at the latest. Thirdly, by setting up a database with a closed platform for the competent authorities – and this is the difference between a publicly available information page for consumers – market surveillance in the Member States will be strengthened. And, as I have heard, this is also supported by the Member States. At one point or another, from our point of view, from a social democratic point of view, there are still a few points that we could well regulate in the best possible way: we believe that a central database is appropriate, and as Social Democrats we support the member states being able to incentivise low-income consumers. We have achieved a great deal with the compromises that have been reached.

We do have some reservations about the creation of a product database.

This database has the potential to be a useful market surveillance tool, but we do not want it to become too great a burden on industry. We are also satisfied that this report requires the Commission to consider a ten-year timescale when deciding on future energy labels. Rescaling labels will impose a cost on industry and it is right that both producers and consumers are provided with certainty over this time period.

We believe the existing directive is working well and would caution against some of the amendments made by other groups that would add much unnecessary prescription without benefiting consumers.

Firstly, it must ensure that the producer is encouraged to innovate and bring more energy-efficient appliances to market. Secondly, we want better, more efficient control of the market.

This reduces consumption and reduces energy bills. For me, it is also essential that we pursue these goals in a way that is as simple as possible for the consumer, the producer and the sellers. We have to take into account our small, local dealers and our SMEs. We must not impose unnecessary costs or burdens on them.

Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr President-in-Office of the Council. Tamburrano, for the very good work he has done. Our group, the GUE, has argued from the outset that it is important to ensure an energy labelling system that is understandable to consumers, but which also includes all the necessary information. We therefore welcome the proposals contained in the report to delete misleading symbols and move to a simpler, uniform labelling system from A to G. That is why we have tabled an amendment calling for this system to be applied immediately and to all products without exception.

The energy label is a success story – we have already heard it today: 85% of European consumers rely on this label when making purchase decisions, and it is also a driving force in the industry for innovative developments: EUR 450 million has been saved by the labels. However, in order to make it easier for consumers to compare products, there will only be a uniform A to G energy label in the future. The consumer should buy the most efficient product. This should lead to a reduction in energy consumption and energy costs. Particularly important: The actual power consumption should be indicated on the label, measured under real conditions and not under laboratory conditions. The rapporteur has also found a good middle ground for future rescaling: rescaling is automatically triggered when 25% of the products sold in a category fall into the top efficiency class A or 50% in classes A and B.

It is actually only creating an obligation on manufacturers and importers to register the product model by uploading information that is already required under the different existing delegated acts. The technical documentation will only be accessible to market surveillance authorities, so thereby the data security will be secured. The Commission already has experience with such databases, for instance in cosmetics. And regarding the costs, the actual costs could in fact be less than today because manufacturers no longer need to keep technical documentation available for market surveillance authorities for five years after the last product was manufactured. So hopefully this will be a useful tool for consumers, and not an extra burden. I agree that we need more, better and simpler standards for the whole of the internal market.

So I imagined that one day I myself could happen in an appliance store and maybe see our new label in operation and see some European citizens, as can australian citizens for many years, point with their mobile phone the QR code and compare, thanks to applications, more products, by virtue of the consumption characteristics and compare them not only on pre-established consumption patterns but also on patterns that are those of his own and his family and to be able to obtain from an app, imaginary for the moment but that will certainly come, information on the actual costs of consuming that device in monetary terms, related precisely to its actual consumption and therefore be able to choose the device that best meets the needs and that allows to recover investments in more efficient and more expensive devices , also knowing how long. This is one of the examples of the label that I imagined and that I hope to see as soon as possible in the real world and let us say that Europe needs a small success story at the moment because I hope that we will be able to move forward and move forward together.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 155, "date": "2016-07-04.json", "name": "Simona BONAFÈ", "mepid": "124814", "text": "  in writing.

It seems to me that the report makes a clear request to the Commission: effective and binding respect for human rights, defence and raising of social and environmental standards cannot be subordinated to trade competition and investment defence, nor entrusted to the ideology of deregulation as a driver of growth. All too often we have seen – and this is also the thrust of the report – a major discrepancy between the verbal affirmation of rights and their effective defence and application.  Let us therefore try to give concrete indications on how to relaunch, through trade policy, the commitment made by the Union to promote and protect human, social and environmental rights, together with democracy and the rule of law. We cannot continue as if nothing had happened. Brexit, as well as the growing distrust of the peoples of Europe towards this European Union, should have given a clear signal about the need for discontinuity. Discontinuity without which the European project itself is in danger of foundering. In my opinion, there is also a necessary discontinuity in trade policy, at a time when the negotiations, which could have enormous consequences for the lives of the women and men of Europe, negotiations such as TTIP and CETA, give rise to legitimate concerns, which are increasingly widespread in public opinion, also on the issues covered by this report: human rights, social and environmental standards. More generally, we could say, the relationship between trade development and democracy.  For this reason too, Madam Commissioner, I would like to make a parenthesis. We believe that it is deeply wrong, for example, not to involve the national parliaments in the ratification of CETA: we need more democracy and more participation and not less democracy and less participation. We know that the Eu ropean Union plays a crucial role in world trade: as the world's largest exporter of goods and services and the main source of foreign direct investment, the Union takes a leading position in the global market, both through its participation in the WTO and through its trade and investment agreements, which have helped to build an important part of that extremely complex and contradictory process that we call globalisation. Globalisation, which at the time of the crisis is having unequal effects both between and within countries, and the role that the European Union can play in this respect is central.  This Parliament has repeatedly expressed the need for trade policy not only to have the benefit of a few companies as an objective but to be an element of a strategy of international relations, aimed at promoting respect for human and social rights and environmental protection. In order to do this, and this is precisely the aim of this report, for the first time in the Committee on International Trade, a report has resulted from a reflection on the impact and follow-up of three reports previously adopted in 2010, while at the same time providing an assessment and guidance to the Commission in the implementation of our trade policy. It was a long process of discussion and mediation, a rigorous discussion with the other shadow rapporteurs, whom I would like to thank here, as well as the rapporteurs for ducks from the AFET, DEVE, FEMM and EMPL committees.  The report also provides guidance on a number of key issues which I would like to outline briefly here. Firstly, on the need for legislative coherence. The Union's trade policies must be developed in line with policies on social protection, development, human rights and the environment. We affirm the centrality of a gender reading of impact assessments and trade policy choices and it is from the perspective of gender mainstreaming, which we are also working on in the Committee on International Trade, that we want a policy that is finally gender sensitive and no longer gender blind.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 160, "date": "2016-07-04.json", "name": "Tiziana BEGHIN", "mepid": "124777", "text": "  Rapporteur. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, what is international trade? All too often, following the debates in this Parliament, I had the impression that it was an objective in itself, a goal. But colleagues, no! Trade is not the goal, it is just a means of achieving other goals. Trade is not the goal, but the race, the race for greater prosperity, equality and social progress for all. That is why the document we want to guide the European Union's trade policy begins with this idea and continues to lay down the conditions for the world's leading trading power to fulfil its role with responsibility, courage and care for its citizens and for all the citizens of the world. Trade is not the end, but it is the means. As rapporteur, I am very proud of this first message, but it is the content of the resolution that makes me truly proud. Of course, it is a compromise text, but the fact remains that, by a large majority in committee, we have approved a number of demands and priorities to make trade policy more transparent, accountable and effective. We have recognised the opportunities for trade and we have called for a trade policy that works for small and medium-sized enterprises, that creates opportunities for foreign markets for our farmers, for our service providers and, not least, for our industry, with agreements that bring tangible benefits for citizens, perhaps exploring new markets. I am thinking in particular of Australia and New Zealand, but also mercosur and Africa. We know that trade is not just an opportunity and it is not always a victory on all fronts. That is why we have called on the Commission and the Member States to implement support policies in favour of the so-called losers of globalisation, and I personally think that this is another opportunity for reflection on social policies that disconnect income from work, such as minimum income or citizenship. But prevention is better than cure. That is why the resolution clearly talks about the importance of accurate impact studies, both ex ante and ex post, and of reforming trade defence instruments, clearly opposing the granting of market economy status to China, but also talking about the defence of geographical indications and the fight against counterfeiting, in order to protect European excellence in the world.  I am also very proud of all the paragraphs that insist on our responsibility for fair trade, respectful of rights and oriented towards compliance with the Sustainable Development Goals. Now all the products we use every day, from cars to mobile phones, are the result of a production chain that crosses the whole world, with a small part of the value that is added in every country. With this document, the European Parliament is calling loudly for these global supply chains to be clean, sustainable and respectful; that there is a respect for due diligence, to know whether the good you buy is stained with blood or not, whether it was produced by forced child labour or by violating human rights. And we did not stop there, because we called for the sustainability of trade to also apply to the environment and animals, demanding greater control with regard to compliance with the rules for trade in protected species and farm animals.  In order to ensure that these commitments are kept by our partners, we are calling loudly for the new free trade treaties to contain binding chapters on sustainable development with clear sanction mechanisms for those who do not respect their commitments in terms of respect for rights and the environment and with investigations, which we want to be launched at the request of the European Parliament. Of course, the great opportunities for trade must be built on solid foundations, which are the protection of European consumers and environmental, health and social standards. This also passes as desired by the resolution through further reflections on those treaties and systems, such as the ISDS and ICS, which could make the interests of the powerful few prevail over those of many citizens.  Citizens must be able to assess freely and at all times whether they are properly protected. That is why we are calling on the Commission to step up its efforts for an increasingly transparent, comprehensible and citizen-viewable trade policy, without more documents and secret meetings. In addition, we also make a clear appeal to the Council to make parliament's consultation systematic in the preparation of negotiating mandates and to binding its opinion, and also to call for the publication of all approved mandates.  Finally, the new media have multiplied the possibilities for participation and citizens' control over the political life of the institutions. That is why I come from a movement that makes direct democracy its flag, I would like to end my speech with the hope that the Commission will be able to engage more and more exchanges and dialogues with citizens on trade policy and use the Internet and the new media to account more and more accurately for its commercial choices, thus making direct sure of the opinion of those who are the first stake-holders , that is, the citizens.  Who knows that one day even the negotiations for international treaties, instead of being carried out behind closed doors, will not be streamed and that trade policy will not become the first area of application of almost direct democracy. Given the time, maybe, this may seem like a dream but it's definitely a nice dream.

Sustainable development in trade policy is an area where Parliament and the Commission clearly share an interest and a strong engagement. The Commission’s new trade policy, the Trade for All strategy, has sustainable development at its core. It sets out an ambitious and comprehensive agenda for the EU, underlining the fact that trade is not only about economic growth but also about defending the values that we share in Europe: social justice, respect for human rights, and high labour and environmental standards. This strategy builds upon progress already achieved since the adoption by the European Parliament in 2010 of the three resolutions in this area: first, the introduction of binding and comprehensive trade and sustainable development chapters in all our free trade agreements; second, the strengthening of the human rights dimension, including gender, in our sustainable impact assessment; and, third, reforming the EU Generalised System of Preferences, including the flagship GSP+, sustainable development and good governance. We also have developed partnerships with key players to promote change in countries where the situation was acute, for example through the Bangladesh Compact. Furthermore, we are supporting responsible business practices, including enhanced transparency for large companies on non-financial information, as well as the uptake in implementation of internationally recognised guidelines and principles of corporate social responsibility. The EU has been a frontrunner over recent years in pursuing the integration of sustainable development into its policy, and this engagement has also been recognised by many international organisations and our trading partners. But being a frontrunner is, of course, not enough. There is much more work to be done. In this regard we have set some priorities, notably the effective implementation of trade and sustainable development chapters, better linking trade policy instruments to development cooperation, including with a view to supporting the 2030 agenda, and the promotion of responsible supply chains and of private sector engagement to integrate sustainable development objectives as part of core business strategies. The report on a new forward-looking and innovative future strategy for trade and investment underlines the importance of pushing both jobs and growth, as well as the value agenda that focused on human rights, good governance and sustainable development. We have taken very careful note of the request for our future trade policy to have a stronger focus not only on these issues but also on manufacturing priorities and services. Trade in manufacturing is, of course, a priority, as it has been in recent decades and will be in the future as well. It is a central pillar of our market access strategy in trade agreements and trade defence. The Commission welcomes the attention given to the importance of coherence between trade and other EU policies, and this new Commission is working hard, along these lines, to integrate the various policy areas – respect for human and labour rights, protection of the environment, and the development of partner countries, including sustainable development chapters – in all our trade agreements. We very much welcome Parliament’s emphasis on the primacy of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) system and the multilateral approach to negotiation. I share the ambition in that regard. We agree that the multilateral route for trade liberalisation is of course the most efficient and the most equitable, when it is possible. Moreover, we endorse Parliament’s demand for a balanced outcome, including on agriculture, in free trade agreements. We will continue, in this context, to balance the needs of manufacturing, services and agricultural producers in setting our priorities for negotiation. We also take note of the view expressed on market economy status for China. As you know, the Commission is currently conducting an in-depth impact assessment analysing the various options with regard to the treatment of China in anti-dumping investigations, and we will hold further political discussions on this in the coming weeks. Lastly, Parliament’s call for greater reciprocity in opening up public procurement is well noted. It is clearly an area where there is imbalance, and we take this very much into account when we formulate mandates and negotiate free trade agreements, in order to have a more level playing field in the area of public procurement. So I want to thank you very much for these reports. They contain some very valuable comments. Much of what you propose is actually already being done by the Commission but we can, of course, do more and we look forward to working with you in order to have not only as efficient a trade policy as possible but also a sustainable and responsible one.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Liberals and centrists"}, {"id": 162, "date": "2016-07-04.json", "name": "Lola SÁNCHEZ CALDENTEY", "mepid": "125035", "text": "  draftser of the Opinion of the Committee on Development. – Mr President, Mrs Malmstrom, the impunity with which many companies are championed around the world is intolerable.

Also ensure compliance with the United Nations declaration on the right to development as an inalienable right of all and that the sovereignty of States to establish policies that respond to the interests of their people is respected. But above all, a binding treaty is urgently needed for companies to respect social and environmental standards and, above all, human rights. The European Union should support the work of the United Nations in this regard, rather than blocking them.

But beyond the recommendations I can make from this Plenary, we do not lose sight of the view that social responsibility is tortured by the large European economic and financial groups: when they promote the relocation of companies and labour and social dumping, when they attack collective bargaining and the organisations representing workers, when they promote the exploitation of resources and workers in third countries by digging social and gender discrimination. It will not be the European Union's trade policy that reverses this reality.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Forenza, for our good cooperation on this report. Since 2010, progress has been made by the Commission and trade continues to try to contribute, at the bilateral and multilateral level, to respect for human rights, as well as to social and environmental standards. The human rights clauses in trade agreements, the presence of binding chapters on sustainable development and the Commission's action on the international stage must continue and be strengthened. In this sense, we must call on the WTO, as part of its reform, to take more account of social and environmental standards. The actions of the European Union must go further. For example, we need to pay close attention to the GSP system and improve it so that the conventions are truly respected. On the other hand, some initiatives need to be pursued. I am referring here to the sustainability pact, launched in the wake of the Rana Plaza tragedy. The Commission must continue its corporate social responsibility policy and extend this type of action to other trading partners. I would also like to raise a request that had already been made in 2010 and to which no further action has been taken. The Commission must present a legislative initiative as soon as possible that will put an end to child and forced labour. I would like to stress the importance of the effective implementation of the agreements and commitments that have been made in a transparent manner. It is important that Parliament be more included in the follow-up process. With regard to the Union's trade strategy, I thank Mrs Beghin for her work. It is essential that the spirit of reciprocity and mutual benefit be at the heart of the European Union's trade relations with its partners. Particular attention should be paid to sensitive products, particularly agricultural products, with the implementation of specific and appropriate treatments. Finally, as rapporteur on the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, I would like to point out that trade policy must protect and promote the values defended by the European Union.

I believe that human rights and trade are not contradictory, but complementary. I believe that trade is a key development instrument that brings growth and wealth, and therefore in the long term contributes to the development of human, labour and social rights. I stand for the strategy of engagement, instead of the policy of conditionality. I believe that we should treat our counterparts as trading partners on an equal footing, and that this kind of treatment will bring a solid basis for ongoing dialogue and cooperation. One free trade agreement in particular, that has only recently been concluded, the free trade agreement between the EU and Vietnam, could serve as a very good example of that approach. I think that developing countries need social, labour and environmental standards that correspond in the first place with their level of economic and social development, and any effort to bring binding requirements, to impose binding requirements, which unfortunately is an attitude becoming more and more popular in this Chamber, means that it will be harmful to them.

Well, first of all, it must not be business as usual. On the one hand, we are seeing more and more EU citizens interested in trade issues. However, on the other hand, there are increasing numbers of those concerned and fearful of the potential impact of the trade issues. We have to be able to come up with new ways to communicate these issues more effectively and to address citizens’ concerns. This would mean saying a clear ‘no’ to all forms of protectionism while aiming for trade that is both fair and responsible. I am convinced that a proper implementation of the strategy should start with an inventory of all current trade negotiations. For this to occur you would need to reallocate sufficient human resources within the Commission services. The EU does not show itself to be very serious about this, when we see negotiations taking more than 12 or 15 years. We need to have clear priorities and deliver. Personally, I see three key areas for our future trade policy. They should consist of: first, promoting a digital dimension of international trade; secondly, facilitating exchange in the services sector; and lastly, providing our companies, especially SMEs, with real new business opportunities.

Free trade agreements can bring many benefits, but they can also seriously jeopardize the future of certain vulnerable agricultural sectors, for which the necessary exclusion clauses or mitigation measures need to be provided. This accumulation of concessions can be particularly harmful in areas such as fruit and vegetables or in sectors such as poultry or beef.  Agriculture has already been, on many occasions, the currency of exchange of trade negotiations with third countries, a circumstance that should not be repeated in the future.  On the other hand, one of the Union's main goals in negotiations with third countries should be the introduction of an equivalence ratio or, if possible, the full reciprocity of health standards, as well as the elimination of non-tariff barriers, which constitute the real obstacle to trade with many countries above tariff barriers.

The second point I would like to make is that there is a general lack of knowledge about EU trade policy on the part of our constituencies. This prevents our trade policy from being effective. Outside of Brussels, people and companies find out about our trade policy initiatives too late to be able to influence the outcome. We must find a way to inform them of our trade initiatives in time so they can fully participate and shape these policies.

But frankly, words on paper are easy and now we need to see the Commission deliver on its promises, and we are not convinced that the current trade negotiations are truly reflecting these new values. We agree that under certain conditions trade can bring sustainable growth and jobs – for instance, we have just had the fifth anniversary of the EU-Korea Free Trade Agreement, where EU exports to Korea have increased by 55% helping to turn a trade deficit into a trade surplus. This is a significant achievement and our companies and workers have benefited from that. However, as a previous speaker has just said, we cannot ignore that trade does not benefit all. It is therefore essential we make sure the benefits of trade reach the widest range of people. This is why open trade has to be accompanied by adequate flanking policies, including access to a reformed Globalisation Adjustment Fund. The losers from trade liberalisation cannot and should not be left alone. My group has always pushed for FTAs to be used as levers to promote EU values, and as such we welcome the reference to sustainable development, human rights, fair and ethical trade and the fight against corruption and tax evasion. And in this respect we reiterate in the report that the trade and sustainable development chapters in our FTAs should be enforceable in order to make sure our trading partners effectively implement those rules. And we agree with the Commissioner that the proliferation of FTAs should not lead to the death of the multilateral trading system.

Areas of concern still remain within this trade strategy: protectionist measures in the form of a retaliatory public procurement instrument and continual insistence on GI protection for non-agricultural products.

In a world which is rapidly changing, with the economic rise of countries like China or the Gulf states that do not share our standards and levels of openness, this is not a luxury, but a necessity. I am glad to see that the Commission has ensured values are at the heart of the EU’s trade strategy. Clearly, this is what EU citizens expect. The interest in, and the debate about, trade have increased significantly over the past years. It is not without reason that Member State governments, as well as parliamentarians, decided to leverage the weight of our entire European economy on the global stage to have the best negotiating position. I certainly hope that these governments, as well as national parliaments, will continue to play an active role because it is too easy to pretend it is ‘Brussels’ dreaming up trade policy or ‘Brussels’ not publishing documents, while we constantly have to push for Member States to make mandate texts available, for example. In addition, there is a huge demand by people to have their voices heard. It is key that the capacity to engage people actively is created.

Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank the commissioner for her work and for the work she has done. International trade policy has reached the public consciousness with the EU-wide debates on TTIP, CETA, TiSA and the Economic Partnership Agreements at the latest. That is why this joint debate is only to be welcomed. The Commission has presented an ambitious work programme and now the long-standing strategy for the coming years. That is why it is all the more urgent for the European Parliament to adopt its position on this. I would also like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Beghin, for her efforts. The report by my group colleague, Mr Forenza, is a report of initiative for review into the extent to which important, central demands of Parliament on social and environmental standards, human rights and corporate social responsibility have been and will be taken into account by the Commission in its trade policy practice in the past and present. In this link in content, the content of the two reports, for me, is closely linked. The GUE/NGL vision of future international trade relations builds on our vision of solidarity, economic justice and fair trade relations. We have re-set out our proposal for an alternative resolution, because the INTA resolution only partially covers what is needed today. We certainly welcome the growing importance that aspects of fair trade are also being given by the European Commission. Nevertheless, the basic concept of trade strategy remains to promote interests and profits for the large transnational companies in production with huge technological upheavals, both in the service sector and in the eu's financial markets, at the expense of the other regions of the world and also, in fact, by small and medium-sized enterprises in the EU itself.

Quite the opposite actually, because trade currently and at the moment often increases inequality and leads to poverty, and that urgently needs to change. I think actually your trade strategy, Commissioner, is a step in the right direction. But now we need to move onwards from the nice words about human rights and values towards the implementation, and that needs to include also binding rules. But instead, what we see the Commission doing is proposing trade sanctions against partner countries that are not readmitting migrants. So instead of having trade sanctions on human rights violations we are actually sanctioning countries who are not closing their border enough and I really hope that colleagues will join me in saying that this is just outright wrong.

In 1990, world trade accounted for 19% of world GDP. That was a total value of $3.5 billion. Today it represents 30% of world GDP and the value overall has more than fivefold. At that time, 38% of the world's population lived in absolute poverty. Today, 10% of the world's population lives in absolute poverty. So it has been halved twice, but it is not just that there is an absolute and causal connection there. Trade in a well-being (inaudible word) eradicates poverty. The problem we have is that this development is slowing down. Trade growth today and late 2008 is less than half that of the average since 1990. And unfortunately, this is very much due to protectionism. Since 2008, when almost 3800 protectionist measures have been introduced worldwide, and at the same time only a third as many trade facilitations have been implemented. Since 1995 to 2008, the average duty was halved from 19% to 10%, but since then it has remained at almost the same level and that is why the Commission's trade strategy is so important in reversing this trend, but then it has to take advantage of all the important issues that you write about. To actually take the fight against trade barriers. Complicated rules of origin, for example.

This report offers concrete proposals to make sustainable development operational, and I will highlight just five of them.  The first is making trade union and civil society engagement more formal, giving greater responsibility to non-state actors, such as the ability to lodge labour rights complaints directly with the Commission. The second, shifting from voluntary corporate social responsibility to effective and enforceable supply chain due diligence requirements, allowing us to build on the recent political agreement on EU legislation on conflict minerals. The third, properly recognising independent expertise by taking impact assessments seriously and undertaking them in a timely manner able to influence negotiations. Fourth, using incentives but equally having adequate deterrents, notably through clear criteria to grant and withdraw GSP+ privileges, which requires, in our view, a new delegated act specifically on this point. And fifthly, involving fully the ILO in all trade talks and negotiations as we did with some success in the aftermath of the terrible Rana Plaza disaster in Bangladesh.

It has been very good and there are a lot of valuable suggestions in the reports by the two rapporteurs. When the Commission presented its Trade for All strategy it had three main objectives. First, of course, that the trade agreements we conclude should have effect: that they should actually bring benefits to our consumers, our citizens and our entrepreneurs. Trade can be a formidable resource in fighting poverty and ensuring that people prosper. Of course, we need to get it right, and this is something that our trade agreements are focusing on. We need to deal with the right issues as well: modern issues, such as services, e—commerce and intellectual property rights (IPR), while defending the very important manufacturing industry that we have in the European Union. We need to make sure that consumers really get the benefits of our trade agreements and that we reach out in a better way to SMEs. We have, for instance, proposed a specific SME website in order to facilitate SMEs’ knowing about the trade agreements we conclude. A second goal was to emphasise the values of the European Union. We cannot solve all the human rights problems on earth through trade agreements, we have to be realistic, but we can contribute – and we can do more by being more comprehensive, by using our various policies, on trade, development, foreign policy, investment etcetera, in a clever way. We can do more and we can enforce those values. We have chapters, in our agreements, on human rights, labour rights and sustainable development: they are enforceable and they are mandatory. We have a dedicated dispute settlement mechanism. And we want to go one step further. For instance, in the newly started negotiations with Mexico, we even have the aim, in the mandate, of fighting corruption. The recent work that we have done jointly – Parliament, the Council and the Commission – to reach conclusions, at least politically, on the conflict minerals agreement and on anti-torture policy is, I think, a good indication that trade can be responsible. The third goal was increased transparency. Citizens want to be engaged, they want to be included, they want to know what trade is about. This is something that has become increasingly acute in recent times and it is mainly to be welcomed but it means that we must change the way that we implement our policy. We have committed to making our trade policy as transparent as possible. With the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), we are taking it as far as possible, and we want to do the same with all other trade agreements. Here, we can do more to engage with citizens. This is the task of the Commission, it is the task of Member States and it is also your task: to engage, to explain, to listen, to bring back concerns and questions, and also to give reassurance when it is needed.  We can do more, for instance, on gender equality. It is present in our trade strategy, we take it into account in our impact assessments. In the GSP+ we have included a requirement for observance of the Convention on Non-Discrimination, for instance, but here too we can do more, and I would be happy to look in more detail at your suggestions. Child labour is also an area at which we have been looking. We published a staff working document a few years ago on trade and the worst forms of child labour, and it shows that the worst forms are actually found in non-tradable sectors, so it is difficult to address this. However, we do follow it very closely with our trading partners – we have, for example, the GSP+ monitoring system – and we will continue to do so. Trade is, as I said, debated, and this is good. We need to do more from the Commission side and from Parliament’s side. Member States need to do more to make sure, too, that the trade agreements we conclude are beneficial for our citizens and also complementary vis-à-vis social policy and different protection measures. We are looking now, in the Commission, at how the Globalisation Fund can be used in a more intelligent way to protect people who are not benefiting from globalisation or trade, and we are, of course, reaching out to a number of countries – both developing countries and developed countries – to negotiate trade agreements, and we will continue to do so, while committing to efficiency and transparency and to a value-based trade policy. Thank you very much for this debate. Thank you, honourable Members, for your input.

Today we are providing precise indications to reiterate one concept: that human, social and environmental rights are not a dependent variable in trade. We call for a reform of the WTO in the direction of ensuring respect for human rights, for the ILO to be a permanent observer of the WTO; we call, for example, for a reformulation of the clause on human rights and sustainable development chapters, so that they are genuinely binding and for the possibility of derogation from trade agreements to be introduced at a time when the real use of human rights is being disregarded.  We are calling for the prior ratification and transposition into national law of the eight plus four fundamental ILO conventions: we know how sensitive this issue is when negotiating TTIP with the United States, which has not signed all of them. We are calling for clear criteria for the identification of environmental assets. We call for action on issues such as current intellectual property regimes. We strongly call for the transition from a voluntary RSI to a binding regulatory framework for multinationals.  As you can see, these are very concrete indications which are designed to reiterate one point: I am sorry to have to contradict the Commissioner, but I do not believe that we have gone and are moving in the right direction with TTIP and CETA.

As shadow rapporteur for the S&amp;D Group on the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs in the INTA Committee, I voted from the outset in favour of encouraging the application of social and environmental standards, human rights and corporate social responsibility in international trade agreements, both bilateral and multilateral, ensuring not only ratification but also effective implementation of these standards, in line with the ILO's recommendations. In order to encourage the application of these standards, it is necessary to provide for the possibility of incentives for companies promoting corporate social responsibility (CSR) and considering proactive measures to prevent human or environmental violations, to identify and prevent all violations of human and environmental rights, including with regard to their branches and supply chain. The horizontal introduction of these standards can promote quality work and decent work.

Mr President, Commissioner Malmström, I would like to thank commissioner for her excellent work and for the work she has done. The report on the fight against trafficking in human beings in the EU's external relations is the first of its kind in the European Parliament. It is an own-initiative report by the Subcommittee of the Committee on Human Rights and the Committee on Foreign Affairs, in which we have also incorporated proposals from the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. It has become a very comprehensive, technical report, and I would like to express my sincere thanks to all the colleagues who have contributed to this, as well as to the staff of the committee services.  The forms of these crimes, colloquially referred to as modern slavery, are very different. There are images of wounded people deprived of their freedom, reminiscent of the slaves of a long time gone, for example pictures of men who were detained on fish trawlers, who worked hard there for years under blows and without pay. Or it is about girls who are put into forced prostitution, where, even if they die from it, no one of them, their misery and their suffering, still notices. In our report, however, we also look at less visible forms, such as child soldiers, forced labour in the household, organ trafficking and forced begging. What all these extreme conditions of exploitation have in common is that the victims have been forced and cannot easily free themselves from them. The aim of trafficking in human beings is always the maximum exploitation of the person concerned. In the report, we propose that the EU and also the Member States should focus more intensively on the crimes of trafficking in human beings in a wide range of policy areas. As a matter of urgency, the victims must be brought into the focus of all endeavours. Anyone who wants the perpetrators of this heinous business to be held accountable must give effective witness protection to the victims. They need help, therapy, legal redress of the injustice that has been inflicted on them, they need reparation and compensation. Trafficking in human beings is an enormously lucrative business with human goods. It brings enormous profits to the individual perpetrators and organised crime networks. According to the ILO, forced labour in the private sector generates about USD 150 billion in illegal profits every year. The EU must therefore work more intensively and better with third countries in the information about financial flows. There is a much greater focus on the money laundering machine within the EU. European companies abroad must be accountable for forced labour in their companies and supply chains. In its trade policy, the EU must make every effort to ensure that human rights protection is consistently implemented. A good example was the discussions on the EU-Thailand fisheries trade agreement and slave-like working conditions in Thailand. Europol and the Member States must cooperate better in the fight against organised crime and must not get tangled up in the scrum of competence and demarcation. All those who come into contact with victims of trafficking in human beings, especially border guards and police, must be trained to better identify victims of trafficking. So our report before us lists a large number of measures that the EU can improve. We want to adopt the report tomorrow, and that is the right time to influence this year's review of EU policy against trafficking in human beings with its assessments and demands. I would like to end with a heartfelt thank you to the EU Special Representative and Anti-Trafficking Coordinator, Mrs Vassiliadou, for her outstanding work.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "Verts/ALE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Greens and regionalists"}, {"id": 201, "date": "2016-07-04.json", "name": "Miroslav MIKOLÁŠIK", "mepid": "28178", "text": "   – The issue of trafficking in human beings, but also an issue that I want to address more, and that is the issue of human trafficking, which has been criminally taken away from people who have been lured to a foreign country, for example, with a job offer, but it was actually slavery, or people trafficked internationally, something that violates even the most basic human rights.

This is an area that is very dear to my heart, also in my former capacity.  The Commission, with the support of the External Action Service, will continue to address human trafficking in the external relations of the European Union. We will continue to ensure that European Union law and standards related to anti-trafficking efforts are properly transposed inside the EU, and we will continue to fight globally for higher standards against human trafficking, bilaterally through different dialogue processes and with leading international organisations. Within the EU, out of the 27 Member States concerned, 26 have now communicated to the Commission full transposition of the Anti-Trafficking Directive. There is one remaining – Germany – and they have informed us about the political agreement reached. We are expecting information very soon on the transposition. An infringement case against this Member State remains open on grounds of non-communication.  The report on the extent to which Member States comply with the directive is foreseen to be presented by the Commission in the fourth quarter of this year. We are currently in the process of developing the post—2016 policy framework, and this resolution and the report are indeed very timely. I would also like to inform you about a milestone the Commission reached recently, at the end of May, with the adoption of the first report assessing the progress made in fighting trafficking in human beings. In this report, we identify areas of progress and achievement, but also expose gaps and efforts that are absolutely still to be made. So the EU has delivered, but a lot remains to be done. We cannot – as all of you have said – allow human beings to be treated like commodities. We must work together to ensure that we prevent the crime from happening, because after that it is too late. We must crack down on trafficking where it matters the most for them – on their profits. There we all have a role to play, including in cooperation with countries beyond EU borders. Trafficking in human beings is indeed part of the European Agenda on Migration, the European Agenda on Security and the new Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy, as well as the new framework for the EU’s activity on gender equality and the empowerment of women in external action 2016-2020.  At the Valletta Summit on Migration, the EU’s and the Member States’ political leaders committed to scale up joint efforts to eradicate trafficking in human beings and combat those who exploit vulnerable people, and that includes children, of course. The action plan that was adopted includes the prevention of, and fight against, irregular migration, migrant smuggling and trafficking in human beings among its priorities.  Trafficking in human beings is also systematically addressed in agreements and partnerships with non-EU countries: in bilateral and regional dialogues on migration and mobility and in political and security dialogues. The EU raises trafficking in human beings in the framework of its human rights dialogue with over 40 countries worldwide, and that is an important component of our action plan on human rights and democracy. We also support international efforts in this field, advocating and funding joint actions with various international regional fora such as the United Nations, the OECE and the Asia Regional Forum. More importantly, we must ensure that we do not foster a culture of impunity for those who exploit and use these victims. We must ensure that the victims are not treated like criminals. We must demand a strong political will and commitment by the leadership of other countries. Only then will the voice and the possible assistance of the EU have an ultimate impact. To do this, we must work together. I count on this Parliament – I know your strong commitment on this issue – to continue to work in this direction. Trafficking in human beings has quite a short story in the external action of the European Union, but we need to do more and to consolidate that work, and this report is an important step in that direction.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Liberals and centrists"}, {"id": 206, "date": "2016-07-04.json", "name": "Ioan Mircea PAŞCU", "mepid": "33984", "text": "   The debate has been closed.

A first step towards strengthening a homogeneous route of the 27 would be to rethink the distribution of the Union institutions in the territory, which would give a clear signal that the Union is giving equally important roles to all Member States. One of the arguments of anti-Europeans, at least in the states that came to the Union after 1990, is that the Union means the domination of western European nations over others. Countering this current must be done with facts, and the homogeneous distribution of the Union institutions throughout the EU is a first step. In this respect, I would like to make a proposal here: after Brexit, Romania becomes statistically the sixth nation of the European Union. In this context, I believe that the time has come for the European Union to show Romanians that it trusts them and their administrative capacity by reallocating to Romania the European Medicines Agency, which is currently based in London. In the next period I intend to generate a legislative proposal in this regard, and I hope that you will be with me, so that together we can give a signal of European unity to both Romanians and other nations.", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 238, "date": "2016-07-04.json", "name": "Tomáš ZDECHOVSKÝ", "mepid": "124713", "text": "   – Mr President, I would like to mention an important subject here. Although we have been talking about it for a long time, Commissioner, it is not and has not been adequately addressed. Few people realise that turning kilometres is one of the biggest problems that is plaguing consumers in the European Union.  Experts estimate that more than 30% of used cars in the European Union are affected by this problem. Consumers then lose more than €9 billion a year because of these unfair practices. Fraudsters profit at the expense of society as a whole. And the European Parliament, which represents this whole, should do everything in its power to protect citizens.
