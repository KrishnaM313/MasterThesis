Last Wednesday evening, leaders listened to Prime Minister May’s views on the negotiations. Afterwards, the EU27 met in the Article 50 format, with our chief negotiator Michel Barnier, to discuss the state of play. It was made clear by the UK that more time is needed to find a precise solution. Therefore, there is no other way but to continue the talks. Leaders expressed their full trust and support for Michel Barnier. Since Prime Minister May mentioned the idea of extending the transition period, let me repeat that if the UK decided that such an extension would be helpful to reach a deal, I am sure that the leaders would be ready to consider it positively. President Juncker also touched upon preparations for a no-deal scenario, an outcome which we hope never to see. And, of course, I stand ready to convene a European Council, if and when the Union negotiator reports that decisive progress has been made. The Brexit talks continue with the aim of reaching a deal. Turning to migration: in the course of our regular discussions, on Thursday morning we had an exchange on our migration policy in all its aspects. The EU leaders want to strengthen external border control and deepen cooperation with third countries to stop illegal arrivals. The focus last week was also on increasing cooperation with countries in North Africa, and a tougher approach to people-smuggling networks.  Leaders noted the Union’s achievement in stemming mass arrivals of irregular migrants over the past three years, even if more remains to be done. We thanked the Austrian Presidency for its efforts to reform the Common European Asylum System and agreed that work should continue with a view to finding an agreement as soon as possible. The European Council also adopted a number of decisions on internal security. Some of them should be seen in the context of increased concerns and risks of hybrid, cyber, as well as chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats. One element of particular interest was the leaders’ call to create a capacity to respond to, and deter, cyber-attacks through EU sanctions. Of course, this is especially important in light of the European elections next year and the active threat posed by malicious, outside interference in our democracies. During the Euro Summit, the Eurogroup Chair, Mário Centeno, gave an update on the finance ministers’ work on the ESM reform and the banking union while the European Central Bank President, Mario Draghi, informed leaders on the economic outlook. The objective of the meeting was to keep up the pressure for concrete results in December. EU finance ministers should speed up their work if we are to achieve our goal, which is strengthening the ESM and the banking union further. Leaders also held a short debate on external relations, including on the fight against climate change ahead of COP24 in Katowice. We adopted conclusions on taking our relations with Africa to a new level – an issue of great importance – and in this context agreed to organise a summit with the League of Arab States on 24 and 25 February next year. For many of the issues discussed at the European Council – from migration to security – as well as the need to scale up the Union’s presence as a global actor in many fields, the EU’s budget is key. At a technical level, there have been detailed discussions on the next multiannual financial framework, but, in general terms, we are far from reaching any sort of consensus. This is why I will propose a political discussion at the December European Council. I welcome the intention that the consolidated position of this Parliament is to be known by then. Let me close with a word on the shocking killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Turkey earlier this month. This was such a horrible crime that even the slightest trace of hypocrisy would bring shame on us. It is not my role to state who wants to protect whose interests here. But I know one thing: the only European interest is to reveal all the details of this case, regardless of who is behind it. Knowing your sensitivity and determination, I believe that you will not allow for Europe, the Member States or the institutions, to become involved in any ambiguous game.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "PPE-DE", "partyIdeology": "PPE-DE"}, {"id": 2, "date": "2018-10-24.json", "name": "Frans TIMMERMANS", "mepid": "129141", "text": "   First Vice-President of the Commission. Mr President, on behalf of Jean-Claude Juncker, I will not go into great detail on the October European Council, as President Tusk has already shared a full account of the results achieved.  Allow me to touch very briefly on the negotiations with the United Kingdom. As was clear after the European Council, the bottom line is that we do not yet have the decisive progress that we need. The goodwill and the determination to find an agreement as soon as possible are there, but it is also clear that we will not rush a deal through at the expense of our principles or our agreed commitments, most notably on the Irish border issue. With all of this in mind, we must now continue negotiating with patience, calm and an open mind.  The Commission and our chief negotiator, Mr Michel Barnier, received the full backing of all leaders to do just that. It is time to deliver and we are getting on with the job. That is what we are focused on doing across all of the issues that matter the most for our future, as we discussed yesterday when we debated the Commission's work program.  When we talk about our future, we must first talk about Africa. Our partnership with Africa has enormous potential for both sides. It must be fair and balanced, helping both partners to grow. This is why the Commission last month proposed a new Africa-Europe Alliance for Sustainable Investment and Jobs, to strengthen the economic partnership with our African friends. This is about concrete action, taking forward commitments made together with the African Union over the past years, notably in Abidjan. With your support and that of the Member States, the Alliance will help attract investment in Africa. It is expected to create 10 million jobs over the next five years and support youth employability through education and training.  The External Investment Plan is well in motion to serve the ambitious objective of jobs and growth creation. It is well advanced in order to mobilize over EUR 44 billion in both public and private investments. The project already in the pipeline will unlock EUR 24 billion. The potential is there. The framework is there. Now it is time to deliver results.   Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren! Die Europeer messen uns nicht an der Zahl der Worte, sondern daran, ob wir diese umsetzen. Ich appelliere daher an Sie und den Rat, die Vorschlàge, die die Kommission bereits vorgelegt hat, voranzubringen. Das gilt vor allem, wenn es um die zentralen Fragen unsere Zukunft geht, wie etwa die Wirtschafts- und Wàhrungsunion sowie Migration und Sicherheit. So messen wir unsere Wirtschafts- und Wàhrungsunion vertiefen, so dass wir ger-stet sind, bevor neue Wolken in der Weltwirtschaft aufziehen. Der Erfolg des Euro h-ngt davon ab, dass jeder einzelne Mitgliedstaat seine Hausaufgaben macht - genauso wie die Kommission ihre Hausaufgaben erledigt hat. Von den 40 Vorschlungen, die wir zur st-rkung der Wirtschafts- und Wàhrungsunion auf den Elfmeterpunkt gelegt haben, wurden allerdings bis jetzt nur sechs angenommen. Das muss sich 'ndern! Bis zum Eurogipfel im Dezember wollen wir, wie bereits im Juni vereinbart, die Bankenunion vollenden. Das hei't vor allem, dass wir den einheitlichen Stabilit-tsmechanismus stunken, welcher die Letztsicherung (back stop) fer den einheitlichen Abwicklungsfonds 'bernehmen soll. Auserdem messen wir mit unserem Fahrplan hin zu einem einheitlichen europeischen Einlagensicherungssystem vorankommen. In allen diesen Fragen haben wir ebenso wie bei der Vertiefung der Kapitalmarktunion keine Zeit zu verlieren.  Das gilt gleichermaen fer die Vorschlàge, die wir zur Migration vorgelegt haben. Wir messen jetzt an umfassenden europeischen Lsungen arbeiten, die langfristig wirken. Die Kommission hat dazu eine Reihe von Vorschlungen vorgelegt, unter anderem zum Ausbau der europeischen Grenz- und Kostenwache, fer wirksamere und make R-ckf-hrungen und zur Reform of Dublin-Systems. Es ist eine Frage europeischer Solidaritet und Verantwortung, dass wir in all diesen Themen Fortschritte machen, und das erwarten die Europeer auch von uns. Ich setze daher weiterhin auf Ihre Unterst-tzung, sehr geehrte Abgeordnete, sodas wir bis zu den Wahlen greifbare Ergebnisse liefern.  - the same in the area of security. Since the beginning of its mandate, this committee has presented numerous legislative proposals, of which only a handful have already been adopted. I would remind you that we have a burning obligation to ensure the safety of our citizens. I would therefore like to see the 20 or so proposals that remain on the table of co-legislators, including those on interoperability, adopted without further delay. There is an urgent need to do so, whether it is cybersecurity or the fight against terrorist content posted online and misinformation that threatens our democratic processes. We must guarantee free elections, transparent and fair. I would also like to add that I am pleased that the Council has agreed that our proposal to establish a new system for combating natural disasters, the RescUE, should be adopted by the end of the year. We cannot accept that more lives are devastated and economies are destroyed because we would not have been able to act in time with all the determination and solidarity we need. Last week was also marked by other summits, especially with our friends in Asia. These summits were an opportunity to reaffirm our shared commitment to multilateralism and a rules-based international order, this commitment coming from a group - Europe and Asian countries - which together accounts for 60% of the world's population and 65% of the world's GDP (gross domestic product). We have also signed new bilateral agreements, notably with Singapore. This agreement will tighten our economic and political ties with Singapore and open up new opportunities for European producers, workers, farmers and consumers, as the EU has achieved around the world with other partners. Our shared determination to meet global challenges will be strengthened by political dialogue. Trade and investment agreements will now be sent to the European Parliament for approval, so that the trade agreement can enter into force before the end of the Commission's current mandate. The Commission has also begun the process of concluding trade and investment agreements between the European Union and Vietnam, and many other agreements are being negotiated. All these agreements go far beyond the traditional abolition of tariffs to also integrate the values and commitments we share, especially in the fight against climate change. In December, in Katowice, Poland, we will all have to live up to the extreme urgency of climate issues and our commitments under the Paris Agreement. In Katowice, the Commission will present its long-term vision and strategy. Scientists from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have told us the truth and we have no time to waste. We no longer have time to think for the next few decades. Now is the time to act. We must work to save our planet and our civilization. Early last week, Jean-Claude Juncker also attended the tripartite social summit. This Commission has put social priorities at the heart of our action, because for too long the social dimension has remained the poor relation of European integration and I would remind you that since the beginning of our mandate, we have presented some thirty legislative proposals in the social field, almost half of which have yet to be adopted. We are therefore counting on the Austrian Presidency so that by the end of the year we will be able to conclude all these subjects. December must be a decisive month for social Europe and we are pleased that during this European Council no Member State has said that we cannot reach an agreement in principle on the next European Union budget before May 2019, a goal that this House has already signalled as essential. We welcome the future of social Europe in particular, with in particular our proposal to provide the European Social Fund with more than EUR 100 billion in budget to support the implementation of the main principles of the European social rights base, which is a genuine programme of action in an area where Member States hold the bulk of competences. It is about our credibility, it is about the trust of our fellow citizens, our students and our researchers in a Europe that listens to their concerns and expectations and provides them with concrete solutions to protect them and offer them better prospects for the future.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 3, "date": "2018-10-24.json", "name": "Antonio TAJANI", "mepid": "2187", "text": "   Before giving the floor to the representatives of the political groups, I wanted to inform the House of what I said during my speech to the European Council.

Mr President, Mr President of the Council, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, thank you for reframed a little bit of the discussion we are going to have this morning on the European Council, because we have heard a wonderful electoral programme from Mr Timmermans. But I will just talk, like you, about the conclusions of this Council because from Salzburg to Brussels, last chance in last chance, the summits pass but the problems remain. Let's give ourselves a little more time, they say, but we don't have any more time, we've already lost too much! We are in a moment of extreme urgency, a few months before European elections which are shaping up to be perilous for the future of Europe. However, our national leaders meet but do not decide. Every week we are entitled to the same litany of promises and declarations of good intentions and, behind it, is the blockage. Let's take a look at the menu of this Council: as an entry, emigration and internal security. We know the solutions. If this Council has indeed enabled, Mr Vice-President, to bring about a consensus on the external dimension of the problem and cooperation with the countries of origin, with regard to the internal dimension and the organisation of solidarity, no lasting solution is emerging. In the main course: Brexit. Despite michel Barnier's remarkable efforts, we are still leaving without agreement. At least it will have brought the unity of European countries back and Theresa May's UK to account. Dear British friends, the ball is in your court. Finally, the eurozone. It is clear that if we had a new debt crisis tomorrow, which is a real risk, there is no guarantee that we will be better off. Not all the lessons of the past have been learned, and we are just able to agree on the need, which has been repeatedly raised, to strengthen the banking union. That is not enough to reassure. The balance sheet is not rosy. The European asylum policy: stalled! Eurozone reform: stalled! The taxation of large digital companies, a measure of tax justice that is highly anticipated by our citizens: at a standstill! Brexit: stalled! As for Italy's budget, which could tip the whole eurozone into a new crisis, we act as if we do not see the elephant in the room. And courage, where has courage gone? Europe remains in balance, on the razor's edge, as if tetanus. However, it is not the fault of the Commission, which has never been as voluntary as it is today, or of Parliament, which is redoubling its efforts to complete the many texts currently on the table on time, particularly with regard to the next multi-year financial framework. We are making progress, we are moving forward, but President Tusk himself has told us that we are far from an agreement. It is not easy to agree at 28, but we have seen it again recently in defence, when the political will is there, no obstacle is insurmountable. What is the conclusion? Quite simply, there is a lack of political will on the part of our Member States. Some are motors, but many are standing on the brake pedal. At this rate, the road exit is not far away.

That, in any case, is my impression. It was a lost date – a date that did not provide answers, a date when the Heads of State or Government have once again shown themselves incapable or unwilling to move Europe forward, and where they have been unable to understand that we are only stronger together. This is a bad image for Europe, represented by the majority of Heads of State or Government. It is my firm conviction that we cannot afford this, seven months before the European elections. Mr Tusk, I would like to compliment you. They are very capable of maintaining a diplomatic language. I appreciate that, you understand. But if you praise the Austrian Presidency for making progress on asylum policy and for making efforts, what efforts did you mean? It may be that I missed something. But please explain to us what efforts you have made in this context by the Austrian Presidency. The opposite is true! It is being sat out, the asylum package is being blocked. That is the reality, and that divides Europe. It does not bind Europe together, it does not build a bridge. The slogan of this Austrian Presidency is wrong. The Austrian Presidency is dividing Europe and giving no answers. That is the truth in this situation, which we no longer accept, which we no longer tolerate. What is happening in the Mediterranean is a scandal. We have said this more than once. We urgently need more sea rescue. That is why we are working to ensure that those who risk their lives are also honoured for being given the dignity to receive the Sakharov Prize. But we know that we need basic solutions – basic solutions in solidarity with secure escape routes, with regulated labour migration and with the asylum package that the European Parliament has adopted. ast weekend showed that when Europe is united, the consequences can be amazing. Last Saturday, we saw some 700,000 people marching in London to have a final say on a possible Brexit deal. We think the British people deserve – once they have seen the measures and the consequences of this divorce and once they have seen the lies of the Brexiteers – to have a final say on their future. This is my firm supply and this is my understanding of democracy. The next European elections are of outstanding importance for the future of our continent and for the future of democracy. You have seen that right-wing radicalism and populism are joining together to undermine the European Union, to put the European Union at risk. Fake news – we discussed this yesterday – the systematic way of undermining democratic decisions must be vigorously combated, and here too we have missed the Austrian Presidency. The Conservatives in the House must decide whether they want to continue to defend democracy and the European Union, or whether they are the ones who open the door to the right-wing radicals. This is a decision, ladies and gentlemen, that you must make if you want to continue to be a reliable partner in the European Union. And we will look at you. Our path is clear: there is a positive moment in these resolutions. Yes, Pedro Sanchez has succeeded in putting sustainability, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, on the agenda. We look forward to the Commission's contribution. We want to move forward decisively. That is the way in which we can move Europe forward.

It’s a strain of socialism. So let’s not pretend: it’s a left-wing ideology; they want the same things as you. Let’s be quite clear. (Uproar) So Mr President, despite all that – you don’t like the truth, do you? – you don’t like that. Come on, it’s National Socialism. (Interjection from the floor: ‘Rubbish’) A lot happened – I’m saying – I’m telling you – it’s a left-wing ideology, OK? Don’t pretend. A lot happened in Brussels last week, and it is sometimes easy to forget that some of the things that happened were positive. As leader of one of the most pro free-trade Groups in the European Parliament, we welcome the signature of the trade, investment and partnership agreements with Singapore, just as we welcome the progress on the EU-Japan trade deal and the adoption of the Vietnam trade agreement. We also welcome the US Government’s push for agreements – the Trump administration’s push for agreements – with Japan, the EU and the UK. These developments, we believe, are a signal of a more outward-looking EU, a re-engaged USA, and a global Britain. However, it is difficult sometimes to convince the electorate when things are going in the right direction, when we had yet another summit with no clear outcome on migration or on Brexit – as you said, Ms Grossetête. Agreeing a withdrawal agreement may be complex, but many of us have been here long enough to know that there is no such thing as an impossible situation. We have seen time and time again the seemingly impossible become the possible, the inflexible become the flexible, the proverbial rabbit pulled out of the hat at the 11th hour for situations that have been described as ‘all or nothing’, such as a Danish opt-out, or Protocol 36 with the UK – legal experts managed to find unique solutions. In this case, either the seemingly impossible will become possible, or there will be no deal. Mrs May’s position on the backstop isn’t a negotiating position or a bluff: it is quite simply a Prime Minister defending the constitutional sovereignty and geographical borders of a nation of a hard-won peace, born through generations of violence and diplomacy. It was clear that, as leaders sat on the Grande Place sharing a joke and a drink, instead of continuing into the early hours of the morning, there was no real sense of urgency around reaching a deal at this Council Summit. So the sooner we start building our shared future, rather than fighting about our shared past – our joint past – the better for everyone. What we need to do is redouble our efforts to find compromises that address the concerns of both communities in Northern Ireland, not just the Nationalists and the Irish Government. Let us look again at indicative time limits, possible sunset clauses, declarations, protocols and technology away from borders that allows checks away from borders. Let’s look to the future, not cry over the past. The ECR believes that one way of regaining the confidence of the voters is a clear and united policy on the handling of the migration crisis. We welcome the fact that many of the policies now being discussed within the Council were policies proposed by the ECR Group at the peak of the crisis, such as speeding up processing returns; increasing funds and powers for Frontex; seeking enhanced arrangements with third countries to stem the flow of migrants; and allowing countries to contribute in other ways apart from only relocation. If these common-sense policies had been adopted sooner and not dismissed as simply anti-European or populist at the time, then maybe the system might be in better shape now. This is why the ECR Group doesn’t wish to see another national or European election go by, where Brussels dismisses the results or the legitimate concerns of its electorate in favour of policies which actually have not yet reached a real result. Instead, we should be asking countries how they are willing to help.

I want to tell you something. I think that what you did was not very wise, and that you have to apologise, in fact, because talking about Nazis as National Socialists and pointing a finger at the Socialist Group is an insult to all those Social Democrats who fought against Nazis, (Applause) and who died in concentration camps. I think that would be the best step from your side.  To Ms Grossetête, I say thank you very much for your comments. I think I agreed with you 100% – more even than when Manfred Weber takes the floor – and I think it is exactly the feeling of the House. Why was it necessary to have a European Council in October? Nothing has been decided – not on Brexit, that was expected; not on migration and the Dublin system, no progress; not on the eurozone governments, no progress. First of all, on Brexit, you know, we are now in the battle of the figures. Prime Minister May says 95% has been agreed. Michel Barnier says 90% is being agreed. I know that Britain has always had difficulties with the metric system, but I have to tell you one thing: whether it is 90% or 95% or 99%, if there is no solution for the Irish border, then as far as our Parliament is concerned it is zero per cent that has been agreed for the moment. We need an agreement on this Irish border, and the Good Friday Agreement has to be protected.  Nevertheless, I continue to be optimistic. I think that a deal can be reached in the coming weeks, in the interest of the Union and in the interest of the UK, and my question to you, Mr Tusk, is this: can you also make a decisive last push on citizens’ rights – that is, to offer unlimited onward movement for the British citizens who are living in the EU27, in exchange for a right of lifelong return to the UK for European citizens? I was in Downing Street, and they are ready to go for such a trade-off, and if you, with the Council, were to push for such a solution, it is a trade off that is possible. So do that at least, for our citizens, so that they have no negative fallout from this Brexit tragedy that we are living through today. (Applause) That brings me to the second point for the Council – namely migration. I will repeat, and I will say it not in French but in English, that I am very disappointed, as is Ms Grossetête. It is now four months since June when the Council promised that an enormous package would be delivered. The transformation, for example, of Frontex into a fully fledged European Border and Coast Guard with 10 000 new agents – no agreement in the Council on that. The reform of the Dublin system – it was two years ago that the Commission put the proposal on the table – again, no progress in the Council. Finally, my third complaint is about the lack of reform of the eurozone, including the Banking Union. It’s now more or less 10 years since the outbreak of the last financial crisis and we still have no governance system in place for the eurozone. Nevertheless, we all know that there could be a next crisis, and this time maybe not in tiny, sunny Greece but in the world’s eighth biggest economy, namely Italy. We have not a single pension fund or investment company in the whole world today that does not hold Italian bonds or securities. So, let there be no misunderstanding, I think that the attitude of the Italian Government in not following the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact is completely irresponsible. But, at the same time, I’m also saying that a big share of the responsibility rests on our shoulders in relation to the strategy that is coming up. Where is the new governance of the Economic and Monetary Union to avoid the sort of free-riding behaviour that the new Italian Government wants to engage in now? Where is the new Minister of Finance for the Eurozone, who could stop such behaviour? Where is the euro budget? Where are the euro securities and, more urgently – if, in the coming months or year, this sovereign debt crisis should become a banking crisis – where is the resolution fund? How are we going to avoid the next bankruptcy in the eurozone, not only of the Italian financial sector but also perhaps of the entire European financial sector? I really think that the attitude of your colleagues in the Council today is dereliction of duty: sleepwalking to a new financial catastrophe that everybody can see before their eyes. I have one ultimate question, Mr Tusk, it’s not a question directly to you my dear Donald, but you are responsible for it, and it concerns method. Is this really the method that will deliver: the government leaders coming together four times a year for two days, and looking forward to getting back again quickly to their capitals? I think the method is wrong. You need to lock them in a meeting room – no new clothes, no new underwear … (Comment from Mr Lambert ‘no food’) No food? No, that would be torture, that is something different, Mr Lambert. But it is necessary, Mr Tusk, that you change your method. I was with Jean Claude Juncker in Nice, and we worked for four days, and four nights until four o’clock in the morning, and we came out not with the best deal that we have ever done but at least having achieved something. Today we are in the middle of a migration crisis. We face a new financial tragedy in the eighth biggest economy of the world, in Italy, and our government leaders go home and say it was not possible to find an agreement on migration and on the Dublin system; it was not possible to put in place new governance for the eurozone. That has to change.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Tusk, I do not know if you are interested, but finally we can always talk. The Treaty on the European Union makes the European Council the body that gives the necessary impetus for the development of the Union and defines its general political priorities. The citizens of the Union are therefore entitled to expect some political leadership from the 28 heads of state and government that make up it. Between the climate change and the growing inequalities, the conflicts and persecutions at our borders, the terrorist threat, the impact of the digital revolution or the exorbitant power of multinationals, it is little to say that our Union faces existential challenges in a world where its friends are becoming scarce. This is probably why in October 2017 the European Council set up a programme of work called, somewhat pompously, 'The Leaders' Agenda'. A year later, where are we? We welcome the adoption last spring of the declaration on the European pillar of social rights. Although it is largely a statement of intent, it has the merit of recalling that human well-being is not just about maximizing the profits of a few. But other than that, we are still looking for the leadership of the European Council and its meeting last week provided, once again, a sad example. On the issue of Brexit, the 27 heads of state and government cannot be held responsible for the failure, we are facing here a British government entangled in its own contradictions and an Theresa May torn between members of her majority and her party. Until she decides this Gordian knot an agreement cannot be reached. But on the other issues, no excuses for the \"leaders\"! Let us take the issue of asylum and immigration: this subject may have been on the agenda of all European Council meetings for more than three years , with one exception - but the heads of state of the Member States are still unable to agree on a common approach to welcome asylum seekers to our continent with dignity. The only common ground at the moment is to discard their responsibilities to the neighbouring states of the European Union. It has been a year since this Parliament has been able to find, on the same issue, the political courage and creativity to propose common solutions in line with the values of the European Union, proof that a political agreement on this issue is indeed possible if there is political will. On the issue of monetary union, the heads of state and government have not advanced one iota. How many times will we have to repeat that an economic and monetary union is not viable - I repeat, not viable - without a fiscal union and therefore a fiscal union and without a social union. Here again, while tensions are revived by the Italian government's budgetary choices, the \"leaders\" remain in denial of reality. The ecologist I am would be tempted to ironise on CO2 emissions and the blockade of Brussels caused by yet another inconsequential European summit. But this lack of leadership is in fact not without consequences. It weakens the European Union every day in its ability to respond to the challenges of our time and undermines its credibility. One gets the impression that the conservatives, the Christian Democrats, the Social Democrats, the liberals who populate the Council are proving to be a little less able to understand these challenges every day and are taking refuge in a choreography without impact on reality. Is it any wonder, then, that an increasing number of our fellow citizens are choosing to find their questions elsewhere? Of course, with nationalists of all stripes, but also, and I welcome it, more and more with the environmentalists, as the recent elections in Bavaria, Belgium and Luxembourg have shown and, who knows, perhaps in a few days in Hesse.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "Verts/ALE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Greens and regionalists"}, {"id": 21, "date": "2018-10-24.json", "name": "Gabriele ZIMMER", "mepid": "28248", "text": "  Mr President, I would like to like to sanendour sto -- on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. Mr President, I would like to thank the Sorry, ladies and gentlemen, but I will return in my speech to the controversy of just now. Mr Kamall, I would really recommend to you: read Klemperer's diaries, read his treatise on the language of the Third Reich, \"LTI – Lingua Tertii Imperii\"! You will find that what happened there, namely misuse, reinterpreting terms, is not just a matter of the past and the manifestly flawed confrontation on your part with the history of Europe – which is why the European Union came into being after the devastating war of the last century – but that it is current today. Why my Social Democrat colleagues react in this way – and rightly – has something to do with the reconnection of the concept of National Socialist/national, and the fact that this is happening again. There are in our countries. There are people on the streets who are collecting weapons, who are ambushing foreigners, who are invading the left, who are murdering – in Europe, in our EU.  You must have understood this slowly, but you cannot have isolated yourself – on your island – from the history of Europe. They are one of them. That is what I had to tell you. It is not a recklessness to deal with these terms.  (Applause) It is not a recklessness, it is a political outcry that you have done here. I would like to say to you: please read, deal with things and, above all, see what is happening in our Member States! I now come to the summit. Much has been said about the way in which the summit went, what it brought. But at the end of the day, we still face one of the biggest challenges, both with Brexit in mind – Theresa May can say ten times: we are now at 90%, we are at 95%, we are at 97%, or at 99.5%. The crucial question is: is the British Government prepared to find a solution within the withdrawal agreement – the divorce agreement – which includes acceptance, respect for the Good Friday Agreement and avoids the rights it enshrines for the citizens of the north of Ireland and, at the same time, a hard border? Is it ready to finally stop playing with the fears of people in the UK, but also in the EU? What we are experiencing is a tragedy. I have the impression that people are deliberately aiming to arrive at the very last minute. This is British negotiating tactics. I can't tell if it's the pressure from the Brexiteers or from anyone else – from the government, from Parliament, from the street or anywhere else. All I can see is that there is no willingness to finally put anything on the table. It is the British themselves who say: do not interfere! We are responsible for ensuring that there is a solution for Northern Ireland. But they are not presenting it, and that is the point. There will be no agreement – I repeat here – unless the issue of Northern Ireland is resolved in the divorce agreement. I like to explain this again, like stubborn children. I would like to make one more comment to you, Mr Timmermans. You said earlier about the need to do our homework with regard to the budget. I would just like to say that, in my view, success does not depend on everyone doing their homework when the homework is wrong, when the homework is done to even the most willing pupils – and this is certainly not the case with Mr Salvini and Di Matteo – is not the case; but even the most willing students would not be able to achieve the class goal unless the homework was formulated differently.  In other words, you have just explained to us, for example, with the social pillar, how great everything is, how great we are on the way to finally agreeing this together. The fact is that we have an economic and monetary union, we have a financial union; but we do not have a social union. We don't have them. So please do not tell you something that is not true in reality and is not perceived by people. When we talk about why, for example, populists had such an influx, we have to question that. Then we have to question why people in Italy, in other countries, are more willing to look to Brussels than to actually elect a non-populist democratic government in this way.  I also call on my friends, who are here from Five Stars, to stop offering Mr Salvini this, not to be held responsible for a policy that they do not actually stand for at all.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "GUE/NGL", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Left-wing"}, {"id": 22, "date": "2018-10-24.json", "name": "Nigel FARAGE", "mepid": "4525", "text": "  on behalf of the EFDD Group. – Mr President, I think under Rule 164 of our revered procedures I am allowed to respond to the comments you made as President of Parliament, some of them personally insulting. Maybe you have a bit of a problem with your temper. I will ignore the personal comments you made about me, but I will say this: we do seem this morning to be struggling just a little bit with our history. To claim, Mr Tajani, that the European Union brought about the downfall of Nazism and Soviet Communism isn’t only laughable, it is very ungracious and deeply insulting to the United States of America, which made massive sacrifices so that Europe could be free twice in the 20th century, and – to a slightly lesser extent – the United Kingdom, as 30 000 British dead in Italy will attest. So you can claim what you want for the European Union, but please do not rewrite history.  Mr Tusk, I want to thank you for confirming that it was Theresa May who asked for the one—year extension to the transition period. I also want to thank you for your recent offer, saying that if Britain wants a Canada Plus—style trade deal, you are open to it. Indeed, it’s what I have campaigned for, for 25 years. I’ve always thought this was a better approach between our country and the EU than the one we currently have.  Now every proposal of course seems to founder on the question of the Irish border, but given the slight state of panic that German industry is now getting itself into – and maybe that’s not surprising because a WTO deal would lead not just to tariffs on German cars, but a weaker pound and probably a more competitive UK economy – the time has come to look for answers. The funny thing is the answers are staring at us. Not so long ago, Mr Juncker in the Irish Parliament made it very clear that there were no circumstances under which the European Union would impose a border. Indeed, even Mr Varadkar, the Irish PM, who is not usually particularly helpful in the Brexit process, has said that under no circumstances will there be a hard border. This Parliament produced a study by one of its own committees, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, entitled ‘Avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland for Customs control and the free movement of persons’.  The point is, there are solutions everywhere we look. The idea that somehow this border is an impediment is, frankly, a red herring. The problem, I’m afraid, is that there is a rogue element in these negotiations, a group of people who do not wish to see a solution, who put up an immovable brick wall to stop us from breaking free, and I regret to say that it isn’t your chief negotiator, Monsieur Barnier, but actually the British Civil Service and Olly Robbins’ team. They signed up years ago to the European dream. They’ve been happy to take their orders from Brussels. They are now out to sabotage Brexit. They are indeed the enemy within.  I think that unless the Conservative Party comes to its senses and gets rid of a leader who clearly is being led by the nose, then we will head to the December summit, we will head towards a humiliating sell-out, and we will head towards the United Kingdom being trapped in EU rules for many, many years to come.

Mr President, as a preamble, I would like to remind Mr Bullmann and a number of people who have been moved by Mr Kamall's comments that there is not a plenary session, not a plenary day where, in the ranks of the left or the liberals, we do not hear a torrent of insults and aggressive and outrageous remarks accusing us of extremism. , especially with regard to all those who, like our group, simply defend a different conception of Europe. We are in favour of freedom, including freedom of expression. You, you do not support, you do not bear that we can have a vision other than yours of European construction.  Last week's European Council dealt with three closely related topics: migration, internal security and external relations. In its final communiqué, it refers to the 'return directive' adopted by our Parliament in 2008. The problem is that in the first months of its implementation, two judgments of the Luxembourg Court of Justice have considerably reduced its scope. In the next paragraph, the text of the conclusions states that, I quote, more needs to be done to facilitate actual returns. The problem is that, not to mention the unfavourable judgments of both the European Court of Justice (ECJ) and the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), the countries from which illegal immigrants originate often refuse to issue consular passes.  Thus, while France has hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants on its soil, its government is unable to be respected. There are, it is true, some bilateral agreements between Spain and Morocco, for example, but they are all the less enforced because the European Union refuses to condition its financial aid on the effective control of migratory flows. Worse, last July, the Commission referred the case to the Luxembourg Court to have Hungary repeal its law against left-wing associations that help to set up illegal immigrants.

I believe that this is the best way to achieve something here. We have to get through this. The crucial point is that there is no common position in Britain in government, in the government faction and in the whole parliament and within the opposition. That is our basic difficulty. In other words, we have a partner with whom we cannot negotiate seriously, because there is no structure for that partner. I believe that the European Parliament has as a condition – as Mr Tajani has said: we must get a sensible solution for avoiding the hard Irish border, and we must make it clear that the unity of the internal market must be preserved. Let me make a second comment. The INF Treaty, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, has been concluded to make medium-range missiles impossible in Europe. That is why it is important, and it must be enforced. I find it intolerable that the American President should quit without consultation and cooperation with the Europeans and now mix this up with China. We must stand up together to save this, so that we do not get new medium-range missiles in Europe, regardless of which side. Even if we then have to talk clearly with Russia that they must not do that. Third point, in short, populism is picking up the issues that can be used in populist terms. I sometimes have the impression that we are not making progress on migration, because some people do not want to solve the migration issue, but need it as an issue in order to impose their positions politically and to use them in a populist way. However, I would also like to say here that we Europeans have secured this peace for 70 years, Mr Farage, that this Europe was built in cooperation with the United Kingdom and the United States, and that europe has helped to achieve the defeat of the great totalitarian regime from Moscow through Europe.

We do, of course, have many external challenges but something that we know for sure is that we need to strengthen internal cohesion among Europeans and the recipe for this is very clear. We need to address social inequalities by fully implementing the social pillar and we need to support investment into the future. We still do not have all the necessary means. At the heart of this you have a historic task, which is to complete, reform and rebalance the economic and monetary union. We have all the proposals on the table. We need the political will to complete the banking union, to reform the European Stability Mechanism and to create a budget capacity in the euro area in order to support Member States to invest in the future. Let me give you a concrete case. I come from Portugal, which is recognised today as a country which is making a real effort to go beyond blind austerity and to make a real recovery and a real effort to change. But now we are stuck. We cannot go forward unless the economic and monetary union is properly reformed. These kinds of cases must be supported because, if they are not supported, you will start having cases like Italy in other places in Europe. This is the choice that the European Council is confronted with.

You just seem to think, ‘OK, I have to sit through this, but at least I can go for lunch afterwards.’ Nobody seems to be feel responsible here. You are the co-legislator, but the Council has become a completely dysfunctional body. It’s a bit like the Bermuda Triangle of politics: you put proposals in there and they disappear, never to be seen again. It is total paralysis. You know what? It’s not just that the Council is totally unable to solve any crisis at all; the Council has become the crisis. And I dare to say more: the Council, in its current paralysis, is a threat to the future of the European Union. You have to ask yourself, as President of the Council, Mr Tusk, ‘Am I going to assume my responsibility for the European Union or am I just going to enjoy this job for as long as it lasts?’ It is about time that the government leaders understood that they are also European politicians; they have a responsibility for this continent, for the European Union, and they cannot content themselves with travelling to Brussels or Salzburg or whatever, having a photo opportunity and then agreeing not to decide anything, because I don’t think it’s even an inability to decide anything – it’s deliberate. The government leaders don’t want to decide anything. They are quite happy keeping everything that they have. But what they don’t seem to understand is that by not deciding anything, they cannot keep things as they are, because the world keeps turning – they cannot stop it. Finally, on the asylum package: it is an absolute disgrace that after three years’ deliberation, there is still no decision. Go back and do your homework, Mr Tusk. Skip lunch today.

The goal of including a protocol or not in Ireland in the withdrawal agreement is to protect the Good Friday Agreement by avoiding a hard border and by ensuring that there will be no diminution of rights for the citizens in the north. This protocol will be used as a backstop to protect the Good Friday Agreement in case the future relationship does not solve the issue. We propose the participation of Northern Ireland in the Single Market and the Customs Union for goods through regulatory alignment. But this solution cannot be extended to the whole of the UK, as Westminster would like, precisely because the UK’s government majority in Westminster – of which the Democratic Unionist Party is a key element – does not accept any differential solution for Northern Ireland, since this would create a border in the Irish Sea. The Commission remains open to discussing other proposals to secure a backstop solution for Northern Ireland in the withdrawal agreement, but at the moment the UK has not presented any alternatives. Unfortunately, we didnʼt achieve any agreement at the political level. In any case, we support the position of the Commission on the need to include the backstop in the withdrawal agreement; on the proposal itself; on the fact that we are open to discussing other proposals if the UK comes up with something reasonable.

Mr Juncker and Mr Timmermans have been full of bonhomie in their personal style, but the content of their politics has brought the EU into constant conflict with democratically-elected national governments. The latest victim is Italy, whose governing coalition has been told its economic policies – for which it has a mandate – are unacceptable to the Brussels commissars. What was it that Mr Juncker famously said? ‘There can be no democratic choice against the European Treaties’. So from the moment the Commission was chosen as the EU negotiator for Brexit, it’s been determined not to agree a velvet divorce and continued friendship but to administer a public punishment to the British people for daring to vote for a future away from the constraints of European Union law. It’s not been motivated by a desire to keep trading ties smooth with its largest customer. It’s shown no understanding of the character of our island nation, inhabited by the proud descendants of those who saved the countries of continental Europe twice in the 20th century.

Once again, it was also not possible to respond to Parliament's asylum package. Not a word about the essential reform of Dublin or the creation of legal entry.

There is a real political war going on between those who want to stop illegal migration and those who want to manage and legalise it. Ideological warfare is being carried out by Hungary and Poland, by Viktor Orban, by Guy Verhofstadt, by Emmanuel Macron and his allies by Matteo Salvini's Italy.  Nevertheless, the Austrian Presidency and Sebastian Kurz's proposal for mandatory solidarity are heading in a positive direction. The debate will continue at the forthcoming Summit in December and it is hoped that elections in May next year will bring about a breakthrough in the UNION's migration policy.

We are close to an agreement, but at the same time what is missing is a decisive and indispensable component of a deal. We reiterate that without a backstop for the Irish border, the European Parliament will not give its consent to the withdrawal agreement. We are not demanding a border in the Irish Sea but a simple, decentralised, mostly immaterial fall-back mechanism which shall not pose any challenge to the integrity of the United Kingdom, and we stand open to consider solutions like a longer transition and a UK-wide customs union, which will make the likelihood of using such a backstop remote. In this respect, we fully share the overall stance expressed by President Tusk and Michel Barnier. We are calm, open, constructive but very firm on principles, such as the right of citizens, the integrity of the Single Market, the protection of the Good Friday Agreement, and of course our arms are and will always be open if the UK changes its mind. The lack of progress on the completion of economic and monetary union is a great responsibility of the Member States. Those who do not understand that we desperately need to complete the banking union, to establish a European unemployment benefits scheme, to make tech giants pay their fair share of taxes and to enhance our investment capacity are making a big mistake. A special mention has to go to the cynical irresponsibility of the Italian Government, which is challenging the very logic of any common rule and is doing this not to support growth and jobs but to pay with the money and the savings of Italian citizens for its electoral campaign, giving amnesty to tax evaders and paving the way for further austerity, making any battle for a better eurozone and more risk-sharing more difficult.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 64, "date": "2018-10-24.json", "name": "James NICHOLSON", "mepid": "1318", "text": "   – Madam President, I have listened this morning with a degree of trepidation to what I have heard.

We need to make progress on these issues very quickly. One sentence on the historical topic that just played out – the debate on the left and the right. National socialism and communism are two horrific totalitarian dictatorships that have resulted in millions of casualties, and we must condemn both dictatorships and pay tribute to all who have died. Go back to Brexit. Both sides - both Britain and the European Union - are losing out on Brexit. I see that in recent times the civilian pressure in britain for a second citizens' survey is growing and I hope this will happen to prevent this folly, which is Brexit.

Stage one – with international airports and maritime borders.  Europe is safer when it is united. Bulgaria and Romania will make Schengen safer and more stable – this is the assessment around which both the Commission and Parliament and all the security experts involved are coming together.

That's bad, because the dispute is finally on the meaning of the concept of sovereignty. Second observation: on the proposal that the distribution of refugees be replaced by a financial contribution. Although, at first glance, it seems a breakthrough in relations within the Union, it is still a bad thing.  From a human rights point of view, the proposal is simply immoral. From the point of view of the Treaties, it cannot be required for a State to receive foreign populations, so the distribution is null and void.

This past week truly was Brexit in a nutshell.  It was indeed disappointing that a deal could not be reached. However, Michel Barnier has the full confidence and support, and indeed gratitude, of Ireland and the rest of the EU27. Progress has been made and I am confident that a deal can be reached, including the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, and the avoidance of a hard border on the island of Ireland. From my meetings this week with Michel Barnier and United Kingdom Permanent Representatives, I think this will be achieved at the 11th hour. On the Irish backstop, let me be perfectly clear. Ireland will listen to all proposals that the United Kingdom brings forward, but any proposal, in order to be acceptable, has to be legally operative and ensure that we avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. It has to protect the integrity of the single market and the customs union, and it has to apply unless and until we have a new relationship that supersedes it. We cannot allow uncertainty about the border and its impact on the peace process to persist beyond the United Kingdom’s withdrawal. This is something I would expect the hard Brexiteers to be conscious of, given the fact that they are part of the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland is in the United Kingdom. A deal is essential.

It is a pity that sufficient progress has not been reached but I still believe that in the weeks to come we will find a good agreement. It is essential that the EU27 keeps together as one and that we defend the clear interest of our members, especially of our Irish colleagues. Secondly, let me talk a little bit on taxation, as I am coming just for negotiation of the report of the Committee on Financial crimes, tax evasion and tax avoidance (TAX3). This is an area in which the EU can bring enormous benefits for EU citizens. If we solve the outstanding issues in the tax regimes, this will bring better and fair competition to the market and we will gain the trust of our citizens and, at the same time, this will allow countries to reduce some taxes which are the most damaging for the economy. There are many very important files on the table, especially CCCTB, CCTB, VAT reform and digital tax. While the Council was able to reach some progress on some tax files, it seems to me that there is not sufficient progress on these dossiers and this is a great pity; it is a lost opportunity for Europe. Last, but not least, let me talk about migration. The number of irregular migrants has gone down. Unfortunately, it seems to me that the efforts of the Member States to find agreement and make Europe more ready and better prepared for such a crisis in the future are also fading away and that is a very bad thing. We must get ready for future problems and we must solve the issues that we have been discussing for the last three years. So, also in this area, let me urge the Council to move forward.

Thank you.  What I would also like to say – because what was said this morning has really affected me emotionally – it’s not so much the comparison that is made or the putting of social democracy in one group with Nazism. That’s not new. This is what we’ve seen happening – just go on the Internet – for years on the extreme right, where they try and rid themselves from their own heritage by saying that Nazism belongs to the left or to social democracy. That’s not new. What is new to me is that the leader in this House of the party of Churchill and Thatcher would appropriate that narrative. What has happened to the Conservative Party that not so long ago – in the last 10 years – was still a member of the European People’s Party (EPP) in this Parliament? What has happened that they are now using the same narrative that Mr Farage and others have been using for many years, a narrative that they’ve always distanced themselves from? Has what Churchill predicted when he talked about appeasers happened – the only thing you get by feeding a crocodile is that the crocodile will eat you last? Has the Conservative Party finally been eaten by UKIP? I hope not.  (Interjection from the floor: ‘I hope so’) I’m sure you hope so, yes, but I do hope not. I say this because I will make no secret of my deep admiration and affection for the United Kingdom and everything it has achieved during European history. I say this also because I don’t want to hide my deep sadness regarding the decision taken by the British people in the referendum to leave the European Union. The European Union is not a market. The European Union is an instrument to help European people solve their differences around the negotiating table instead of at the battlefield. The European Union is the best guarantee that no British soldiers will have to be sent to battlefields in Europe again, as they have so valiantly done in our common history. The European Union is the best guarantor for peace in Europe for the ages to come, and for one of the biggest Member States to leave that European Union is an incredibly sad moment. I want to say that in this House, but, given that decision, we are all under an obligation to do as little harm as possible in the process. As a democrat, as a human being, who in this House has never ever changed their minds on anything? We’ll leave that with the British people. That’s not for us to judge. But I want us to be clear about our obligation as the Commission, European Parliament and Council: that we should do everything in our power to make sure we do as little harm as possible. That is the attitude with which the Commission should do this. This will not be helped by exaggerated political rhetoric, by appealing to the darkest angels of European history. Let’s have a rational debate, let’s understand that we build bridges – not walls – in this European Union. Let’s be clear about that.  I want to end with a quote from one of my favourite writers, Primo Levi. I say this because of what was said this morning. I quote: ‘Auschwitz is outside of us, but it is all around us, in the air. The plague has died away, but the infection still lingers and it would be foolish to deny it. Rejection of human solidarity, obtuse and cynical indifference to the suffering of others, abdication of the intellect and of moral sense to the principle of authority, and above all, at the root of everything, a sweeping tide of cowardice, a colossal cowardice which masks itself as warring virtue, love of country and faith in an idea.’ (Applause)", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 1, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 84, "date": "2018-10-24.json", "name": "Frans TIMMERMANS", "mepid": "129141", "text": "   President of the European Council. – Mr President, thank you for your interesting interventions. I really appreciate your involvement, even if I don’t agree with all your arguments and emotions. You may have noticed that I never try to take too much of your precious time, and today I will also stick to this rule. However, I cannot leave two interventions without a comment. First, on migration. Almost all of you have expressed your disappointment with the lack of decisions on migration policy that you were expecting from the European Council. I understand your dissatisfaction, because I know that the will of the majority in this House was to establish mandatory quotas. In spite of what you are saying, the European Council is building the common European solution for migration policy. But in the centre of this approach is the strengthening of cooperation with third countries, a fight against human smugglers, external border protection – and not mandatory quotas. The real progress in the European Council is that today, almost everybody understands that our priority should be stopping the inflow of irregular migrants and not their distribution. On Brexit, we want to avoid a hard border in Ireland, but there is no guarantee that we can do it. And do you know why, Mr Farage? Because Brexit is de facto a political decision to re-establish the border between the Union and the UK. Brexit is a project to separate the UK from the EU.

The multinational Alcoa wants to close its two floors in Spain, in Avilés and in A Coruña, leaving hundreds of workers on the street. This company has received more than 1 billion euros in public aid and has acknowledged that the closure is due to the company not having invested a single euro in modernizing these plants. Yesterday, at the beginning of the negotiation, Alcoa proposes that she refuses to sell the factories, which she wants to close. Why? Because, coincidentally, where you have invested the money is in a factory in Saudi Arabia and what you do not want is to have any kind of competition; because, while receiving this aid with money from the Spanish state, he invested it in Saudi Arabia. That's why I'm going to ask you for two things. First of all, I don't care about the political group, I don't care what country they belong to, I ask for the utmost support to protect European industry, our workers and our communities.

Mr Tusk, I would like to hear you say that our heads of government have considered a migration policy 'in all its aspects'. I have read the Council conclusions and I see only three elements in them: cooperation with North Africa against illegal migration, tackling people smuggling and return. Important things, of course, but are these ALL aspects of a migration policy? What was it about addressing the root causes of migration? Short asylum procedures? Distribution? Resettlement? And above all: what was it about the dramatic situation in the hotspots? These elements were discussed in 2015 and 2016, and it is not because you are silent about them that the problems have disappeared.  I would also like to draw your note to the letter of 10 October which the rapporteurs of Parliament sent to Mr Kurz. Two and a half years after the Commission published seven reform proposals, the Council has not yet reached an agreement on any. Three provisional agreements with Parliament were even withdrawn.

Secondly, I welcome the strong emphasis on security in cyberspace and the call for the possibility of imposing sanctions on those involved in cyber attacks on Europeans or our infrastructure. The answer to such flagrant violations of our online security must be firm. Defence capabilities in this area should also be further worked on at a rapid pace.  It is also an important step to call for concrete action to combat disinformation and the possibility of manipulating social sentiment in Europe.

Now in fairness, this is an attitude common to almost every organisation. Any bureaucracy over time becomes primarily interested in its own aggrandisement. Its primary purpose becomes to spend more on itself and its notional stated purpose becomes secondary – if you’re lucky.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, ten years have now passed since the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, and it is therefore necessary to take stock of the current situation in the EU. Economic and social data do not lie and tell us that today we are worse off than we were ten years ago, with unemployment rising, wealth falling and the debt-to-GDP ratio amplified by more than twenty percentage points over ten years. This is the reality of the numbers, but beyond these clear macro-indicators is the reality of daily life, which shows that citizens are increasingly in difficulty and how much differences and mistrust between the countries of the Union are also exacerbated, resurrecting and reinforcing feelings of fear and mutual mistrust that we believed had long been buried. It is clear that the Treaty and the EU have failed in their objectives: there is no prosperity, there is no economic cohesion, there is no social or territorial cohesion, no much-vaunted solidarity between countries. It is not surprising, moreover, that one of the objectives enshrined in the Treaty is to have a highly competitive social and market economy. How has this principle been translated into practice? This has resulted in the sacrifice of young people, workers and pensioners to the preserve of leniate neoliberal policies. There have therefore been youth unemployment, wage cuts and pension cuts – the only recipes brussels has been able to impose on the Member States. Over the past ten years, the Treaty and the EU have not been able to give a concrete answer to the three major problems facing European citizens today: the enforcement economic crisis, the internal security crisis and border protection against illegal immigration. Not only has nothing been done, but European recipes have even made the situation worse. I wonder how the European Union can improve the situation if a democratically elected government cannot even establish its own economic measures but must always be blackmailed by one or other EU Commissioner, who, having failed at home, now wants to decide at home. I wonder what power Junker, Dombrovskis or Moscovici have in deciding the future and hopes of millions of young people, workers, pensioners and the unemployed in Italy and elsewhere. The arrogance with which you want to continue on a vision of a centralizing Union, with more and more powers and competences taken away from national governments, is leading Europe to collapse. Perhaps it is appropriate to get out of your head the mantra of 'more Europe' than 'there is no alternative', which for you is the solution to all the problems but which in reality was only the sublimation of an undemocratic system to the detriment of the freedoms of the citizens and peoples of Europe. I ask you if you have ever wondered why, when European citizens were allowed to give their opinion directly on EU-related issues, the outcome was often quite different from what you expected. The latest Eurobarometer says that less than half of Italians see benefits in the EU but 60 % support this government that you oppose. What do you want to do? Respect democracy and the freedoms of peoples or take them away from them once and for all?  For you, the hands of history are now inexorable. Those who supported this failed idea of Europe will be wiped out by the popular vote. For many years in these classrooms you have ostracized, mocked, mutilated us. We're going to get our revenge in May.

I was waiting for Mr Zanni to go onto the Lisbon Treaty. He went onto many things, very interestingly, but not onto the Lisbon Treaty. I will stick to my brief anyway.  The Treaty is a reflection of what Member States collectively want and require from the EU. They have come together and pooled sovereignty because they see there are challenges that no one Member State can address acting alone. As Jean-Claude Juncker said in the State of the Union address this year, and I quote: ‘European sovereignty is born of Member States’ national sovereignty and does not replace it. Sharing sovereignty – when and where needed – makes each of our nation states stronger.’ End of quote.  Too often the discussion on sovereignty is a pretext for the question of how we can stop things, but the real question we should ask is: how can we act effectively and legitimately in the face of challenges or crises? I also want to react to some of the things Mr Zanni said. There is no imposition. Every single Member State has signed and ratified the Treaty. You can’t afterwards say, ‘I’ve signed and ratified, but I will not apply the Treaty’. We are based on the rule of law and that means that this Union can only function if we can accept that those who sign and ratify the Treaty also apply the Treaty. If we have a problem with that, the Commission can intervene and at the end of the day, it’s the Court of Justice that will rule on this. That is the essence of how we constructed the European Union after the Second World War. Creating the impression that this is an imposition from outside is, I think, fooling your own people and it is irresponsible. It can create a certain feeling of ‘we’re being dictated to from outside’, but it is not a reflection of reality, and it is also hiding away your own responsibility. You have a responsibility vis-à-vis your colleagues in the Council, vis-à-vis the European Parliament, vis-à-vis the Commission, but you certainly have a responsibility vis-à-vis your own signature, your own ratification, and I think we should be talking about that more.  I also believe that if you look at the number of Treaty changes we have seen over the years, you see that, given the complexity of the challenges and the complexity of working together and having to tackle issues no Member State can tackle on its own, the need for decision through qualified majority voting (QMV) has increased. I hope we can use the coming time to look into areas where QMV can be increased, especially in foreign policy. If you have to take decisions on international human rights, or if you have to take decisions on commercial issues, I think QMV could be a helpful instrument. Again, and I come from a country where the temptation of thinking that the veto was the best thing you had has sort of waned. People understand that a veto can only give you the instrument to stop something temporarily, but it doesn’t give you the opportunity to act, to actually do something proactively, and so I think the discussion of QMV will have to move forward.  On issues such as taxation, there is no way we can muster enough strength against the huge corporations that can negotiate tax deals with individual Member States that de facto mean they don’t pay any taxes if we don’t do this at the European level. We need to do this at the European level, and for that I think QMV would be important as well. I also want to mention briefly the task force on subsidiarity and proportionality that Jean-Claude Juncker created last year. Yesterday in the Commission work programme, we set out in broad terms how we believe the task force needs to respond to the questions that were put on the table by Member States, by national parliaments and by other stakeholders such as regional and local authorities. We will prepare this for the Bregenz conference that will take place soon. The core of the issue is that we need to make sure that all those who in the end have to work with legislation are also involved in preparing the legislation, helping us to evaluate the legislation, to make sure that we avoid duplication, to make sure that we avoid unnecessary complexity. It is now also my experience that the issue is not, in general, should competences be returned from the EU level to Member States? We've challenged everyone to give us some examples, and the examples are few and far between, but not really very concrete.  The real issue we need to tackle is: how do we legislate? How do we do this? Can we not do this in a way that is less complex, that will help local and regional authorities to have ownership of these processes? Where can we evaluate existing legislation to make sure that we take out what is no longer necessary etc.? We should get out of this logic that the only thing we could do is do less. We need to do things Europe needs to do, and we need to stop doing things that are nice to do. We only need to do what we need to do. I believe that if we start from that premise, we will understand that there is a tremendous amount we still need to do, and I couldn’t end my intervention without referring to the momentous decision this Parliament took today to embrace the plastic strategy. It is now up to the Council to do something that a vast majority of Europeans want us to do, and they want us to do it now.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 157, "date": "2018-10-24.json", "name": "Danuta Maria HÜBNER", "mepid": "96779", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, I will speak on the Lisbon Treaty as well. I believe that it has brought immense progress to the functioning of the EU in terms of efficiency, democracy and also transparency. But it maintained and enhanced the system of intergovernmental policy coordination, which was very different from the Community method, and for many of us this has been a disappointment. As a result, important policy decisions and actions are based on the voluntary commitment of Member States, with all its consequences. We saw during the time of ‘polycrisis’ that this working method does not work when key challenges are at stake.  The Committee on Constitutional Affairs has proposed – and the whole House accepted when voting through a series of reports last year – the logic to first explore fully the potential of the Lisbon Treaty and only then to reflect on the changes to the Treaty that would be necessary to attain desiderata the boundaries of the Treaty of Lisbon do not allow to be pursued. But we all know that today unanimity makes Treaty revision virtually impossible. There is a long list of issues on which the Union has moved forward, building on the unexploited treaty potential – PESCO is a recent example here – but the list regarding unused Treaty potential remains even longer: the passerelle clause that has never been used; the European Parliament’s right of inquiry and its right of legislative initiative; reinforcement of the rule of law framework; transparency of Council legislative decision—making; and accession to the ECHR.  Without doubt, within the Lisbon Treaty framework, we can move forward on completing reforms of the EMU. All we need is the political will. In this House we have called for the use of QMV in the Council, but also for the general use of the ordinary legislative procedure. Eventually all decisions, including on the MFF, should be taken by QMV, even if a very high one in some particular cases.  So yes, indeed, we can clearly use the existing unexploited potential of the Lisbon Treaty to improve the governance of the Union and its institutional set—up. I believe that this will make the Treaty of Lisbon more relevant to the challenges that our policy—making will face in the years to come.

We hear a lot about false news these days, but really, this is a false narrative. Just look at the facts: this Union, its central administration, the Commission, has fewer employees than the city of Leeds in my constituency. Its budget is scarcely 2% of public spending – 98% is national. No legislation can be adopted without the approval of both this elected Parliament and national ministers – members of national governments, accountable to national parliaments – meeting in the Council. It’s not actually possible for this Union to act in areas that the Member States don’t want it to act in. It’s in those areas where we need joint action.  I was Parliament’s rapporteur on the Lisbon Treaty. It was a series of reforms to make the Union work better and to improve its accountability, a series of reforms that needed the grand slam of ratification by every single Member State to get through, so again, a very high level of consensus about it. What did it do? Firstly, it made our Union work better. As Mr Timmermans has mentioned already, more majority voting, fewer vetoes, but a qualified majority still needs a very high threshold in the Council. It has allowed the European Council to choose who chairs its meetings, instead of having a Buggins’ turn rotation with a new President every second meeting. It allowed us to have one external representative – the High Representative – instead of two as we used to. It rationalised our work, but it also made the Union more accountable. Prior scrutiny by national parliaments – every legislative proposal goes to them first. They have an eight-week period to look at it before we begin on it.

It is therefore the first time that the Commission has been in a state of interest. Note, in the whole Treaty of Lisbon, it is not said that the Union should serve the people, it serves itself.

Completely independent of the citizens of the Member States, of normal people. It explicitly states: \"The Commission carries out its functions in complete independence. Members of the Commission shall neither request nor take instructions from any government, body, body, office or agency.\". This means that the Commission is completely cut off from the people. A political system that disregards people's interests is considered an authoritarian system. Some argue that, after all, the Member States decide what the Commission is allowed to do.  Council: in the Treaty of Lisbon, Article 4 of the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Parliament and the Council adopted a directive on the implementation of the Lisbon Treaty. 3 states: \"Member States shall facilitate the performance of their tasks and shall refrain from any action which might jeopardise the achievement of the Union's objectives.\" So states must not promote their own interests and those of their citizens in the Union. At this point, I will quote the President of the European Commission, Mr Juncker.

The House of Representatives decided that the people were too stupid to have an informed opinion and the major parties, including Commissioner Timmermans, ignored the outcome.  The Netherlands joined the Lisbon Treaty in a single vote. That was illegal, because contrary to the Dutch constitution, but yes, everything for the Good Cause, right? A decade later, the population appears to have been visionary. The EU has pulled everything towards it. The Netherlands is not about anything anymore. No more about border security, no more about migration, not about his own government budget, not about free political discussions on the Internet.

All the institutions are democratically legitimised – through the election of the citizen, the election of this House or the election of national parliaments on the Council side. This also applies in particular to the Commission; There is nothing to interpret. In some areas, we have more rights on these issues than some national parliaments, and that should not be discussed away. It serves people, it benefits, it creates jobs, it avoids crises, it helps to deal with problems. We have overcome the 2008 financial crisis and no one has gone bankrupt – with solidarity. We need to improve the instruments. To do this, we need greater decision-making and more codecision skills. That is why the Passerelle must be used. That is why the Council must also act here. I consider that the Council's behaviour today is contrary to the Treaty. Even in those areas where majority voting is foreseen, the principle of consensus is agreed and majority voting is not used. I consider this to be contrary to the Treaty. The time will come when we must complain that the Treaty is not being used to bring about the capacity to act – the capacity for action that we need so that we can solve today's problems – with migration, internal and external security, climate change and many other issues – to the better situation of our citizens. Citizens expect Europe to be more capable of acting. That is the main reason for the criticism of Europe today that we are not delivering. To achieve this, we need improved decision-making structures that are possible in the Treaty of Lisbon. I believe that we should make greater use of this in an increased way.

Let’s be fair: when we focus on the Treaty, the Treaty has involved important progress when it comes to democracy. First of all, the fact that this Parliament has extended co—decision in many, many new areas. This is really deepening European democracy. Second, the Lisbon Treaty could pool sovereignty where this is needed: when we address climate change; when we negotiate trade agreements; when we affirm our monetary sovereignty. In all these areas we need stronger European sovereignty. This does not go against national sovereignty. This is to strengthen our control of the situation.  I am now addressing the part of Parliament and those Members of the European Parliament who are taking a position against the European Union and the treaties of the European Union. You are wrong. This is not the problem, and the solution is not to withdraw from the treaties. The solution is to change policies in favour of more economic and social convergence and more tax fairness.

But if you look at Europe today, the challenges we face are global challenges and the one question you can ask your citizens – and I am sure of the answer you’ll get – is, do you honestly think you can face the migration challenge on your own as a Member State? Do you honestly think nationalism is an answer to the challenges of economic change in the fourth industrial revolution? Do you honestly believe that being on your own will make you stronger in facing the challenges of President Putin or the challenges of a President Trump, who wants to change the international system? Do we honestly believe we will be stronger on our own? I don’t think there is a constituency anywhere in a Member State that truly believes that, and I’m afraid the British people today are learning this the hard way. I believe that if we take that as a starting point, the way we transform our rules, the way we apply the Treaty to face these challenges and to come up with real results for our citizens, is going to determine whether we’ll get support for this. I think debates about abstract notions such as sovereignty are distracting people or they are causing alarm.  I do maintain that you can have a theoretical approach to sovereignty and to saying I want national sovereignty. Theoretically, technically, yes, national sovereignty, but I think it was Michael Heseltine who said that ‘a man alone in the desert is sovereign [too]’. He dies of thirst but he’s sovereign. Sovereignty should also be a material issue. Does it give you the power to act and to change things the way your citizens want things changed? Then the answer will be very clear: only if we act collectively can we shape the world according to the values we share in a world that is changing so fast. I wish that could be the starting point of our discussion about what we need in a treaty.  There are still ample opportunities in the existing Lisbon Treaty to move ahead.

Mr President, Madam President, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Oettinger, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur and the rapporteur, Commissioner Oettinger, for the work she has done on this report. As a former Member of this House, I know all too well that the European Parliament is currently in a very labour-intensive phase. Parliament is currently working at full speed to launch a large number of other pieces of legislation before the elections. I would all the more like to thank you, as President of the European Court of Auditors, for the time you have taken here in plenary for the debate on our annual report. We have presented our annual report to give you our assessment of the state of financial management of the European Union in 2017. This means that the discharge procedure is now formally initiated, the last in this parliamentary term. For 2017, as in previous years, we conclude that the EU's annual accounts give a true and fair view of the financial situation of the European Union. As last year, we are giving a limited and not a failed opinion on the regularity of the payments underlying the 2017 financial statements. In other words, a significant proportion of the 2017 expenditure we are looking at does not have a significant error rate. I am referring to expenditure based on payment entitlements, i.e. expenditure on programmes where beneficiaries receive payments if they meet certain conditions. These claims-based payments accounted for more than half of all payments from the EU budget in 2017. In addition, irregularities in EU expenditure have also continued to fall. The estimated error rate for payments in 2017 was 2.4%, down from 3.1% in 2016 and 3.8% in 2015. This shows that the Financial Management of the European Union is clearly moving in the right direction, thanks – and I should like to make this quite clear here – to the continuing joint efforts of the Commission, the European Parliament, the Member States, but also the Court of Auditors. Let me give a positive example of direct payments under the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund, which accounts for a very large part of the relevant MFF heading. For these direct payments, we concluded that they no longer have a significant error rate.  At this point, however, I would also like to point out that there is often enough information available to prevent, detect and correct a significant proportion of the errors we have detected. If this information had been used by the Commission or the national authorities, an even larger part of the European budget would have recorded an error rate below the materiality threshold of the Court and the Commission. In short, what we discovered could have been discovered by others. Ladies and gentlemen! Now is the time to go one step further. The management and control systems have improved – for us, as the Court of Auditors, this is now an opportunity to make these improvements available for our audits.  For 2017, we have tested a different approach in the area of cohesion. The most important change was that we reviewed and tracked inspections and inspections previously carried out by the expenditure authorities. With this new approach, we, as MEPs, want to provide you, as MEPs, with better geographical and fund-specific insights for the whole of the European Union in a cost-effective way. In the coming years, we will also extend this approach to other areas of expenditure, provided – and I stress this explicitly – the necessary conditions are met, i.e. the data available to us also have sufficient reliability.  Mr. President! I have read with great interest the survey results of the Parlameter 2018 that you have recently published. Certainly, I am optimistic about the future to see that membership of the EU and the euro has strong support – among the majority of the citizens of the European Union. At the same time, however, there are also large discrepancies in support – depending on the country. Both annual budgets and the Union's long-term budgeting are distribution instruments. Decisions in this regard often involve political complications for those Member States which, in their opinion, have 'gone badly away'. Whatever political decisions, it is important for us at the Court of Auditors to ensure that the the citizens of the Union – whether in Bucharest, Helsinki, Lisbon, Berlin or Paris – can get their own picture of this and can therefore be confident that EU funds have been used not only properly, but also sensibly. We call this process \"performance audit\" or performance audit, and I can assure you that you will see an increasing number of these exams in the coming months and years. This is a direction that has been consistently pointed to by the Court in the many discussions that I have had in this House, but also in many national capitals, and I think that is a very important task. Ladies and gentlemen! The Court has shown that various Member States are having difficulties in using the European Structural and Investment Funds in a good and timely manner. In this respect, it is to be welcomed that the Commission has proposed a series of measures for the next financial framework, which should contribute to a better use of cohesion funds.  In the coming days, we will publish our detailed opinion on the relevant legislation. At the same time, the European budget remains under severe pressure, given the level of payments to which the EU has committed itself in the coming years. These so-called outstanding commitments, or RAL, are expected to increase even further by the end of 2020. We believe it is essential that this growing volume of outstanding commitments should be the main focus of the next multiannual financial framework. The total budget of the European Union represents only about 1% of the gross national income of the european Union as a whole. It is important that the funds of the European budget are used effectively. At the same time, however, we must realistically assess what can be achieved with the funds entrusted to us. The European Union can only win or retain the confidence of its citizens if it actually fulfils the expectations it has raised. We must prove to our citizens that the European Union can deliver on its commitments efficiently and in a way that actually makes a difference.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 190, "date": "2018-10-24.json", "name": "Klaus-Heiner LEHNE", "mepid": "2224", "text": "   Mr. The Commission. Mr President, Mr Lehne, Member of the Court of Lazarou, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. In the context of the Commission's annual accountability, the annual report of the European Court of Auditors plays an important role in the discharge procedure. We are grateful for the expert, objective assessment presented by the Court for the 2017 financial year and the Commission's accounts to us today. In fact, I believe that we can present good results to Parliament, the Council and the Court in terms of budget implementation and clearance of accounts, in the use of our budgetary resources. The Court of Auditors therefore also confirms improvements in financial management, and the error rate it estimates is lower than ever.  I want to make a contribution to continuing to learn from the experience and constructive critical advice of the Court and Parliament and the Council, and thus not at the end of a good development in the management of the budget. The annual report shows that we are transparent in the implementation of the budget. An unqualified opinion of the Court on the reliability of the annual accounts has now been issued for the eleventh time in a row. The Court recognises that the budget is an important instrument for achieving Europe's political objectives and that it helps – the budget – to achieve real added value in the interests of our citizens.  In addition to our traditional long-standing tasks, such as the common European agricultural policy, such as the still important cohesion policy, we have set priorities in the area of infrastructure and the development of efficient cross-border infrastructure across the continent over the past year. We have funded more important projects in research than ever before, and we have tried to tackle the migration task that has become a priority over the last three years, not only politically but also financially. We believe that the European budget will deliver concrete and good results for our citizens and have been achieved in the last year. The Commission also continues to see a focus of its budget implementation on keeping the risk of errors under control and further reducing it. This is about errors in the Commission and mistakes on the ground. Our aim is to make mistakes avoidable in the first place, so that they do not have to be corrected in the first place. We are therefore working closely with the Member States and with recipients. We provide assistance, we provide training and set up help desks to ensure that shared management – even beyond the European services on site – ensures the appropriate expertise in the implementation of the budget. You can't avoid all the mistakes. That is why we need sound correction systems when something has gone wrong. These corrections do not occur until some time after payment, which is also due to the multiannual nature of the European programmes.  In the management of our budget, we in the management of our budget want to ensure that, after a programme has been implemented, after a programme has been completed and after all the controls have been carried out, the remaining error rate is less than 2%. We reached the target last year and estimate the remaining error rate at around 0.6%, which is well below 1%.  I would like to add that mistakes can be due to fraud, waste and inefficiency. But there may also be mistakes that arise negligently, which have nothing to do with fraudulent intent, corruption or infidelity and still need to be corrected. The President of the Court of Auditors mentioned the outstanding commitments, and we also discussed payments at the interinstitutional meeting last week. We are monitoring the situation very closely, partly because Parliament expects this to be done. We are fully transparent about the outstanding commitments. The sum of around EUR 270 billion is not a surprise at this stage of a multiannual budgetary framework, but can be explained. EU financial assistance needed to implement programmes on the ground will be disbursed to Member States and other beneficiaries. We do not withhold any money. But it is important to note that the duration of many projects extends over several years from the initial planning to the start of construction, implementation and clearance of accounts.  As a result, commitments may not be made until a later financial year, even after the multiannual financial framework has been completed. This phenomenon also occurs in national budgets, but to a much lesser extent there.  The current state of play in the commitments to be made is not surprising and the implementation of projects on the ground has picked up speed. I can inform you that the Member States are now carrying out project selection as planned, that the budget has now reached full speed, and this also applies to the implementation of the current budget for 2018. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report, which You and we are currently in the middle of negotiations for the next Multiannual Financial Framework 2021-2027. I would like to thank the House – Parliament – for its efforts to quickly establish a position that you intend to adopt here in Parliament next month. The Commission's proposals contain many elements which will bring improvements with regard to some of the aspects identified by the Court. Firstly, a smaller difference between the level of appropriations for commitments and the appropriations for payments, from the outset. Secondly, more flexibility. Thirdly, N+2 instead of N+3, as is currently the case, so that the incentive to avoid delays increases, and then a greater focus on performance and results. For this we need yours – the support of Members – for these points, and we also want to include the Court's opinion on them. I would like to thank President Lehne, Mr Lazarou, your staff for the work the Court has done to make further improvements in the management of European finances. It is my and our overarching objective to have a budget that achieves results and real added value and that is managed well and correctly. Your constructive participation is necessary. We look forward to constructive cooperation with Parliament, the Council and the Court for the forthcoming discussions on the 2017 budget discharge.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "PPE", "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 191, "date": "2018-10-24.json", "name": "Pavel TELIČKA", "mepid": "124706", "text": "  We will now proceed with speakers on behalf of the political groups.

This year, as the Commissioner has already mentioned, the topic of discharge is being discussed mainly in the context of the debate on the next Multiannual Financial Framework between 2021 and 2027. Why is this debate important? Because the EU budget is the most important instrument the EU has in hand in implementing its strategies and objectives. If the budget is not drawn down properly, effectively and its use does not add value, then the EU loses its meaning. I therefore see the need for fundamental budgetary and administrative reform. The need to simplify bureaucracy in the first place. Secondly, a reduction in the number of institutions and bodies. Thirdly, improving communication with the ordinary citizen, offering greater transparency. An EU citizen should understand, understand internal processes that should be much simpler and more readable. Projects must also be better presented, have more added value, have vision and have, ladies and gentlemen, above all sustainability.  The European Court of Auditors rightly warns the President that we must deal with money realistically, not set impossible targets. On the contrary, we must build citizens' trust through successful projects and build on some strong, long-term strategy. We want a clear vision from the new European Commission next year of where we are going, what we want and what we have lacked so far. This vision should bring the remaining Member States together and take the wind out of the sails of eurosceptics.

I would also like to thank you for the possibility of this debate being held in the presence of a large part of visitors, citizens of the European Union who have access to this debate. The Court of Auditors' annual photo of the European Union's dynamic and multiannual budget is now much closer to the reality of that budget than, for ever-increasing and more complex ambitions, it remains only 1% of the European Union's GDP and in relation to which we are concerned that flexibility and financial engineering will become escape elements. And we say this less than nine months after the European elections, criticism, and in the midst of debate on the Multiannual Financial Framework. In view of the debate on the financial future, we welcome the two most important recommendations. Firstly, that the European Union must not promise anything it cannot deliver, which in political policy would be, rather, that the European Union must give itself sufficient means for the promises it makes to its citizens. We also reflect the challenge of the growing gap between increasing commitments and poor payments, which leads precisely to the end of the outstanding budgetary commitments in a new high. We must therefore make this rebalancing a priority in the next financial framework.

For 23 years now, in principle, when the Court began to draw up statements of assurance for the annual report, the opinion has always been negative. Now, for the second year in a row, the Court is iassing a qualified opinion on payments, so there is progress. Let us remember, however, that this is still not a clean opinion, that is, pure regarding payments. This could have been granted if the estimated level of error did not exceed the 2% threshold. What is worth highlighting, in my opinion, is that there is a growing progression here, because in 2015 we had almost 4% of this payment error (3.8%), in 2016 – 3.1%, well now – 2.4%, so it is clearly better.  On the other hand, it is worth pointing out that the biggest problem is in terms of reimbursement payments. Here, the situation is much worse, as this includes spending in the areas with the highest error levels.  Finally, it must be said that this Court's report is sound.

What is more, the estimated level of error in expenditure from the European budget is 2.4%, and last year it has once again come close to the materiality threshold. This means that more than 97.5% of European funds have fulfilled their purpose and purpose flawlessly. Individual projects have shown that they have brought European added value and contributed to the common political and economic objectives of the European Union. I believe that further reducing the administrative burden and overall simplification will continue to contribute to reducing error rates and raising the standard of living of Union citizens. On the other hand, however, it should be noted that, across all Member States, the overall absorption rate of European MFF funds was 16%, significantly lower than in the previous period, when absorption was at 22%. This increased the remaining commitments to more than EUR 267 billion. I believe that it would be appropriate to focus more on the cost-effective, efficient and efficient use of these European funds, so that they do not become merely a statistical indicator of the ability of Member States to draw on the allocated allocation in its own right.

This equates to less than half of one per cent of Member States’ GNI. As auditors, concerned where funds are spent, this represents outstanding value for money. The fact that 500 million citizens of the EU have access to quality, affordable food is perhaps one of the greatest achievements of the EU. The error rate in direct payments (Pillar 1) is below 2%. With improvements in the control systems – both the Integrated  Administration and Control System (IACS) and the Land Parcel Identification System (LPIS) – this is expected to improve further. The error rate in Pillar 2 is higher, and while we must be aware of this and work to improve it, it should come as no surprise. We should bear in mind that Pillar 2 schemes focusing more on environmental issues are inherently more error-prone and less easily quantifiable. We face huge challenges in this area and we must continue to set the bar high and assist our farmers as they take on new challenges in climate change mitigation. We must resist the urge to focus solely on error rates in this sector, which may have the unintended consequence of lowering ambition in order to comply with targets in this vital sector.

One conclusion – as many newspapers have read – is that 2.4% is equivalent to EUR 3.3 billion, which seems to have been completely muddied. The headline and the coverage suggest that they were simply carelessly put in the sand or misused. Over EUR 3 billion is certainly not peanuts.

Of course, this does not fit into the plan for the EU critics. But it means that 97.6% was used correctly.

The turnaround also in budgeting, the performance budgeting is made. First the money went very easily to the Member States, now there has to be an agreement in advance and then we also look in advance whether there is that commitment. A new practice has been introduced. Second point: indeed a late start-up. The Member States are only now gaining steam. And the result is that money remains in that European coffers and it flows back to the Member States. And it's inevitable: in 2–3 years we'll get that whole pile of bills again. Good thing you come up with suggestions to do something about it. Thirdly, you are right to say that there is sometimes too little coherence between, for example, research policy, Horizon 2020, and regional funds. Horizon 2020 looks a bit like a beautiful Airbus that hangs in the air, but has no view of the landing strip. And there's a lot we can do about that.

Secondly, allow me to say that although we are politicians and we can make bad news out of good news at the end of a sentence, and sometimes we try to make good news out of bad news at the end of a sentence, it is by no means detrimental that the error rate identified in the European Union budget, as examined by the European Court of Auditors, has decreased compared to previous years.

Last but not least, if there is one area where a erroneous, irregular or corrupt payment from the European Union budget is unacceptable, it is the area of migration.

As other colleagues have said, it must lead to less bureaucracy, not more bureaucracy. We have to do things differently, and in any new budget we have got to prioritise new areas of public expenditure.  As we go forward to the multiannual financial framework (MFF )for the next seven years, let us agree that earlier rather than later. Let us also ensure that we breach the 1% cap, which many Member States do not want to breach, because that will show real solidarity to the 27 Member States that remain within the European Union, and it will also show real determination to be ambitious on European projects that can lead to a better, stronger single market.  I also think it’s important that we highlight in this debate the way in which we can change attitudes and change procedures through better public expenditure.

Mr President, Mr President of the Court of Auditors, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work and for the work she has done. I have listened carefully to your speeches. We will evaluate them and come back to them in the course of the further discharge procedure. I am grateful for the recognition given by many Members to my staff in the Commission services for their proper budget implementation. I can also accept and accept the expectations of many Members here, and I think some critical remarks are worth considering. Thank you very much for the factual debate! If we still see in 2018 that some of the programmes have been delayed, what are the reasons, and what are the consequences for the next budget framework? Firstly, since the current budgetary framework was only adopted by the Council and Parliament in mid-December with all the implementing rules, it was the first year and also the second year of the budgetary framework, so the years 2014 and much of 2015 were a lost time. Only in 2017 did all programs record full travel speed. This can be noted in particular for 2018 and for the implementation of the budget this year. Secondly, N+3 does not put a great deal of pressure on us to submit invoices quickly and to request reimbursements. Only a few months ago, we practically completed the 2007-2013 budget framework. Only now do the authorities also have some room for manoeuvre to apply for and obtain approval from the current budgetary framework. Therefore: N+2 instead of N+3. And our joint recommendation – that of Parliament and the Commission – to the Council to do everything possible to ensure that the next budgetary framework can be adopted along the way to the next election. This will allow the preparations to use the programmes from 1 January 2021. This lesson must be drawn from the deliberations of the current budgetary framework, from 2011, 2012 and 2013. Thirdly, simplification of the rules for our programmes. With our proposal for the next MFF, we have clearly combined simplification – simplification. Finally, the Member States would have to designate their competent authorities much earlier. In some cases, some Member States and regions only designated the authorities responsible for implementation and programme implementation at the beginning of last year. These lessons can be drawn from the current budgetary framework. Next time, the delay will certainly be much reduced and the benefits of the Commission's and the Union's budget programmes as a whole will arrive much earlier and more strongly with citizens, the labour market and European economic competitiveness.

Mr Lazarou, who, as the main rapporteur in the House, has done the essential work in drawing up the annual report, and I will gladly pass that on to all my fellow Members and staff in the House.  Mr Czarnecki raised the issue of the fact that for 24 years now, since the entry into force of the Maastricht Treaty, we have had to make the so-called statement of insurance as the Court of Auditors. We have delivered a negative verdict of this for 22 years and a limited positive judgment for two years now.  I think this is a really positive development. I would like to emphasise this once again: this is not due to miscalculation or downcounting the error rate, but is simply due to the fact that the data have actually improved.

This is also due to the fact that this year we have, of course, had a comparatively small share of cohesion expenditure and cohesion expenditure tends to always have a slightly higher error rate anyway. It cannot therefore be ruled out that the picture may not look quite as good next year as it has been this year. I would perhaps like to make another comment on the error rate. This is not an exact calculation – and this is often unfortunately misunderstood – is a mathematical-statistical method that you, as a politician, all know from opinion polls, where a sample is taken, and on this basis is then calculated what the probable error rate is. But this always has a variation range of about +/- 1% on average, and therefore it must be said quite clearly that if one makes concrete statements about concrete percentages from a certain limit, i.e. below the materiality limit, then they have a relatively small actual statistical value. As a farm, therefore, we are increasingly considering – we will reconsider this again next year – whether we should not completely save ourselves all the statements that are below the materiality limit and delete them altogether. This is an issue that we will discuss, simply to avoid further misunderstandings in this context. The issue of RAL, the rest of the liquid, has, of course, played a major role in the debate. I would like to make it quite clear – in order to avoid misunderstandings again – that RALs are normal, as Commissioner Oettinger quite rightly said. What worries us is the sheer dimension that we currently have RALs in the order of double the annual nominal budget.  Of course, this is also a consequence of the N+3 rule. The N+3 rule was introduced in 2008 or after 2008 in the context of the financial crisis because Member States had problems co-financing or financing projects. But the financial crisis was ten years ago. That is why it might now be time to think about returning to normal conditions and thus avoiding such an increase in commitments in the future. I think Mr Flanagan, Mr van Nistelrooij and Mr Hayes have made reference to the MFF anyway. You can assume that in the next few days we will decide on the individual opinions, the opinions on agricultural policy, cohesion policy. Because the desire is your own, we are happy to make it horizon and other topics that are important to you. I would like to mention the error rate, because Mr Kohn was right to raise the issue, and I am very grateful for that. If we find an estimated error rate of 2.4%, that does not mean that EUR 3.3 billion has been wasted by the European Union from EU funds. That does not mean that. This simply means that we have found errors in the issuance of these funds, either legal, usually legal or accounting deficiencies. That says nothing about the usefulness of expenditure. These funds, even if they have been flawed, may have been spent in perfect sense. It is just as conceivable that funds that have been lawfully spent have been spent in absolutely pointless terms. This is a compliance check. So we are doing nothing but checking whether things are right in legal and mathematical terms. The other theme of meaningfulness is examined in performance, i.e. in Audit reports, which, incidentally, we are already producing in large numbers – up to 50 per year – at the moment as the European Court of Auditors. The performance share also plays a certain role in the annual report. We are currently considering internally how we can improve this in order to give you better information about it in detail. The issue of value for money has also been raised here; European added value is also an issue that plays a major role in the issue of performance and is very limited in the issue of compliance.  Mr Ashworth was right to point out that a large part of the responsibility also lies with the Member States. I think that is correct and that should not be forgotten. The Commission is not to blame for everything. It must, of course, stop the Member States from doing things properly. In this respect, it is always in business in terms of data reliability. I would also like to say something about this, because it is also mentioned time and again. Rest assured that we only use data from the Member States and the Commission for our audits, which we personally believe to be reliable. All other data on which we have doubts are not consulted, but our own data collection takes place on our own. I can say to Mr Marias that the report on NGOs is in its final phase, and it will come soon. I hope that you will be able to draw conclusions from this. Mrs Maletis was quite right to raise the issue of often lack of or insufficient technical support. We made a report on this some time ago on the JASPERS programmes and we have also made some critical comments on how this can be improved. As you can see, the Court of Auditors is trying to keep you all up to date so that we can improve our overall work. Our criticism does not serve to bring anything down, but our criticism serves to improve the situation, to put our finger in the wound, but in the sense of healing, not in the sense of destroying.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 219, "date": "2018-10-24.json", "name": "Dimitrios PAPADIMOULIS", "mepid": "28586", "text": "  The debate is closed.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, after lengthy negotiations, we are finally debating today the adoption of the regulation on the import of cultural goods. I would like to begin by thanking all my fellow Members for the hard work they have done over the last few months. Some studies indicate that the illicit trafficking of works of art is second only to that of weapons and drugs. Images of the destruction of the Palmyra site by Isis are still alive in our eyes, but talk of destruction is inaccurate. It was a real dismantling: the most precious finds were stolen and sold on the European square. After depriving the Syrian people of their history and culture, European buyers contributed to the direct funding of a terrorist organisation. The illegal trafficking of works of art is a crime against humanity because it deprives us of our common artistic heritage and history, but it also threatens the security of European citizens, contributing to the financing of terrorist activities. Not only that: by promoting tax evasion and money laundering, the illegal trade in works of art threatens our social model.  The new regulation will therefore contribute to this threefold battle by imposing transparency and greater controls. It was not an easy task. Although we all agree on the urgent need for action, we have had difficulty in establishing the right balance between the need to put a stop to these illegal trades and the objective of not burdening private operators and customs with unnecessary red tape. We have therefore introduced facilities for small and medium-sized enterprises, an electronic registration system that can facilitate the procedures and value thresholds that will allow for more targeted application, imposing controls only on the most valuable goods. In addition, starting with the UNESCO Convention of 1970, the text we have proposed will be more consistent with international conventions and Union regulations. By applying the same annex to the Export Regulation and drawing on the experience of customs officials and art markets, implementation will thus be easier. The final text is balanced, as demonstrated by the very large majority that supported it. The European Union will equip itself with a state-of-the-art instrument capable of combating illegal trafficking without curbing lawful trade, which is a source of employment and growth. After approval, we will have to ensure that the application is as uniform as possible. We cannot allow internal competition between European ports to create free zones. We must combat internal fraud, such as that perpetrated, for example, by the BRITISH authorities in the Eu ropean budget from 2011, which is why we will be entering a due diligence system, that is, a list of equal documents for all that customs authorities will be obliged to request. To our British friends who are frightened by the effects that the regulation will have on the London art market after Brexit, I would like to remind you that you cannot enjoy the benefits of a community without being part of it and if you want to avoid double controls you have to be part of the single market. Once again, European trade policy is an alternative to both protectionism and unbridled liberalism. A strategy based on our values: trade cannot, in fact, be free from social, human and environmental rights. With tomorrow's vote, we will be adding another element of sustainability to European trade policy, another brick to make our common home more worthy for the men and women who live there, a further effort to make globalisation a fairer and more humane process.

But our discussion showed that we all share the same goal: workable legislation that targets the illicit importing of cultural goods for terrorist financing without overburdening customs authorities or small businesses. For that reason – unlike the Commission – we recognise the need for value thresholds on most items. We already have value thresholds in the export regulation. For imports, clearly, higher-value items are of greater interest for terrorist financing. So for the Commission not to follow that precedent and to have no value thresholds on a regulation that applies to the whole world – low- as well as high-risk areas – made little sense. Customs authorities are already overwhelmed and unable to check most imports. So to work, this regulation needs to focus on higher-value, higher-risk goods. That is how we deal with customs issues throughout our legislation: risk-based, intelligence-led checks. This proposal – let’s not forget – was originally drawn up in light of Isis’s control of large areas of Syria and the potential for them to traffic antiquities to fund their activities. Global strife, however, constantly evolves, so our work here needs to be better than just press-release politics, and legislation needs to be fit for changing risks. Importantly, in the Parliament text we also recognise that there are legitimate movements of goods for museums and art fairs that we shouldn’t in any way hinder. Creating long delays to imports would have simply moved these fairs outside Europe, where there is often less oversight. In the Parliament we agreed from the start on a digital-led approach. Cultural objects cross borders repeatedly, so information needs to be exchanged to allow previously-vetted goods to circulate freely. A fully-electronic system is therefore critical and, given these rules will not be applied until the early 2020s, continuing with a paper system, I think, would look ridiculous. We also recognise that small businesses will need help in complying with this regulation. Many cultural goods, such as sub-genres of books or types of antiquities, are sold by highly-specialised companies, so micro- and family businesses are at the heart of the trade. The scope is fundamental to the potential burden of this regulation, but we have also proposed targeted measures to further help small companies meet the demands on them. Cooperation with third countries will also be vital to tackling illicit trade. So I strongly support the provisions we introduced in this regulation to bolster efforts being made to improve the capacities of countries that are struggling to preserve their cultural heritage. By complementing those efforts with sensible import rules, we can act to resolve the whole supply chain for illicit goods rather than just isolating Europe from a global problem. As I said at the start, although we’ve made significant improvements, this text is not perfect. For example, there is still some potential difficulty in cases where provenance is hard to determine – of which there will be many when dealing with ancient artefacts. This is particularly the case for low—value archaeological items, which fall under the scope of the final text, regardless of whether they are from high- or low-risk areas. It should be possible to import items which have been held legitimately for decades without the cooperation of source countries which lack documentation to judge the original export’s legitimacy. Otherwise, we risk overburdening customs authorities and importers with an unachievable proof requirement that could clog up the system and fail to deliver on the regulation’s aims. I am optimistic, though, that, through constructive negotiations with the Council, using their first—hand knowledge of customs operations, we can streamline this proposal and emerge with a final law fit for purpose. We want to avoid a ʻfortress Europeʼ approach and unworkable requirements that might prevent the profiteering of Isis but also devastate the responsible family businesses that make up the vast majority of the trade in Europe. If I can just make one point in response to Ms Mosca’s points: for the UK this is a classic case in point. If these rules are too overburdening for European producers and the UK is outside that market, I can guarantee you that the trade will move to the UK, and no one in Europe or the UK will be thankful for that. I won’t.

There is evidence that some of those artefacts are sold and brought into the Union, with their proceeds potentially used to finance terrorist activities. For instance, early in 2018, a Spanish antiques dealer was arrested in Barcelona for his alleged participation in a wide international network trafficking antiques. The investigation appears to show that these works of art were stolen from archaeological sites in Libya. They were looted by the terrorist organisation Islamic State and were especially intended for the financing of terrorism.  Another example is the seizure by French customs authorities two years ago at Charles de Gaulle Airport of looted cultural goods which probably came from the war region in Iraq and Syria. The Commission is very engaged on the issue of cultural goods trafficking.  The Commission is also fully engaged in the fight against terrorist financing and presented an action plan aiming to reduce the sources of revenue of terrorist organisations in February 2016. Within this context, the Commission made proposals to the Council and Parliament to strengthen customs controls in two areas, one on the control of cultural goods at import and another one on controls on cash entering and leaving the European Union.  The proposal on cash controls has led to the adoption of an amended regulation, soon to be published in the Official Journal. The Commission welcomes the successful effort of the co-legislators on that matter.  On cultural goods, the Commission adopted in July 2017 a proposal to prevent the import and storage, including in free zones, in the EU of cultural goods illicitly exported from third countries. The measure aspires to protect cultural heritage, to combat illicit trade in cultural goods, especially archaeological objects and parts of dismembered monuments, and to strengthen the fight against terrorist financing. At the same time, the right balance between safeguarding of common cultural heritage and avoiding undue burden on trade was fully taken into account.  At present, the EU applies common rules on the export of cultural goods and the return of cultural objects unlawfully removed from the territory of a Member State. However, with the exception of two specific measures prohibiting trade in cultural goods with Iraq and Syria, no common rules exist regarding the import of cultural goods into the EU customs territory.  The Commission’s proposal came as a response to a call for action from the European Parliament and the Council, from international organisations and from governments of the Member States. Our proposal provides a common definition of cultural goods deriving from the 1970 Unesco Convention and the 1995 Unidroit Convention, listing categories of objects which are of importance for archaeology, prehistory, history, literature, art or science.  Furthermore, a minimum age threshold of 250 years for such objects is introduced. This allows focusing on cultural goods considered to be the most affected and vulnerable to illicit trade. It also minimises the impact on national authorities and the art market in terms of operational and compliance costs as they already have experience with these thresholds, which exist in US legislation. The proposed regulation establishes a system of import licences and import statements that are required, depending on the category of the cultural goods concerned. The import licence, which implies a higher level of scrutiny, would target the cultural goods most at risk.  Exceptions to this rule are introduced in the case of the temporary admission of an object for scientific or academic research purposes and cultural exchange, or for cultural goods at minimum risk of destruction sent to the Union for safekeeping by a third country’s public authorities.  In order to improve the ability of customs officials to recognise suspicious shipments and to cooperate more efficiently with other law enforcement authorities in preventing illicit trade in cultural goods, the proposal also provides for the organisation of training and capacity—building activities for customs and other law enforcement authorities and awareness-raising campaigns aimed at potential buyers in the Union.  The brief summary I have set out focused on the main elements of the proposal. Let me recall that this is an essential piece of legislation to combat trafficking in cultural goods, deprive terrorists of a source of income and protect cultural heritage.

During our work the most important and, at the same time, the most challenging issue was the scope. Luckily, we managed to achieve a good compromise, covering all those goods that deserve special protection, but at the same time limiting the scope as much as possible to those cultural goods most affected by illegal trafficking. I believe that it is extremely important not to overburden market actors and disturb the licit trade of cultural goods in the EU, therefore, I am very happy that red tape for the art market will be avoided, in particular for SMEs. This will be possible through the establishment of an economic threshold in addition to the 250—year threshold, which means that not all goods with zero value will be covered by this regulation. To give you an example, without an economic threshold, books from the 18th century which are worth nothing would fall under the scope and administrative costs would probably be higher than the value of the book itself, and that would kill the market. We need common rules to ensure effective protection against the loss of cultural goods and the prevention of terrorist financing through the sale of looted cultural heritage to buyers in the EU.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the commissioner for her excellent work and for the work she has done. Tomorrow, the trialogue mandate for the regulation on the import of cultural goods will be voted on. Why does the European Parliament take care of the import of illegal cultural goods from third countries? After drugs and weapons, the illegal trade in cultural goods is considered one of the most lucrative transactions on the black market, possibly also used to finance terrorism. But what is at stake here is that centuries-old testimonies of human civilisation may be lost forever, sold on the black market, or disappear ingesbly to free ports or cellars. We are not playing the world police, but the principle must apply: culture is worth protecting all over the world. We must therefore not allow cultural goods worthy of protection to enter the market illegally in the European Union. Better customs rules help to combat organised crime, money laundering and tax evasion. The text as voted on in committee is, in my opinion, balanced and takes account of all interests equally. The bureaucratic burden on the art trade will be relatively low. An import licence will only have to be presented for a fraction of all imports, because it mainly concerns archaeological goods. It deliberately does not include every family heirloom. There is an age and value limit for all other cultural assets. All that would have to be done for them is a self-declaration, which can then be used to act legally. Customs officials must also have a legally sound basis for action in order to be able to withdraw illegally imported cultural goods from circulation.

Instead, this requires an extensive list of documents to prove origin, otherwise they will be treated as illicit imports.

I guess they would prefer to roll out the red carpet for terrorists. That is something that we should not do. We have to be very serious about the problem that the trade in illicitly obtained cultural goods presents. Over the last few years, we’ve seen that, for terrorist groups like Daesh in search of income, actually, there has been a prospering market of stolen cultural artefacts that links organised crime, money laundering and the financing of terrorist activities across the world. Europe and also the United Kingdom are not free of the risk of becoming a part of such schemes. That is why we had to take action. Only in 2016, for example, two Syrian freezers were seized at an airport in France. Daesh has emerged as one of the key players. It is also destroying, looting and trading cultural goods for profit, but let’s not forget that they also do this to stamp out cultural identities as part of ethnic cleansing, which is among the most significant crimes that we know of. We need to tackle the illicit trade in cultural goods with trade measures and by harmonising rules and building on what we already know without burdening galleries and museums. We have come to a common definition of what cultural goods are and identified those most at risk, and are making sure that we have checks on the origin licensing schemes without placing unnecessary burdens on sellers and SMEs.

Already at the stage of the joint work of the two INTA/IMCO committees, I welcomed the European Commission's proposal to regulate the import by the Union of cultural goods, with the aim of preventing and blocking the illicit exchange of works of art. I would also like to stress the need for such a regulation when we vote in plenary. I think that the text has been improved by the drafting of the two committees: for example, the minimum age of 250 years for works of art proposed by the Commission has been removed, and this allows us to have a wider margin of control over figurative works of art, for example, which may be more recent but not of lesser value. We have also agreed on the easing of procedures, moving from the double licensing procedure to a single one.

Although we all had a common objective, it has certainly not always been easy to find compromises in this dossier. However, I believe that we have a very balanced text – which, according to The ECR opinion, certainly still has one or two shortcomings, but I believe that we have a very good, constructive and balanced result here as a whole. With the Import Regulation, we want to achieve harmonisation of the import rules of cultural goods in the EU, originating not in the EU. This, too, has been misrepresented time and again in the past. We must make this particularly clear here once again, that it is precisely cultural goods that originate in a third country and not in the EU, and the watch of the British great-uncle or grandfather may not fall under that. The general aim is to prevent the illegal importation of cultural goods from a third country and the storage of these goods in the EU, to curb the illegal trade in cultural goods, to combat the financing of terrorism and also to protect cultural heritage – not only our own, but that of humanity as a whole. I think it is right that we have limited the scope as far as possible to the cultural goods that are most affected by illegal trade and which are also of particular importance for cultural heritage. This will prevent unnecessary red tape for the art market, for small and medium-sized enterprises, as well as for customs and national authorities.

It is important to step up the fight against this dangerous phenomenon, including through legislative means. It is therefore a good thing that the European Parliament's proposal for a trilogue negotiating mandate with the Council represents an extension of the existing legal protection of cultural heritage in the EU Member States as well as to the cultural heritage of third countries, as the rules on imports from third countries are not harmonised at EU level. By contrast, common rules for the export of cultural goods already exist in the form of EU regulations. As regards imports of cultural goods, only two specific restrictive measures are in force at EU level in relation to Syria or Iraq. So the general adjustment seems to be lacking and quite strongly. From the proposal put forward, I promise to break the link between the illegal trade in cultural goods and organised crime and the financing of terrorism, while at the same time ensuring legal certainty for the legal market for works of art. The need for coordinated and effective action at EU level is also due to the lack of sufficient capacity by the competent authorities of third countries to combat the illicit and illegal trade in cultural goods, and they are also often exposed to corruption or other forms of maladministration. It should be remembered that when cultural goods are torn out of the environment, the locals lose their customs and monuments or memorable and places of worship.

It is not only about the illegal export of cultural goods from elsewhere and the cultural heritage of certain countries, especially third world countries, being damaged, but, as has already been said and emphasised here, trade in cultural goods has become a way of financing various terrorist and other illegal activities in recent years.

This threatens the integrity of the palace, which constitutes a site of national significance for Ukraine, as well as an integral part of the cultural heritage of the Crimean Tatar people.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 251, "date": "2018-10-24.json", "name": "Kateřina KONEČNÁ", "mepid": "23699", "text": "   – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a sad truth that war, among many other horrific crimes that accompanies it, also leads to the pillaging of cultural heritage.

Allow me to stress one more time that with the legislation we are discussing, we cover only antiques and valuable works of art from impoverished or war—torn countries and regions, which are often illegally acquired, sold and imported into the European Union. In addition to damaging or destroying the archaeological sites and the artefacts themselves, illicit trade in looted cultural goods has also been identified as a source of income for organised crime groups and terrorists.  Before I conclude today’s discussion, please allow me to respond to some of your comments.  First, regarding old books. These are not, I repeat, not, placed under import licence requirements. Only a signed declaration or minimum information will be required. On the topic of value thresholds, the proposed regulation does not provide for minimum value thresholds, but provides for a high age threshold of 250 years instead. Neither Unesco nor Unidriot nor the Hague Convention provide for minimum age limits. Parliament’s proposal for shorter minimum age limits comes from the EU Regulation on the export of cultural goods and ranges from 50 up to 200 years. That being said, the Commission could consider minimum value limits as well.  Mr Campbell, you do not need to worry about the grandfather clock. The proposed regulation’s scope does not include European cultural goods created or discarded in the territory of the Member States, so no worries about that.  Let me also stress that the proposed regulation does not concern the cultural heritage of Iraq and Syria. On those we have EU measures prohibiting trade – an embargo basically. The comment related to Iraq was, therefore, completely misplaced.  I would also like to stress again that there is already EU legislation about the return of EU cultural goods between Member States. However, the Directive in question does not have retroactive effect and could not be used for the return of looted art during the Second World War. In this particular case, this would be a matter of negotiation between two Member States and can take place anytime.  A common EU-level approach based on everything that we have heard so far is necessary to ensure that imports of cultural goods are subject to uniform controls along the EU’s external borders. The Commission proposal is a follow—up to other EU initiatives aimed at strengthening the fight against terrorism financing, indeed precisely to prevent the import and storage in the EU of cultural goods that have been removed from a third country illegally and thereby combat trafficking in cultural goods, deprive criminals, terrorists and other warring factions of a source of income, and protect cultural heritage.  From what I have heard today in the debate, I can say that the Commission welcomes most elements of Parliament’s position, which will be put to the vote in the plenary tomorrow.

We all have the same goal here, namely to tighten rules to prevent the illicit import of cultural goods, and there is clearly consensus for that across the House. But that doesn’t mean that we support all and every measure that is proposed, particularly those that could punish legitimate traders or keep European cultural heritage out of Europe. That’s what a lot of this text does, and we’ve got to be very careful to make sure it doesn’t do that. The grandfather clock, for example: if that goes outside Europe, you may well not be able to bring it back in. Similarly with the point that Mr Marias was making: if those go out of Europe and you can’t get the approval of the source country to get a licence to bring them back in, under these proposals you’re going to struggle to get European goods back into Europe. No one wants that. I know no one in this House wants that. That’s the point that I’ve been trying to make in these whole discussions, and that’s the problem we still have with this file as it is now. Yes, we need to be very, very strong on terrorist financing and we need to make sure we clamp down on that illicit and serious organised crime route into Europe. But let’s not punish legitimate arts traders, people that have got books – because some books are still covered by this – and a whole range of other European artefacts that we want to make sure can come back into Europe legitimately.

I’m not going to oppose it and I hope that, in the negotiations with the Council, we can come together to get a final agreement that does look along those lines: do what everyone in this room wants to make sure that we hammer down that potential loophole on terrorist financing but that we do not hurt legitimate traders and legitimate people that have legitimate European cultural heritage.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 256, "date": "2018-10-24.json", "name": "Bogusław LIBERADZKI", "mepid": "23768", "text": "  I close the debate.

Please allow me to take a look back at the work done with my colleagues and the collaborators involved in this, while thanking them for their consistency and dedication, but also for the spirit of collaboration and constructive cooperation. This is because the result of our work is spectacular, with positive implications for national authorities, patients, human and veterinary doctors, farmers and consumers. In September 2014, the Commission presented a proposal that centralised authorisation for the placing on the market for veterinary medicinal products was decoupled from that for medicinal products for human use, which involved amending Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999. whereas, in order to ensure that the provisions of this Regulation are complied with, it is necessary to establish a Community procedure for the authorisation and supervision of medicinal products for human and veterinary use and to establish a European Medicines Agency; Although Parliament adopted our position on 10 March 2016, interinstitutional negotiations did not begin until January 2018. The Interinstitutional Agreement was concluded on 21 February 2018 with regard to the amendment of Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999. 726/2004 and 5 June 2018 for VMP. The final text was approved by Coreper on 13 June 2018 and on 20 June 2018, following a consensus among the main political groups in the ENVI committee, the result of the trilogues was adopted unanimously.  The final agreement resulting from the negotiations included a number of improvements to the Commission's proposal relating, in particular, to the Agency's revenue and sources of revenue. With regard to the determination of the fees due to the European Medicines Agency by industry, we have agreed with the Council to respect the current practice of codecision. We have also won concessions from the Council on the European Parliament's amendments on the determination of the Agency's revenue sources, the frequency of reporting of The AMR by the EMA, the research of innovative methods and alternatives to animal testing and alignment with the financial regulation. The European Medicines Agency remains responsible under the centralised authorisation procedure for both medicinal products for human and veterinary use.  We have concluded an additional agreement with the Council to bring the provisions on amendments and sanctions of Directive 2001/83 of the Lisbon Omnibus into line with the provisions agreed in the EMA Regulation. As shadow rapporteur in the Grossetête report, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and colleagues on a very good collaboration and a result commensurate with the work done. The new regulation on veterinary medicinal products COM(2014)0558, as a result of interinstitutional negotiations, covers all avenues for granting authorisations to place veterinary medicinal products on the market, ensuring the protection of animal health and therefore also human health, the fight against antibiotic resistance and the competitiveness of farms and the veterinary medicinal products industry.  This interinstitutional Agreement also facilitates the movement of veterinary medicinal products throughout the European Union through better authorisation procedures and clear and up-to-date retail regulations. The main improvements to the Commission proposal resulting from the trialogues were those relating to the AMR package, online sales, pharmacovigilance, data protection, specific procedures for authorising the placing on the market for minor species or exceptional circumstances, environmental protection, homeopathic products.

Mr President, it is with the satisfaction of the duty accomplished that I see this vast project to be completed today. Four years, we have been working for four years on this overhaul of the \"veterinary drugs\" regulation with this triple objective of protecting animal health, and therefore of human health, the fight against antibiotic resistance and the competitiveness of our farms and our veterinary medicine industry. We can say this without blushing, the result is a great step forward for public health. I would like to thank my fellow shadow rapporteurs, Commissioner Andriukaitis and the Bulgarian Presidency, all of whom have achieved this excellent result. For beyond farmers or pet owners, the use of veterinary medicines concerns us all. It has a direct impact on our environment and our diet, in short: on our health. The major challenge of this revision was the fight against antibiotic resistance, while the World Health Organization continues to make alarming findings. According to the WHO, the resistance of antibiotic infections could soon cause more deaths each year than cancer. However, the fight against this scourge must begin in farms where antibiotics have long been used for purely preventive purposes. Thus, in 2015, the use of antibiotics in veterinary medicine was still twice as high as in human medicine. This regulation should make it possible to change this state of affairs in a lasting way through finer surveillance, enhanced supervision of the use of antibiotics, and a ban on the veterinary use of antimicrobials of critical importance to human medicine. It should also be remembered that the first solution is prevention, thanks in particular to biosecurity measures. Antibiotics should only be used as a last resort and under no circumstances to compensate for non-compliance with good breeding practices. Our agricultural model has to adapt to that. These new rules, I would like to stress, are not intended to stigmatize farmers and farmers, whose difficulties we know, but rather to help them to better care for herds, and because antibiotic resistance is a global phenomenon, we were keen to impose in the text the reciprocity of our standards for the use of antibiotics. It's a major success. There will be no more meat imports from countries that continue, for example, to allow antibiotics as growth factors. Gone is the hypocrisy of imposing standards on our breeders that others do not respect. Europe is changing the rules of the game and they will now be the same for everyone. In addition to the issue of antibiotics, the text of course includes other important advances. Through targeted incentives and reduced administrative burden, it will, among other things, stimulate innovation in the veterinary market, which is facing a real problem of treatment availability. It is therefore a comprehensive, cross-cutting approach that promises to transform the world of animal health for the long term and for the better. These changes will benefit all the players in the sector, including farmers and veterinarians, but also for all our fellow citizens who are committed to knowing what they find on their plate. Above all, with its particular conception of health and environmental issues, Europe is thus determined to be at the forefront of the fight against antibiotic resistance.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 2, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 263, "date": "2018-10-24.json", "name": "Clara AGUILERA", "mepid": "125045", "text": "  Rapporteur. – Mr President, I too welcome the report of the Regulation on the manufacture, marketing and use of medicinal feed, and for the result achieved together with my colleagues, Mrs Grosset-te and Mr T.N.Sescu. I think in the end the result is pretty positive. After four years of the launch by the European Commission of a package of proposals to update the legislative framework for veterinary medicinal products, stricter standards have been proposed in order to advance the fight against antimicrobial resistance and improve the availability and correct use of veterinary medicinal products in the European Union. The proposal on medicinal feed is part of this legislative package. These feeds — medicinal feed — are a route of administration of veterinary medicinal products, an effective tool for the treatment of animals in communities. As already indicated, the proposal on feed is connected to the new legislation on medicinal products, to the three Regulations. This proposal aims to update the 1990 Directive, which is obsolete in many of its provisions, and to advance the internal market for medicinal feed through legislative harmonisation which will now be established through regulations. The new text regulates the production, marketing and transport of medicinal feed, as well as the correct administration of both animals intended for human consumption and in pets. I would remind you all that, in addition to the specific provisions contained in this text, medicinal feed is also subject to other general legislation on the hygiene and labelling of feed, rules on the marketing and use of feed and additives in animal feed. The first-reading agreement aligns the feed regulation with the agreement on veterinary medicinal products reached by Mrs Grosset-te. We have put a lot of emphasis on coordination, making our trilogue decisions subject to decisions and advances in veterinary drug trilogs as the main instrument. Everything relating to the authorisation and requirements of the veterinary medicinal product applied to feed is regulated in the general text on veterinary medicinal products. We have paid particular attention to the coherence of the provisions designed to increase measures against antimicrobial resistance. In this regard, the ban, which had been in force for years, on the use of antibiotics as promoters of growth is reiterated. Some important provisions: the preventive use of medicinal feed with antibiotics is prohibited. Prophylaxis is prohibited in the European Union. Metaphylaxis is reduced to cases of high risk to animal and/or human health under close surveillance, and express reference is made to the international dimension in the fight against antimicrobial resistance, as set out in Article 118 of the Medicines Regulation. In the context of international cooperation, and in line with the actions and policies of the World Health Organization and the World Organisation for Animal Health, progress in reducing the use of antibiotic-containing medicinal feed should be taken into account on a global scale for animals and animal products from third countries exported to the European Union. Cross-contamination in the manufacturing process has also been a very important issue, and EFSA's proposal will remain within four years.  Finally, thanks to the general coordination with the other two rapporteurs, we have achieved more than optimal results, I believe. I believe that we have achieved an ambitious regulation which will give consumers more confidence in the European Union's livestock products and help us achieve a triumph in our fight against antimicrobial resistance.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 264, "date": "2018-10-24.json", "name": "Clara AGUILERA", "mepid": "125045", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, today we are debating a package of proposals for new legislation on veterinary medicines. This includes the Commission’s proposal for new rules on veterinary medical products and medicated feed and amendments to Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 on the authorisation and supervision of medicinal products and establishing a European Medicines Agency. Four years, as mentioned before, of discussions between the co—legislators have made many improvements to the initial proposal put forward by the Commission in 2014. I believe the text before us today provides a legal framework that is modern, innovative and fit for purpose. The package contains very concrete measures to promote more prudent use of antimicrobials in animals and strengthen EU action against antimicrobial resistance. These measures are designed in line with the one-health approach, recognising that human health, animal health and the environment are interconnected. They follow the comprehensive EU Action Plan on Antimicrobial Resistance. You will remember that Commissioner Andriukaitis came to discuss it in this House several times, including last September in this plenary, when Ms Kadenbach’s own—initiative report on antimicrobial resistance was adopted. I’m very grateful to the European Parliament for its valuable support and intensive work during the negotiations, particularly that of the three rapporteurs: Ms Grossetête, Ms Aguilera García and Mr Tănăsescu. Thank you. A few words on the individual components. First, on the key elements of the proposal for veterinary medical products. The text lays down a vast array of measures to tackle antimicrobial resistance. They build on the one-health approach and include: first, a ban on the preventive use of antibiotics in groups of animals; second, restrictions on metaphylactic use; third, the possibility to reserve certain antimicrobials for human use only; fourth, a ban on using antimicrobials to promote animal growth, adding to the 2006 ban on antibiotics as feed additives; fifth, other measures aimed at the prudent and responsible use of antimicrobials. In an ambitious move, the rules on growth promotion and antimicrobials reserved for human use in the EU also apply to non-EU operators exporting their animals or animal products to the EU. In addition, Member States will be required to collect and report data on the sales and use of antimicrobials in animals. This valuable data will support the design and implementation of targeted policies against antimicrobial resistance in the future. The text also aims to the stimulate innovation and improve availability. It provides for a simplified assessment procedure and a data protection period which may be extended by up to 18 years under certain conditions. This will facilitate the development of new antimicrobial veterinarian medicines, both generally and those more specific to mirror real diseases in major species that may not be developed under current market conditions. These measures will be supported by: first, clear and fully-harmonised labelling requirements; second, a simpler system for variation decisions; and third, a risk—based approach for pharmacovigilance and controls. The proposal for medical feed will also make an important contribution to the EU’s work on antimicrobial resistance. It will ensure the economically-viable production of safe medicated feed adapted to the optimal local situation and support innovation in medical pet food. A new area it covers is chronically-diseased pets. The proposal creates the legal framework to enable pet owners to administer veterinary medicines via pet food. Once the new regulations are adopted, the Commission will begin urgent action to support its implementation, notably through delegated and implemented acts. To accompany this package of proposals, the Commission will have two formal statements to make with regard to the reports of Ms Grossetête and Mr Tănăsescu. These have been provided to Parliamentʼs services for inclusion in the record of this debate. The first one concerns veterinarian medical products. On this, the Commission acknowledges the substantial input in terms of resources required by the Member States to implement the new rules on the collection and reporting of data on the sales and use of antimicrobial use in animals. It also underlines its commitment to providing the necessary technical support to Member States to design and implement policies on antimicrobial resistance. And the second concerns the proposed amendments to Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. On this, the Commission will clarify the transition arrangements and state its regret that the alignment of existing provisions with the Lisbon Treaty could not take place under a single legislative instrument. Dear President, honourable Members, to summarise: the adoption of these new regulations on veterinary medicines will mark a major achievement in this field. They will help consolidate the EU’s position as a world leader in acting against antimicrobial resistance and contribute to global progress in this critical area. They will also deliver a stable and harmonised marketplace for veterinary medicines and medicated feed in the EU that encourages innovation and competitiveness and contributes to greater animal health and welfare and food safety. Thank you again for all the dedicated work and I look forward to a positive outcome in tomorrow’s vote. Statements by the Commission  (in writing)  Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on veterinary medicinal products COM (2014)558 final – 2014/0257(COD) “The new EU Regulation on veterinary medicinal products requires Member States to collect and report data on sales and use of antimicrobials used in animals. The Commission considers this information essential to identify possible risk factors for development and spread of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), monitor trends in antimicrobial consumption, target relevant policy measures and assess their implementation. Although the implementation of this legal requirement is foreseen through a gradual (stepwise) approach, it may require substantial input in terms of administrative, human and financial resources. The European One Health Action Plan against AMR recognises that in order to deliver long-lasting results and create the necessary impetus, it is important that the EU legislation related to AMR (including, inter alia, on the use of veterinary medicines) is adequately implemented. In this context, the Commission has committed in that Action Plan to engage in supporting Member States in the implementation of EU rules, including by providing technical support through the Structural Reform Support Service (SRSS) for designing and implementing policies against AMR.  Furthermore, the Commission will explore the possibilities for supporting this data collection in Member States in line with its proposals made in the context of the future EU Multiannual Financial Framework.” *** Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of  the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 laying down Community procedures for the authorisation and supervision of medicinal products for human and veterinary use and establishing a European Medicines Agency  COM (2014)557 final – 2014/0256(COD) “The Commission recalls its position that when adapting existing Commission empowerments to Article 290 and 291 TFEU it is not an appropriate legislative technique to provide for transitional provisions that would state that Commission acts adopted previously under those empowerments will continue to apply unless and until repealed. In the Commission's view such provisions state the obvious and would not be coherent with other legislative acts and are liable to induce legal uncertainty at a broader level. The Commission regrets that only part of the existing regulatory procedure with scrutiny empowerments in Directive 2001/83 and Regulation 1901/2006 will be aligned in this instrument, while the rest of the empowerments remain to be aligned in the context of the negotiations on the Omnibus alignment proposal (COM(2016) 799).

Furthermore, I would like to highlight the way in which the fees paid by pharmaceutical companies to EMA for obtaining and maintaining a Union authorisation for veterinary medicinal products are paid. In doing so, the specific needs of SMEs have been taken into account, a separate procedure separate from that procedure for the authorisation of medicinal products for human use is being introduced for the marketing authorisation of veterinary medicinal products, as I have already said. And this new centralised registration system should provide a greater guarantee of expertise and efficiency.

The way we treat our animals also says a lot about ourselves. The welfare of farmed animals is also in the producer's interest, as a well-off animal produces better.

Some time ago, here in the House, we adopted by a large majority the European Parliament resolution on combating antimicrobial resistance within the framework of the concept of 'health'. I believe that the package we are discussing today meets many of the demands and proposals it contains. One of these is the targeted use of antibiotics. One of these is the investment in research and development for the provision of comprehensive, modern and good medicines for veterinary medicine, for animal husbandry. Because we know that even if the best technical conditions are met and animal welfare is respected, it will not be possible without medication. However, it should be done without antibiotics in many areas, and it should be possible above all without the use of so-called reserve antibiotics or critical antibiotics. I believe that this is one of the essential points we are discussing here today, that these antibiotics can only be used for veterinary medicine in very rare – precisely described – cases in future. We think and speak in the One Health approach, which means that we cannot forget here that the question of future agricultural policy will also make a significant contribution to what our animal welfare looks like, what use of medicines we have and where we can do without antibiotics in the future, especially in metaphylaxis.

I am pleased that the Commission and then the European Parliament have taken up work on this important subject, and even more so on the fact that it has completed it. It's a great success. I am a doctor, so I think it is extremely important that the regulations on veterinary medicines have nevertheless been clearly separated from the rules on medicinal products for human use. I believe that the negotiated regulations are good because they strike the right balance between the need to increase efforts to combat antimicrobial resistance and, at the same time, avoiding – as is often the case – excessive administrative burdens.

But the answer to this risk should not be the reckless use of antibiotics, as has been done so far, given antibiotics in the water that animals drink and in their food.

Moreover, it is well known that through the tropical chain there is a possibility that substances of veterinary medicinal products will be passed on to humans, with whatever risks this poses.

For instance, the use of antimicrobial products in livestock is important to restore full health as soon as possible and to stop the disease developing further in the animal or throughout the herd or flock. While preventative use of these products may be necessary under certain conditions, they should never be used as a substitute for proper feed, good hygiene practices in an appropriate environment and animal welfare standards.

In some European Member States, for example, the use of antibiotics in the livestock sector has fallen by 70%.

Only vets will be able to prescribe antibiotics in medicated feed in future, and only when there are clear signs of disease in the animals. The length of time that animals can be treated with antibiotics will be limited. For decades the routine use of antibiotics in livestock farming has propped up a system of factory farming where animals are packed into squalid conditions, only to be pumped full of antibiotics and other medicated feed to prevent the outbreak of disease. This has often been allowed even when an animal or group of animals has shown no sign of illness. This has encouraged appalling animal welfare standards and led to antimicrobial resistance, which has caused many deaths in our continent.

The Commission has not done this, with the potential consequence that large quantities of meat will arrive into the UK from farms that use antibiotics prophylactically, as a medicated feed. It is even possible that the antibiotics in this feed are of a type that the British livestock industry voluntarily does not use because of their extensive use for human patients. I urge the Commission to delay implementing this legislation until either Brexit is safely achieved or they have squared it with the WTO. In any event, the legislation should use sound science when laying down prescriptive rules for medicated feed: for example, the threshold at which carryover in mills becomes a genuine issue. British livestock vets are high-grade professionals who need flexibility in how they prescribe and use medicines. If this legislation becomes too restrictive, welfare problems may ensue, with culling as the only solution. I hope that the future independent UK government will think outside the box as regards antimicrobial resistance, because big advances have been made in commercial genetics. Among our wild bird population we find genes that will tolerate a bacterial attack and shrug it off after a few days of lethargy. These genes could be transferred into our own poultry so that medicines are not required in the first place. I’m sure that Ms Molly Scott Cato won’t like that, but it is a genuine solution. Above all else, we must educate our consumers into taking antimicrobial resistance seriously enough to insist to the supermarkets they do not expect to see substandard products on the shelves.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "EFDD", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Eurosceptic conservatives"}, {"id": 283, "date": "2018-10-24.json", "name": "Diane JAMES", "mepid": "124939", "text": "   – Mr President, I don’t share the enthusiasm of some of my fellow MEPs, but I do echo what the previous speaker, Mr Agnew, a fellow UK MEP, stated: the risk to British farming is huge.

For this, I would like to stress the importance of international dialogue to developing common rules through, for example, a dialogue at the G20.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the presentation of this report today marks the culmination of a long work cycle of almost two years on a text fundamental to the future of European transport policy.  The revision of the European directive which regulates road pricing systems over 136,000 km of the trans-European road network represents a unique opportunity to better take into account the impact of road transport on our society. The reason we are revising this text is because the 'Euro-fee' directive, which has helped to combat discrimination between residents and non-residents, has now reached its limits in terms of contributing fully to the objectives of the Transport White Paper to move towards the full application of the principles 'user-pay' and 'polluter-pay' principles. Without a strong measure and a long-term vision of the evolution of road transport pricing, which accounts for more than 70% of emissions from the transport sector, we will not meet our climate targets and we will not respond to the urgent need to better combat the scourge of air pollution that affects our citizens.  In the face of these emergencies, attitudes are changing and road users are increasingly aware and sensitive to the environmental impact of road transport. And it is from this perspective that we, as policy-makers, will have to show courage and will to accompany and accelerate this awareness and the transition to fairer and more environmental road pricing and I would like to take this opportunity to salute the Commissioner's political courage in putting an ambitious text on the table. The extension of the scope to all heavy vehicles and light vehicles, the phasing out of sticker systems or the obligation to adjust tolls according to CO2 emissions, are all measures that I support and which are reflected in the report to be presented to the vote tomorrow.  And the work in the parliamentary committee has improved the European Commission's proposal. Firstly, with regard to the 'user-pay' principle, the Committee on Transport adopted my proposals to advance the end of the vignettes to 2023 for heavy vehicles and 2026 for light vehicles, in order to accelerate the transition to fairer pricing based on distance travelled. Regarding the \"polluter pays\" principle, the Committee on Transport voted in favour of the application of specific charges related to pollution standards from 2021 for heavy vehicles and from 2026 for light vehicles. It is a proposal that will better take environmental and societal costs into account in road pricing and ensure that around 50% of the trans-European road network will be covered by the 'polluter pays' principle.  Alongside the application of these two main principles, the acceptability and transparency of toll systems are at the heart of this report.  First, throughout this work, I have placed central emphasis on the territorial and social dimensions of road infrastructure pricing policies. And to combat the territorial divide, I propose to introduce the possibility of lowering the cost of tolls for frequent users, especially on the outskirts of urban areas and in remote areas. The current directive did not give this opportunity to differentiate toll rates between frequent and occasional users. This is a major step forward that I am proposing to ensure that users who have no choice but to use their car daily to get to work can benefit from a preferential rate compared to casual users.  Also on territorial cohesion, I also propose to give Member States more flexibility to take into account the impact of tolls on peripheral regions. Secondly, I am convinced that introducing mandatory arrowing of royalty revenues to combat the degradation of road networks and to promote the transition to sustainable mobility, the acceptability of tolls will be strengthened. The tragic incident of the collapse of the Morandi point in Genoa reminds us of the cruel lack of investment in the maintenance and safety of road infrastructure in Europe. The proposals in my report that establish mandatory arrowing will ensure that toll revenues will be used to ensure the safety of road infrastructure.  In conclusion, I would like to reiterate the importance of approaching my report as a coherent whole. Proposals for the application of the principles \"polluter-pay\" and \"user-pay\" cannot be analysed without taking into account all proposals to strengthen the acceptability and transparency of tolls.

The Commission proposed a major step to put into practice the application of their polluter-pays and user-pays principle, and I am very glad to see that our level of ambition is shared by the European Parliament, which wishes to go even further in some cases. The proposal presented by the Commission last year as part of the first mobility package aims to make sure that national charging schemes converge. The intention is to modernise charging for trucks and buses and, for the first time, to apply some common principles to cars and vans. To be very clear, we would leave it to Member States to decide whether or not to charge for any infrastructure, but if they decide to do so, they would have to conform to common principles. As a contribution to forward-looking climate change policy, we propose to modulate tolls to reflect the level of CO2 emissions. At the same time, we would simplify the application of external cost-charging to address also other forms of pollution. More regular and thorough reporting on the revenues generated by charges should ensure transparency and, importantly, improve access by users. I very much welcome the wide support for the Commission’s proposal behind the changes proposed by Ms Revault d'Allonnes Bonnefoy. I also know that many amendments in her report aim to go beyond the Commission’s proposal. I believe that your position could ease the discussion later on with the Council. At the same time, in some cases we need to be cautious, as amendments might be difficult to implement. Let me highlight just five key points. First, on the transition to distance-based tolls. I am happy to see that Parliament wants to speed up the transition from time-based user charges to modern and proportionate distance-based tolls. This could ensure fair and efficient road pricing, which is a key element of our policy aiming at the decarbonisation of transport. On the second point – on external cost-charging – we consider that the simplification proposed should make external cost-charging more appealing to Member States. This should help them to tackle the problems of air pollution and noise generated by road transport. At the same time, one should be careful when setting minimum charges both for external costs and for congestion. As actual costs differ between Member States, the Commission favours reference value rather than minimum. On markups, the Commission welcomes the simplification related to the application of markups. These measures can help Member States to finance transport infrastructure of critical importance and thus reduce congestion and environmental damage. Having said that, markups can represent a significant increase in the toll – up to 20% – and it is thus essential that they are applied in full transparency. The notification of such schemes to the Commission is there to ensure such necessary transparency. On discounts counts for frequent users, the Commission is also open to consider appropriate discounts with respect to frequent users who might be most affected by tolls, and it is understood that this has to be done with sufficient safeguards to avoid discrimination against occasional and transit traffic, while following the same common principles. Last but not least, on earmarking. Even though the Council might favour a different approach, I am convinced that the earmarking of toll revenues and the more detailed reporting you propose could contribute a great deal to acceptance of tolls by the users as well as, of course, ensure badly-needed financial means for maintenance of transport infrastructure.

For 20 years, we have tried to put in place a single European system, a system for charging more than 3.5 tonnes on our roads for modes of transport. However, the previous directives have done so very poorly. The consequence is that today in Europe we have a patchwork of sometimes non-interoperable user charges, tolls or vignettes with or without adjusted external costs. This mess does not do justice to our current environmental ambitions or to those of an integrated transport market. In order to remedy this situation, the following points were particularly important to me: firstly, the inclusion of light commercial vehicles, which are in direct competition with lorries over 3.5 tonnes. However, we are not burdening craft enterprises, but we are only concentrating on the professional drivers who are covered by the regulation on the rules on access to the market for cross-border freight transport – access to the market. Secondly, a uniform application of external costs with incentives to invest in clean vehicles with a technologically neutral approach. Thirdly, greater transparency on the use of the fees charged. This is a particularly important point for me, because we absolutely need more investment in our infrastructure. Even economically well-positioned Member States have considerable catching up to do. I voted against a European set of rules on congestion charges. I believe that this will not solve the problem of congestion on our roads. However, the directive does not only deal with lorries, but also with passenger cars. I am clearly answering the question of whether these should fall within the scope of this directive. Why do I think so? The rules on mobility for our citizens must be simple, efficient and non-discriminatory. It is therefore important that each country respects the same rules.

It is clear that we are increasingly moving towards the principle of 'the user pays' and also that of 'the polluter pays', although I believe that in the context of this proposal it should also be taken into account that, when talking about zero-emission vehicles, if zero, it is zero. And, therefore, adorning them with other things might be complicated, and I see that for the Greens, in some cases, even zero-emission ones are not acceptable.  In any case, in peripheral countries, such as Spain or Portugal, or others, we are increasingly being forced to pay by distance that actually places a burden on many of our trading products, which are sometimes or often of low added value. We therefore, in any event, thank the rapporteur for taking special account of the territorial and social dimension in relation to both peri-urban areas and peripheral areas. And, therefore, we totally reject the Greens' attempt to end these possibilities, with that capability, since there are countries that are not only peripheral, but through which the train does not pass because there is no way to pass the train across the border and, therefore, at least, that approach needs to be possible. Some reservations: identifying motorcycles or trying to integrate them largely into cities, especially after the great crisis experienced, has been a good alternative, on the one hand, to save congestion.  We also find that there is some problem in the equalisation, not clearly different, between heavy vehicles and light commercial vehicles, which can lead to clear harm to SMEs; at the very least, we would like to make it clearer in subsequent negotiations in that case. And finally, also in relation to reservations: a certain unilateral obligation that only those who have an on board unit or a subscription can cope with that step.

Mr President, Commissioner, first of all I thank our rapporteur for the quality of her work. In fact, two recent events have shown us how topical this topic is. The report of the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), which has shown an increasingly worrying climate situation, and we know that transport is unfortunately an element that is not under control, and the tragedy of the Morandi Bridge, which showed that infrastructure perhaps deserved a little more attention from our Member States. The European framework for taxing externalities and road users must restore two goals: to be fair and to be effective. And when you look at the chaotic landscape in Europe on taxes on road users, you can say that the work is considerable. We must in fact return to the externalities of each one: depending on the type of vehicle but for all vehicles, according to the kilometres travelled, taking into account the uses, the hours, the place, the existing concessions, it is also an important subject, since there are already perimeters granted - and also encouraging the improvement of the fleet with positive discrimination for the vehicles that are the least polluting. It is up to everyone to decide whether or not to remove unfair and ineffective mechanisms, including vignettes, and of course we support this proposal. It will be up to the Member States to determine whether this scheme applies or not, but it will at least put an end to a totally unfair and totally ineffective situation. Of course, the tax is not popular, especially when it affects all vehicles. But can the situation be allowed to deteriorate, with rising emissions, major consequences on human health in terms of particulate matter and degraded infrastructure with security problems that put human life at risk? It is desirable for Member States to place this scheme within their national burden framework on road transport and make the necessary adjustments. It is desirable that they agree to allocate their revenues to the object that generates them.

Every locomotive in the European Union has to pay a toll on every kilometre of the route. On the road, tolls are voluntary. This should remain the case in Germany, for example, only on motorways, some other roads and for trucks weighing 7.5 tonnes or more. 100% of the rail network is tolled and 1% of the road network. In this way, the environmentally friendly rail system becomes expensive and the climate-damaging road is made cheap by politics. This is crazy, but sad reality, and that must change. We need, at least, fair competition. Every car in the EU is still subsidised by the taxpayer with EUR 1 600 per year because climate, accident and noise costs are not taken into account. The vignette is not only unecological, but also antisocial. For 10 000 kilometres it is just as expensive per year as it is for 200 000 kilometres. Therefore, the vignette must be abolished and replaced by a distance-based toll. We had a large majority in committee for this, and I hope that we will get it here in Parliament. We want a minimum amount for the toll, not a maximum amount. In mountainous regions, they can then estimate the real costs. And frequent drivers must also be treated on an equal footing. There is no flat rate on the railways; why should they be on the streets? Then do it on the railways, so that we at least have fair competition! Transport is the only sector in Europe where emissions have increased since 1990, by 28%! In industry, we have achieved a reduction of 38% with billions of our taxpayers' money, in households by 24%, and only in transport. Transport therefore eats up twice and threetimes what has been achieved in other sectors with billions of our taxpayers' money.

The British public have many times rejected road tolling and road pricing and since your attempts to implement road charging on British cars have failed, you have now set your sights on HGV drivers. This report will only lead to increased costs for hauliers that, like all forms of hidden taxation, will pass on to the public. With the rising tide of Euroscepticism, how do you think the public will feel when their services and food become more expensive because you have increased transport costs? UK hauliers have already been hit hard in the pocket by paying for unnecessary training from the EU’s Driver Certificate of Professional Competence. This was an insult to the common sense of long—standing hauliers. Not only did this cost far too much for the self-employed, it has actually caused a huge shortage of hauliers in the UK. So what is your answer to this problem? To make drivers pay even more to use the roads that they have already paid for through fuel duty, HGV road user levy and then VAT to top it off. This is just bonkers. Hauliers already have far too much paperwork to do when dropping goods off in the UK and the last thing they need is more paperwork. If you carry on at this rate, each driver will need a personal assistant and a filing cabinet in their truck just to meet your demands.

Distance-based charges for heavy-duty vehicles are a step in the right direction.

Coming from a troubled country such as Austria – I am reminded of the Brenner and Tauern motorways – I can only welcome this.

What do motorists do? They go to the small-scale road network. This puts citizens at risk and puts the environment at risk even more than it already is. In addition, as we all know, the risk of accidents on the small-scale road network is 13.5% higher than on motorways. That is the first thing. The second thing that really needs to be said is: how does Europe actually come to educate itself, since it has to make regulations for all states?

On the other hand, I will draw attention to one element which, from my point of view, is very important, to the clarity of politics, to building it so that it is understandable to those who are its addressees.

I would like to thank again all of your Members who have contributed to this discussion. I am really encouraged by seeing that Parliament has confirmed its broad support for the Commission proposals. At the same time, I hear, of course, the concerns regarding the more controversial elements of the proposal, and let me briefly react to some of your concerns.  Some of you suggested that the EU should not regulate road charging for passenger cars. My answer is that we cannot ignore the impact of cars on infrastructure wear and tear and on the environment at local, regional and even at the global level. Cars are responsible for the lion’s share of external costs – two—thirds of CO2 emissions in road transport, which is 60% of all emissions in transport – so we cannot simply ignore that.  Next, we propose to extend the scope of the directive to high vehicles, including LDVs – where there was a comment that this is not the case. For zero-emission vehicles we propose incentives, and I’d like to be very clear on that – a special discount on infrastructure charges of 75% – so that is a very strong incentive.  Let me also insist one more time on the fact that the directive, tomorrow, just like today, will not force Member States to charge for infrastructure. Again, we are setting common rules. That is all we are doing. We are setting common rules, not imposing the level of charges. For example, if the UK imposes a charge on UK HGVs today, this is the result of a UK decision. This proposal does not change that fact.  Allow me also to stress that road charges are not a tax, as this is a way to pay for a service – access to the infrastructure – and for externalities. The Commission has actually proposed allowing Member States to have some additional vehicle tax incentives, if I can call them that, on HGVs in parallel with the introduction of tolls. So this can be already done, and this is part of the proposal.  The Commission receives also numerous complaints about discrimination against foreign motorists, especially from border areas, and recurring complaints against national charging schemes. I do believe that common principles, agreed at EU level, are needed and justified, and all the more so as Member States remain fully free to decide whether to charge or not, but if they do, there are certain rules they should respect – common rules. It is also worth mentioning that common principles are an important element of seamless mobility models that we are foreseeing in the forthcoming years.  As a final remark, let me express one more time my real appreciation for the work you have done. It was crucial to conclude the discussions in Parliament before the elections and I am confident that the position adopted in the European Parliament will serve as a solid base for the negotiations with the Council, so I really look forward to a positive vote tomorrow.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for this debate and for the extremely strong opinions, thank you commissioner for your commitment and your words. Many of the concerns that have been raised in this debate are in fact already covered by the report, particularly on issues related to social issues and the principle of subsidiarity. However, I will go back to one point in particular, which would suggest that excluding light vehicles from the scope of this text would be tantamount to \"defending\" road users. It is quite the opposite because, in fact, excluding light vehicles means voting against reducing tolls by 75% for zero-emission vehicles and voting against reducing tolls for cars that emit less CO2. Excluding light vehicles is therefore penalizing users who are increasingly moving towards clean vehicles and we must not have a short-term vision of the future of road infrastructure pricing. Excluding light vehicles also means voting against reducing tolls for frequent users who have to use toll roads to get to work. But that's not all, excluding cars from the scope is also giving states the opportunity to introduce more discriminatory sticker systems between residents and non-residents.  Those who claim to defend road users by wanting to exclude light vehicles are in fact doing the opposite: they are opposed to fairer road pricing for taxpayers, who now pay for road maintenance in many countries, and for users who will not benefit from the toll modernization proposals included in this report. In conclusion, I would therefore like to call on all colleagues not to reduce the level of ambition of the text in order to arrive at a strong position of the European Parliament, particularly with a view to negotiations with the Member States.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 335, "date": "2018-10-24.json", "name": "Fabio Massimo CASTALDO", "mepid": "124812", "text": "   The debate is closed.

It was therefore necessary to decide whether we are abandoning this regulation at all or reforming a system that is not the most perfect. The Commission decided on the latter solution by proposing a system based on binding purchase, leasing or public tendering services.  In the work in the European Parliament, we first of all had to answer the question of how we understand the definition of a clean vehicle. The majority considered that, in addition to zero-emission vehicles, there should also be vehicles with the best chance of reducing pollutants into the air, both by dust, nitrogen oxides, but also by other pollutants. In seeking an appropriate solution, we decided to base the definition of clean vehicle on an already existing and agreed text, using the fuel list contained in the Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Directive, with certain restrictions on biofuels, in particular the first generation. In this way, we have created synergies between the new law and the existing law. This will promote clean transport, support the development of new technologies such as electric cars or alternative fuels, and thus also improve air quality, allow us to fight smog, a new difficult phenomenon in many cities, and make a brick in the way of achieving the climate objectives agreed in the Paris Agreement.  The objectives that we have adopted must be acho maniable for the public actors who will implement this directive. These regulations must also take into account the principle of subsidiarity. I must therefore stress the need to ensure that these objectives are financed at an appropriate level. Otherwise, local authorities will not be able or unable to buy vehicles whose price currently far exceeds the price of traditional vehicles. It is often twice as high, for example in the case of buses. As a result, they will be slower to replace their rolling stock, which could jeopardise the development of public transport. Many local authorities also have tasks to do, which are related to public transport in non-urban areas, in rural space. There you need a completely different technology when it comes to the drive for these buses. One of the objectives of the Directive is to create contracts for low-emission vehicles on such a scale as to support innovation and the production of vehicles based on new solutions. However, we must also bear in mind European producers so that they do not fall victim to unfair competition. That is why tomorrow we will be voting on an amendment to restore a level playing field for all producers and to encourage those countries that do not allow European producers into their public procurement markets to do so. Otherwise, vehicles produced by companies originating in such countries will not be able to be counted against the objectives of the Directive.  I would also like to appeal – I think I can also say this on behalf of all the shadow rapporteurs, to whom I thank you very much for your cooperation in the work on this regulation – to the Presidency that the European Parliament will be ready to open negotiations from tomorrow. We therefore ask that the Council conclude its work on the general approach quickly so that we can adopt the directive before the end of this parliamentary term.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 338, "date": "2018-10-24.json", "name": "Andrzej GRZYB", "mepid": "23785", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, the Commission welcomes the opportunity today to discuss Mr Grzyb’s report on the revision of the Clean Vehicles Directive, which is an important part of the Clean Mobility Package. The Commission warmly welcomes the progress made in the European Parliament on this file and would like to thank Mr Grzyb and the shadow rapporteurs for their very ambitious work. Let me recall the context of the proposal. The Paris (COP21) Agreement requires substantive emission reductions from all parts of our economy, including transport. The recent special report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) on the impacts of climate change is yet another wake-up call in that respect. We must ensure that we are firmly on the path towards zero emission by mid-century. Among many other things, this means faster deployment of more efficient transport systems, low— and zero—emission vehicles and increased use of alternative energy sources. Public procurement has a special role to play here. This is particularly true in the bus sector, where public procurement represents around 70% of all new vehicle registrations. Public authorities are already today leading the way in the fight against climate change. I therefore welcome this general support in the Parliament’s report for the objectives and the approach that the Commission proposes for the revision of the Clean Vehicles Directive. On some aspects the report goes even further than our initial ambition, by extending its scope to other services and vehicle categories. Compared to the Commission’s proposal, the report takes a different approach to the definition of clean vehicles. It includes all fuels under the Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Directive and introduces sub-targets for low—and zero—emission vehicles. As regards heavy—duty vehicles, as you know, we are not yet able to define emission thresholds. We’re working on it. Including all fuels under the Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Directive could therefore be considered, provided that a sufficient level of ambition for zero-emission vehicles is maintained throughout the sub-targets. For light—duty vehicles, however, we are able to use emission thresholds to define clean vehicles. In my view, this approach remains the best solution for light—duty vehicles, as it is technology-neutral and more future proof. The amended directive should provide a clear long-term market signal allowing public authorities, manufacturers and investors to plan the transition towards zero—emission mobility, based on the technologies and fuels that they deem most suitable. I am pleased to know that work in the Council is also progressing fast and that a general approach is in reach. So let’s therefore all work together to secure a trilogue agreement before the Parliament recess. A timely adoption would be an important step towards the de—carbonisation of mobility.

However, it is important to leave sufficient flexibility and room for manoeuvre at Member State level, because conditions vary greatly across Europe and Member States, municipalities and regions have the best idea of how best to promote clean transport. It is indeed a shortcoming that it has not been possible to define heavy equipment and the use of biofuels for clean transport. We know that biofuels play an important role in clean transport and it is certainly a shortcoming that it has not been possible to take this into account at an adequate level. In addition, the calculation method, which only looks at emissions from the end of the exhaust pipe, does not adequately cover the entire energy consumption and environmental impact. In this respect, therefore, we should be able to promote and improve the calculation method, on the basis of which it is determined what is considered to be a clean vehicle. I am very pleased that the Committee on the Environment has drawn attention to the battery industry and its development needs in Europe. As electronic traffic progresses, it is increasingly important that battery production is also sustainable.

I think we have reached a good position.  The European Union, of course, is undergoing, like the rest of the world, a transition towards sustainable zero carbon mobility – a transition that is, of course, inevitable if we are to be serious about tackling climate change. The question that we are all grappling with is how soon we do it. Last month, this Parliament voted for ambitious new CO2 standards for cars and vans and, together with the Clean Vehicles Directive revision, we can accelerate this transition towards much cleaner public procurement in Europe, as well, I think, as creating a renewed European market through the creation of, if you like, a premium market through public procurement.  Public procurement is 14% of the EU’s GDP and 75% of new bus registrations, and it is essential that we use taxpayers’ money effectively to procure clean vehicles. It is also important, of course, that public authorities set an example to the rest of the economy when it comes to the transition away from fossil fuels. But I have to be honest, I didn’t support initially the alignment with the Directive on Alternative Fuels Infrastructure (DAFI) because I thought that it would weaken the targets but the inclusion of strong sub—targets are very important on this for zero-emission vehicles and I am pleased that we have managed to reach an agreement. I will, of course, be voting for the strongest and most ambitious targets.  It is crucial now that local authorities and governments put their money where their mouth is and ensure that local authorities are properly funded to remove the burden of compliance on local governments and make sure that air pollution targets can be met without penalising local authorities that are cash-strapped. Crucially, tomorrow’s vote in Parliament will mean that we can get this file done under this Presidency, because progress is so important on this. The ball is now firmly in the Council’s court and I hope that we can get sufficient progress quickly.

Without this document, we will not even be able to partially meet the exorbitant targets that we voted for here last time in the context of Mrs Dalli's report. I am therefore extremely sorry for the approach taken by the Austrian Presidency to discuss the directive, which is in no hurry to conclude it. It is not at all clear whether we will be able to conclude the document in this legislative period, yet without massive public sector assistance, the market for clean vehicles cannot be opened up in a timely and sufficiently broad manner.  On the adopted text, I certainly welcome the sensible definition of a clean vehicle. What I do not like, however, is the over-fixation of the 2025 targets only on electric vehicles. The solution adopted by the Committee does not take into account the billions of dollars spent on infrastructure for LPG and CNG cars, which, while slightly higher in CO2 than the 50g received, are significantly lower than conventionally powered vehicles.

Unfortunately, however, from our point of view, for the 5 Star Movement, we are wasting it. Tying up until 2030 the definition of a clean vehicle to fuels that are dirty, such as oil and natural gas, means clearing the way for the transformation of the market on the demand side, in particular buses, which are now mainly powered by diesel, in fact also disregarding the recommendations of the EMIS committee, the committee that investigated precisely the dieselgate scandal , which urged public authorities to buy zero-emission vehicles. From our point of view, this updated text complicates even more the procurement procedures for the authorities of the Member States that will have to buy clean vehicles. The definition of a clean vehicle, as it is present in this text today, has in fact not allowed us to insist on an operation, that of retrofitting, which is, from our point of view, fundamental to updating, improving and really having vehicles that are clean on the roads.

I am happy to know that there is broad support in Parliament for these proposals and objectives. Let me comment on some of your questions and comments. On the comment related to EU manufacturers, most EU manufacturers already have clean vehicles on the market and are investing to further expand their offer well before the date of application of this revised directive. Many EU cities, regions and transport authorities have also already taken strategic decisions to advance the introduction of clean vehicles. The proposal will not penalise EU manufacturers. On the contrary, it will facilitate their investment planning and help them remain competitive in this market. This is particularly needed in light of the quickly accelerating global competition and increasing market share of non-EU manufacturers. In addition, the Commission is open to considering an alternative approach, based on alternative fuels, only if the proposed sub—targets for zero-emission vehicles are maintained at a necessary level of ambition. Finally, let me stress again that I warmly welcome your ambition to conclude the negotiation before the parliamentary recess. There are of course certain aspects that will need to be clarified in cooperation with the Council, but I am confident that the right solution can be found and swift agreement can be reached between the co-legislators.

I can say that, for example, this indicator that seventy per cent of buses are bought in public procurement shows how much impact public procurement can have on the replacement of rolling stock and on its quality, and on the level of emissions that this rolling stock goes for.  On the other hand, we are also aware that in public transport, for example, the use of buses is not a period of seven or eight years, as in the case of cars, for example passenger cars. This is often a period of fifteen years, and therefore there is a proposal here, which has also been criticised, retrofitting, that is, the reconstruction of the drive units in these buses. We believe that this is extremely important because many local authorities – for example, Tallinn, many other cities – in consultation when we met with representatives of local and regional authorities – have spoken about this. We have done this work. What is more important to buy one new electric bus or to replace, for example, ten buses with old diesel engines? It seems to me that here we get much greater results in a shorter period of time. Each of these elements will have an impact on the final effect of the objective that we want to achieve with this directive.  The second issue, of course, is biofuels. We are convinced that, with the objectives that we have set ourselves in the recirculation economy and with the experience that local authorities show us, the introduction of biofuels, in particular those derived from, for example, recycled organic waste, is also an objective that is already being achieved in many local authorities, within so-called energy clusters or local energy communities. That is what we should take into account. Finally, I would also like to say that many local authorities have also started to make changes to their public transport and service services towards clean vehicles. Often, the proportion of these vehicles in countries that are not the richest is much higher than in countries that have much higher GDP per capita. So local governments have noticed this opportunity to improve air quality, because transport is responsible for forty to sixty percent of emissions. So I think we have allies here – not only those who defend themselves against European regulation, but also those who want to benefit from this regulation.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the commissioners for their excellent work and for the work she has done. It is remarkable: I do not believe that there is a head of government in the EU who does not want workers in the EU as a whole to become more mobile. Wherever possible, we stress that the European labour market lacks the will to be more mobility- If we want mobile workers, we must finally enable them to be mobile. This can only be done through education and training, and it can only be done by automatically recognising learning periods abroad in the EU. However, the reality is different: the vast majority of pupils who complete a longer-term study abroad lose a school year in their home country. In 1997, almost a quarter of a century ago, the Lisbon Convention was adopted. In principle, this Convention is intended to recognise a university entrance qualification granted in the Contracting State in all Contracting States, as well as degrees and periods of study, without any problems. However, non-compliance with this principle is a reality: recognition procedures take months, administrative procedures between Member States, even in some cases between regions within a Member State, are not coordinated. Despite European guidelines, local tax bases vary considerably. Career planning based on educational attainment obtained abroad is therefore still almost impossible. Those affected feel swayed and exposed to arbitrariness. For 25 years, we have not been able to overcome such hurdles in the European Higher Education Area, and even more so in the educational area to be created, in such a way that it seems attractive enough for trainees to complete learning periods abroad. Our students are best off, but each of us is likely to know a person in his or her own environment who is studying or training, who is grumting with what appears to be nonsensical, lengthy procedures. The free movement of workers remains a right that actually exists only on paper. Or do the counter-test: has you recently met any young European who said: \"I spent a training period abroad, my recognition went perfectly smoothly, in two weeks everything was done, great!\"? I don't. Exactly what was supposed to be a reality for 25 years sounds like a joke to our ears today. That, ladies and gentlemen, is the real scandal! Now, thankfully, the Commission is trying to launch a proposal to promote automatic recognition. As recently as November, at the Gothenburg Summit, all the Member States declared that the European Education Area was a huge step forward and, above all, that it was extremely important. However, as soon as it comes to the concrete implementation of the idea, unfortunately, the over-the-top concerns win again: an automatic system is not compatible with subsidiarity. Why not? Because if it is entirely up to the Member States to create such an automatic system within seven years, I do not know where there is to be a violation of subsidiarity. It is immediately assumed that the Commission is involved in learning content. However, this is not at any point in the proposal. Those who can read have a clear advantage here. Surely it really cannot be too much to agree within the next seven years on automatic recognition of learning periods, which eliminates the need for separate recognition procedures, especially as all EU Member States have committed themselves to the Lisbon Convention, and have done so for almost 20 years now. I have the impression that the wake-up call that the Commission launched with the Gothenburg Summit was still too quiet to be heard in the Member States and, above all, to be understood in this clarity. The fact that the European Education Area's goal by 2025 not only sounds nice, but is, in my view, an increasingly urgent problem to be solved in terms of skills shortages, language skills shortages, deficits in the field of mathematics and science, deficits in digital skills and the increasing demand for more mobile workers, has, in my view, been completely insufficiently understood by the Member States. There is no other explanation for why some are so opposed to automatisms in mutual recognition. I firmly believe that we need to be much more committed to the ideas for achieving a European Education Area by 2025. Ultimately, it is a question of justice and esteem: not only to students whose mobility through the European Higher Education Area has already been developed. Politically, we must offer this advantage much better to trainees and school leavers. In this respect, I hope that tomorrow, as in the Committee on Culture, the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the European Parliament, will finally have a broad majority and that the Heads of State or Government will finally come to reflection.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 361, "date": "2018-10-24.json", "name": "Petra KAMMEREVERT", "mepid": "96837", "text": "   Commission. – Mr President, I am taking this question on behalf of my colleague, Commissioner Navracsics, who unfortunately cannot be here this evening. On behalf of the Commission I would like to thank Ms Kammerevert for tabling this oral question at a time when the Commission and Council are discussing the Commission’s proposal for a Council recommendation on promoting the automatic mutual recognition of higher education and upper secondary education diplomas, and the outcomes of learning periods abroad. The question is a strong sign of support for this important topic in the Parliament, and I would like to thank you for that. Indeed, automatic mutual recognition of diplomas and study periods abroad is key for ensuring the free movement of learners across Europe. It is a key element in creating a European education area, where learning, studying and carrying out research are unimpeded by borders. Learning mobility fosters competences and experiences help people to participate more effectively in society and in the labour market. It fosters labour mobility, contributing to individual and economic resilience. The recent mid-term evaluation of the Erasmus+ programme demonstrates that mobility has a positive impact on learners’ confidence, independence and transition to employment. When compared to their non-mobile peers, Erasmus students are more entrepreneurial, have better language skills and are more likely to get a job. However, in order to make learning mobility a reality, it is crucial that learners have the confidence that their qualifications in another country would be recognised upon their return. I am therefore glad that from next month, Member States will make a political commitment to put in place by 2025 the steps that are needed for automatic recognition of higher education and upper secondary education qualifications, and the outcomes of learning periods abroad. This political commitment will be accompanied by actions to help Member States to build trust in each other’s education systems, because without trust, automatic recognition will not work. The Commission will be supporting Member States in this process through a series of concrete actions, such as exchanges of good practice, building synergies between EU transparency tools, and exploring the potential of digital technologies – in particular blockchain – to facilitate automatic recognition. The Commission, through the Erasmus+ programme, also provides funding to the national academic recognition information centres to facilitate cooperation and recognition. This year alone, EUR 1 million was allocated to these projects, including digital exchange of student data, creating a digital database of school-leaving qualifications, and the recognition of qualifications held by refugees. Of course, we are not starting from scratch. Several Member States already have systems which allow for automatic recognition of diplomas, and we can learn from them. For example, there is the Benelux decision on the automatic recognition of higher education qualifications; the Nordic and Baltic agreements to recognise higher education and school leaving qualifications; bilateral agreements, such as the one between France and Italy on the recognition of school leaving qualifications; and the Nordic, Franco-German, Austrian and Italian arrangements to recognise mobility periods during secondary education. The Commission is convinced that its vision for a European education area and the many initiatives that stem from it will enable Member States to make progress quickly while inspiring the non-EU Member States in wider European higher education. This impetus is important, because after 30 years of cooperation through both the Lisbon Recognition Convention and the Erasmus programme, learners still face avoidable problems with the recognition of their diplomas and study periods abroad. This is not acceptable. In conclusion, let me underline that improving learning mobility and the exchange of ideas have a positive impact on education systems throughout Europe, and they contribute to the creation of a dynamic, innovative education community. There is no evidence that automatic recognition will cause a brain drain or weaken Member States’ education systems. On the contrary, it will ensure that learners can study abroad with the confidence that their learning outcomes and their qualifications will be recognised. This will encourage – and should encourage – more learners to participate and return after their time abroad, and more academic and education institutes can support mobility and automatic recognition. I wish to thank again Ms Kammerevert for raising this question, and I look forward to hearing the views of the Members.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "S&D", "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 362, "date": "2018-10-24.json", "name": "Michaela ŠOJDROVÁ", "mepid": "124710", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, Commissioner, colleagues, I think we can agree with the need for automatic recognition of higher education results in other Member States. The objectives are in line with what is happening in the Bologna Process, which is linked to the emerging European education area and should be further strengthened. We also support the idea that qualifications at upper secondary education level should be automatically recognised for further study in another Member State. The European Union needs to have a better framework for the recognition of educational outcomes and recognition of qualifications than that offered today by the Lisbon Convention. The Commission should therefore shed light on its precise intentions. Its proposal for a Council recommendation is addressed to the Member States, but the European Parliament plays an important role here and cannot be left out.  As regards the Council recommendation itself, I consider it important to better define the term learning agreement, because in some parts of the text it refers to tertiary and in some cases only to secondary education.

To date, around 65 % of Europeans with a qualification find it difficult to have them recognised outside their own country, and 59 % of those studying for a period in an institution in an EU country other than their own have difficulty validating credits once they return to their country. To date, progress has been made, but only through bilateral agreements between certain States, steps which are, moreover, important references to the automatic recognition of diplomas throughout the EU. As the European Union, we must therefore take a new course so that the Member States, overcoming resistance and reluctance, mutually recognise the value of qualifications awarded by other EU Member States, if necessary by defining additions to curricula in order to acquire substantially homogeneous levels of preparation for, for example, declarations of comparability of upper secondary school diplomas. All this in order to finally create a real European education area that allows strong mobility for students, teachers and workers, taking due account of the objective needs of people with disabilities or disadvantaged people, including refugees and migrants.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 364, "date": "2018-10-24.json", "name": "María Teresa GIMÉNEZ BARBAT", "mepid": "135491", "text": "  on behalf of the ALDE Group. – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, freedom of establishment, freedom to provide services and the free movement of students and workers in the Union are fundamental principles of the Treaties, which are at the root of European construction.

Among the measures we suggest I would like to highlight the regular issuance of declarations of comparability of higher secondary education diplomas; systematic use of the ratings table and the European credit transfer system; the use of a European student card with the aim of facilitating mutual recognition of diplomas and learning periods abroad, while reducing administrative burdens and costs.

Mr President, Commissioner, the Commission's proposal for automatic joint recognition of higher and secondary education degrees is yet another attempt to remove the right that Member States have so far to shape their education systems, the content of qualifications and teaching methods. The implementation of the proposal is also based on a tool-based view of knowledge and education, the qualification market and the pieces of knowledge certified and recognised throughout Europe. Ladies and gentlemen, the Commission's recommendations to the Council seek, through homogenisation, to bring education systems in the Member States into line with the political priorities of the neoliberal European Union. We have seen in practice the results now of the Bologna Process and the Commission's guidelines and education, Commissioner. The political priorities of the neoliberal European Union in education are the degradation and underfunding of public education, the conversion of studies into educational products, the introduction of tuition fees in universities, the subordination of curricula to the requirements of the market, degrees without real rights, the deterioration of the role of students and teachers in the decision-making process, the ejection of the 'brain drain' phenomenon which mainly benefits the powerful countries to the detriment of the countries of the South. I don't know if that's what we're talking about. Three hundred thousand scientists have left Greece in the years of crisis and have gone to stronger countries.

The question was addressed to the Commission, but the task is de facto for states to make the effort, the effort in their own countries, the automatic recognition of diplomas that arise in other countries.  Finally, I would like to draw attention to only two elements. Firstly, the importance of the Erasmus+ programme, which builds and experiences, and some common denominators for the education acquired in each country by young people from different European Union countries. And the second thing to recall is some of the legal uncertainty that is currently building as a result of a potential Brexit.

We cannot have Member States with public procurement that requires post-Bologna level training and that leave out citizens who have completed the same level curriculum equated in the pre-Bologna education framework and in some cases even with more years of study and more ECT. We are talking about automatic recognition of diplomas between Member States, but we seem to have forgotten to reconcile recognition with our recent past. At the level of transnational cooperation, using information and communication technologies, the recognition of the source qualifications for access to regulated professions takes place through the online platform Internal Market Information System. You don't have to invent the wheel to do the same across the educational system. I do not want it to be said that preparing future generations involves harmonising education at European level. The diversity of curricula allows us to prepare citizens with greater adaptation to the challenges of each Member State and gives us greater adaptability to face the future.

These are problems that should be addressed and which we should not leave in the air in any way.  On the other hand, as I support mutual recognition, it must be said that there are certain fields where mutual recognition is not entirely possible. My colleague here named the issue of legal education that Italian lawyers had registered in the Madrid Law Chamber. In short, this is precisely the type of education, study of law and legal sciences, where each country, thanks to its own legal system, has its own education. This needs to be approached selectively and the fields where universal quality is possible and where this is influenced by national specificities, e.g. the legal system of a given country, are possible.

The right to education is a fundamental human right that must be guaranteed to all.

I think it is important that higher education degrees are finally mutually recognised in the European Union and that the administrative barriers to recognition are finally removed.

Unfortunately, obstacles are emerging in this regard. Students are often not guaranteed that their diplomas obtained in one Member State will be recognised in another. I support the proposed EC recommendations, the consequences of which will enable the creation of an integrated European education area and the functioning of an open European labour market, but should be implemented in all Member States. It should be noted, however, that it is the individual countries that are responsible for their education and training systems. The automatic recognition of diplomas should be without prejudice to the right of education and training institutions to decide on the admission of a candidate.  An important aspect of the project is the voluntary involvement in the proposed actions of individual countries, while respecting their competences. The planned actions should complement national actions.

The Presidency takes note of the report from the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment, which has alerted us to the risks deriving from placing on the market potentially harmful chemicals without correctly assessing whether they are mutagenic, teratogenic or toxic. The Presidency thanks Members for drawing our attention to these risks and the magnitude of the problem. We also take note of the fact that the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) agrees with the report’s overall assessment, confirming that the quality of data on chemicals in registration dossiers still needs to improve. This view is also shared by the Presidency. In the 10 years since REACH entered into force, safety in the EU has undoubtedly increased, but there is still much to do. Both industry and the authorities must increase their efforts to improve the quality of safety information on chemicals. It should be stressed though that the Council’s role in this process has recently been very limited as no new legislation in the area of REACH has been proposed since the mid—term review in 2013. ECHA’s Enforcement Forum is currently designing tailored enforcement actions, together with Member States, to increase compliance of the dossiers concerned. In instances such as these, it is to the Commission, in its role as guardian of the Treaties and as enforcer of Union level legislation, that we should turn for guidance and action that is appropriate and justified.  On that note, if you allow me, I would like to draw your attention to the second REACH review, which was discussed in the Council bodies earlier this year. This report showed that, in the 10 years since its entry into force, REACH has become fully operational and is delivering results towards achieving its stated objectives. We should not lose sight of the progress made.  The report, however, also identifies priorities and actions needed to further improve the application of the REACH Regulation. Among these, it was noted that Member States identified the quality of registration dossiers as the main issue that needs to be addressed in a timely manner. Member States expressed concerns about two things; firstly, that some registration dossiers do not comply with the information requirement that the REACH Regulation lays down, and, secondly, how updates to registration dossiers can be ensured. As to time, in June of this year, the Commission expressed its intention to work with the European Chemicals Agency and the Member States to identify the reasons for the poor quality of dossiers’ updates. The Commission also signalled that it would make the appropriate proposals for improvements to this system by the first quarter of 2019. The Presidency is launching discussions on this issue in the Council working groups concerned. Moreover, the Presidency is convening an international conference on the future chemicals policy in October in Vienna and another one on green chemistry in November. The Presidency will provide a progress report to the Competitiveness Council, as well as to the Environmental Council. The Presidency would like to join the calls on the European Chemicals Agency, as well as on Member States, to show that they are serious about protecting human health and the environment. We call on both industry and the authorities to increase their efforts on improving the quality of registration dossiers and, of course, the Council also looks forward to any proposal that the Commission may present in the future. I would like to conclude for now by expressing my gratitude for this opportunity to join in your discussion here today. I look forward to hearing your views and to conveying them back to my colleagues in the Council.

Reach is the most comprehensive chemical legislation in the world. It was designed to address the knowledge gap on the chemicals manufactured and used in Europe and to speed up risk reduction strategies for those substances that are harmful for health and harmful for the environment. The basic condition of Reach is no data, no market. This means that companies must register the chemicals they make or import. Without registration, the substance is not allowed on the market.  In these registration dossiers, the companies must detail the impact of the chemicals on human health and the environment, and how to manage those risks. Prior to registration, the European Chemicals Agency assesses all dossiers for completeness. The Chemicals Agency and the Member States’ competent authorities also carry out targeted evaluations to check that the dossiers comply with the legal requirements. The Commission is aware of recent reports indicating that an estimated one—third of the registration dossiers are non—compliant.  The need to improve compliance of registration dossiers was one of the main findings of the second review carried out earlier this year, and specific actions are already being taken to address this issue. For example, we have asked and tasked the European Chemicals Agency to increase the efficiency of the evaluation procedures by 2019. We would like to stress that already now when a dossier is found to be non—compliant, it must be remediated by the respective company and brought into compliance. The Reach Regulation requires the Chemicals Agency to check the compliance of at least 5% of all registration dossiers. The Agency does this by targeted compliance checks of the registration dossiers that matter most through its so-called integrated regulatory strategy. We are also looking at incentives to companies to regularly review the registration dossiers and update them when necessary. We should not lose sight of the fact that the Reach review confirmed that, overall, Reach is functioning and meeting its objectives, notwithstanding what I have just said. By the last registration deadline in May this year, more than 21 000 substances in 90 000 registration dossiers were registered at the European Chemicals Agency. This is a large amount of information unique in the world and it represents much more and better information on substances that are on the EU market, in 10 years.  The Reach review also confirmed that Reach improved risk management of chemicals by companies as well as communication and safety along the supply chains. Reach has also led to the listing of 191 substances of very high concern on the candidate list. This is in addition to the 68 entries on the restrictions list which represents hundreds of hazardous substances that are now banned.  Altogether, this means that hazardous chemicals are being replaced by safer alternatives. The evaluation procedure will help identify more substances of concern, I have no doubt. Enforcement is, of course, of huge importance and this is the responsibility of Member States. Coordination of their activities through the enforcement forum is proving reasonably satisfactory at EU and national level.  Based on the findings of the Reach review, I strongly believe that Reach has already contributed to the protection of EU citizens’ health and the environment, but there is much more work needed to be done to improve implementation. I am calling on the constructive cooperation of all parties involved to improve the effectiveness of our legislation.

It should be seen, moreover, that of the 40,000 registration submissions only four will have been rejected, which is much less than the rejections before reach was implemented. Of course, we have to take into account that ECHA only has to carry out follow-up checks on about 5% of the dossiers, yes, only in 5%. The Commission will think that the REACH procedure is a success because it imposes barriers to entry through market access requirements and hence there are only four rejections, but no. From the assessment conducted by the German Federal Institute of Risk Assessment and the German Environment Agency, it was concluded that the number of compliant substances never exceeded 50% in the criteria of biotic and abiotic gradation of bioaccumulation and ecotoxicity. Furthermore, the evaluation of this institute considered that the standard requirements are not well applied in the dossiers because they use experimental data or parallel data, or do not present full justification for the absence of data. Chemicals need to be taken more seriously and ECHA is more accountable for its assessment. One third of high-volume chemicals, manufactured or imported into the Union since 2010, do not comply with rules to protect health and the environment. We are talking about mutagenic substances with environmental toxicity that affect biodiversity and human toxicity that can induce health problems such as metabolic, oncological and endocrine diseases.  The Commission certainly knows that there are other dangerous chemicals that we regularly use with a much tighter legal mesh, medicines, but here the collaboration between Member States is much greater.

Many companies are therefore in breach of REACH by not informing the European Chemicals Agency whether the substances they market are carcinogenic or harmful. Millions of tons of these substances have been drained for the production of all kinds of industrial and consumer goods, from painting, packaging, furniture to building materials. Exposure to many types of industrial chemicals, mainly through skin respiration, is a leading cause of increasing rates of metabolic diseases, hormonal cancers and neurological diseases. The UN Special Rapporteur on Hazardous Substances and Waste has warned that unceasing exposure to toxic substances could create a silent pandemic of disease. It is therefore urgent to change this scenario. Concrete actions are needed to verify and strengthen the implementation of REACH.

In order to do so, sufficient information on hazardous chemicals must be available. It is a fact that many chemicals have been placed on the EU market, sometimes in very high quantities, without sufficient information on the dangers they pose to human health and the environment. Nowadays, however, there is already a wide range of test methods used, with efforts to avoid testing on laboratory animals and alternative methods of testing being preferred. In this context, it should be noted that the implementation of REACH legislation, including proper testing of chemicals, is the responsibility and responsibility of the Member States. Each Member State is obliged to set up control mechanisms, including sanctions for breaches of reach provisions. The European Chemical Agency, which is in contact with national supervisory authorities, also plays a role here, drawing their attention to any findings of deficiencies. This is how the whole system is set up and I believe it is set up well, I see no reason for revolutionary changes. The consistent application of the existing rules is the right way to go. I want to speak out here in defence of REACH legislation, which I consider to be the most advanced and comprehensive legislation on chemicals in the world. Indeed, many other countries in the world have been inspired by the EU's example. EU industry now produces chemicals that are safer for citizens and the environment.

We are just out setting out the facts of the situation, Mr Eickhout. The issue of non—compliance of registration of dossiers is not unexpected and was foreseen by the decision—makers with the compliance check process. This is the reason why the second review was carried out and, arising from that review, there were recommendations made and I just want to tell you about some of them that have been implemented. So it’s not that there’s nothing happening. The European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), with the support of the Member States and the Commission, has been working on the effectiveness and the efficiency of the process. The Commission has requested ECHA to significantly increase the efficiency of the evaluation procedures by 2019 – that’s not far away – by identifying reasons for non—compliance and developing the necessary remedies to improve the procedures and the work—sharing with the Member States.  This is not happening in the best possible way at the moment, but we want to ensure that the processes do work – and can work in parallel – and, importantly, to address the groups of substances where appropriate.  So concrete changes in decision—making are already taking place and a first 14 substance group compliance check decisions are in the final adoption stage in ECHA. The Commission has encouraged as well, of course, the updating of registration dossiers by the first quarter of 2019 to specify further the situations that trigger updates, as well as to set precise deadlines. We have an implementing regulation, supporting the implementation of REACH Article 22, being considered by the Commission and this work is ongoing.  Enhanced enforcement is very important and you and other speakers have raised this. So, by the first quarter in 2019, the Commission will consider further measures that are necessary in order to ensure that we have better enforcement. The objective of the action is wider, but we will also address the issue of registration dossier compliance.  The work of the German Institute is very welcome. I stress though that the German Institute’s project was established to estimate the data quality. It was not the legal compliance of the dossiers that it was asked to do. This is a matter for ECHA. Nevertheless, it is a very valuable contribution towards bringing this issue up the agenda and ensuring that we all have to do better in order to make sure that the dossiers are registered and that there is full compliance with what was intended in relation to the REACH proposals in the past.
