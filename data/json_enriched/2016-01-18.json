This is a very worrying situation, because measures, which, in the eyes of quite a large number of us, constitute offences, are being taken in this country. The situation in Denmark is worrying, in the sense that measures are being taken, the final adoption of which is scheduled for 26 January, which, at least in the eyes of a number of us, seem to be at odds with the values of the Union. We discussed this in the Conference of Presidents and agreed on the following procedure: tonight - I say this evening - the Committee on Civil Liberties would hear from a representative of the Danish Government and, following this meeting, the coordinators of the Committee on Civil Liberties would meet and decide whether or not the time for debate in plenary is necessary. However, we note that we still do not know whether the Committee on Civil Liberties will hear from a representative of the Danish government. In any case, it certainly won't be tonight , which was agreed. So it will not happen tonight and it is certain that the coordinators will not meet tonight. In this case, it seems to me normal, Mr President, to provide a plenary slot to discuss the situation in Denmark, since we still do not know whether or not the Committee on Civil Liberties will decide, in its wisdom, to meet on this matter with a representative of the Danish Government. In other words, if we decide to play the clock, perhaps this Parliament will debate in plenary, but post-factum, that is, during the february I session period, in other words after the Danish government's decision. So as much - and I said this in the Conference of Presidents - I fully understand that the European Commission can only decide on decisions of the acts of law taken in the Member States, as much as I think this Parliament has a role of warning. I therefore believe that the debate must be held in this Parliament before the Danish Government and the Danish Parliament decide, rather than afterwards. And since the conditions are not right for the debate in the LIBE committee, I think that we must provide for it as a precautionary measure, at least in plenary, and if, fortunately, the LIBE committee were to meet and its coordinators feel that a debate has become unnecessary, we will cancel this debate in plenary.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "Verts/ALE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Greens and regionalists"}, {"id": 4, "date": "2016-01-18.json", "name": "Martin SCHULZ", "mepid": "1911", "text": "   Thank you, Mr Lamberts.

Mr President, I would like to thank the I have waited a little longer for those Members who are not interested in the subject to leave the Chamber. Today we are discussing Parliament's opinion on the 2014 competition report. Since we do not have legislative powers in competition policy, it is particularly important that we give our opinion on these decisions of the European Commission every year. I would like to begin by thanking the Commissioner, Mrs Vestager, with which we worked very well over the last year. Although the report concerns ten months of her predecessor Almunia's term of office and only two months of her own term of office, this report has discussed important choices that are important for further development. The report was published on 4 June. We adopted this report in the ECON Committee on 7 December with 40 votes in favour, 6 against and 4 abstentions. It comprises a total of 117 points addressed to the Commission, the Member States and the sectors, in particular the Commission. I believe that we must keep pointing out the importance of competition policy. The EU Commission has extensive powers to prohibit prohibited price fixing and impose fines, to prevent mergers or to impose conditions, to control, recover or prohibit state aid. And in all these areas, it is particularly important that the democratic legitimacy of this competition policy is questioned. That is why there are two proposals in this report that, as far as possible, the codecision procedure should be introduced in future as part of a treaty amendment and, in addition, that we should also ensure that the same services responsible for enforcement, penalties, are not responsible for the basic guidelines, and cooperation is important. I would like to mention a few of the points in this report that we have taken up in general. Firstly, it has been called for cartel penalties not to be imposed only on legal persons, as in the past, but also in future on natural persons who are responsible for the whole thing. Secondly, the emphasis on the digital economy has been highlighted. We need new models of assessment here, we need new criteria. That is where the Commission is involved, and we want to support it in this. I want to remind you of Facebook's takeover of WhatsApp. The purchase price was 19 billion U.S. dollars. The EU Commission has waved this through. WhatsApp reported last week that they now have more than a billion users. In other words, new criteria are needed here. The third issue is the issue of tax avoidance and unfair tax competition. Here I would like to encourage the Commissioner to continue to do so. Last week, a decision against Belgium was published, which granted special conditions to 35 companies. We await the lawsuits against Google, Apple and Amazon. That is why it is also important that the Special Committee has called for a common consolidated corporate tax base and that we have decided on automatic exchanges. However, it is also important that we look at the VAT Directive, because Amazon pays only 0.5 per cent in taxes in Luxembourg for its European sales. In addition, with the case of state aid, we have the problem that, in the legal evaluation of tax procedures, penalties go to the States, in other words to the perpetrators. We need to examine whether the legal basis is being changed, whether the Commission is making a proposal here that it is not those who caused this that will receive these fines, but those who have been harmed. And the best way would be to put all these things in the EU budget, as is already the case with other antitrust procedures. I know that there are legal problems. Finally, I would like to express my sincere thanks to all the members of the European Commission who have been involved intensively and to the shadow rapporteurs. I hope that, despite a number of amendments and split votes, the report will be able to obtain a broad majority tomorrow, so that competition policy can emerge from the corner of the stepchild of the social market economy and the internal market. All of us here in Parliament support your work and hope for good results, Mrs Vestager!", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 12, "date": "2016-01-18.json", "name": "Werner LANGEN", "mepid": "1928", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, first of all thank you very much for inviting me here today, and very warm thanks to Mr Langen, both for his introductory remarks but most of all for the substantial work that has been done with the report and in the co-work with the shadow rapporteurs. The very fundamental thing here is that we are together in this, making sure that competition law is enforced and that it is done in a way that supports the everyday life of citizens. One obvious point is that powerful companies who are successful do not misuse their power, that we keep the market open, keep the playing field level, and make sure that every company has a fair chance of making it if they can attract consumers.  As you well know, I have opened a public consultation on the work of the national competition agencies. We in the Commission, and therefore hopefully also you, are very dependent on their strength and commitment, as well as the decisions they take using European law. I hope very much that together we can strengthen the competences of the national competition agencies and I will do my utmost to make sure that Parliament will have full engagement in these efforts. I very much appreciate that you are focusing your attention on the work that we do when it comes to corporate taxation. I think this is very crucial to keeping the playing field level. If one company can pay very little or almost no taxes and another one just pays the taxes by the book, obviously there is a distortion of competition.  Last week we took a decision on the Belgian ‘excess profit’ scheme, declaring that it is illegal under state aid legislation. First of all, because it gives multinationals a selective tax advantage that their domestic competitors cannot get. Secondly, because instead of ensuring that profits are attributed to the right group company and taxed there, the system just exempted a proportion of profits from taxation.  With this decision we take another step forward in ensuring that we have companies paying their fair share of taxes. But of course we need to do that in cooperation and I very much appreciate the work done here in Parliament in the Special Committee on Tax Rulings but also in the Working Group on Competition. Keeping markets fair and open also relates to mergers. And here it is very important to have lively debates about how we apply our Merger Regulation. I think the report makes a very valuable contribution to that discussion and, in the end, merger control also relates to the consumer and the individual and making sure that the consumer can have affordable prices, high quality and, of course, choice. As the market has gone global, it is very important that our enforcement is global as well and I think it is very important that we do not give up on our European values but do our best to work with counterparts in the US, in China, in South Africa, in South Korea and in Canada, to make sure that these values of fair and open competition are the values that we work with globally. We work with that in the international competition network, in the OECD and in UN entities. I think this is very important, both when negotiating free trade agreements, where we are discovering anti-trust-relevant cartels and mergers, and when entering into state aid.  In conclusion, I would say that a lot of things have happened. It is clearly reflected in your report, Mr Langen. We have worked on making digital markets work better by launching a sector inquiry into e-commerce; we have had cases concerning Google and concerning Qualcomm; we have acted to protect the internal market for energy with our cases involving Gazprom and Bulgaria Energy Holding; we have launched the first ever sector inquiry into state aid, looking into capacity mechanisms; and we continue our actions against cartels affecting products that consumers use every day.

The report recognises well the need for better management and coordination of tax policy so that we can avoid abuses. It is also necessary to create fair competition in Europe's internal market. It is bad for the internal market when tax policy is used aggressively and without transparency to provide better conditions of competition to large companies. We talk a great deal about small and medium-sized enterprises in this house, but it is precisely the large companies that are doing this thinking and being able to move profits where tax is not - or hardly - paid, whereas SMEs have to pay at box one.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I wanted to draw your attention to a number of specific points that are of particular interest to the Committee on the Internal Market, but not only. The first concerns the digital single market: we need common rules; we must quickly overcome the differences, country by country, precisely in order to give meaning to competition and not to make this instrumental and improper, just as state aid must be aimed, when it is there, at growth and development, in order also to give a quality to competition between individual companies.  But I would particularly like to insist on you on the tax side: today there is no uniform tax legislation in Europe, which seriously harms small businesses. As long as there is no obligation to report in every country what they do and what companies pay in taxes, we will have a situation of inequality that will end up giving a very heavy blow to the expectations and potential of small businesses.

It is important and right that the Commission investigates the tax practices of multinational companies, that it sends a clear stop to illegal aid and 0% tax rates. The citizens of Europe should know that illegal aid is sanctioned through tax law in Europe. And the citizens should also know that the honest taxpayer in Europe is not being let down politically. Competition policy certainly has a crucial role to play here. However, the investigation of high-profile tax cases is not enough either. We urgently need to adapt competition policy for the fast-growing digital economy. A difficult market definition must not protect against antitrust proceedings or proceedings against market abuse. We call on you, Commissioner, to continue your strict approach to Internet giants such as Google swiftly and transparently. We want an effective, efficient and, above all, honest competition policy. We call for strict organisational separation within the executive and legislative departments of the Competition Commission.

The first one is about the scope, the powers and the methods of DG Competition. Its remit amounts to one of the most powerful tools in the executive kit of the European Commission, indeed of the European Union. DG Competition has the power to set and change market rules within the Union affecting a wide range of economic and financial issues. It can, and it does, issue orders to governments and corporations, big and small, regarding decisions they have taken or need to take. It is run by competent technocrats operating under the overall mantle of the Commission.  In arriving at decisions the DG carries out inquiries and investigations following an opaque process of negotiations that happens mostly behind closed doors. Political, economic, social, personal and national factors enter into play. In this, being ‘big’ is of greater account probably than being ‘small’. There is little transparency and hardly any accountability.  Moreover, there is an overlap between those whose job it is to set the rules and those implementing them. The two roles of setting rules and of implementing them should be institutionally separate and both should adopt more transparent methods. There is an urgent need to review DG Competition’s modus operandi as well as to reform its organisation. The second concern that this report raises relates to how state aid rules are being applied to peripheral or isolated regions and islands. The latter should not be treated as if they belonged to the mainstream and better endowed centres of the Union. This approach cannot be justified by the argument that structural and cohesion funds already compensate for the disadvantages which these territories are burdened with; they do not. In such regions the sectors of communications, infrastructure, aid to SMEs, energy, the protection of traditional small-scale initiatives, among others, carry no systemic significance in the context of the continental single market.  To apply to these regions the same treatment as for the centre is helping to increase structural disparities between the centre and periphery of the Union. This should stop, not least when the states to which such peripheral or isolated territories belong already conform to the rules and procedures of the Stability and Growth Pact.  The operations of the Commission’s DG Competition require much deeper evaluation than can be provided by debates such as this in order to promote reforms and ensure transparency, fairness and accountability.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 19, "date": "2016-01-18.json", "name": "Morten MESSERSCHMIDT", "mepid": "96663", "text": "  for the ECR Group. Mr President! I believe that we all agree here today that a fair and free competition policy is a prerequisite for the functioning of a market economy. That is why I am also pleased that we have a Commissioner who dares to fight with the big companies, who are trying to put themselves above the common rules that are the prerequisite for the market and therefore the prerequisite for the prosperity and well-being of all European citizens.  Having said that, I have to say that I do not quite share the vision, the idea, the approach taken by my good Conservative colleague, Bent Bendtsen, in relation to tax policy. Many of the problems we are experiencing with the member states' use of tax policy can be dealt with precisely through competition policy, since it is a question of applying tax policy, which favours some companies over others. We do not need a common harmonised tax policy there. We do not need more EU regulation. What we need is a strong and resolute Commissioner, and we already have! That is why, Mr Bent Bendtsen, there is no need for all the harmonisation that your colleague in the EPP is proposing, and that is why, unfortunately, we in the ECR Group will also vote 'no' when we vote on this report later this week.

Competition policy must intervene against large private and financial oligopolies, because they distort market rules in their favor, from the field to industry. But it must also respect those policies that seek to democratize the economy under public control. Competition policy has often been used to dismantle and privatize the most varied public services or to support public investment, which is critical to industry and innovation, and we certainly oppose this.

The 28 governments are undermining each other's tax base to attract large corporations, and offering a few large corporations zero-point tax rates – a few percent. This cannot continue. This is rightly an essential position in this report and is rightly criticised by most groups here and amendments are being proposed. The main task of competition law is to prevent the formation of cartels. Why? Because cartels can have influence and can collude with each other. That is exactly what the 28 governments should do in tax policy. They should come to an end and try to make smart and cooperative tax policies together as influential lysmis as possible, rather than undercutting each other. We should cooperate, but we should not compete against each other. This is not just about the taxation of large corporations. It is also about the income base of our countries, our governments, the preservation of welfare states, the preservation of the education system and also the financing of current issues. That is rightly one of the essential points in this report. It is right that competition policy should be entered under the codecision procedure, that the European Parliament should be able to participate in competition policy in the future. We should press for much more say in this in the future. One more point would be highlighted: the digital world, the digital future.

Mr President, misleading, worrying and a basic lie are contained in the report on competitiveness. Misleading concerns supposedly equal competition, but it always leads to the domination of monopolies. The concern is related to competition with Russia, China and in particular the United States, the digital economy with online sales of billions without frontiers, the automotive industry, transport, telecommunications, the media, food and agricultural products in view of the Transatlantic Agreement, and even the energy sector, where competitiveness means wars and refugees , state funding which is reduced in areas such as public health, education, welfare, but is not reduced for the banks, the recapitalisation of which the people pay, as well as the legal capital exemptions, despite the false criticism that is supposed to be made in tax havens.  But then there's the big lie. What is hidden is the condition of competitiveness, is that the reduction of so-called labour costs will automatically be ensured by the national competitiveness councils together with the European Union and governments.

I will be very simple, and I would like to recommend this to the Commissioner. I believe that a lot of governments care about certain multinationals, but I think it would also be worth saying at the principle level in Europe that the small and medium-sized enterprises sector is just as important. I would even go so far as to say that although any government should grant tax relief to any multinational, it should be automatically extended to the entire small business sector. The other, this concerns my country, Hungary, this is the situation of the Paks nuclear power plant. Commissioner, you have dealt with this issue a lot, but the way I see it, the Hungarian Government is playing tricks here and is stalling.

It is crucially important that we have a fair competition policy to ensure that the single market works for everyone. We have to make sure that if dominant players are abusing their position then we have a strong position against that, and I very much agree with what the Commissioner said this evening in terms of adapting more power to national competition authorities. It is really important that more power be vested in the 28 competition authorities, and that they can go after bad practice wherever they see it. I also agree with her that we need global enforcement, especially at an OECD level. My concluding remark is that, where investigations are taken up by the Commissioner and her DG, it is crucially important that they are brought to a speedy conclusion. It is important that they are evidence-based and that they are legal-based, not based on political rhetoric from this House or elsewhere, not based on an anti-US bias, which sometimes is heard across this Chamber, but are based on fact and evidence, not based on supposition. I think it is crucially important – as the point was made some time ago – that where those investigations are taken up they are concluded in a timely way.

Annual losses due to the existence of cartels are between EUR 181 billion and EUR 320 billion, which is around 3 % of the G.D.P. of the European Union. We need an immediate upgrade of the existing legal framework to implement this important policy.

I almost wish that you could see the notes that I have taken both of the general remarks and the very specific questions. I would like to try to go through a number of the questions being raised, but this is a very good illustration of why I very much appreciate the meetings, for instance in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON), where we have more time to go in depth, and also with more concrete questions. Starting with the question from Mr Fernández, this case is still under assessment. Of course we are working with it as fast as possible in order to finalise it but I cannot go into the detail now since the investigation is still open.  When it comes to the question of remote areas and public services I think it is very important to pay attention to the rules that we have, both in the general Block Exemption Regulation and in services of general economic interest, because it preserves room for national governments to make sure that they can have a public sector working as they wish , decided by the national democracy. My second point is that within this set of rules there is room for special treatment of remote areas for obvious reasons, because we are differently situated here in our Union. When it comes to the matter of Paks it is very difficult to say at present what will come out. You probably know that we have formally opened investigations to see if there are state aids involved and, if that is the case, whether that state aid can be justified. These investigations have only just opened and therefore it is very difficult to see when they will end. But of course we will look into this. On the question of the food supplies chain raised by Ms McGuinness this is, as you say, a very important issue. On this we are working very closely with the national competition agencies and we are trying to promote a new set of rules that enables producers to help each other, to gain more strength when it comes both to the inputs but also to reselling into the retail chain, because basically enabling the different parts of the supply chain to be strengthened is part of that goal. I think we are pursuing that together.  A lot of Members have addressed the question of taxation. When it comes to the question of recovery, raised among others by Mr Kofod, I understand why you feel that this is a provocation. I think we have to find solutions outside of the state aid regime, because basically, since state aid control was invented, the rules have been such that the state that has been given the favourable ruling has had to effect recovery from the businesses in question. So maybe a broader debate would be in place. Best, of course, would be that there would in the future be no question of recovery if companies pay the taxes that they are supposed to pay – not only the majority as today, but every company.  I very much appreciate the broad view taken that we need the strong cooperation also with you on the legislative part, not only on the automatic exchange of information, and on discussing a corporate consolidated tax base eventually, but also in making sure that we hopefully can approach a situation in which profits are being taxed where they are being made. I hope that can be a unifying goal in the processes, going forward. When it comes to taxation as such, I very much appreciate the very strong cooperation with this Chamber and the strong support from this Chamber. I think it is a question of levelling the playing field and I think it is a question of being able to address all those businesses who just pay their taxes. They should know that there is someone looking after the level playing field, ensuring that those who do not pay their taxes actually will do so. A number of you have addressed the question of how we work within the competition field. We try to do our best to be transparent, to publish decisions as soon as confidential information has been taken out, to be much more transparent when it comes to state aid as such, empowering Member States to take many more decisions by themselves. The other side of that coin is to be more transparent about how taxpayers’ money is actually being used.  I am very much engaged in the work to empower national competition agencies, and I hope that we can work with this together, because the strength of the national competition agencies is also the strength of competition law enforcement. I think more than 80% of the decisions taken over the last 10 years have been taken by national competition agencies and that is a very good illustration of the need to strengthen these bodies in order to be able to work for national citizens. On digital developments I very much appreciate the broad recognition of the fact that we are digitalising our economy. It is not just a question of a sector, it is a digitalised economy, digitalised government, digitalised services in general. I hope that our concrete casework will enable businesses to guide themselves when they digitalise.  On the Google case, as asked by Mr Tremosa, we are now in the process of analysing the responses that came from the Statement of Objection. This is a very data-rich response that we have got, and of course we will do our best to analyse this with an open mind, as we should in a Union based on the rule of law, and therefore of course there will be no such thing as a strategic Statement of Objection. If there ever is a Statement of Objection, for instance in the Android case, it will be purely based on the facts of the case and the evidence of the case.  Which is also a good note on which to recognise what was said by Mr Hayes, that we truly need to make sure that companies know, governments know, that when we enforce competition law we do that in a purely fact-based way, with an open mind, very stringently and always remembering – at least I try to do this on a day-to-day basis – that this has to stand the test of our courts , because competition law enforcement is no stronger than the processes, than the rules and how we actually implement the processes. I very much hope that we can continue the structured dialogue that we have been having. I very much appreciate how we have been working with Mr Langen both on this report but also in general, and I hope to be able to come back both to the ECON Committee but also, of course, to the Special Committee on Tax Rulings and Other Measures Similar in Nature or Effect (TAXE2) in order to go into depth with a number of these question that have been raised.  Having said that of course I recognise that there are a number of concrete questions that I have not been able to address, but I do hope to have a second chance to come back to that.

Mr President, I would like to thank the I would like to thank colleagues for supporting a good competition policy, albeit with different priorities. I would like to thank the Commissioner for taking all the suggestions here, because fair competition benefits consumers and taxpayers. The independence of the competition authority is important so that it can combat and abolish power concentrations and ensure market access. Transparency is just as important. I would like to reiterate what you said, namely that cooperation between competition authorities at national and European level can probably be improved– particularly in the border areas that we have discussed. For example, in the food chain, where national responsibility is usually there because the market shares of retailers in Europe are well below the usual threshold.  I welcome the fact that you believe that further sectoral investigations are useful and necessary. The question of whether the staff is sufficient for this is something that we, as budgetary legislators, must also ask ourselves here. In aviation, or wherever, as the honourable Member has suggested. I would like to make a correction: Mr Marias is so arrested in his fight against Germany that he no longer knows the facts. Fraport is a state-owned company owned by the state of Hesse and the city of Frankfurt, not Lufthansa. Lufthansa is the largest user in Frankfurt, but the claim that Lufthansa now dominates everything because Fraport makes service contracts is pulled by the hair and fits into Mr Marias' world view.  However, I would also like to put some demands into perspective, because competition policy may be overwhelmed. Social dumping cannot do it alone, or because, for example, we have already dealt with the Committee of Inquiry in another form. The Commission, and this is my request, should take the decisions we take tomorrow seriously with a very extensive follow-up assessment. We should also not place too much emphasis on the contradictions that have been expressed here, for example by the ECR, at the heart of our decision.

As you know, since 2006 there has been a multiannual recovery plan for bluefin tuna which plans to be completed in 2022 and fishermen have made an enormous effort to adjust their respective catches to the reduced catch volume, complying with the strict conditions set out in the plan.  As a result, bluefin tuna biomass recorded a very positive trend in 2008 and in 2014 the regional organization decided to increase the volume of catches initially set until 2017, as there are solvent scientific data showing that populations are at a healthy level of abundance.  In my opinion, the dramatic recovery seen in bluefin tuna stocks in recent years could justify a ICCAT decision to further increase these volumes, and we have asked for it. It is difficult to explain to fishermen engaged in artisanal fishing for bluefin tuna in an absolutely sustainable way – as is the clear case of the Canary Islands, for example – that within 24 hours of opening the fishery they have to withdraw because the quotas are absolutely finished. The legislative initiative we are discussing today is intended to ensure the uniform and effective implementation of this plan throughout the European Union.  The proposal contains technical measures, such as those relating to transfer and introduction operations in a live bluefin tuna cage, including measures relating to the use of stereoscopic chambers to estimate the quantities of bluefin tuna and releases, catch declaration requirements and the implementation of ICCAT's regional observer programme. In general, the Commission's proposal correctly transposes iccAT's relevant recommendations and we believe that in certain cases it goes a little further than what is decided by ICCAT. I would like to recall that the objective of transposing ICCAT recommendations is their uniform application throughout the European Union. It is therefore not intended to start a new debate on what has already been decided. The uniform application aims to ensure a level playing field for all operators involved in tuna fishing, including, in particular, third-country operators. Otherwise, if different rules apply to foreign fleets, all efforts made and all restrictions on fishermen in the European Union will have been in vain.  On the other hand, and this is a very important issue, the Commission proposes to transpose future amendments to this recovery plan through delegated acts, and here we do totally disagree. We believe that the transposition of these recommendations should remain a shared competence between the European Parliament and the Council within the framework of the ordinary procedure and should therefore be adopted in codecision. I have always called for this Parliament to have this codecision and not to attempt to infringe or use practices to try to circumvent Parliament's intervention.  Finally, we welcome the fact that ICCAT's recommendations take into account the specific characteristics of the different tuna fishing gear. In this context, it is necessary to emphasize the role of artisanal fishing gear – such as those used in the Canary Islands or as traditional almadrabas – in the conservation of populations. That is why in this report we place particular emphasis on this allocation of quotas and that particular attention should be paid to traditional activities. I conclude by thanking all the Members who have participated in the amendment process to improve this report and I hope that we will finally have a document that is satisfactory to all.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 55, "date": "2016-01-18.json", "name": "Gabriel MATO", "mepid": "96936", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Gabriel Mato. The Commission very strongly appreciates the draft report as prepared by the rapporteur, Mr Mato. It is obviously the result of a very good understanding of the issues which surround the status of bluefin tuna, a very important species. It provides a very valuable contribution and also some positive suggestions for the modification of the initial proposal. It is also important to remember that this proposal aims, as has already been explained, to transpose into EU law measures which were already adopted by ICCAT, the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna. They were adopted in 2014, and they have been applicable to Member States and operators since July 2015. It is important to say that this recovery plan has been very widely acknowledged as a success story, and the stock of bluefin tuna is well on its way towards recovery. Having said that, there is and there can be no room for complacency. We still need to continue to give priority to the sustainable management of this important stock. Measures adopted in the recovery plan by ICCAT are therefore crucial. Many of the provisions of the recovery plan are directly applicable to all our Member States. However, transposition is needed to ensure that the provisions applicable to natural or legal persons are also complied with in the European Union. This is necessary to ensure that compliance is there – the compliance of the Union with its international obligations – and it is also there to maintain the EU’s credibility in sustainable fisheries management. While this report largely meets our expectations, there are still some divergences. This is the case regarding the interpretation of the competences of the respective institutions when transposing provisions from the Regional Fisheries Management Organisations (RFMOs). However, we are confident that they can be solved.  Regarding the provisions for the empowerment of the Commission to adopt delegated acts, the Commission strongly believes that due to the frequent amendments of the recovery plan in ICCAT, this is a crucial element within the proposal. Why? Because such delegated acts are required in order to swiftly incorporate into EU law any future amendments of the recovery plan at ICCAT level. These amendments are bound to, and do, occur regularly. In these cases, going through the full ordinary legislative procedure very often impedes us from implementing new measures in time to ensure the European Union’s compliance with our international obligations. The adoption of delegated acts by the Commission provides the possibility to accurately and, most importantly, rapidly transpose ICCAT measures into EU law by amending only the non-essential elements of the legislative acts. This requires appropriate consultations including consultations at expert level. It also requires the timely and appropriate transmission of relevant documents to the European Parliament and to the Council.  The Commission also believes that it should be empowered to adopt implementing acts. This is justified by the frequent need to establish how certain measures of the recovery plan should be implemented at the level of the EU. We need this to achieve a level playing field for the Member States and also to ensure the effectiveness of the same measures. This is particularly relevant for control measures introduced in ICCAT whose interpretation could be different amongst different Member States and which are directly linked to the respect of quotas and other international obligations. The Commission’s proposal for a regulation on the multiannual recovery plan for bluefin tuna provides a very balanced and effective follow-up to the ICCAT agreement.

In my opinion, we have the opportunity to address important issues relating to tuna, both as regards the ecology of the species, in terms of the recovery of stocks, and the socio-economic factors linked to it, in particular, its fishing. As we know, the European Union, together with the Member States, is a contracting party to ICAT and in 2014, combined with Genoa, that my city, at the ICAT annual meeting, welcomed the news of the positive data on the state of good health of bluefin tuna and, there, a 20 % increase in the quotas allocated to the contracting states was decided. The quotas for bluefin tuna are laid down in the ICAT, but the distribution criteria are decided at the discretion of the individual Member States.  Unfortunately, in very many cases only a few shipowners benefit from these quotas, while small-scale fishermen are substantially excluded, despite an increase of this 20%. Not forgetting that, if a bluefin tuna is accidentally caught, the small fisherman is in danger of being severely penalised. A fairer distribution would therefore have been expected, and for this Group of the European People's Party (S&amp;D) it has tabled an amendment denouncing the current monopoly mechanism for large shipowners and calling on the Member States to review the system of bluefin tuna fishing quotas more fairly.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 58, "date": "2016-01-18.json", "name": "Ruža TOMAŠIĆ", "mepid": "119431", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Club. – Mr. President, fisheries as an economic branch today depend more than ever on the balance between the social sustainability of the fleet and the conservation of fish stocks.

The progression of biomass certifies this and encourages it to compensate for the effort made so far by a sector with a more generous TAC. Not for nothing, in 2012, to recover the species, it lost 58% of the fishing capacity available to it before this process was launched. We also believe it is essential that fleets operating in the Mediterranean, whether European or third-country, operate on an equal footing. The European sector cannot be penalised to the detriment of third-country producers when iccAT negotiations fail and especially when activity occurs in the same ecosystem. Finally, we are committed to total support for traditional and small-scale fishing, such as the Canarian one, and we claim its most characteristic arts, such as almadraba, which offer great selectivity and are environmentally efficient. We are committed to more control and to be stricter for different sectors, but we do not agree with expressions that criminalize those operating within a regulatory and control framework designed to combat unsofiable practices by all operators. Finally, and from an institutional perspective, we also support Parliament's role in transposing the recommendations of the regional fisheries management organisation, because we bring transparency, balance and legitimacy. The opaque negotiations on fishing quotas in European waters, as indicated by the Lisbon Treaty, are an eloquent example of what happens when these processes move away from citizens and their legitimate representatives.

In 50 years, the number of bluefin tuna has fallen by almost 90%. As a result, the species has been brought to the edge of the abyss and the reason for this was the serious overfishing that has taken place for decades. Overfishing, largely due to the subsidised overcapacity of our European fishing fleet. In 2006, measures were taken to reduce overfishing and protect tuna. But while it seems to be working somewhat, there is still no reason for euphoria.  Because if the number of tuna drops to almost zero and then that population doubles again, then you have twice as much as zero.  Bluefin tuna is still listed on the red list of endangered species at the hands of humans and many organisations warn that it is too early to fish more for tuna. And that is exactly what the rapporteur and the European Commission want: more fishing! We are not even talking about the bycatch of other species, all species which, like tuna, are facing a gruesome death.

Not one person in this room has mentioned angling, and I think our whole approach to fisheries simply is wrong. We have a quota system for most of our species, which of course in mixed fisheries has meant decades of discards on a truly horrendous scale. And whilst I, and everybody else, want a proper, sustainable commercial sector, we are massively underestimating the power of recreational sea angling to bring good – not just economically, but also the environmental benefit of our stocks not being hammered in the same way. In the United Kingdom, just anglers targeting bass alone bring in GBP 200 million a year to the UK economy – far more than the level of commercial landings. In America they have got this right. They recognised on the East Coast that the striped bass was an asset. After a complete moratorium they now regard that stock as primarily an angling resource which has led to a massive boom in jobs and boatbuilding and all those East Coast coastal communities benefiting massively.  But what have we done with our declining bass stock? We put a total ban in place for anglers, with after 1 July a derisory one fish limit per angler, whilst at the same time allowing the small commercial boats to use gillnets to catch 1.3 tonnes per month each. What we have done is wholly disproportionate, and frankly we are punishing anglers who did not cause the problem.  And we did it, Commissioner, through a regulation that you, a Maltese bureaucrat, proposed, that was nodded through the Council of Ministers, that was not debated in the European Parliament Committee on Fisheries, not debated or voted on here, certainly not debated on in the British Parliament, and that will turn now ordinary people into criminals if they pursue their Magna Carta rights.

The first concerns the issue of so-called delegated acts: the Commission proposes to transpose future amendments to the bluefin tuna recovery plan in the Eastern Atlantic and mediterranean by means of delegated acts, but if this were to happen, Parliament would no longer have any chance of having an impact in the ICAT. In my opinion, however, the transposition of the recommendations of regional fisheries management organisations must remain a joint competence of Parliament and the Council under the ordinary codecision procedure.  The second point concerns quotas for bluefin tuna fishing: it is not clear why the diversification of quotas for each vessel should only refer to the quantity caught in 2000, nor how this quota can in fact be to the exclusive benefit of some fishermen to the detriment of so many other operators, especially the small ones. The bluefin tuna quota mechanism must be freed from the monopoly of large shipowners, favouring more sustainable fishing systems and in favour of small and medium-sized enterprises.

I also appreciate the fact that there is general support from the honourable Members of this Chamber. The Commission would also like to recall, as every one of you has done, the sensitive nature of bluefin tuna in international fora and the particular responsibility of the EU in doing our part in ensuring its sustainability. Having the largest share of the quota, we also carry the responsibility in that we have the largest number of operators and therefore the EU does have a central role to play in the management of this very important stock.  This proposal is essential in order to accurately transpose ICCAT decisions, measures adopted in ICCAT a few years ago, into Union law. The resulting regulation would ensure legal certainty regarding the obligations of the operators, all the operators, and as a result facilitate the implementation of the measures and the compliance of the Union with its international obligations. I would like to go through some of the comments that were made. Mr Mato, Ms Briano and Ms Bilbao Barandica, and almost everyone, have stressed the role of artisanal fisheries. Yes, it is true that the Commission largely shares the interest of Parliament in preserving ancient traditional fishing methods. We also believe that the drafting of the text as put forward in the draft report is not always appropriate and can be misleading.  Coming on to tuna traps, which were also mentioned: tuna traps are not the only sustainable gear for targeting bluefin tuna, or the only gear providing significant employment opportunities. This is not reflected in the proposed amendments to Mr Mato’s report .  As to whether the Commission agrees to include suggestions to allocate additional specific quota or to establish, or even break down, the quota allocation between gears: yes, I think that this should be reassessed in the light of the specificities of the fisheries in each Member State.  Individually, there were some comments with regards to the almadraba, which I mentioned goes along with the artisanal fishing, and that we need to go for the more environmentally friendly and the most sustainable methods.  With regard to the points mentioned by Marco Affronte who highlights the importance of this stock for European fishermen, I appreciate that this is the right way to move. We mentioned, a lot of us mentioned, the socio-economic aspects and I think that correct management is the only way forward to protect sustainability and the long-term sustainability of the socio-economic aspects.  I also agree with Ms Rodust who said that the quotas should be transparent and so on. I believe that this is something that all the Member States should aim for, along with the need for high selectivity, low-energy consumption and, again, small scale. This is the part that the small-scale artisanal fishing could play in all of this. I also agree with many of you who said that we should agree that things are not as good as we would like them to be, and that is why I said there is no space for complacency. Yes, we have made progress, but there is still a lot of progress to be made.  Ms Aguilera García mentioned the uniform and effective level playing field and more distribution towards the small fishermen. I took on board Mr van Dalen’s point about the conservation plan for hake, I think that is something that we can discuss.  With regard to the environmental impact assessment (EIA) on collective fishing gear mentioned by Mr Serrão Santos, that is something that scientists do take into account but if need be it should be more enhanced as well. With regard to the mention of the need for delegated acts, I think this is a crucial element of the proposal because there will be frequent, very frequent, amendments of the ICCAT recovery plan and these amendments will need to be put into European law swiftly. Going through the full ordinary legislative procedure will not allow us to act in time. However, these delegated acts will make it possible to act fast and transpose ICCAT measures relating to non-essential elements of the legislative acts into EU law. I think this was mentioned by Mr Caputo. With regard to accuracy and the positive data of recovery, we still need to be very cautious. I think Mr Jakovčić and others mentioned this. Mr Ferreira also spoke about better distribution. Renata Briano spoke about the stock and its socio-economic impact, and yes, the quotas are there to be distributed by the Member States in a more fair way. I think it is important that RFMOs are transparent and more representative. With regard to Mr Farage, unfortunately today we are discussing tuna, and sea bass is not under ICCAT. However, I would still like to point out that I agree with you that anglers are contributing highly to the economy of many of the European states. You mentioned 800 000 in the UK, there are some 1.3 million anglers in France and a high percentage of the sea bass is actually being caught by anglers. Since they are benefiting, I think they should also take on the responsibility. With regard to our proposals on sea bass not being debated, I do not agree with you. We have been discussing this and we have been urging all the Member States involved to come up with an agreed plan.  With regard to the contribution from Ms Hazekamp, I agree that even though we have made some improvement on recovery this species is still threatened and we do hope that ICCAT will continue to take this into consideration. Overall, I would like to thank all the Members of this Chamber for your contribution and I would like once again to thank the rapporteur Mr Mato, and this Chamber, for an open and a very productive discussion.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 79, "date": "2016-01-18.json", "name": "Gabriel MATO", "mepid": "96936", "text": "  Rapporteur. – Madam President, thank you Commissioner and, above all, thank you to all the Members who have surgery and who in one way or another have helped to improve this report.

In any case, thank you because it's good to listen to everyone. There are two fundamental issues here: one is quotas. Firstly, we are talking about the fact that good work has indeed been done by fishermen and stocks have recovered. That requires an increase in quotas. I think so. And it is also true that the other important part is how this quota-sharing is done and that is done by the Member States. It is true that it is not a question of this Parliament, it is not in this report that it has to be, but it is a political option. It's a very clear message. We believe that a better allocation of quotas has to be done, benefiting small fishermen. I'm not going to demonize the big ones, but I do think we have to benefit and be fairer to the little fishermen.  That is why we clearly share that position and have already included it in a compromise in the text itself. An amendment is now being tabled that goes further, but deep down what is intended is simply that there should be a fairer allocation of quotas.  And then we have a problem, Commissioner. We will not understand each other, and we understand each other many times, on the subject of delegated acts. I believe that you, the Commission, are not an example of rapid transposition, and we have many examples, and I believe that this situation cannot be used as an argument or subterfuge to eliminate Parliament's powers.

Air pollution causes over 430 000 premature deaths in the EU every year and costs up to an estimated EUR 940 billion a year as a result of its health impacts. In particular, nitrogen oxides (NOx) are major air pollutants which cause, inter alia, lung cancer, asthma and many respiratory diseases, as well as environmental degradation such as eutrophication and acidification.  According to the EEA, NOx emissions are the cause of at least 75 000 premature deaths in the European Union yearly. Diesel vehicle exhausts are a major source of NOx in urban areas in Europe, and the Euro 6 limit value for NOx emissions from diesel vehicles is 80 mg/km under so-called normal use conditions. The draft measure, the subject of the objection, aims to establish the so-called real driving emission requirements to limit the tailpipe emissions of light passenger and commercial vehicles. The motion for a resolution considers that the draft Commission regulation would result in a de facto blanket derogation from applicable emission limits, which is not compatible with the aim and content of Regulation 715/2007 and exceeds the implementing powers provided for in Regulation 396/2005. The ENVI Committee objects to the draft measure, in particular because it would allow vehicles to emit 168 mg/km of nitrogen oxide in the real driving emissions test, applicable to all new vehicles from September 2019, which means four years after the entry into force of the Euro 6 80mg/km limit value.  Surpassing the regulation by 110% is something that deeply undermines not only the regulation itself but also, I believe, the credibility of the regulating EU bodies. The resolution therefore calls on the Commission to withdraw the draft regulation and submit a new proposal by 1 April 2016 at the latest, introducing a real driving emissions test that would ensure the effectiveness of emission control systems.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 84, "date": "2016-01-18.json", "name": "Benedek JÁVOR", "mepid": "124721", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, today we are discussing the introduction of the new emissions testing procedures for cars in the EU. As you know, we have been working on this issue for quite a long time, but of course the Volkswagen revelations gave action greater urgency. So I want to focus today’s debate on the impact of the decision that has been taken. We know that laboratory tests are not reliable. Currently, the real NOx emissions by diesel cars are, on average, 400 mg/km. That is 4-5 times higher than the legal emissions limit of Euro 6 cars. That is why we have prepared some substantial changes to the regulatory framework. Of course, it was demanding, but we have come up with a solution that is unique and fit for purpose. We will be the first in the world to introduce emissions tests on real roads under real driving conditions. Our solutions will change the current measurement systems completely. It will no longer be possible to cheat in emissions tests. Member States have reached a compromise. In the first stage emissions will be reduced to 168 mg/km by September next year and then, by January 2020, the limits will be reduced still further to 120 mg/km. You are well aware that the initial Commission proposals were significantly more ambitious. I said on many occasions that I wanted more stringent ‘conformity factors’, but we could not convince the Member States. Still – and I want to underline this – I consider this agreement substantial progress because we are halving the NOx emissions of diesel cars currently on the streets and, at the same time, we are forcing the automotive industry to speed up efforts to make cars cleaner and respect our common environmental goals. This is why we need the new rules as soon as possible, and this is why we need – and ask for – your agreement on the Commission’s proposals on introducing real driving emissions tests in the EU. But, as I have also told you, we will not stop here. The real driving emissions tests are only one part of the package. We want to bring down NOx emissions as much as possible. Ultimately, if technological development allows, we want the cars to achieve the legal limit of 80 mg/km. That is why the legal proposal on the real driving emissions test procedures suggests a so-called annual revision clause. This means that, from 2020 onwards, the emission limits can be adjusted if technology improves. Each year, the Commission will assess the portable measurements technology: this is the technology which actually measures the emissions under real driving conditions. If this technology improves and allows for more exact emission measurements from 2020, we will have the legal possibility to bring the limits down further, to 80 mg/km. We intend to start this work already by the end of this year. It is possible to do so within this time limit because manufacturers design their vehicles well in advance of their production, so the vehicles on the roads in five years’ time are being designed today. That is why the existence of the annual revision clause provides legal certainty and an incentive for car manufacturers to design their cars with much lower emissions than the current limit. Let me now come to the rest of the package. In the course of this year, the Commission will propose a third regulatory package on real driving emissions testing to increase transparency. The idea is that the conformity factor of each vehicle is shown in its certificate of conformity: the consumer will be fully aware of the emissions performance of his/her vehicle. Further, I promised to improve the type approval system and strengthen the independence of the control bodies. I will propose the text for the College discussion next week. The new rules will clarify and strengthen the recall system and safeguard procedures. The Commission will be given the powers to intervene and comment on the corrective measures taken by the Member States. The system of exchange of information and cooperation between enforcement authorities in the Member States will be reinforced. The Volkswagen case also showed that Member States do not react in a very coordinated manner, so I intend to force Member States to carry out market surveillance and controls of vehicles brought to the market. The quality and independence of the services responsible for approving vehicles will be strengthened. This means more quality checks, better cooperation and more and stronger tools to enforce the rules. We need to restore the confidence of our citizens in the type approval system and the car industry as a whole, as we have all agreed a few times before. This is why we urgently need new rules on type approval and emissions testing to be in place. Last, but not least, a few words about Euro 5/6 proposals: the Parliament and Council are currently negotiating some revisions of the Euro 5 and Euro 6 legislation, which is also the parent legislation to the act on introducing real driving emissions. In this context, the delegated powers to be given to the Commission are being discussed. Our objective is to have a very smooth and rapid implementation of the new real driving emissions procedure in the future. We are ready to work together with you, and of course with the Council, to find a balanced solution because we want to achieve our environmental objectives and we are determined to respect the institutional balance. I know this is also important to you. I hope that my commitment is very clear to you. I want to tackle it in a very coherent and comprehensive way. I will be demanding and decisive towards our car manufacturers if they do not play the game. I am confident that this new framework will restore the effectiveness of our legal system to protect both consumers and the environment.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 85, "date": "2016-01-18.json", "name": "Ivo BELET", "mepid": "28257", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – What is at stake here? We all know that. We want harmful nitrogen oxide emissions to be reduced effectively and as quickly as possible. Today - and the Commissioner has just confirmed it - a Euro 6 diesel car emits on average 4 times more nitrogen than the legal standard we adopted a few years ago and which has been in force since last year. So those emissions have to go down. We all agree on that. Secondly, the new test, the Real Driving Emission Test, which determines how many cars emit in real driving conditions, must now finally be introduced. There is an agreement on this, which is essential. We've wasted enough time. That test must now be introduced.  We welcome, of course, Commissioner, that you here are committed to coming up with a legislative proposal in the short term on additional supervision of national type-approval, on this homologation. It is essential that national control can be independently and robustly verified. I also refer to the discussion on delegated acts and implementing acts.  Parliament wants to be directly involved in future revisions. We explicitly ask that this be done through delegated acts and not through implementing acts.

In many municipalities, towns and cities, those responsible have difficulty in complying with the EU's aviation pollution standards. That is why the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has always advocated the elimination and reduction of pollutants at source. Of course, this also includes the cars. That is why we want a solution to real drive emissions.  It cannot be the case that the test values in practice have virtually nothing to do with those in the laboratory and that additional problems arise as a result. But the question of what follows from this general statement is not so easy to answer. A majority in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Social Affairs said that the proposal is not strict enough , which is why we reject it. In my personal opinion, there are also reasons for this, particularly because the GROWTH Directorate-General GROW originally proposed stricter values – 1.6 and 1.2. But we can only say yes or no.  I know from many discussions, including from committed environmental politicians from the Council of Ministers, that if we reject the proposal, we will automatically get a stricter one, but we may not have any result at all.  That is why the GROUP of European Democrats is in favour of a compromise that helps people, health and local authorities, but which also gives us a certain degree of planning certainty.

The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats wants to fight for this, and there is much to be done about this, not only in the area of car registration.

I fully respect and understand all of their concerns. Let me come back to the most important questions.  First, let me underline again that the Commission did not ignore any signals before: neither in 2006 when we worked on a proposal for Euro 5/6 in order to bring emissions down – although this was for laboratory testing, and that has to be stressed – nor in 2011 and 2012 when it was the JRC, not anybody else, who indicated for the first time that there is a problem with the real driving emissions.  We now have to finish this process with a positive vote. We cannot make any new proposals on conformity factors, firstly because Member States will not change their views, and secondly because it would extremely delay the whole process. To make things very clear: if we do not have rules in place by 2017, we will maintain this situation with 4-5 times higher emissions in real driving – in real life – and have 4-5 times more pollution. Rejection implies that we will not have rules in 2017, and we will have to explain to our citizens why we now have 500 mg/km of NOx emissions and have not done anything to reduce it to 168 mg/km.  I feel, of course, that a consensus can emerge. Let me outline a possible way forward without new proposals on conformity factors: the Commission is ready to make a declaration for the plenary vote next month, outlining the solution that we discussed today, so I can honestly commit to activating the annual revision clause for the second conformity factor as soon as possible next year. This is more or less the same as reducing the second conformity factor. You can take this as my personal commitment too, and the second one is that we will adopt the reinforced type approval system on real driving emissions. I can commit to these two things before you now without making new proposals for conformity factors.

For the first time in history, the proposal is to increase NOx emissions from diesel engines by 110% compared to the original plan. At a time when the Dieselgate scandal and the Paris agreement are resonating around the world, such a proposal seems like a bad joke. Moreover, the general exemption from the emission limits in force is not compatible with the objective and content of Regulation (EC) No 715/2007 and exceeds the implementing powers laid down there down thereto. It is typical of this Commission that the decision has been approved by the representatives of the Member States in the Technical Committee for Motor Vehicles instead of the ordinary legislative process. Manufacturers always state that they need a long-term outlook and stable conditions. In this case, they had nine years to adapt to the new requirements, and some manufacturers meet the set limits. That is why I say that by changing legislation, honest people cannot be punished for dishonesty.

My report, therefore, aims to build on the common agreement reached by all 28 EU Education Ministers in the aftermath of the Paris attacks. This ministerial agreement acknowledges that joint efforts are needed in order to prevent and tackle marginalisation, intolerance, racism and extremism, and to preserve a framework of equal opportunities for all. The report identifies opportunities, along with challenges, and makes concrete recommendations for action at all governmental levels, as well as at EU level, including the increased use of culture in external actions and in the development agenda. It recognises the unique role that culture, inclusive learning and active citizenship can play in building strong, confident, resilient and cohesive communities of the future. I decided to take a positive approach, particularly in respect of young people and the potential that they offer to society, and to celebrate that cultural diversity can create empathy, empower marginalised communities and foster more active citizenship. Intercultural dialogues and exchanges also address stereotypes, prejudices and discrimination by the majority. Intercultural practice demonstrates that you can only truly understand yourself when you encounter the other and thus see yourself reflected in another’s eyes. So the other becomes you and you become the other. You develop empathy, compassion and the ability to stand in someone else’s shoes. You see others, not as alien or unequal, but as neighbours, all part of the human family. When we refuse to engage in intercultural dialogue, the phenomenon of ‘othering’ begins and can ultimately lead to the terrible genocides we have witnessed.  My report promotes the need to reinvigorate and promote healthy dialogue between all kinds of communities, leading to a better understanding and acceptance of common fundamental values, thereby laying the foundations for more inclusive and pluralistic societies. Too often in times of crisis, the dominant media narrative is that somebody else is to blame for the world’s problems. This results in scapegoating and a culture of fear. However, when people come together and talk honestly and share in each other’s culture they learn that we are all human beings with common aspirations and concerns. During the recent devastating floods in my north—west region, the much—maligned Muslim community were amongst the first to offer practical aid and moral support to remote rural communities, countering growing Islamophobia through spontaneous intercultural dialogue born out of true compassion and demonstrating a greater degree of sympathy and solidarity than the government did. Formal and informal education and intercultural dialogue are crucial tools for a more harmonious society. Children are not born to hate, so tackling things from an early age is vital. But learning does not hold only one form and have only one purpose, nor does it solely concern children and young people. Learning to be an active and responsible citizen is a lifelong learning process that can take many forms. We are sometimes afraid of otherness, and the best way to address this is to talk to different people, to share different practices and learn from different cultures. In this way we grow as people, gaining confidence, making friends, being surer of ourselves and, incidentally, being more employable and more entrepreneurial. I am proud to represent a region that includes examples of vibrant multicultural cities and towns, such as Manchester, Liverpool, Preston Blackburn, Bury, Bolton, Rochdale, Burnley, Accrington and others. I know, therefore, that cultural diversity is an opportunity, not a threat, and I firmly believe it is a solution, not a problem. My report adopts an integrated approach when addressing this broad and complex topic, not separating culture, education, youth and active citizenship into four different fields of action but building bridges and synergies between all those elements.  So I call on the Commission and Member States to also adopt a cross-cutting and coherent approach between all fields of their actions in and outside Europe. The European Union is at a particular point in history where notions of identity and belonging are contested, reconfigured and defended with strong feelings from a diversity of voices and divergent political perspectives.

I would like to congratulate the rapporteur Ms Ward on the excellent result of her work. The terrible terrorist attacks in France and elsewhere in Europe remind us yet again of the importance of building cohesive societies, where everyone can feel safe and valued irrespective of one’s conviction or background.  The richness of the social, linguistic and cultural diversity that the EU represents is indeed held together, as the report says, by the fundamental values that we share: respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities. Continuous efforts to promote multiculturalism, integration and social cohesion are needed to guarantee a Union in which pluralism, non-discrimination, tolerance, justice, solidarity and equality prevail.  The Commission welcomes the strong emphasis of the report on the role of intercultural dialogue and education, which helps learners to show an open mind and be active, responsible citizens equipped with a critical mind and committed to our common fundamental values. This is precisely the point of the Paris Declaration which the Education Ministers and myself endorsed in March last year. To follow up on this declaration with concrete actions is a key priority for me. Preventing violent radicalisation by promoting an inclusive society and democratic values is firmly embedded in the European Security Agenda, which recognises the key role of education, youth work and intercultural dialogue in this context. We will also follow up on the European Council’s call to address the factors underlying radicalisation. Such a complex phenomenon cannot be handled in a simplistic manner. Quick fixes and spectacular announcements will not do. We need deeper changes in the social fabric of our societies that can only be achieved through longer—term actions, particularly through formal and non—formal learning. The Ward report identifies several very relevant areas for action: the need for civic education to start from an early age, the creation of common education platforms, the development of quality training programmes promoting diversity, the provision of counselling services at schools, the need to provide teachers with multilingual and intercultural skills, and the creation of rights-based and gender-sensitive learning environments.  Important steps have, in the meantime, already been taken. Firstly, the Education Ministers have agreed to anchor the objectives of the Paris Declaration firmly in the current priorities for European cooperation in the field of education and training. Secondly, we will also use the Erasmus+ programme to its full, in order to put the Paris Declaration into action. Projects linked to equity, inclusion and non-discrimination will be substantially reinforced. In 2016, EUR 400 million will be spent on transnational projects which will enhance, amongst others, the education of disadvantaged learners and promote the integration of newly arrived migrants. In addition, a specific call will soon be released with a budget of EUR 13 million to disseminate good practices in the field of inclusion, anti-radicalisation and integration of migrants.  The report also rightly emphasises the importance of intercultural dialogue in promoting fundamental values. The Commission Work Programme for 2016 stresses the importance for the EU to take advantage of opportunities to advance its values, as well as European history and culture. In line with this idea, I, together with High Representative/Vice-President Mogherini, am currently working on measures to further cultural diplomacy, in particular to enhance intercultural understanding through direct people-to-people contacts and civil society relationships. Again, this is fully in line with the report in front of us, which calls on the EU to include culture and cultural exchanges and to enhance education in EU external relations. Generally speaking, promoting intercultural dialogue, cultural awareness and cultural expression are high up on our working agenda with the Member States and they will be discussed at the European Culture Forum, which will take place in Brussels on 19 and 20 April.  I greatly appreciate the commitment of Parliament to stand behind this important agenda of enhancing fundamental values through culture and education. I am looking forward to working with you on these issues.

One of the initiators– I would also like to thank Mrs Ward for her excellent work – had the main ambition to do nothing but reality. The report clearly points to the unique role and opportunities of the family in conveying our common values. In my current experience, nothing can replace the family when it comes to the transfer of norms and knowledge. I am pleased that, in addition to political camps, we can agree on this fundamental issue.  The social role of religions, if indirectly, remains decisive, contrary to all previous predictions. All this, I would like to stress, is not a matter of faith, but a sociological fact. Interfaith dialogue should be a fundamental element of policies to help young people. Religious communities differ from ngos of all kinds, among other things, by offering an alternative to man from the beginning to the end of life. Religions and their representatives have a sure, important task in creating social cohesion. Cultural diversity has now received attention because of the size of migration that we did not expect before.

Indeed, it contains positive elements, such as recognising the vital role of education and educators in integration and the importance of media literacy in the digital age. It does nevertheless contain many more aspects that the ECR and its UK delegation are unable to support, and which go way beyond the 17 March declaration. These include calls for stronger EU representations within the UN, appointments of EU cultural attachés, harmonisation of visa procedures, adequate – which I would assume means ‘yet more’ – funding for Europe for citizens, which has many controversial elements, and proposals relating to Member State education policies and other items which are outside EU competences. The report is also full of references to EU citizens and EU citizenship, which many ECR members dislike and may surprise many UK citizens when efforts are being made by Europhiles to persuade them that the EU’s ambitions are limited and have no federalist element to them; clearly not the case judging by elements in this report. As well as learning and understanding other cultures, it is important that we have understanding and pride in our own countries’ values. This is not referenced in this report, and may even be regarded as distasteful by some of its adherents: big mistake. Education and intercultural dialogue are indeed vital tools in the fight against violent extremism. An expanded role for the EU is not.

In these dialogues, the partners must accept each other's differences and particularities, but they must share, above all, a minimum of basic values and principles. Without the recognition of these values and principles, dialogue is born flawed. Intercultural dialogue makes it possible to get to know each other better and can sometimes help you get to know yourself better. In any case, the purpose of dialogue between cultures must always be respectful coexistence. The report refers to violent extremism and links it to social exclusion. We have a challenge before us when we find that this type of violence has also been expressed by young people with university degrees and that they have grown up in educated settings, or people belonging to well-off families and that during their childhood and youth they did not suffer problems of integration, so it is not easy to make these contraposed realities marry.

Education in particular plays a very important role. An intercultural and value-based approach should be taken here at an early stage. Educational institutions of all kinds should not only impart knowledge, but also ethical and civil society values in order to educate their students to be tolerant and responsible members of society. The role of teachers is also essential in value education. The EU's ERASMUS+ programme has already enabled many young people to exchange ideas with other cultures. The refugee crisis is one of the European Union's biggest challenges today. We must work together to prevent extremism and xenophobia and to combat all forms of discrimination and exclusion.  To this end, the communication of common social values is indispensable. However, we also need an enhanced dialogue between different cultures, but also religions. Religions influence the actions and thinking of people in our society. That is why it is important that we work out similarities through dialogue between religions and minimise contradictions.

It means a richness, not a giving up of anything. I was brought up in a family that every week went to dance English country dancing. My father is a Morris man, and ‘Morris dancing’ probably comes from ‘Moorish dancing’. It comes from Africa, it comes from Islam.

Madam President, I would like to thank the president for her As rapporteur, I am pleased that Lord Hill is taking part in our debate on financial regulation today. Our committee, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, has voted by a large majority in favour of a comprehensive review of financial market legislation over the past five years. This does not mean deregulation. This means that, for the first time, we will receive an overall overview of the existing banking, insurance, fund and market regulations and their interaction. This also means that vulnerabilities are discovered and fixed. It also means that the effects of regulation become transparent. When the financial market and debt crisis erupted in 2007/2008, the legislator was unheard of being called upon to act. We have operated financial market regulations in crisis mode, and I think we have been successful in it. No stone has remained on the other. We quickly rebuilt the whole building, rebuilt it quickly, with new supervisory authorities, with binding EU-wide standards and a far-reaching banking union. But as we continue to build, we should look at where gaps are, where are crooked, where inaccurate and where construction was too fast.  That is why, as rapporteur, I call for the Commission to draw up a comprehensive impact study across all financial market sectors by the end of this year. In doing so, we list the following points for the examination. Firstly, the consistency and accuracy of the existing laws, because the rules should not contradict each other or call each other into question. They must be comprehensible and also practicable for the user. Secondly, the proportionality of legislation, because we want to preserve the diversity of the market for consumers and we do not want to overwhelm small and medium-sized enterprises.  Thirdly, the complexity and complexity of European and international requirements, because we want to continue to be competitive internationally with our European financial service providers. We want to have a strong voice when a decision is taken at the Banking or Insurance Committee in Basel or at IOSCO in Madrid. Fourthly, the added value for consumers and investors, because we want legislation not only to produce information material, but also to meet the needs of consumers and investors. We also want barriers to product access to be reduced and the internal market for financial services really being lived. Fifthly, the economic effects, because we are calling for the financial sector to return to the strongest where it can have a positive effect, namely by serving the real economy. The legislator must create the possibilities for this. For me, as rapporteur, and for the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats as a whole, these are essential points that we want to improve. Here we are calling for a quantitative and qualitative analysis, by the Commission itself in cooperation with the European supervisory authorities.  Financial market regulation must meet the objective of financial stability and consumer protection, and that remains a top priority. But the success and design of financial market regulation is also a location card for the European financial industry. If, Commissioner, you want to boost the investment strength of the European economy through the Capital Markets Union, then you must include all financial market sectors, including banks and insurance companies, and that is why, Commissioner Hill, we are counting on us to see us again in a year's time on this very issue, on the occasion of the presentation of the impact studies that are due.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 178, "date": "2016-01-18.json", "name": "Nathan GILL", "mepid": "124965", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, thank you for giving me the chance to come along this evening. I want to congratulate Mr Balz for this excellent report and for setting out the issues at stake so clearly. I share 100% his goal of creating an effective legislative framework for financial services. For that to happen, people need to know that it will be implemented. But they also need to know that it will be proportionate and that it can respond to changing circumstances, and that is the logic that sits behind the call for evidence that forms part of the Capital Markets Union (CMU) action plan. I therefore see this report and the call for evidence as being consistent, the one with the other. I would like briefly to focus on two issues raised by the report: the need for a regulatory framework that supports growth, and the need to make sure that smaller businesses have access to finance. It is clear that the major reforms we have introduced in recent years have made the financial system stronger, and now it is time to check whether, looked at in the round, those 40 separate pieces of legislation that we passed have had any unintended consequences. As Mr Balz said, it is part of good law making to check that our rules are doing what they set out to do. The call for evidence will close at the end of this month. I hope it will give us a better understanding of the impact of our legislation. It will help determine our approach to over 100 reviews of existing legislation planned over the next five years. It will inform how we monitor the effectiveness of legislation in the future, and I know that your report makes a number of interesting recommendations in this area. We need legislation that is proportionate if we are going to create an environment that supports investment. If legislation can be streamlined, if it can be simplified and yet achieve the same prudential objective, let us be ready to change it. I am looking forward to reporting back to you when we have been through the ‘call for evidence’ responses and completed our analysis. Improving access to finance for smaller companies is also one of the priorities in the report that I strongly support. If we need companies, if we want companies to start up and grow and create jobs here in Europe, we have to improve the funding conveyor belt. That is what lies behind the work to build a Capital Markets Union. I am grateful for the support that you have given it in this report. As you know, we have made a quick start. Among the initiatives relevant to the report, we have proposed to overhaul the Prospectus Directive. We are looking forward to working with you on our proposal to relaunch simple, transparent and standardised securitisation, and that is to free up lending capacity in the banking sector and increased lending to the wider economy. The Council reached an agreement on that in record time. I hope we can keep up the same kind of pace. Those were just two of the main areas in your report, but there is a wealth of recommendations in there. It has strengthened my belief that, by continuing to work closely together, we have a real opportunity to refine our legislation, to make sure it strikes the right balance between maintaining financial stability, giving consumers confidence, and supporting investment and growth across Europe.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 179, "date": "2016-01-18.json", "name": "Janusz LEWANDOWSKI", "mepid": "23781", "text": "  draft opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. – Madam President, i voted in favour of the report by Mrs Schwab The natural consequence of the deep financial crisis, which began with the financial markets, is the comprehensive regulation of financial services, the priority of which must be product safety, of course also banking security and macroeconomic stability, which means costs and, in general, increased regulatory complexity.

Investment is lagging behind and growth is therefore fragile. Banks, and SMEs in particular, find it difficult to find each other. Capital markets are underdeveloped.  The capital market union can therefore be an opportunity to stimulate financial innovation, to break down barriers between Member States and to deploy capital efficiently. The Commission took a close look at the United States. It has often been said that capital markets there provide 80% of the loans and only 20% here. But to speak to David Bowie: \"This is not America\".  From the 80/20 ratio, it can be concluded that capital markets need to be better developed, but also that bank financing needs to be better achieved. It's important to fix banks. It is good to look again at the United States. There, a separation between savings and investment banking has been established. According to OECD research, the categorisation of banks is better regulated there.  The burkhard Balz report - my congratulations to the rapporteur - is based on the premise that the financial sector should serve the real economy. Regulation is a means of doing so. It's not an end in itself, it's not an ailment in itself, it's a means. It is through this balanced approach that the S&amp;D Group can endorse this report. The aim of regulation must always be to serve the financial sector. Then it is also good to periodically check the servitude of the financial sector. In the end, the capital market union can only work if the European context is recognised. That means stimulating innovation and fixing banks.

Therefore it is right that we take a step back and look at the overlaps and crossovers at this time.  Mr Balz’s report clearly emphasises that this review needs to go beyond value judgements and qualitative statements and stresses that any meaningful review should have a strongly quantitative aspect to it. For me the key areas of this report refer to the overlaps between files, particularly the crossover between MiFID and CRD IV, where we have brought new firms into markets legislation without adequately tailoring the capital standards to suit these new types of firms as yet. A similar issue of scope is seen with the clearing obligation in EMIR: the arrangements for non-financial firms that were intended to prevent financial firms from misusing a justified exemption have led to huge amounts of red tape for businesses that were never meant to be included.

It comes at a key moment where we move from a regulation designed primarily to repair the legislative holes which were so evident in the crisis, towards the Capital Markets Union, which aims to encourage more investment and growth in Europe. The key aspect of the stocktaking report is the call for the Commission to undertake cumulative impact assessments and, at regular intervals, of all of the new legislation enacted in the aftermath of the crisis. I fully support this call. In my view it is imperative that the impact assessment looks at how different pieces of European legislation in the area of financial services interact with each other. Are there any gaps or loopholes? Are there any unintended consequences? How has Europe’s competitiveness been affected globally? We must gain a full understanding of the new legislation, at which point we can focus on building a robust and competitive Capital Markets Union. There are a number of points which I have pushed during the negotiation. Firstly, in order to ensure Europe’s competitiveness on a global level, we must have a coherent framework in place with regard to dealing with third countries, for example in UCITs. Secondly, access to finance for SMEs is key in order to bring Europe back to sustained growth.

Madam President, Commissioner Hill, Mr Balz, I would like to thank mr Balz for his work on this The signs in the EU are once again on deregulation of the financial markets. The financial lobbyists in Brussels have therefore cold-called the shampoo for better regulation in order to eliminate unwelcome regulation. Smart regulation of financial markets does not have to be complex. The US Glass Steagall Act, which separates investment banks and credit banks, was 37 pages long, and the much weaker EU banking regulation covers 1000 pages. In the EU, the problem of banks, which are too big, too networked and, indeed, too powerful to fail and therefore live at taxpayers' expense, has not been solved at all. Democratic US presidential candidate and old bone Bernie Sanders said the right thing to do: split them up! Burkhard Balz has worked seriously and has also taken up some of our concerns. I would like to thank him for that. However, the EU Commission wants to respond to the investment weakness and credit crunch with the Capital Markets Union and the synthetic securitisation of the packaging of scrap loans. The weakness of investment is linked to the policy of cuts and the insufficient disengagement of bank balance sheets. Mr Hill said in a speech in the United States last year that the fairytale that small and medium-sized enterprises in particular would benefit from the Capital Markets Union is above all a PR gag. Europe would need a genuine public investment programme, a decentralised banking system under public control and strict regulation of financial markets with a financial TÜV.

First of all, in my view, this report sets the right priorities. Contrary to what Mrs Swinburne said, it is not a call for unilateral deregulation. It is aimed at both double regulation and gaps, it aims at reducing unnecessary complexity, but not at unilateral deregulation, and should not be misunderstood in this way. The report rightly emphasises that we have not done enough in some areas, while in others we have not acted proportionately. This must play a role in the revision. It is also true that this financial system must be thought of from the user's intake. Hence the question: are financial products not far too expensive compared to what is generated in terms of income? Isn't too much going into the pockets of intermediaries and too little in savers' pockets? These questions are very legitimate and belong in a review. However, i would also like to say, in order to avoid misunderstandings, that I believe that there are two gaps in the report. Firstly, the financial crisis is not over, it is simply buried. If you look at interest rates at the long end, you see that we have too much capital in the market that doesn't know where to go. I agree with Fabio De Masi: this cannot be solved by turning a few scorisks in the financial sector, but by a policy that directs this surplus capital into sustainable investment. That is why I also ask you, and the report also calls on you to look at the macro-prudential side of the financial system and, in particular, to ensure that new risks do not arise from the fact that unsustainable investments in the bank and insurance balance sheets pose new future risks.

This report states that EU Financial Services regulations will prevent that happening again, but it also stresses the need to reduce the burden of financial regulation, because it recognises it increases costs and makes EU financial services businesses uncompetitive. But the idea that the EU will reduce regulation is as fanciful as the idea that Britain needs to be a member of the EU to trade with it, or indeed that Lord Hill will support a vote for Brexit.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I regret that this report on the issues of financial regulation is ignoring a number of major issues. The first major issue is bank separation. I am talking about the real bank separation, a project that has been stalled since the 2008 crisis. Indeed, all regulatory regulations are futile if risk activities are not separated from bank deposit activities. In other words, it would be an end to the universal banking scheme that takes depositors and savers hostage to play speculative market roulette with other people's money. This is the ultraliberalism that patriots denounce: to make a profit with risk-taking on the backs of others. And here the EPP and the Socialists are in favour of the status quo in private banks. Worse, as the European Union is in a state of financial emergency, it not only does not protect citizens, but, since 1 January 2016, it has even done the opposite, with the disastrous banking union, which legalises the disposing of savings and then deposits. The last example in December: the banking scandal in Italy. It is the duty of responsible political leaders to protect household savings and corporate cash in banks and life insurance companies. The second major issue is the relaunch of securitisation. You should be concerned about the risks of a mechanism that caused social damage and financial losses during the 2008 subprime crisis. Watch out for Pandora's box. The aim is to lend to the productive economy and not to further promote the affairism of the banks.  Finally, on the union of capital markets, yes to the way out-of-bank economies are financed, but the chances of success are very small, in the absence of domestic demand in Europe and real economic opportunities in companies, underfunded European companies, which suffer too much from global unfair competition, charges and taxes to risk investing.  Beyond that, Lord Hill, I am very concerned that your European Commission is opening up the juicy debt market, mainly to Us banks based in the City of London.

I believe it strikes the right balance between improving channels of funding to the real economy and at the same time undertaking a comprehensive assessment of the cumulative impact of the EU Financial Services Regulation – identifying shortcomings and loopholes, but not deregulating. The ongoing crisis in China demonstrates the importance for us not to forget the lessons that we learned from the financial crisis and the need for a robust financial regulatory framework. It is important to keep this perspective. Also this initiative, the Capital Markets Union, is not going to be a panacea. It is not a miracle solution that will solve the level of growth. However, it can deliver alternative sources of finance to companies in the whole of the EU, and not just to the ones in the handful of Member States where we have developed capital markets. The challenge in front of you, Commissioner, is this: can we really speak about a financial services union, a place where capital can circulate freely, unhindered by extra layers of national legislation? Not really. It is critical that you address this, otherwise the EU investment funds will remain a drop in the ocean compared with the American ones. The Commission must tackle national fragmentation urgently. Alongside action on this, it is important that mid-caps are able to maximise their potential. Therefore, the prospectus proposal has to be a real gateway to the capital markets for this group. It has to be short, effective and affordable and, at the same time, an instrument that truly informs investors about securities.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 193, "date": "2016-01-18.json", "name": "Ivana MALETIĆ", "mepid": "119436", "text": "   - Mr. President, I greet the Commissioner and congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent report.

Mr President, the issue of interbank and other transaction charges plays a key role for consumers, especially in Greece, where banks have often been recapitalised with the sweat of the Greek people and where capital controls are still in place. The increased charges imposed by banks on interbank transactions place an excessive burden on Greeks. Charges of between 2 and over 10 euros are charged for simple electronic money transfer for amounts up to 1000 euros, commissions from EUR 1 to EUR 1.25 for credit cards, commission to the bank of 2 to 2.5% for small and medium-sized shops, while in contrast for very large shops the commission is less than 1%, although Regulation (EU) 2015/751 provides, inter alia, for maximum charges for credit and debit cards of EUR 0.30 and EUR 0.20 respectively.

If we concentrate on the report, I think a lot of the comments point to the unique position that the financial sector holds in Europe’s economy. As was said, it is a means to an end, and we should think of it as that and not an end in itself. We need a strong financial sector at the heart of Europe’s recovery – and indeed of our wider society – providing funding for businesses to grow and create jobs and to give citizens the certainty that they need to plan ahead to prepare for their old age and to protect against ill health. It is for that reason that, after introducing the range of legislation in response to the financial crisis, it is so important – as Mr Balz’s report makes clear – that we should check that it is working as intended. It is not to question the fundamental architecture of the reforms that we put in place, but it is to ask whether, in maintaining financial stability, we do not stand in the way of the investment Europe needs to remain competitive and to create jobs. In other words, as so often in financial regulation, it is a question of balance. As was said, we need to think about our competitiveness at a global level and, of course, how we can build consumer confidence in markets. The first stage of our call for evidence, which I think has been inspired by the thinking behind this report, ends in a fortnight. We are not approaching it with preconceptions but in the hope that it will give us detailed information – as many colleagues have said – to understand exactly how the legislation is working, what the connections are between it, whether there are overlaps or, indeed, whether there are any gaps that need to be addressed. I hope it will give us that detailed information on which we can build our analysis and recommendations. When we have got those, I look forward to discussing them with you and to continue working closely with Parliament to overcome these national barriers and obstacles that were raised here again tonight and to build a genuine single market for capital in Europe.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 199, "date": "2016-01-18.json", "name": "Burkhard BALZ", "mepid": "96997", "text": "   Rapporteur.

They have been very helpful and have shown in detail what is important to each of us. After five years of intensive legislative work, the restructuring of the financial supervisory authority and the Capital Markets Union in prospect, it is now time to look at the impact so far and to examine possible improvements. I therefore welcome the fact that the Commission has already taken the first steps in the right direction, and I also welcome the ongoing consultation with financial market participants. It should be made clear that the consultation takes full account of the points in Parliament's report. I also see that the revision of the CRD IV Capital Requirements Directive offers great potential for simplification and greater proportionality, especially for smaller and medium-sized credit institutions. Progress is also certainly to be welcomed here. As The ECON, we are right to call for regular, at least annual proportionality checks. At the same time, however, I would also like to stress, Commissioner, that we and the impact study are not a single piecemeal piece, but, in the end, an overall picture. The puzzle of existing legislation must finally be brought together so that the interactions are clearer and the requirements are less complex and the objectives can be better achieved. To do this, we also need better regulation in financial market regulation. In particular, we are taking on the responsibility of the European Commission as the legislator of initiative, and here we are also taking on the responsibility of the European supervisory authorities and the ECB's banking supervision: coordination, transparency and cooperation in legislation must be improved.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are now at the final stage of a work that has seen me engaged for many months. The subject of women's entrepreneurship is extremely topical in a Europe that is struggling to recover from one of the most acute economic and financial crises in its history. I thank the shadow rapporteurs for their constructive spirit, which has accompanied the text at all stages. I have adopted a strategy that has involved the other political forces since the beginning of my report. We have managed to come up with a cross-cutting position that has not seen any divisions. We didn't need to have a shadow meeting. I would like to thank all of you, ladies and gentlemen, for the desire that has united us to make women protagonists of economic recovery. I have investigated, studied and researched the reasons for the external factors which represent obstacles to female entrepreneurship, which in the European Union stands at 30%. The process of women's emancipation, which over the centuries has seen women fight hard to achieve equal treatment, has not yet achieved its ultimate goal, equality in all areas. Among the major obstacles that we find and which have given rise to the need to draw up this report, we find social, economic and psychological reasons. Women are all too often victims of archaic stereotypes, which see them marginalised in second-hand roles and too little often in command. Women need to think about family, children and the elderly. As if motherhood were considered an obstacle and not the crowning achievement of one's life.  Despite the many directives that oblige people not to discriminate on the basis of gender in terms of access to services and equal treatment, women are often discriminated against when accessing credit. That is why I believe that we need to educate our young women in the spirit of enterprise, in the risk and also in the will for independence and to do business.  The text on which we will vote tomorrow focuses on 5 fundamental thematic areas: 1. Firstly, the main issue is the work-life balance, which is, unfortunately, one of the main obstacles that European women encounter when doing business. In this respect, I have proposed that there should be a real rationalisation of the possibility that European funds make available to provide care for the elderly and babysitting for children; 2. Secondly, in the second chapter, I am convinced that the exchange of good practices, networking and entrepreneurial education are important elements, hence the development of a European platform for female entrepreneurship; 3. The real barrier in Chapter 3 for women is access to credit and I am convinced that greater implementation of the Equal Access to Services Directive has become indispensable. Banks must treat everyone in the same way and not prefer male investment projects; 4. Penultimate chapter: I am convinced that an entrepreneurial culture must be instiled in the minds of our boys and therefore encourage girls and women to consider careers in the world of finance; 5. Last chapter, women must be inclined not only to work in the social sector but, as I said, also to open up to new technologies and also to the green economy. So, Mr President, the minutes available to me have ended, I invite all my fellow Members tomorrow to vote positively for this report, for a more inclusive Europe, and I will end with the words of Oriana Fallaci, an Italian writer who I really like, \"Being a woman is very fascinating. It is an adventure that requires courage, a challenge that never bores\".

As we have heard, and as we know, it is SMEs which will be the engine for job creation in Europe, and to unlock the full potential of our economy we need to unlock the creativity and entrepreneurial potential of our whole workforce of women and men – and yet we know that entrepreneurship is less popular among women than men. Sixty-three percent of women say that it has never crossed their mind to start a business, compared to 52% for men, and as we heard, among the key barriers that hinder women there are stereotypes, sometimes lack of confidence, and difficulties in accessing finance and business networks. That is why the role of education is so important and why it makes sense for Member States to include entrepreneurial learning at all levels of education. Studies show that women are different not only in the motivations that drive them into business but also in the way that they manage an enterprise. In particular, women take more calculated business risks than men, and usually, of course, such economic behaviour leads to a lower rate of failure and to more sustainable enterprises. Yet despite that, women find problems in getting hold of the financing that they need. One way forward could be specific programmes for investors to understand women’s entrepreneurship, and also the use of role models has been shown to produce great results, especially when it is linked to tailor-made mentoring and support services. To encourage women to enter the entrepreneurial world, the Commission has already taken a number of steps, such as the European Network of female entrepreneurship ambassadors and the creation of a network of mentors. But we want to do more, so this year we will launch an online platform for women of all ages who want to start, run and grow a business. The platform will provide training, mentoring, advice and business networking opportunities for women. It is meant to be a one-stop shop for female entrepreneurs. It will enable them to get in touch with other organisations, to enter into existing networks and to find information on funding. Thanks to a pilot project from Parliament, we also want to increase access to alternative sources of funding by creating a network of women business angels. In addition, as we have heard, women can play an important role in social entrepreneurship, and the Commission, via its expert group on social entrepreneurship, is working with interested parties to improve the situation of social enterprises in Europe. Finally we all know that, to support female entrepreneurs, we need to create an environment within which they can make the most of their potential. That is why we work together with Member States to ensure that issues like childcare and facilities for care of the elderly are addressed across Europe. Europe needs all of its talent, and I can assure you that the Commission will continue to work hard to promote and support female entrepreneurship and that this report from Parliament will help guide us in that task.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 212, "date": "2016-01-18.json", "name": "Ramón Luis VALCÁRCEL SISO", "mepid": "125032", "text": "   The debate is closed.

Recently, the self-employment rates of women in Europe were only 31%, while the part-time rates of women were 30% compared to 10% of men. In countries affected by mercelian austerity, such as Greece, the unemployment rate for women in the first quarter of 2015 reached 30.6% compared to 23.5% for men, with women paid 16% lower wages than men.

I thank Professor Krasnodębek for preparing a balanced opinion of the Committee on Culture and Education, as well as all the colleagues who tabled amendments. Your comments have contributed to the development and completion of this report.  A key element of the report on skills acquisition strategies to combat youth unemployment is to highlight the importance of better preparing graduates for labour market requirements. There is a need for a real partnership between the education sector and business, as well as for young people themselves to be involved in all measures to improve their situation on the labour market. There are good practices in this area, but they need to be disseminated.  My report also highlights the role of small and medium-sized enterprises in creating new jobs and the fundamental importance of educating entrepreneurial skills from an early age and promoting entrepreneurship. In addition, the report highlights the role of key skills, including those related to new technologies, and the importance of combining theoretical education with traineeships and traineeships. The report also stresses the importance of greater flexibility in education and lifelong learning systems and of removing barriers to education completion and re-certification. It draws attention to the under-util exploitation of skills training opportunities in the workplace. Another important aspect is equal opportunities by supporting young people from disadvantaged groups, including families affected by poverty, expatriates and young people with disabilities, to acquire the right professional and social skills and to make full use of their own opportunities.  Finally, I drew attention to the fact that the potential, talents and values and priorities of young people brought up in an era of rapid technological progress are very different from those of the previous generation. In my opinion, this is one of the reasons why the potential of the younger generation is still not fully understood and exploited. Therefore, it is worth investing in programmes that make it easier for employers and employment services to better understand the qualities, opportunities and potentials of the younger generation.  Tomorrow we will vote on this report. I am convinced that our joint work will contribute to better targeting measures to support young people's chances in the labour market, and that the report's conclusions will inspire further work.

As we have heard, youth unemployment is obviously one of the biggest challenges that we face in Europe, and if we are going to fight it effectively, we clearly need to get better at matching young people’s skills to what employers need. The Commission agrees that better cooperation – better partnership, as was said – between businesses, between education and training providers and local authorities, could help make skills training more relevant to what employers actually need. And with that in mind, increasing apprenticeships and workplace training is key. High-quality traineeships can help smooth the transition from education to employment, and we need to find ways that, for skills acquired outside traditional education, for example through volunteering or on-line learning, can themselves be better recognised. The youth guarantee remains a priority for the Commission, and the Commission will report on its implementation in October, and this will include an assessment of how well Member States have met the requirements of a quality framework for traineeships. To help Member States speed up the fight against youth unemployment, the Commission has proposed to increase the pre-financing for the Youth Employment Initiative from 1%-15% to 30%, and this was quickly accepted by the Council and Parliament and represents an advance payment to Member States of around EUR 1 billion. Other concerns set out in the report include the importance of promoting equal opportunities, of entrepreneurship and flexibility in education and training provision. These are all areas and concerns that the Commission shares, and work here is in progress. Last year we set priorities to improve cooperation on vocational education and training, and in the education and training 2020 framework. In November the Commission launched a cooperation initiative with businesses and other interested parties on a pact for youth. With business help, over the next two years this pact will deliver 10 000 business education partnerships and 100 000 new opportunities for young people: entry-level jobs, good quality apprenticeships and traineeship opportunities.

The report urges Member States to implement urgent structural reforms in the field of education in order to facilitate the transition from school to labour market.  Changes in the labour market require more flexible education systems that enable knowledge and skills to be complemented and developed at all stages of a professional career. It is important to acquire general, basic competences and transversal skills and abilities, such as information and communication technology, mathematics, critical thinking, knowledge of foreign languages, mobility, teamwork skills, communication that allow young people to adapt more quickly in a changing social and economic environment.

Youth are affected by unemployment more than any other age group – approximately 7.5 million young Europeans are currently neither in employment nor in training. To reduce youth unemployment, several actions should be taken.  First, we need to build stronger partnerships between authorities, educational institutions and businesses to better forecast future skills needs. Second, a new impetus should be given to STEM skills and vocational education. Best practices should be exchanged between Member States. Third, young people’s employability can be further improved by adopting new teaching and training methods. Schools should put more focus on soft skills to prepare youngsters for real ‘work-life’. Also, entrepreneurship education should be fostered from an early age. Last but not least, it should be the young people themselves who take their future in their hands.

Given the current refugee crisis, it should be assumed that the problem of youth unemployment is likely to increase. If we want to avoid the build-up of problems and a kind of ghettoisation, member states' education and training systems need to adapt very quickly to this situation. On the other hand, we should also bear in mind that young Citizens of the Union will gain new competition on the labour market and will require even stronger support. Therefore, the coming years will certainly be a huge challenge for both education systems and public employment services.  In order to combat youth unemployment, the focus must be on three pillars: formal education, career guidance and lifelong learning programmes.
