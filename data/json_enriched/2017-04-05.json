It took nine months to write a letter of six pages, but finally, we received the letter. Today is the day at the European Parliament and today’s signal is that we are ready, we can start and, hopefully, after the vote we can say we are united and we stay together in these negotiations. First of all, I would like to thank Guy Verhofstadt for his work in preparing our resolution. The message is clear on the procedure: first, divorce and, second, the future treaty. Then we underline what should be the atmosphere in the negotiations; we want to have a fair, constructive atmosphere built on trust. Then we have defined our priorities regarding citizenship: do not play with the legal uncertainty of citizens. We are underlining that, for us, the Northern Ireland question is a decisive one: avoid a hard border in Ireland. Then we have to talk about money. The top priorities are defined. Finally, we hope that London respects that the EU27 will continue. The Rome Declaration is clear and we have to talk about the future in our Union. The point is, from our point of view, a decisive difference. It is a very fundamental question: what does leave mean? What does it mean to leave the European Union? For example, on the question of security, I heard last week that Theresa May said that they want to stay in Europol. Europol is a European Agency – it is the European Union who is organising Europol – but they want to stay. So does leave mean no further access to Europol and to the Schengen Information System, or does leave mean to stay in them? Then we talk about the research union. Cambridge, Edinburgh, Paris and Milan are working closely together. So does this mean that with leave there will be no further cooperation, because at the moment the European Union is financing this? Then there is the single market. Trade is positive. Does leave mean no more access to the single market? Does leave mean no more cooperation? I feel that London thinks they will find the perfect deal, and that means they take the positive points and they leave the negative points. I have to clarify that this will not happen. Cherry-picking will not happen. A state outside the European Union cannot have the same, or better, conditions than a state inside this European Union. Liebe Kolleginnen und Kollegen! Was machen wir hier eigentlich? Beispielsweise Nordirland: Dort haben wir jetzt viele Sorgen von den Kollegen, die aus Belfast zu uns kommen, die äußern, dass der Friedensprozess unter Druck steht, dass wir eventuell Rückschritte machen. Oder Gibraltar: Da kann man darüber lachen, dass es in den letzten Tagen Diskussionen über möglichen Krieg gab. Aber tatsächlich hatte die Premierministerin eines großen Landes, nämlich Großbritanniens, die Notwendigkeit gesehen klarzustellen, dass es keine militärischen Aktivitäten gab. Wo sind wir denn gelandet? Über was reden wir eigentlich? Ich muss mal sagen: Sind wir eigentlich noch ganz bei Trost? Wir müssten eigentlich über Digitalisierung, über die Sicherheitsfragen unseres Kontinents reden und nicht über Debatten der letzten Jahrzehnte. Das zeigt uns, dass wir in die vollkommen falsche Richtung diskutieren, die uns leider Gottes von den Nationalisten und Populisten aufgedrückt wird. Und ich möchte den Spaniern und auch den Iren zurufen, dass sie dieses Mal eine andere Lage haben. Sie werden nämlich nicht ihre Interessen als Iren beispielsweise allein gegen London durchsetzen können. Oder auch die Spanier werden sich darauf verlassen können, dass sie nicht alleine stehen in der Debatte gegenüber London, wenn es um Gibraltar geht. Wir werden die große Chance haben, dass die EU-27 deutlich macht, dass wir eine große Familie sind und zusammenhalten, dass die irischen Interessen nicht nur irische, sondern europäische Interessen sind und dass die spanischen Interessen europäische Interessen sind. Und zu guter Letzt: Austritt aus der Europäischen Union. Theresa May formulierte: „Es ist kein Austritt aus Europa.“ Das mag für Menschen gelten, in der Beziehung zwischen Menschen mag das gelten. Wir bleiben Freunde, das ist vollkommen klar. Aber die Idee der Europäischen Union ist eine Idee des Miteinanders. Großbritannien wird zukünftig nicht mehr am Tisch sitzen, wenn die Außenminister über Syrien beraten. Sie werden nicht mehr am Tisch sitzen, wenn wir über die Ukraine beraten. Das heißt: Natürlich tritt Großbritannien aus der politischen Idee Europas aus, und das ist das, was leider Gottes sehr, sehr negativ ist. Positiv ist, dass wir am Ende des Tages Partner und Freunde bleiben. Aber in den Verhandlungen muss sich Großbritannien auf eine harte Verhandlungsposition der Europäischen Union vorbereiten.

Mercy for the victims. Twenty children died. Shame! Shame for the principals, shame for the political leaders and also for those who, washing their hands, gave the impression of giving carte blanche to the Syrian regime. When you are faced with a real war, you realize the irresponsibility of certain politicians. Don't laugh! Two days ago, as my colleague Weber recalled, a former British conservative leader feared the risk of a war between the United Kingdom and Spain. These are the words of amateurs in disarray. I hope the British citizens understand which hands they have ended up in. The Tories wanted the referendum and the day after the vote they didn't even know the procedure for asking for a divorce. The integrity of the UK is at risk. You wanted to take back control, but what? You promised a better future. Your lies have only created chaos in the UK. We will not lie. (Applause) This institution is the first to respond. And I too thank my colleague Verhofstadt and those who have worked the most on this resolution. We are ready to use our veto power if the conditions set out in the resolution are not met. Our priority is to protect the rights acquired by those European citizens now threatened by Brexit. We want to tell some truths. First: a country outside the European Union will never be able to benefit from the same conditions as when it was a member. We need to discuss the terms of the divorce. Only when we have made substantial progress will the future relationship be discussed. We also return any blackmail or blackmail to the sender. If anyone from the UK wants to use common security as a blackmail weapon, they are wrong! Second truth: any future deal with the UK it will be conditional on compliance with the Union's social, environmental and tax standards. We will never tolerate the creation of a maxi tax haven at the gates of the European Union. There will be no favorable treatment of the City, and we will not accept any race to the bottom for workers' rights. Third truth: peace in Northern Ireland today - and that should worry you! - is more fragile, and we must preserve it. And all the financial commitments undertaken, as happens in all families, when you leave the house and go to another house, you have to pay the bills for electricity, gas, energy. And this concerns everyone, it is not a disfavour against someone. And finally, Brexit has taught us that the European Union cannot be just the sum of national interests united by a single market. We are first of all a community of values, first of all solidarity. May Brexit be an opportunity to find ourselves even more united around our common destiny.

The peoples whose jobs, businesses, economy and security all depend on us to take the EU in the right direction. A new direction. The UK leaving must not be a missed opportunity to create positive change. That is why the ECR Group adopted last week its vision of a reformed and decentralised European Union. I can recommend it to you. Britain is an island, not a boat. It will remain where it is, it will remain one of our most important economic, political and security partners. The United Kingdom and the European Union are friends, not enemies. This should not be a nasty break-up but the beginning of a deep and special partnership between long-standing allies. We need to start work on a comprehensive deal right now, a deal that looks at everything: cooperation on security, trade, education, research, transport and, yes, money. Everything from the start. There is no time to lose. If we do anything less, history will judge us harshly as having been small and petty when the challenges of our age required us to be bold and visionary. Mr Verhofstadt, you spent a great deal of time in your campaign for president of the Parliament distancing yourself from the backroom deals of the past. Yet, once again, the pleas for openness and transparency feel like the same old empty promises – promises which those outside of Brussels are increasingly frustrated with. The negotiation and process of this resolution have sought to exclude the opinions of some political groups and Members in this Parliament. When you do that, you do not just exclude the voices of those Members, but also the voices of their electorates. Mr Verhofstadt, no one is asking you to agree with everyone, but you could at least listen to what they have to say. That is not to say that we do not agree with anything in the joint motion. We do. We agree, for example, that it is essential that the rights of EU citizens in the UK and of UK citizens in the EU are dealt with quickly and fairly. But we do not share other key points. We believe the European Parliament should seek to support the EU negotiator not make life more difficult by making excessive demands in advance. That just looks like the same old tired tactics, which undermine the credibility of this Chamber. The three-year limit on transitional arrangement seems arbitrary. We might want different lengths for different issues. We deeply regret that all the work prepared by Parliament’s committees was just brushed aside. Mr President, fellow Members, my hope is that the EU will emerge from Brexit renewed and able to prevent the departure of other Member States. The next two years should be about building the faith of the peoples of Europe in the decisions we are making. If the EU is to come back stronger and if we really want to win back the confidence lost by our citizens, then this is not only the moment to determine how we will work with the UK in the future, but also how we can get the EU back on track. I call on all colleagues to listen to the recent statements by several European leaders who show that there are alternatives to ever more Europe. We need to follow the path to a decentralised confederal Europe. There simply is no support for more centralising Euro-federalism.

That was my feeling anyway: a very sad moment. It is true, naturally, that the relationship between Britain and Europe was never an easy relationship, let us recognise that. It was never a love affair and certainly not a question of wild passion. I think it was a little bit like a marriage of convenience, if I can use that term.  It was already clear, dear colleagues, from the beginning. In the 1950s Britain decided against membership of the European Coal and Steel Community. Attlee and Labour did not want it, and it was Churchill and the Tories who were in favour, it is good to recall this. And in 1955 at the start of the Common Market, Britain walked away from the negotiating table. In the early years of the Union it was the British Prime Minister Macmillan who looked at the continent with nothing less than suspicion. What were they cooking up there in Brussels, were they really discussing coal and steel and customs union, or were they also talking politics in Brussels, plotting on foreign policy? Oh, God forbid, defence matters even! So British Prime Minister Macmillan wrote to his foreign minister, and, I quote, I have the quote here: ‘For the first time since Napoleon the major continental powers are united in a positive economic grouping, but considerable political aspects’, and to his own surprise, Macmillan had to admit this new experiment, and I quote further, ‘was not directed against Britain.’ So when Britain finally joined the European Union in 1973 after, as we all know, several blockades by General de Gaulle, the headlines were festive. You have to read all the British press in 1973, it was a great day for Britain to join the European Union. Let us be honest about this, it was only a short honeymoon, as we know, because Margaret Thatcher asked for her money back and her successor John Major called the euro, and I quote again, ‘a currency as strange as a rain dance, with the same impotence’. Well, I have to tell you that the pound slipping against the euro, as we see today was not exactly what Major expected at that moment. But all the rest, let us be honest with each other, is history. Perhaps let us recognise that it was maybe impossible to unite Great Britain with the Continent, and naive maybe to reconcile the legal system of Napoleon with the common law of the British Empire, and perhaps it was never meant to be. (Applause) But, and this is important – and I hope you are applauding this also – our predecessors should never be blamed for having tried, because it is important in politics, as it is in life, to try new partnerships, new horizons, to reach out to the other, to the other side of the channel. I am also convinced and 100% sure about one thing: that one day or another, dear colleagues, there will be a young man or a young woman who will try again, who will lead Britain into the European family once again. (Applause) And a young generation that will see Brexit for what it really is: a catfight in the Conservative party that got out of hand. A loss of time, a waste of energy, and I think, a stupidity. Although I continue to think that Brexit is a sad and regrettable event, I also believe it is important to remember something. Remember what Britain and Europe in these more than 40 years have achieved together. It is true, we may not have had the most passionate relationship, but it was not a failure either, not for Europe, and certainly not for Britain and the British. Let us not forget, Britain entered the Union as the sick man of Europe, and thanks to the single market, came out the other side. Europe also made Britain punch above its weight in terms of geopolitics, as in the heyday of the British Empire. And we, from all sides, must pay tribute to Britain, to Britain’s immense contributions as a staunch and unmatched defender of free markets and civil liberties. And thank you for that because as a Liberal, I will miss that in the future. Colleagues, within a few weeks we will start the process of separation. And I think, Mr Juncker and Mr Barnier, the goal must be to have a new and stable relationship and a deep and comprehensive partnership and association between the UK and the EU that certainly will be very different, as we all know, from membership. In this new venture let us always remember one thing. Our common bonds, our common culture, our common and shared values, our joint heritage, our history. And let us never forget that together we in fact belong to the same great European civilisation, from the Atlantic port of Bristol, I go as far as to the banks of the mighty river Volga; but maybe that is a little too far for the moment. But let us be honest, and this will be my final point. Brexit is not only about Brexit. Brexit has to be also about our capacity for a rebirth of our European project, because let us recognise that Brexit did not happen by accident. Even though since Brexit I see what I call a change for the good in the mood of the public, let us not fool ourselves: Europe is not yet rescued and Europe has not yet recovered from the crisis. Europe is still in need of change, I think in need of radical change: change towards a real Union, an effective Union based on values and based on the real interests of our citizens. And a Union also – and I want to conclude with this – that stands up against autocrats. Autocrats will close down their universities, to give one example.  (Applause) Autocrats will throw journalists into jail, as is happening today. Autocrats will make corruption their trademark. And yesterday, as we all have seen, beyond any humanity, autocrats again bombed innocent women and children with chemical weapons in Syria, to give the nastiest example. So in these negotiations which will have to start in the coming weeks, let us never forget why our founding fathers – British and other Europeans alike – launched this European project. There are three words: freedom, justice and peace – these are three great things that are worth fighting for.

Almost nine months have passed since the British referendum. Article 50 was triggered last week and it is clear that the divorce between the UK and the EU is going through. The time when the contestants show each other the instruments and the weapons is over. The time of irresponsible demagogy, especially from Mr. Farage and others, is over. Now we have to negotiate hard. Now is the time for those who really need to be clear and precise, prudent, fair and respectful of one another in order to find solutions that enable the United Kingdom and the European Union to work together. This separation clearly shows how closely interwoven the structures that have become the lifelines between the member states have become. It affects all areas. The time to negotiate this in 15 months is incredibly short - we all know that. So it requires that we as Parliament are not only involved today, not only at the end, when it comes to the act of separation, but that we can also agree in the interim assessments here in Parliament that we should be at the moment when it is said : \"Phase two is triggered\", also asked here as a parliament. What is important to us We believe that in the foreground the rights of the people, the citizens of the European Union, namely the previous 28, must stand. It is important to us that the rights of UK citizens, the citizens of the UK in the EU, EU citizens in the UK, who together are already over 4 million, plus the rights of the 1.8 million people living in Northern Ireland live, be preserved. And we all know very well that there are then not only those directly affected, but that there are effects on behavior, on cooperation in important regions of the European Union there. We welcome the fact that the Good Friday Agreement with the North of Ireland is firmly anchored in the joint proposal and is viewed as a whole. The European Union has always been an active contributor and a guarantor for the workings of this Good Friday Agreement, and for this reason alone we should make it our duty here to consider the interests of the people on the Irish island as a whole and there at all times not allow a new frontier to emerge in the European Union in the 21st century. I don't want to have a border in my country again, never again a border and a wall that is impermeable. (Applause) What are we all about? We want the fundamental rights, social rights, practically what constitutes human dignity, to always be in the foreground in these negotiations. That must be our common goal and pivotal point, and I can tell you that the way we negotiate with one another will also determine what future the European Union has. And we also have to ask ourselves why demagogues like Mr Farage have managed to turn the mood in Great Britain around in such a way that this ultimately came about. It wasn’t just the national problems inside Great Britain or the Tories, it’s also the problems we have within the EU that we have not solved. So where is our social union? Where is the employment protection? Where is social protection, the social pillar? Where is our promise for more democracy? That is what we need to signal to people. Let's fight this fight together.

And by choosing the hardest form of Brexit you chose the most extreme interpretation of the referendum. In doing so, you encouraged all those on the continent as well as in the UK from the fringes of the political landscape and the benches of your own governments who have made grandstanding and threatening their brand of politics. On the one hand, we have to all those who call for making Britain the world champion of social and tax dumping, or even for starting a war with Spain. On the other hand, we have those who say we should punish the United Kingdom. Have the last 70 years not told them anything? Mrs May, by your own choice you dug yourself a hole of contradictions. How can you have a hard Brexit without having a hard border in Ireland? How can you – to use your own words – have the freest possible trade in goods and services between Britain and the EU while you take the UK out of the single market, which allows precisely that? But above all, how can you reconcile a hard Brexit with your own stated desire of a more united UK and our claim to represent every person in the United Kingdom, including the large number of people, especially the young generation who voted in favour of remaining in the European Union? Resolving those contradictions, so as to minimise damage to our citizens must be the objective of the negotiations to come. If we want common sense and the general interest to prevail we must ignore those who shout and posture. I agree with you, Mrs May, when you say you want to build a stronger, fairer, better Britain. Achieving stronger, fairer and better societies is a goal that many share in this Chamber. Delivering this requires us to face the Trumps and the Putins of this world, to tackle climate change, to fight terrorism and organised crime, to find common responses to the global migration challenge, to curb corporate power. And who can believe, who seriously can believe when EU citizens altogether represent 7% of the global population on 2% of the land, that any – I say any – of our Member States, including the largest is better equipped to faces challenges on its own? Mrs May, like it or not, we are in this together. Taking back control, being recognised as global players, requires all Europeans, including Britons, to act together. There is no such thing as absolute sovereignty. In the 21st century we can only reconquer sovereignty for democracies by sharing it. Mrs May, you want to build a Britain your children and grandchildren are proud to call home. Let me remind you that, as we speak, many of your own citizens are proud to call not just Britain but Europe home.

We have had a little history lesson this morning from Mr Verhofstadt, but he made one mistake. In 1973, sir, we did not join the European Union; we joined the European Economic Community. Had the British people known that it was the intention to get political and take away our ability to govern ourselves, we never would have done so.  I am sorry to say that the response to the triggering of Article 50 has been all too predictable. Already you have made a series of demands that are not just unreasonable, but, in some cases, clearly impossible for Britain to comply with. You began by telling us that we have to pay a bill: a cool GBP 52 billion, a figure that has clearly been plucked out of the air, which is effectively a form of ransom demand. What you could have acknowledged is that we put over GBP 200 billion net into this project. We are actually shareholders in this building and the rest of the assets and really you should be making us an offer we cannot refuse, to go.  The ever-charming Mr Verhofstadt, Parliament’s chief negotiator, in his resolution that we are to vote on later today, tells us that we cannot discuss potential trade deals with anybody else in the world until we have left the European Union. That has no basis in Treaty law whatsoever. It is rather like saying you cannot guarantee yourself a dwelling for when you leave prison and I trust the British Government will completely ignore you. I suspect that Mr Tusk, who is not with us today, is still crying. He looked pretty tearful, did he not, after the British Ambassador delivered the letter last week? He tells us in his memorandum that any future trade deal must ensure that the United Kingdom is not allowed to have a competitive advantage. This is all impossible. Add to that the hypocrisy of saying, on the one hand, that the EU will negotiate as one, and clause 22 of the Tusk document which says that the Spanish can have a total veto over the whole trade deal if they are not happy with the sovereignty of Gibraltar.  We believe in national self-determination. Your aim and ambition is to destroy nation state democracy. Gibraltar is clearly a deal-breaker on current terms. With these demands, you have shown yourselves to be vindictive, to be nasty, and all I can say is thank goodness we are leaving. You are behaving like the mafia.

In a defining and challenging moment for our Union, the role of this Parliament is more important than ever. You must scrutinize and validate the final agreement. No negotiation, no separation without representation. This is the reason that from the very start I pushed for this House to have a full and active role in the process. I would like to thank and congratulate my friend Guy Verhofstadt and all parties involved for the speed and clarity of the resolution that you are voting on today. I will not give a detailed response today on each point but, given the cross-party support in this House, it is clear that we are on the same lines when it comes to the big issues. That is absolutely crucial because this is the time to stay united, this is the time to stay undivided. During these negotiations, every one of our institutions and every one of our 27 Member States must be singing from the same hymn sheet. The stronger we are as 27, the stronger we will be in the negotiations. You already know our chief negotiator Michel Barnier very well, but over the course of the next two years you will become even more familiar with him. I have to say, before the start of the negotiations that he is doing a good job. Sometimes, not very often, I take wrong decisions but - don’t laugh - but one of the best decisions I have taken since I have been President of the Commission was the appointment of Michel Barnier as our chief negotiator. (Applause) It is normal that your Parliament will have a say on the final deal, but more importantly, you are the checks and balances during the negotiations themselves. This is fundamentally a constitutional question for our Union: a third country cannot have the same benefits as a Member State. This Parliament must, and will, ensure that this reality is fully upheld over the course of the next two years. We will negotiate in friendship and openness, not in a hostile mood, with a country that has brought so much to our Union, and will remain close to our hearts long after they have left. But this is now the time for reason, rather than emotion. Sehr verehrter Herr President, meine Damen und Herren, liebe Kollegen! Es geht bei diesen Verhandlungen nicht nur um Verträge und Paragrafen, schon gar nicht um diplomatisches Pingpong oder intergouvernementales Scharmützel. Es geht um das Leben von vielen Millionen Menschen. Mehr als vier Millionen Menschen haben berufliche und familiäre Brücken von und nach Großbritannien geschlagen und damit grundlegende biografische Entscheidungen, ja Lebensentscheidungen getroffen. Sie haben sich in ihre Arbeit gestürzt mit vollem Vertrauen in die Zuverlässigkeit der Europäischen Union, haben Kinder in die Schule geschickt, erfolgreich Geschäfte gemacht und sich so ein auf Dauer angelegtes Leben aufgebaut. Wenn wir nun in die Verhandlungen einsteigen, dann tun wir dies auch und vor Allem in ihrem Namen. Die Kommission wird Fürsprecherin der direkt Betroffenen diesseits und jenseits des Kanals sein. Wir treten dafür ein, dass Arbeitnehmer, Unternehmer, Studenten, Rentner nicht diejenigen sein werden, die den Preis für den Brexit zahlen. Menschen sind keine Verhandlungsmasse. (Beifall) Und sie dürfen nicht zum Faustpfand in den Verhandlungen werden. Ihre Interessen sind unser Auftrag, und wir werden deshalb sicherstellen, dass die britische Brexit-Entscheidung sie nicht in Unsicherheiten und ins Ungewisse stürzt. Das gilt übrigens auch für alle diejenigen, die sich auf EU-Projekte verlassen, die bereits geplant und genehmigt sind. Eingegangene Versprechen, eingegangene Verpflichtungen sind absolut einzuhalten! Allgemein gilt: Eine ungeordnete Scheidung ist der denkbar ungünstigste Fall. Kein Deal, das wäre ein äußerst nachteiliges Szenario für viele Menschen und für viele Familien, ein nachteiliges Szenario für Forschung, für polizeiliche Zusammenarbeit, für Handel. Kurzum, kein Deal heißt: Niemand gewinnt, alle werden verlieren. Deshalb werden wir die Verhandlungen mit Großbritannien so führen, dass wir die menschlichen, wirtschaftlichen, politischen Unwägbarkeiten des Brexit so weit wie möglich abmildern. Wir wollen in going Fairness verhandeln - in going Fairness, ja, aber ohne nachsichtige Naivität. Ich weiß: Sanfte Neugeburten sehen verlockend aus. Aber - ich möchte das auch Herrn Farage sagen - nicht die Europäische Union verlässt Großbritannien, Großbritannien verlässt die Europäische Union. (Beifall) Unsere Scheidungsanwälte, German vor Michel Barnier, werden nun im Detail die vielen Errungenschaften auseinanderdividieren müssen, die wir in 44 Jahren gemeinsamer, nicht krisenfreier Ehe angehäuft haben. Dies ist die notwendige Voraussetzung, damit unsere neue Partnerschaft auf eine Solid Grundlage zu stehen kommt. Neue Partnerschaften können erst nach sauberer, klarer, unmissverständlicher, nicht interpretierbarer Klärung früherer Verhältnisse erfolgen. Parallele Verhandlungen über die Zukunft können nicht stattfinden. Verhandlungen über die Zukunft finden erst statt, wenn die Fragen, die uns aus der Vergangenheit erwachsen, allesamt zufriedenstellend geklärt sind. (Beifall) Mr President, Ladies and Gentlemen, the choice of the United Kingdom to leave the Union is a choice which heralds the end of the European Union of 28. The separation that is looming at the he horizon makes me deeply sad. The choice of the British people, respectable as it is, does not support either continental or world history. However, the announced separation marks a new birth, that of the European Union of 27. This European Union of 27 is already functioning: from September of last year, the 27 met in Bratislava to adopt a route that encompasses our priorities for the coming years. This work of reflection and action continued at the Malta summit last February and culminated in the celebration of the sixtieth anniversary of the European Union in Rome on March 25. In Rome, we renewed our wedding vows, out of choice and pride, with the feeling of having accomplished, but not yet finished, our duty on a continental scale. Far from stopping there, we will continue to build the European edifice with renewed energy. While we were gathered in Rome, a citizen and popular mobilization in favor of our common project was expressed with vigor in many European cities. I would like to greet, and with a certain emotion, all those who, in our streets and in our public places, march for Europe. They remind me of the ardor of the founding fathers of Europe. (Applause) Today we have to make choices about how we want to work, act and progress concretely together. This debate can be based on the White Paper published by the Commission. We must organize this debate on the future and the future of Europe across Europe with our national parliaments, with our regions, so necessary for our cohesion, with our civil societies, with artists and creators. , without whose contribution we would not have become what we are. The choices we make now, today, tomorrow, two years from now or by 2025 must take into account their consequences not only for us, but especially for generations to come, because we will be judged not on what was bequeathed to us, but on what we will have left as a legacy.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 16, "date": "2017-04-05.json", "name": "Michel BARNIER", "mepid": "72776", "text": "chief negotiator. - Mr President, good morning to each and every one of you, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you, Distinguished Presidents, for allowing me to speak today directly to your Parliament, as a negotiator and alongside President Jean-Claude Juncker who, the very first, trusted me for this mission, and that I thank. I would like to salute the very important work that you have already accomplished together under the aegis of President Tajani with all the groups and committees and, of course, behind Guy Verhofstadt and his team. Dear Guy, we have started to work constructively and effectively and I am sure that will continue until the end of the road. So, ladies and gentlemen, your resolution today will be the very first political position taken by a European institution in response to Theresa May's letter to the President of the European Council last week. With this resolution, you will set the tone, of course addressing the British government, the governments of the twenty-seven countries of the European Union, but also and above all European citizens. As far as I'm concerned, I obviously understand the message you want to send me at the same time. Our common goal is to succeed in this negotiation, that is to say to reach an agreement. There are three conditions for this that I would like to quickly recall. The first condition, which has just been underlined by Jean-Claude Juncker, is unity. It is by remaining united that we will best defend, together, the interests of the twenty-seven countries of the European Union and their citizens and, at the same time, as each of the group chairmen has underlined, the fundamental principles and the values ​​on which the European project, which was recalled in Rome, has been based from day one. Unity is essential above all for the Union but also for our British partners. At the end of the road - and I would like to say this so that everyone is well convinced - if the Union were disunited, we would simply take the risk that there would be no agreement. However, the absence of an agreement - Philippe Lamberts said so very forcefully earlier - would have very serious consequences. Of course and first for the UK, but also for the Union. This is why I repeat that the scenario of a no deal is not ours. Our ambition must be to succeed, not against the UK but with the UK. Not against the United Kingdom but with the United Kingdom. Ms. Helga Stevens, I heard the appeal you made earlier. For this we will need to explain what we are doing and why we are doing it. We have a duty of truth towards citizens. Perhaps we must finally say objectively, without aggressiveness and calmly what Brexit means, what it means quite simply to leave the European Union. Can I also say that this negotiation should have an educational dimension for all of us? It will be an opportunity to recall day after day, or even to rediscover, all the progress made together and which we have often forgotten: progress for the daily life of citizens, consumers and businesses. Ladies and gentlemen, our unity will be all the stronger as it is built in transparency and in public debate. This extraordinary negotiation - which must remain extraordinary - that we will conduct transparently will not be a secret negotiation. The second condition is to remove the uncertainties. Where the UK's decision to leave the Union creates uncertainty and insecurity, our role is to restore certainty and legal certainty, first for citizens, but also for beneficiaries of the European budget, in the United Kingdom as in the other countries of the Union as well as at the borders of the Union. To remove this uncertainty, the principles that I will have to defend on your behalf must be perfectly clear. For European citizens in the United Kingdom and vice versa, the continuity and reciprocity of the rights they currently have, until the day of Brexit, must be effectively guaranteed and without discrimination, as President Pittella said earlier. the hour with force. I was obviously attentive to what each of the group chairs said in turn. Theresa May's letter, by the way, also calls for early agreement on this issue. But, ladies and gentlemen members of Parliament - and I can say this in light of the work that I have been doing with our team over the past six months - the devil is in the details. We will have to ensure, beyond an agreement in principle, that this agreement provides effective guarantees for citizens, as President Juncker has just said, and it will also be the role of Parliament to be vigilant. For the budget, a single financial regulation will cover all the commitments the UK has made with us, and us with it, as a Member State. Here again, your resolution is unambiguous. We will never seek to punish the UK. Never! We will ask the UK to simply pay what it has committed to as a member state. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr Farage, we just have to settle the accounts, no more and no less. No more no less! (Applause) Finally, for the borders, especially in Ireland - as Ms. Gabriele Zimmer reminded us - arrangements will have to be found which never call into question the existing fragile balances, dialogue and, in particular, the Good Friday Agreement. , while being naturally compatible with Union law. The third condition is doing things in the right order and putting them into perspective. The UK letter makes clear that the UK Government will push for parallel negotiations on withdrawal and on future relations. This is a very risky approach. To succeed, we need, on the contrary, to devote the first phase of negotiations exclusively to reaching an agreement on the principles of the exit. We are not proposing this to be tactical or create difficulties for the UK. On the contrary, it is an essential condition to maximize our chances of reaching an agreement together within two years, which is very short. It is also our best chance, as Manfred Weber mentioned very clearly, to build trust before proceeding to the second phase of negotiations. This second phase will be devoted to scoping our future relations and to discussing the necessary transitory arrangements. To put it differently, the sooner we agree on the principles of an orderly withdrawal, the sooner we can prepare our future relations in trade: obviously, a free and fair trade agreement, a level playing field, but also in security and defense. It is on the basis of these three conditions - unity, lifting uncertainty, and phasing of negotiations - that we can succeed, and your resolution will set the tone. My hope is that the European Parliament makes these three conditions its own. Finally, Ladies and Gentlemen, Mr President, I will add just a word about our common work from now to the end of the road. As President Juncker said, in this negotiation your role will be essential from start to finish. The beginning is today's resolution, and the end will be your vote on the draft withdrawal agreement that we will be negotiating for two years. With this vote, you will have the last word. All along the road, it is first of all in the European Parliament that the democratic debate on this negotiation will take place, which is not and will not be a negotiation like the others. This public debate, here and in each of your countries, is essential for a successful Brexit, but also for reaching an agreement on others. future relations, which I would remind you that will have to be ratified by your Parliament but also by national parliaments.Along the way, we will work together, every step of the way and every moment.This is why I am happy to be, today, before you, to have had the opportunity to speak alongside President Junker and the Council, and this is also why I will continue to work intrust with President Donald Tusk and his team on the eve of the extraordinary European Council on April 29.Ladies and Gentlemen, I will remain available for your Conference of Group Chairs, for the Conference of Committee Chairs and, as far as I can, for each of your groups.In conclusion, I just want to confirm that, throughout this long and extraordinary negotiation, my team and I will always be at your disposal.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 17, "date": "2017-04-05.json", "name": "Esteban GONZÁLEZ PONS", "mepid": "125027", "text": "- Mr President, over the past three hundred years, British politicians have hit the right side of politics so many times that they have come to believe that the right thing to do was simply to be English. And that's where, unfortunately, now they are wrong. They are wrong because reason is always on the side of solidarity. They are wrong when they leave, but they want to organize life for those of us who remain, like today, when the conservatives present a plan for the future of a European Union in which they will no longer be. They are wrong when they want us to close the single market to Scotland, which wants to be European, but they intend to leave us in Gibraltar, which is not a constitutional part of the United Kingdom and is a tax haven. They are wrong when they do not see that extreme nationalism leads to racism. Only seven days have passed since Brexit and we do not stop hearing contempt for Spain and the most nationalists with the word \"war\" on their lips. They are wrong if they believe that outside the European Union they will have the same friends as inside, the same rights as inside, the same opportunities as inside. You are wrong if you think that Europeans prefer a good fight to a good deal. They are wrong if they treat the European Union as a divisible project without realizing that the United Kingdom is also divisible. You are wrong if you believe that the European Union is not going to defend each and every one of its Member States, that we are not going to surrender to the future. Europe is the largest market in the world. Europe is the largest area of ​​peace, freedom and security in the world. Europe is the largest provider of social services in the world. Europe is the best idea 20th century politicians had. We are not going to give up. They are wrong if they think it doesn't hurt that they leave. It hurts us, a lot. Unfortunately, this time the UK is going to be walking on the wrong side of history. I tell you with friendship, I tell you with loyalty.

We regret the decision to leave the EU, but we respect it. We also know, and will not forget, that a large number of UK citizens voted to remain because they understand that the European project is the only way to protect and to recover our sovereignty in a globalised world. Our guiding principle in the whole process will be to protect the rights and interests of the citizens we directly represent. We want to ensure an orderly withdrawal of the UK from the EU, avoiding a no—deal scenario, which would have negative consequences for all, but in particular for the United Kingdom. For this reason, we call on the UK Government to agree as soon as possible on the principles of the withdrawal provisions in order to allow us to begin talks on the main features of the future relationships and on the necessary transitional arrangements. We fully support the sequencing set out by Michel Barnier. In this context, Parliament will pay particular attention to the need to protect the rights of the EU 27 citizens living or having lived in the UK and vice versa, because people – as President Juncker said – are not negotiating chips. We will also ensure that the financial settlement will cover all the commitments and liabilities, and we will insist on the absolute need to safeguard the Northern Ireland peace process and to avoid a hardening of the border in Ireland.  The future relationship between the EU and the UK should be a close partnership, based on balanced and comprehensive agreement, but it cannot provide similar benefits to those enjoyed by the Union Member States. The European Parliament will not accept any trade—off between security and economy, nor any cherry—picking. We will want an agreement which is fully in line with our standards on the environment, the fight against tax evasion and the protection of social rights. I am confident that the vote will show that this Parliament is united in line with this principle, that we back the EU negotiator and that we will honour our constitutional obligations, contributing to that unity of the EU, to a successful negotiation and to the defence of our common values and projects.

This, I guarantee, would cause immense damage to the economies of the European Union and would result in putting many of your citizens out of work. It is what we call, in the UK, cutting off your nose to spite your face. However, the most offensive position that you have taken is the proposal that Spain will have the right to veto any Brexit deal over the issue of Gibraltar. I want to make it clear in this Chamber today that the people of Gibraltar are proudly British. In 2002, 99% of Gibraltarians voted in a referendum against shared sovereignty with Spain, and the wishes of the people should be upheld. I do, however, have a solution to prevent Gibraltar being used as a pawn in Brexit negotiations and, indeed, end Spanish claims once and for all. Make Gibraltar a fully integrated part of the UK; give her and our other overseas territories their own Member of Parliament.

I have to remember right now that I took part in a demonstration in London in 1975 for Britain to remain in the European Union - in a Britain that was economically and politically eroded by strikes and industrial decline. We are debating today about a Britain that has regained strength through membership of the European Union. And at this demonstration there was a Ms. Thatcher who was and always fought for British membership and who made the internal market possible, who also made the Maastricht Treaty possible in the Tory government. I have to say: all the treaties, Mr Farage, have since been ratified by the British House of Commons and are therefore fully legitimized. Today's Europe also has the legitimacy of Great Britain! That should be recorded. We want constructive negotiations, fair negotiations, no revenge - in our common interest. But it must also be clear: Those who do not want to bear the burdens of the EU, the internal market or the customs union cannot save their advantages through a trade agreement. It must therefore be clear that you do not have the same opportunities in the internal market or elsewhere as if you were a member. That is fair behavior. And I think that for this reason we cannot see that we should allow threatening backdrops. You follow us in the divorce agreement and in the free trade agreement, we ensure your security. Security in Europe against terror - London should know that - against terrorism, against external attacks is in the British interest, this is in the common interest, this cannot be offset. I believe this will also be understood in the UK. That's why it's not a threatening backdrop, but a lack of understanding. And you have to know: this European Parliament must approve the divorce treaty. We will pay attention to the conditions. It will have to agree to a transition agreement and it will have to agree to the final outcome. That is why I think it is good to be on good terms with the European Parliament and that we are fighting for your country and for everyone as the EU of 27, for the rights of the citizens - the rights of the citizens of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland - to secure across the European Union. We do not want the rhetoric of war, as happened again with Gibraltar, we want to defend a Europe that has brought 70 years of peace, even at this hour!

Europe has the right to establish a requirement that leaving the \"club\" is not free, so that it is not better to leave than to stay. It is a pedagogy of cost that Europe has to establish as a condition of its own continuity. Secondly, I think it is important to point out to Mr Barnier that it could be important that at the same time that we negotiate the exit from the European Union, we have a framework that ensures the rights of the four million British and European citizens who live together, because it is important that this agreement is simultaneous to the exit. And thirdly, I would like to vindicate what I believe is the end of this process. And we have to seek an agreement, but, ladies and gentlemen, an agreement that must also be the result of a desire to coexist, also with Gibraltar. Spain does not intend to wage a war of sovereignty, it does not intend to wage a war of sovereignty with Gibraltar, but Spain has a pending historical dispute and wants to live with Gibraltar.

Brexit is not the disease, but the symptom. The disease is the way of thinking that thrives in some parts of the EU, but especially here in the European Parliament, which is about wanting this project to develop into a federal superstate. If one learns from Brexit by moving forward with a common army, with joint initiatives in a number of areas, yes with the whole of Mr. Verhofstadt's major project on a new constitution for Europe with a view to introducing such a superstate, then Brexit will simply be the starting point for a number of Member States to no longer be able to see themselves in European cooperation.

In Ireland, peace and war are at stake. For citizens, the legal foundations of the Union are at stake - I prefer to speak of legal foundations, rather than values, which are too subjective and therefore questionable. Brexit, from this point of view, worries me. Millions of European citizens in the United Kingdom and of British people in the Union risk losing fundamental, social and civil rights, currently guaranteed by European law. One of the purposes of Brexit is the Great Repeal Bill, which will cancel that right, create an even more unregulated economy and could herald the exit from the Human Rights Convention.

Only on one condition will they see specific acquired rights protected: that they do not become a bargaining chip and are registered in the withdrawal agreement.

This is what this House is doing today. First and foremost, we should aim to overcome the uncertainty regarding the lives of both EU citizens on the island and UK citizens in the European Union. Their lives should not be used as a bargaining chip, as has been underlined many times. There is also the issue of security cooperation, which is beneficial for both sides in this process. Second, trading freely would be in everyone’s interest, but the UK cannot have a better deal outside the Union and the single market than it has currently. In any future arrangement, the UK will have to play by the same rules as everyone else.

And boy are we threatened, both economically and politically. But with this solidarity we can be confident that the terms of the Good Friday Agreement will be observed to the letter, that there will not be, cannot be and must not be a return to a hard border and that the prosperity of Ireland, especially our exporting sector, must not and cannot and will not be sacrificed on the high altar of expediency or pride.

We lost the EU referendum, and while it saddens me to say it, Britain is leaving the EU – but those dangers are still there. In all our countries, there are families for whom the Brexit vote has created worrying uncertainty – millions of people concerned about their rights to live and work in countries they have made home. Citizens across Europe are now at risk of the economic consequences of a bad deal – or even worse, no deal at all – and people in all 28 countries will suffer if Brexit means competition on low wages, lax environmental standards and scaled back rights for workers and consumers.

Breakup is always painful, and if there is strength in unity, disunity is a terrible source of vulnerability. The British have nothing to gain by finding themselves isolated on the international scene and losing all the benefits that membership of the European Union brought them: freedom of movement, freedom of residence, the single market, the charter fundamental rights, and so on. The European Union will also lose. She finds herself with a limb amputated, weakened in many of her policies and with millions of citizens with uncertain futures. Again, the list goes on. But while the pain that all pro-Europeans feel today is severe, we remain politicians nonetheless. So, despite the sadness that we may feel as individuals vis-à-vis our colleagues, comrades or friends, we must move forward and turn this political crisis into an opportunity for the refoundation of Europe. We will have to fight to ensure that citizens are the first priority in the UK exit negotiations, and then in the possible partnership that will follow. But, above all, we will have to hear the anger that carried the supporters of Brexit and reform Europe in depth so that tomorrow, membership of the European Union is once again evident to its inhabitants.

The least that can be said is that it has been a long road, synonymous with a certain lack of preparation on the part of the British government.

On the one hand, there are the technical aspects, which number in the thousands: the resolution we are presenting today, which makes our institution a democratic bloc capable of agreeing on the red lines and which it is important to defend in the negotiations, is a working basis for the Commission and the Member States. But on the other hand, there is the act of communicating, of explaining, of speaking to citizens, which is a matter of concrete and useful politics. We are elected officials in contact with women and men in our Eurocirconscriptions. In the vagueness that has reigned so far, some may have said to me: \"You see, sir, it does not change anything to get out of the European Union\", believing that the UK was already outside. Populists or extremists also play on the fears and isolated national destinies of the Union, but let's be honest: isolation leads to decline. No longer belonging to our community of destiny will inevitably weaken this undoubtedly disunited kingdom tomorrow, with Scotland eager to be part of the world's leading economic power, the European continent. Things must be clear: the United Kingdom has chosen to leave the single market, it will lose economic sovereignty.

Ensuring their rights must be our top priority from the beginning of the negotiations. The European Union must remain adamant about the four freedoms. Brexit has consequences and there can be no question of a Europe a la carte scenario. There can be no status similar to that of the Member States.

I think there needs to be give and take on both sides, and I think if you gave on the money and you gave on Gibraltar, then what I would like to see the United Kingdom Government doing is saying there are 3.3 million EU citizens living in the UK, they all came to Britain legally and we will now unilaterally guarantee their rights for the future. Both sides need to give on this for any sensible deal to come out of it. We can walk away without a deal, it will hurt European workers and European companies more than us, but surely it makes sense for both of us to come to a sensible accommodation.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "EFD", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 72, "date": "2017-04-05.json", "name": "Philippe LAMBERTS", "mepid": "96648", "text": "  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Mr President, if we want to get to a sensible accommodation, Mr Farage’s speech is precisely the kind of nonsense that we should just ignore.

That was a discussion today in a good tone, and I hope that many citizens have followed the discussion because they have seen that the major political groups, the European groups, have adopted an objective, constructive tone here and sadly, the populists and extremists that we have here in this house have reenacted. It was quoted as saying that there is fighting in the streets and that independence must be defended. It was a hard, aggressive tone. Objectivity here, aggressiveness there. I hope many citizens saw that in the discussion. By the way, I didn't get any answers. I asked whether you want to continue to be part of Europol now, whether you want to continue to be part of the internal market, whether you want to continue to be part of the research union. Mister Farage has not yet given any answers as to whether these partnerships are still correct or not. That means: the fundamental question of what leave really means remains on the table. At the end of the day, I cannot completely resist one remark, dear colleagues. If we look at the Council, then we have the situation there that when the heads of state and government are discussing Brexit, Theresa May is not here because that is one thing that the EU-27 have to negotiate. That means that Theresa May treats the other 27 states with respect. If we look at the parliamentary situation, we have Westminster, which has to vote in the end - that's where British interests are represented - and we have the European Parliament, which has to vote - that's where the interests of the EU-27 are represented.

I want to respectfully acknowledge that Syed Kamall is not today spoke on behalf of his group.He gave the floor to colleagues who are not British to make the group's positions clear.I would like Nigel Farage to be a man of honor in the future and to let his Italian colleagues speak in future debates about Brexit in his group.Nigel Farage has been explaining to us over the last few years how good it is that the British are finally leaving the European Union.I would like him to finally set a good example and then no longer burden the debates in the European Parliament.Thank you very much for that.(Applause)", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 78, "date": "2017-04-05.json", "name": "Antonio TAJANI", "mepid": "2187", "text": "I report that I have received four motions for resolutions in accordance with Rule 123 (2) of the Rules of Procedure.The discussion is closed.The vote will take place today, Wednesday 5 April 2017, at 12.00.I thank all those who took part in the debate, the President of the European Commission, the negotiator of the European Union, the representative of the Council and all the Members who have taken the floor during this debate.Parliament will play a decisive role during these negotiations, it will vote in the end for or against, respecting the rules of democracy.There are 751 parliamentarians in this House representing 500 million European citizens, all duly elected.There are neither mafia members nor gangsters, there are representatives of the peoples and this is not a question of national sensitivity, it is a question of civilization and democracy.(Applause)", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE-DE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 79, "date": "2017-04-05.json", "name": "Vicky FORD", "mepid": "96949", "text": "   – Mr President, I would like to raise a point of order under Article 11.2 about this morning’s debate.

In my opinion, this gap must be filled by transfers from other budget articles or by a steady reduction in all EU spending. In other words, membership fees should not be increased as a result of brexit. An increase in the EU payroll tax from 10% to 30% would also generate additional revenue accordingly. The task is not difficult, as the gap can be filled by reallocating budgets from projects for which there is no evidence of effectiveness.

Brexit can thus lead to more unanimity about our common values. Of course we cannot be naive. The UK will try to get the best deal out of the fire.

Great Britain, as a member of the European Union, annually contributed to its budget about EUR 17 billion, and received about EUR 6 billion. The remaining funds, i.e. over EUR 10 billion, were used every year to finance investments in many Member States, including Poland. Therefore, these countries planned their expenses based on funds provided by the EU budget, also from British contributions. In negotiations with the United Kingdom, it is therefore necessary to insist that it fully meets its financial obligations, as they were one of the important sources of EU funds allocated to other countries.

The other Member States decided that that was not a concession they were prepared to make, which is absolutely fine. We are therefore going to seek it from the outside.

If the point of changing the EU budget is to adapt it to new challenges, I do not think the proposed corrections are up to par. We proceed in small steps. Therefore, the effort to indicate as a priority measures in favor of youth employment is certainly welcome; 1.2 billion more for young people is a positive figure. That is why I voted in favor: because it is clearly stated that these funds should be increased in the event that unemployment surveys do not change or new emergencies and needs arise.

It is thus difficult to determine to whom to grant asylum and who to send back to the country of origin. In addition, it can be another motivation for people to simply go to Europe for a better life. The second point is the aforementioned unconditionality of European Union development aid. If we are to provide development aid, we must be sure.

The issues of hate speech, populism and fake news on social media are relevant given the rise in extremism, populism, xenophobia, sexism and other forms of discrimination and intolerance. Here are some of the most popular fake news titles which were making the headlines in the 2016: ‘1 000 Muslims screaming “Allahu akbar” set fire to Germany’s oldest church on New Year’s Eve’, ‘Pope Francis shocks world, endorses Donald Trump for President’, and ‘ISIS leader calls for American Muslim voters to support Hillary Clinton’.  Fake news is not a new phenomenon. It is as old as the press itself. However, it gained momentum and global visibility during the US elections, the UK referendum and even during the recent elections in the Netherlands. What is especially worrying is the accelerated spread on social media. Today around half of European citizens follow news on Facebook and other social media and six out of ten news items shared are passed on without being read first. The majority of people, mostly young, have difficulty in identifying fake news. We have already called in this Chamber in the past for a European solution to fake news. Today I call again on the Commission to urge social media firms to boost their efforts to counter fake news. We need some kind of clarification from the EU on the self-regulatory measures in the sector. We have to strengthen efforts in working towards the establishment of online platforms so that fake news or illegal content is completely eliminated and to impose fines on those who fail to do so. We have to better support fact—checking websites. This is why I also call on the Commission to analyse in depth the current situation and legal framework with regard to fake news and to explore the possibility of legislative intervention to limit the dissemination and spreading of fake content. Next education: for children to be taught in schools how to spot fake news and the inclusion of media literacy in education as we have to actively engage with our youngest citizens. I am convinced that part of the solution is also to strive for better quality in journalism and the media. To achieve this we need to encourage quality journalism online and to extend ethical journalistic standards to all media actors. We need more investigative journalists, professional and courageous media outlets and more transparency in media ownership.  It is also of key importance to address the particularities of hate speech online. The Code of Conduct published by the Commission is a step in the right direction. We also need more financial means to fund research on social media algorithms that create filter bubbles and prevent the viral spread of fake news. Finally, why not launch the European Union’s own broadcasting channel to counter the lies and draw Europe together and defend democracy, not as an EU propaganda system, but as a major European media platform in its own right? This idea is currently being floated in Germany and France. My group, the Socialists and Democrats, are committed to being in the forefront of this important fight. We owe this to our citizens. If we do not win this battle, fake news and propaganda will, together with its main goals: provoking fear leading to apathy, chaos or completely irrational decisions. We must not let lies dictate the truth of what is going on in our society.

L-evidence minn different sips bħall-Aġenzija tal-Unjoni Ewropea għad-Drittijiet Fundamentali u l-Kunsill tal-Ewropa tikkonferma żieda alarming fl-intolerance u l-mibegħda fl-Ewropa. Jista ’jkun hemm several raġunijiet li jispjegaw dan il-fenomenu, iżda żgur li ma hemm ebda lok għal ġustifikazzjoni għalih. L-Unjoni Ewropea adopted leġiżlazzjoni speċifika dwar il-ġlieda kontra l-intolerance u l-mibegħda, partikolarment anki l-framework decision tal-2008 dwar il-ġlieda kontra ir-razziżmu u l-ksenofobija. U f'Ġunju tas-sena l-oħra, fl-2016, il-Kunsill stieden ukoll lill-Istati Members jiżguraw it-transpożizzjoni u l-implimentazzjoni effective tal-framework decision u ta 'liġijiet oħrajn relevant marbutin ma' ta 'mibegħda fuq livell nazzjonali sabiex jiġġieldu kontra l-pjaga tar-reati ta 'mibegħda. U barra minn hekk, il-Kunsill talab ukoll lill-Istati Members jiżviluppaw effective methods sabiex jiġu rrappurtati r-crimes ta ’mibegħda u allura tkun żgurata r-reġistrazzjoni kif xieraq tagħhom. Ma hemmx dubju, Sur President, illi l-mezzo ta 'komunikazzjoni soċjali llum huma wieħed mill-mezzo ewlenin, kif qalet anki l-Ladies Fajon, wieħed mill-mezzo ewlenin kif id-diskors ta' mibegħda qed jinfirexies ma 'ħafna n jinfirex fl-inqas żmien possibbli. U rimedju possibbli kontra din l-epidemija hija reazzjoni Ewropea li tkun koordinata u tkun determined. Fil-kuntest tal-kooperazzjoni interistituzzjonali, il-Kunsill diġà wkoll appoġġa l-pjanijiet ambizzjużi tal-Grupp ta ’Livell Għoli tal-Kummissjoni li qed jipprova jiżviluppa, mal-Istati Members, prattiċi u għodod konkreti ħalli titjieb ir-reazzjoni għar-razziżmu, il-ksenofobija u forom oħra ta ’intoleranzi. U allura nilqgħu u nappoġġaw ukoll id-djalogu li għaddej fil-livell tal-Unjoni Ewropea ma ’kumpaniji ewlenin tal-informatika sabiex tiġi addressed to il-pjaga. Fl-aħħar iżda mhux l-inqas f’dan l-await għandna niftakru u nfaħħru wkoll il-ħidma eċċellenti li saret mill-Aġenzija li rreferejt għaliha aktar kmieni. Dawn il-kontromiżuri jkunu kollha għalxejn, however, jekk ninsew l-irwol important tal-edukazzjoni u l-ħidma tagħna fost iż-żgħażagħ. U b’mod aktar preċiż il-bżonn li niżviluppaw ir-reżiljenza demokratika, il-litteriżmu medjatiku, it-tolerance, il-ħsieb kritiku u anke ħiliet ta ’riżoluzzjonijiet tal-tal-kunflitti fil' tag-proċlim. Fl-aħħar nett, nixtieq nenfasizza wkoll li l-ġlieda kontra d-diskors ta 'mibegħda fuq l-internet hija wkoll waħda mill-prijoritajiet tagħna bħala Presidency. Fil-fatt, proprju għada fil-Belt Valletta ser jitlaqqgħu madwar mitt espert li ser jiddiskutu kif għandhom jitwasslu b'effective narrative modes pożittivi kontra d-diskors ta 'mibegħda fuq l-internet u l-irwol tal-Unjoni Ewropea u l-irwol tal-Unjoni Ewropea u Members fl-appoġġ lis-soċjetà ċivili f'dan l-isforz. Element pożittiv ta 'dan l-event huwa, jidhirli, il-fatt illi l-means ta' komunikazzjoni soċjali qed jitqiesu mhux biss bħala l-problem iżda bħala parti mis-soluzzjoni. Issa nixtieq nidħol aktar fid-Dettall dwar it-hold parts tad-debatit: il-manipulazzjoni u l-propaganda permezz tal-fake news. L-aħbarijiet foloz u l-informazzjoni skorretta li jitqiesu minn ħafna bħala perikolużi għad-demokraziji għax jheddu s-sisien infushom tas-soċjetajiet tagħna: li ċ-ċittadini jeleġġent afna bħala perikolużi għad-demokraziji għax jheddu s-sisien infushom tas-soċjetajiet tagħna: li ċ-ċittadini jeleġġent afna bħala perikolużi u ġust. Iż-żieda fil-popularity tal-internet u l-media tal-komunikazzjoni soċjali wasslet għal tkattir ta 'sorsi tal-aħbarijiet, u dan minnu nnifsu huwa tajjeb, iżda bosta minn fosthom mhux ta' min joqgħod fuqhom. Hija reality. U allura l -organazzjonijiet tal-aħbarijiet jinsabu taħt pressjoni dejjem akbar biex iwasslu fluss kontinwu ta 'aħbarijiet fil-mument li jseħħu, u allura jħalli anqas żmien, bħala ħin, għall-kwika tal-veralità tal-kontroll. U allura dik hija challenge fuq il-kmamar tal-aħbarijiet illi aħna nifhmu. Barra minn hekk, inti għandek ukoll l-atturi populisti li qed ixerrdu informazzjoni skorretta sabiex jappoġġaw in-narrative tagħhom, illi hija ta 'ħsara partikolari fi snin b’mod partikolari meta l-poplu jkun qiegħed jiegagħmel tmel. Mhuwiex faċli li ċ-ċittadini jagħrfu liema huma l-aħbarijiet il-foloz, jew anke li jsibu u jaċċessaw l-informazzjoni affidabbli. Smajna diġà xi proposed u dwar dan nimmaġina li Members oħrajn jitkellmu matul dan id-debitu.

We have a responsibility to make sure that we have effective tools to address situations where the right to free expression is deliberately abused to promote violent extremism or discrimination against certain groups in society. This is based on the set of values laid down in Article 2 of the Treaty: ‘The Union is founded on the values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities.’ It is our collective duty to show that democracy is there for everyone. Countering all expressions of discrimination, violence and intolerance is a priority for all of us. It requires a joint effort. The EU has increased its actions to prevent and fight against different forms of hate crime and hate speech.  The proliferation of hate speech online is shrinking the space for democratic discussions. When ‘toxic narratives’ about migrants and religious minorities publicly incite hatred and violence, the thin line between hate speech and hate crime merges into one. Where public incitement to violence and hatred is spread against groups or individuals on grounds of their race, ethnicity or religion, we have EU laws that criminalise these kinds of behaviour. The Commission has engaged with the social media operators to counter illegal online hate speech. In May 2016, IT companies – Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube – agreed a voluntary Code of Conduct with commitments to take action and tackle illegal online content that publicly incites violence and hatred. We will present the results of this self-regulatory exercise next month. The Commission’s proposal to revise the Audiovisual Media Services Directive widens the definition of hate speech by referring to ‘incitement to violence or hatred’, and includes ethnic origin, belief, disability, age or sexual orientation. It calls for a requirement for video-sharing platforms to protect people against incitement to violence or hatred. The Commission is now assessing whether improved EU-wide procedures are needed for the removal of illegal content from online platforms. We will announce our conclusions on 10 May this year as part of the mid-term review of the Digital Single Market. Fake news – or simply ‘lies’ – are also a serious problem...

We are aware of the need to protect freedom of speech and to trust people’s common sense, but we also need to be aware of the possible negative effects of this phenomenon. Promoting media literacy is vital, as is the need for quality journalism. All journalists’ codes of conduct include accuracy as one of their main requirements. Self-regulation and ethical standards play a very important role here. Social media platforms and users are acting to expose fake news and unmask the source. I also see global brands and media organisations deciding to move advertising money only to sites that are known to be free from harmful content. I welcome private sector initiatives to cut commercial funding of fake news sites. Last November, First Vice-President Frans Timmermans, together with Commissioners Oettinger and Jourová, organised the European Commission’s Annual Colloquium on Fundamental Rights. This focused on media pluralism and democracy. It identified two main routes: ethical standards among those producing media, and media literacy among those using it. Lastly, the EU External Action Service has set up a taskforce on strategic communication to promote EU policies and a healthy media environment in the Eastern Partnership region. Its key task is to improve the EU’s capacity to forecast, address and respond to disinformation activities by external parties.

Incitement to hatred, recruiting for terrorist or other criminal purposes, fanatization, ideologization, demarcation, marginalization, incitement to acts of violence - none of this is a trivial offense, none of these are things that can simply be left standing. In normal reality, this leads to a prosecutor's investigation, it then leads to a lawsuit and then to a conviction. What is true in the real world must also apply in the digital world. In the digital world, there must be no legal free space that enables people to hold hate speech at others, to cause endless suffering, to marginalize people, to bully or persecute them for various arbitrary reasons and then to enjoy themselves without being held accountable for being able to anonymize themselves, without prosecutors and judges even having the option of still having access to the person who is committing hate speech or such a crime.

So social media is neither good nor bad. They have a great impact and they expand public space across borders. Social media create new audiences, and they are serious competition for the mainstream media. But it would be foolish to think that you can sit back and just watch. We must not let ourselves drift, we have to shape this process with the aim of expanding the opportunities for democratic participation.

We need sets of rules, because blocking and deleting must be carried out transparently and promptly. The users must be notified and adequately informed. There must also be the possibility of objection and complaint, and there needs to be a public discussion of how to identify fake news.

Chairman! If someone had imagined just a few years ago that we here in 2017 should stand and discuss hate speech, extreme populism and fake news, many would probably have shaken their heads and thought we were paranoid. Nevertheless, it is a reality. The new technologies have not only made it easier to communicate, they have also created a violent fragmentation - and they have helped to create echo chambers where we as citizens can seek refuge and be confirmed in our worst prejudices and perceptions. Even darker forces are abusing the new opportunities, and therefore we must, of course, be ready to defend the open, liberal society, representative democracy and the rule of law that are under pressure now. Propaganda and misinformation are simply poison for the Western values, for the opportunities we have, for our way of life and thus also for our cohesive cancer. We owe it to each other to take this threat seriously. In the Liberal Group, we are very keen to take this fight and take the lead in the fight for our democracy. However, as liberals, it is also our job to hoist the warning flag. It is important not to fall into the trap of introducing new forms of censorship, of restricting the freedoms that precisely define our society. The answer is no restrictions, no truth ministries here, thank you! What we should do, on the other hand, is to map out the threats, their extent and the possible efforts against them. I would suggest devoting resources to setting up a knowledge center for misinformation. Here, at European level, one can gather media actors and ask them to come up with ideas for self-regulation and self-justice. One could also imagine a form of certification of online content, again without interference from the authorities, but as an opportunity to stamp the quality that we are all calling for.

The current political system is one that systematically cultivates and nurtures hatred in our societies, dismantling social cohesion and establishing a real witch-hunt against those who dare to have a different view. Contrary to what you accuse us of, we believe in freedom of opinion. Everyone, without exception, should be free to express their views, no matter how much we disagree with them. As for populism, the term itself, as it is used today, is simply another creation of the ruling political class, which baptizes a \"populist\" who presents a different perspective that is closer to the real needs of the people. It is the fault of populism, you say, that the citizens are now aligned with parties outside the political establishment. In fact, you simply have no contact with their desires. Fake news has a huge share of responsibility for governments and systemic parties with fake leaks.

And, in this sense, we must commit ourselves from the European institutions to pour our efforts into the eradication of these stereotypes. To prepare this debate I have read some reports. One of them said that, in a study on misogyny, carried out during three weeks in April 2016 among users in a European country, more than 200,000 tweets with the word \"bitch\" or \"whore\" were found, finding that every ten seconds someone insults a woman with those words on Twitter. And the truth is that as a button shows. A month ago, I was participating in a debate in this House that had media and public significance. I received a lot of messages through social networks. One of them is this. I'm not going to read it in full, but it says: \"Mrs. Iratxe Garper, you're dead, whore.\" He carries a photo of a woman chained and hanged and a photo of a hand with a firearm.

Fake news has always existed, because this is the information that you have used to manipulate information, for example by funding European propaganda. But who can have the authority to say what is true and what is false? The truth is that you are the power that seeks to absolve itself for the mistakes it has made, for having given citizens in the hands of the banks and finance. You remain closed here in this ivory tower and you don't even realize it. And for a reason: because the network scares you. Because the network allows you to get in touch with citizens, without actually having a filter in front of you, and therefore for this reason you have proposed, for example, the creation of an independent authority for checking the truth on the web. Here, attention: please, do not jeopardize the freedom of the network, because it is very dangerous, and you could even have an authoritarian drift. The solution, on the other hand, is education, civic sense. In this sense, for example, projects for citizens' media literacy are welcome, especially for the new generations, for adolescents, for minors. We want informed and aware citizens.

Third, populism is an extraordinarily complex phenomenon, which grows every day. We must fight it, but we must also understand its origin. Reducing populism to hate speech and false news can also be populism. Combating these phenomena requires an effective, robust and comprehensive response by the Union.

Like Commissioner Ansip, I was raised in the Soviet Union, where so—called anti—Soviet propaganda was perceived as one of the major reasons why the Soviet people were not happy about the regime. The Communist Party believed that people were misinformed and manipulated by foreign actors, and that is why the people looked up to the West. I am sure that the other side’s propaganda has poor chances if it is not based on some real facts, or if it addresses issues that are properly touched upon by the mainstream media. As for fake news, it cannot attract public attention if it does not seem to be reliable or does not reflect the wishful thinking of the audience. For instance, any fake news about certain countries like North Korea, may be accepted by the public because the regime there is so nasty. Regrettably, mistakes, misinterpretation of data and manipulative delivery of news – I mean all these games with titles, subtitles, selection of pictures, experts and the use of specific terminology – are a big challenge for us.

I understand that this increasingly centralized Union likes the media to be centralized to a few media houses. The European Union is making the same mistake that the American left has made, namely to confuse fake news with news that takes on different perspectives. When all Swedish media only reported the positive aspects of the enormous migration we had to our country, and in some cases pure misinformation, so-called alternative media emerged, where individual citizens on their own dug up the truth behind the angled news that dominated society. Among other things, it was revealed that the news about violent crimes often completely withheld the fact that the perpetrator was a migrant or had a foreign background. While in those cases the perpetrator was Swedish, this was reported very clearly with name and picture. Many of the major media houses in Sweden have long had the line to show only the benefits that they believe migration has, regardless of whether it can be proven or not. In most cases, their theses do not allow for closer examination by researchers or educated citizens. Both the European Union and the Swedish state keep these media houses under their arms through grants and loans. Already dominant actors receive additional support through tax funds to conduct agenda-setting journalism instead of objective news reporting. I appeal to you.

And I can well remember how our socialist state secretary at the time promised us before Austria joined the EU: “Every Austrian has a thousand schillings left in the bag.” The result is of course completely different. So I thank you for obviously warning against this. As of today, based on your factual assessment, I can also call the Austrian socialists populists.

Secondly, strengthen media plurality and the objectivity, impartiality and independence of the media within the EU and its neighbourhood. Thirdly, support journalists and develop capacity-building programmes for media actors. Then, develop education programmes in schools to detect fake news. That is where it starts.

On 15 June, roaming surcharges will be a thing of the past for European citizens travelling in the European Union. Europeans will no longer face huge phone bill shocks after travelling in another EU country. In June, Europeans can use their phones just like at home without paying extra. Before, Europeans used to switch off when they crossed a border. This summer, Europeans will be able to call their friends from the beach, tweet from the work conference, or check emails and social media from Lisbon to Latvia, from Dublin to Dubrovnik, without fear of surcharges.  Often we are asked what is the benefit of the European Union, and what is the significance of the internal market, for citizens? We are and we will be reminded of the roaming surcharges when leaving the internal market when travelling outside EU borders. I will give you a concrete example: I checked many European operators, big and small, on the prices for data roaming when travelling to Croatia and to Serbia – neighbouring countries. Travelling to Croatia, a Member State of the EU, applying the rules of the internal market, the cost of using one gigabyte abroad after 15 June will be no extra cost on my tariff plan as it is included in my tariff plan at home. When travelling to Serbia, a neighbouring country but outside the EU, how much do you think that one gigabyte would cost? Make a guess! The bill sent to me would be thousands of euros for using that one gigabyte! What is the reason for this? It is that operators in visited countries, and visiting operators, can both charge much more than needed from the consumer without regulation of the internal market that has now been created over the decade by reducing roaming costs within the EU.  Tomorrow we will vote on the last piece of legislation to make ‘roam-like-at-home’ a reality. It sets a price cap for what operators can charge each other when their consumers travel. The European Parliament defended the interests of the citizens, competitive markets and small operators. As a rapporteur, I am proud of this result. I am proud of what we can achieve together. Together we have reached a dramatic drop in the prices from the original proposal by the Commission. The most important was the price on the data caps. The lower data price cap benefits European citizens directly. The lower the price on data, the more data Europeans can use when they travel.  Mobile data plays a key role in today’s digital society. The use of data is growing rapidly. Data will play an even more important role in the future. Today, Europeans use mobiles everywhere; opportunities are unlimited. Already today, mobiles are used for many services. We follow news online, order bus tickets, make restaurant reservations, use maps, look for tourist attractions, play mobile games and we can stay connected with our colleagues online. All the time we can do more and more on our mobile services using mobile data. The services must not stop at the internal borders of the European Union. The end of roaming surcharges contributes to the freedom of European citizens; it contributes to the development of the internal market, connectivity and the use of electronic services wherever Europeans travel in the EU.

It is a great achievement that will have an immediate positive impact on the lives of millions of Europeans from 15 June this year. I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Ms Miapetra Kumpula-Natri, and all honourable Members of Parliament who were involved in this work.  This is the result of more than 10 years of regulatory effort by the EU institutions. During this time, several of you played key roles in reducing roaming prices in the European Union from extremely high levels. Two years ago, Ms Pilar del Castillo led critical negotiations from which the decision emerged for full abolition of roaming charges while travelling in the European Union. Several additional steps had to be taken for this to become a reality. The main step was to reduce wholesale roaming prices. Without this, many operators would not have been able to eliminate roaming charges without increasing their domestic prices. This was technically complicated and involved finding an adequate political balance. The new caps on wholesale roaming prices agreed with the Council – and on which you will vote tomorrow – will allow operators to provide roaming at the domestic price. At the same time, they will ensure that the networks visited can recover their wholesale costs. In addition, as you know, the Commission delivered the implementing regulation on fair use policy in time last year on 15 December, after a lively debate with stakeholders, Member States and Members of this House. Thanks to all our efforts together, the ‘roam-like-at-home’ system is now fully designed and predictable. We have shown people across Europe that the EU institutions can deliver, also in difficult times. The widespread positive media reaction reflects that. With this deal, we should not forget that we have achieved a much more vibrant Digital Single Market. It brings many new possibilities that will benefit all of us, if they are used properly.

Thank you very much. I would especially like to congratulate the Commission on the proposal. Today we are celebrating the tenth anniversary of the roaming regulation. A student from Linz brought me a complaint and we've been negotiating roaming ever since. We have always set ourselves three years, a sunset clause that will enable us to now bring the roaming 4 period to an end. In truth, we are already preparing the fifth round for the digital single market. And ten years means: We have a child who is ten years old and who now understands a little what the digital single market should look like. We have now achieved that there is at least competition within the Member States and that our citizens can finally go on vacation, our small and medium-sized enterprises can finally go on business trips within the European Union and pay the same tariff here as they do at home. So you no longer have to have two phones and two SIM cards when traveling within the European Union: of course it is still very dangerous outside the European Union. The tariffs for one gigabyte go up to 19,900 euros, whereas today we have an average price of 2.77 euros in the European Union. And we won't be ready until 2022 that this wholesale cap of 2.50 euros is below today's average price. So we are not setting prices here, we are only defining where fraud begins, and I think that is the right thing to do, so that the citizens can rely on us. Of course, we have also ensured that there will be no increase in the national tariffs, that competition can take place at the national level and - this is the most important thing - that investment will continue to be made in the future.

The caps will also have a direct impact on how much mobile data a consumer can use when abroad. The lower the cap, the larger the amount of data.

Soon, roaming charges will be a thing of the past, and people will not even remember their existence. It is satisfying indeed that Europe has managed to deliver on its promise to abolish roaming charges.

What is also important in this process is to see that the debate that has been going on all the time has also affected the market. We can see at home in Sweden how large telecom operators are already starting to get rid of roaming charges, so that before the legislation is even in place, big things are starting to happen in the European market. This can also be a good foundation for much that we need to continue to do. In one of my first debates in this House, they wanted to break Google's monopoly position. To me, it was so surprising that no one in the House asked why we do not have a European-based Google. The answer for me there is quite obvious: we have not been able to create a common market where there is competition and where there is growth opportunity for digitally based companies and telecom companies to a sufficient extent. Several telecommunications companies have been able to make a lot of money by reducing roaming charges, but here we have said that it is important that European citizens have the opportunity to move across borders to work, move across borders to travel and visit other parts of Europe. , without coming home and having to spend the entire next monthly salary on paying bills. This of course creates new digital opportunities, but the work is not finished. We must ensure that we go further with the digital agenda for the whole of Europe.

We then warned that there was still no convincing response to these alerts. A year and a half later we continued. Without a convincing answer, without the certainty that consumers in the southern countries will not pay the costs of ending roaming in the European Union in their domestic tariffs. We intervened in this process with a clear objective: to enable the end of roaming surcharges at the retail level, that is, the end of roaming charges for consumers in the European Union, while eliminating, at the same time, the risk of costs resulting from roaming. , namely the costs resulting from increased seasonal pressure on national networks are passed on to national domestic tariffs. From our point of view, there were and are more effective ways of ensuring this than the provisions that were adopted.

When he gets there, he - colleague Kumpula-Natri gave the example - suddenly has to pay 1,000 euros per gigabyte with his contract because he doesn't have any Buying decision has more about it.A market cannot function like that.That is why regulation works in this area.That is why regulation in this area is necessary, good and democratically correct.You can see the difference between an internal market and a free trade area here quite well.If we agree on common legislation, if we jointly ensure that we get the best out of the consumer, then this European Union has more than just a right to exist, and I believe that is an example that we should blow out as loudly as possible.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 262, "date": "2017-04-05.json", "name": "David BORRELLI", "mepid": "124796", "text": "on behalf of the EFDD Group. - Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, from 15 June the telephone companies will abolish the cost of roaming.

Do you shop at the store? ” No, it is also theoretically possible for someone else in Europe to sew all their own clothes. But sooner or later that person will have to buy either a sewing needle, or a thread, or a plow, or something else. He will be partly dependent on others. And we call this system trade. And in Europe, the advantage of our giants, and the greatest advantage of the European Union in particular, is that this trade takes place between 500 000 000 people without internal borders, without tariffs, without customs duties, virtually without problems. This is the European Union's greatest asset to most of our citizens. But there is one area that is absolutely missing. That's when we go with these devices, which almost everyone, even school children today, have in their pockets - with mobile phones - outside our country. Suddenly, it seems that the single market no longer exists. We pay much, much more expensive. Now this bill, which we will be voting on tomorrow - on wholesale prices - will put an end to the 'i' and destroy so-called roaming, which, by distorting the single market, makes us pay much more abroad.

Then there is no guarantee that in the end the locals will not pay the cost. On the contrary, it is certain that in order for domestic providers to survive, they will pass on costs to consumers, increasing domestic charges. Countries with a small market, such as Cyprus, will be particularly hard hit. The costs that local companies will have to pay in the summer months will be unbearable, with unforeseen consequences.

It is a great day if we can talk about the fact that additional roaming charges will disappear in a few months. We will pay everyone as in their home country when going to the countries of the European Union. We've waited ten years for this. I watched this because I have been a member of this committee for many years, and now I am speaking on behalf of the ITRE Committee. It is important that we have carried out this process in ten years. We figured out three times what we have today to make these charges disappear, extra charges. This is important because we watched how companies behave during this time, whether they do not use this situation to burden customers, and therefore, among other things, it was a three-step process. I also wanted to respond to the absurd allegations made by one of my non-attached colleagues (she is not in the room) that the European Union took a long time and that there was some misunderstanding that we are doing it within the Union. Please state! When we leave the EU, we still pay roaming charges outside the EU. It follows that if we extended the Union to other countries, other countries would be deprived of these fees for us, for the inhabitants of the European Union. So is it good to expand the European Union or not? These are absurd allegations that are actually difficult to answer.

The next item on the agenda after the fire alarm is the continuation of the debate on the report by Miapetra Kumpula-Natri, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EU) No 531/2012 as regards provisions in wholesale roaming markets (COM (2016) 0399 - C8-0219 / 2016 - 2016/0185 (COD)) (A8 = 0372/2016)", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 287, "date": "2017-04-05.json", "name": "Seán KELLY", "mepid": "96668", "text": "   – Mr President, I did not realise that my Kerry accent was so magnetic that I would set the alarm bells ringing in Parliament, but I do hope that you enjoyed your roaming free of charge around the Parliament. So now to this topic. I welcome the proposals, which are the final piece of legislation required to ensure that mobile roaming charges will be removed from this coming June. It is something we have promised for a long time and something the EU has delivered for its citizens. As an MEP who has campaigned with many others for the abolition of roaming charges for the last seven years, I am delighted that we are now nearly there. It is already eighteen months since, in 2015, it was proudly announced here in the European Parliament that, after a long process, ‘roam-like-at-home’ was to be introduced by June 2017. It was a very high-profile and important announcement. While tomorrow’s vote might not have the same fanfare, its importance cannot be overstated. The introduction of this wholesale roaming cap is an absolutely essential piece of legislation, as it allows for ‘roam-like-at-home’ to happen in a cost-effective manner this June. The caps that we arrived at in the end: EUR 0.032 for a voice call, a gradually-decreasing cap from EUR 7.75 in 2017 to EUR 2.50 in 2022 per gigabyte of data and EUR 0.01 for text messages represents a fantastic result for the European Parliament, particularly given that the majority of Council favoured higher caps. Wholesale data prices are declining by around 40% annually across the EU. The overly-cautious Council position just did not reflect reality. I feel the final result could have even been better, but such is the nature of compromise. In my own country we are very pleased with the outcome, because it means that the higher caps, which would have put artificially-high costs on to Irish producers – this will not happen now. It is a good day for the European Parliament, especially when we speak about Brexit – again an indication that the United Kingdom citizens will not benefit from this.

In fact, since 2007, when roaming was first introduced at EU level, prices have fallen by as much as 90%. It is a very significant achievement for consumers. It is important that when we want to promote digitalisation in Europe, consumers are encouraged to use digital services and also mobile data. In that sense, this outcome of the negotiations on the wholesale price cap, which has now been achieved and in which Parliament did an excellent job in the negotiations, was very important. Especially in the countries of Northern Europe, Scandinavia and the Baltics, where mobile data is used very much, it is important that operators cannot charge each other too high prices for roaming. In my own country, Finland, mobile data is used the most in the world and even ten times more than in other European countries, and there this is of great importance to consumers and operators. Otherwise, the threat would have been that consumer prices might even have risen in Finland as a result of the abandonment of roaming charges. It is important that strong efforts are now being made across Europe to promote the use of mobile data, and that this can be done by investing in good high-speed networks and promoting fair competition.

Regulating the wholesale market is a very important step for a competitive single digital market that benefits European citizens and creates the conditions for healthy competition, but most importantly, Europe is finally delivering on its promise. As we also approach the mid-term evaluation of the digital single market, we need to show that this effort continues. We need more protection and security as a default for users, especially when it comes to our personal data, easy and reliable e-commerce, so that everyone, consumers and businesses, can easily, without discrimination, within the European Union, of course, invest in countries and areas that need it most, so that no one is left behind in this new digital age, but also innovative solutions, such as Blockchain technology, which can give back control of data to citizens, while also offering many solutions to many different challenges. So this regulation comes at a critical time and sends a very important message to Strasbourg and Brussels that we are working for a truly single digital market with more security for European citizens.

This journey was a really long one. We started with this process in 2007, but in the beginning this process was not very rapid. But since last May we have been able to cut those roaming surcharges by 75%. Altogether, in comparison with 2009, we were able to cut roaming surcharges for SMS messages and voice minutes by 92% and for data by as much as 96%. At the same time, domestic prices in all our Member States decreased. This is my message to all those people who are worried about the increase in domestic prices. Exorbitant roaming charges were an anomaly in a continent where people move freely across, and between, countries. Together the EU institutions are now putting an end to the roaming surcharges for our people. At last, people will be able to stop turning off the data on their phones when they cross an EU border. This is how it should be and how it should always have been. The Commission, in cooperation with national regulatory authorities, will continue its close monitoring to ensure that the new rules of today’s deal are strictly observed by the operators. The EU is often criticised for not delivering concrete results to Europeans. This is because the benefits of EU policies are sometimes difficult to grasp and identify in people’s daily lives. Here is one well-identified and very concrete benefit. The Commission strongly urges the European Parliament to adopt the new regulation on wholesale roaming markets.

It was an honor to lead this negotiation on behalf of Parliament. The last piece of legislation on common wholesale market prices will be finalized in a vote tomorrow. The European Parliament would have been prepared for even lower prices, as came up here, because we see that the lower the price caps, the better for the consumer. But even for those operators that already today offer unlimited data usage at a cheap price, three facilitations were obtained in the process. Firstly, the ceiling price was much lower than the Commission's original proposal, secondly, these operators can set ceilings for the use of data abroad, and thirdly, operators can then apply for an exemption if this would still be too costly for them. Here, however, I believe that the market and the competitive market are playing and consumers will be covered by this legislation, so that it is also possible to travel and use the telephone abroad. I do not know of any country whose consumers would benefit from high national prices. I think it would be a good goal if this legislation also increased transparency, because why on earth would we be arguing that the price of data in one country could be 100 times that of another or ten times the price of calls. I think you should all go to your home countries and ask if technology is really that much more expensive or wages or what, because the differences between countries are really big. This can be a good addition to this, as we gain transparency. We are proving that the EU is needed, that regulation is needed and that transparency is needed.

High mobile phone bills for calling in other EU countries are a thing of the past. On the basis of the Commission's proposal, the European Parliament and the Council reached political agreement in June 2016 on the new rules to be applied by operators in the wholesale roaming market from June onwards. The wholesale prices for data roaming have been falling for a number of years. The increase in data usage is one of the main reasons for this price drop. The increased use of data brings clear economic advantages, as it opens up new service options. In addition, the increased use of data is increasingly triggering infrastructure investments, which means that consumers can use even more data. For my home country Austria in particular, investments in broadband infrastructure are of great importance because the country only ranks poorly in the middle of the field in terms of digitization when compared to Europe. According to the Index for the Digital Economy and Society (DESI) 2016, Austria only ranks 20th out of a total of 29 countries when it comes to the proportion of fast broadband over 30 Mbit / s.

The entry into force of such a system requires the introduction of rules governing wholesale charges for roaming services. At the same time, it will be possible to abolish retail charges for roaming in Europe. This solution needs to be introduced as soon as possible, as it is definitely valuable for all consumers, and especially for those traveling to different European countries. It will also contribute to reducing charges for communications, provided that a \"fair use policy\" based on non-charging for ancillary services of operators and data transfers outside the country where the service was purchased is ensured. In this context, the protection of competition in the telecommunications market needs to be addressed in the implementing acts, as this is necessary to maintain potentially low service prices.

First and foremost, the rapporteur would like to thank the Commission and the Council for the excellent collaboration that has existed all through the process. The rapporteur would like to highlight the remarkable work realised by the Slovak and Maltese Presidencies in order to achieve the completion of the visa liberalisation process so dear to the Ukrainian citizens. The rapporteur would also like to thank the Ukrainian people and the Ukrainian government for all their efforts, determination and patience. Indeed, on 28 February an agreement was reached between the European Parliament and the Council on the visa liberalisation process for Ukraine. This agreement was confirmed by the COREPER meeting two days later. On 9 March 2017, an overwhelming majority of MEPs on the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) voted in favour of the visa waiver for Ukrainian citizens, sending a strong message. In the words of the rapporteur, Ukraine has achieved all the benchmark criteria set out by the EU and has even gone beyond expectations in terms of sustainable reforms. Important advancements have been realised in the areas of document security, border and migration management, public order and security, and external relations and fundamental rights. For the rapporteur, it is these criteria and this methodology that are extremely important in the benefits that they produce. On the one hand, citizens benefit from the implementation of reforms that impact their daily lives. In fact, the visa waiver is a remarkable tool that allows to connect people and build bridges among populations. On the other hand, it is a strong message for the citizens that see their country engaged in a European path. Given the commitment of Ukraine to pursue in the way of the reforms undertaken and the consolidation and sustainability of its compromises, the rapporteur calls on us to confirm today the principle that the European Parliament so heatedly defends: that every country that meets the criteria set out by the European Commission should benefit of the visa waiver for its citizens. Finally, the rapporteur would like to stress that Ukraine is a key partner for the EU in the Eastern Partnership in the fight against organised crime and terrorism, the fight against human trafficking, and the fight against corruption. Our vote tomorrow, supporting the visa waiver for the Ukrainian citizens, would constitute in this sense the concrete realisation of their aspiration and engagement in favour of peace, stability and European ambition.

We are seeing the results of the hard work of the Ukrainian authorities over the past three years. It has been a long process, but we are reaching the end. Already in December 2015, the Commission confirmed that Ukraine had implemented all the benchmarks set out in its visa liberalisation action plan. Following this positive assessment and taking into account the overall EU-Ukraine relations, we proposed in early 2016 to lift the visa requirement for Ukrainian citizens holding a biometric passport. I am very pleased that we can now finally conclude this process. In parallel, the revised visa suspension mechanism just entered into force at the end of last month. The visa suspension mechanism will be an important tool to further enhance security for the EU but also to strengthen our visa liberalisation policy. Under the new mechanism, the Commission will monitor the continuous fulfilment by Ukraine and all visa-free countries of the visa liberalisation criteria, especially in the fight against organised crime and corruption. Honourable Members, we are almost there. Visa liberalisation for Ukraine will be an essential contribution to strengthening cultural and economic ties between Ukraine and the EU for the Eastern Partnership and our neighbourhood in general.

I am speaking today as the European Parliament's standing rapporteur for Ukraine. I took on this task from our colleague Saryusz-Wolski, who, as rapporteur, drafted the Foreign Affairs Committee's opinion on this report. I thank him for his work so far and I am sure that he will share my remarks. Today we congratulate Ukraine. With the decision of the European Parliament, we are exempting Ukrainian nationals from the visa requirement. At the same time, we are strengthening the connection between the European Union and this country. The visa waiver was made possible through the work of the Ukrainian government and the Verkhovna Rada. You have met important technical requirements. They also have the political will to modernize their country democratically and according to the rule of law, that is to say, in this context, to use an efficient readmission mechanism. Today, however, I also say critically to our own address: We as the EU have delayed this decision for far too long. The Commissioner said by December 2015 the country was ready. The Ukrainians deserved a much earlier decision. Because we also have to see: Ukraine steers this important reform course while it is at war and parts of the country - the Crimea, Donetsk and Luhansk - are occupied. The Russian President does not allow Ukraine these successes. I therefore say to those responsible in Ukraine: You have to safeguard the progress that has been made, even after the visa requirement is no longer applicable. I am therefore concerned about the latest attempts to make the work of anti-corruption activists more difficult. Traveling in the EU without expensive visas and time-consuming procedures will bring Ukrainians and EU citizens closer together. The Ukrainian passport will now be one of the first-class documents in Europe. Unlike documents issued by Russian occupation authorities, it opens all doors.This message should also be heard in the Donets Basin.Ladies and gentlemen, dear colleagues!Do you remember?Twelve years have passed since President Yushchenko lifted the visa requirement for EU citizens in Ukraine.The occasion was the final of the Eurovision Song Contest in Kiev at the beginning of May 2005.

In the last two years, Ukraine has embarked on an ambitious and comprehensive reform process, the real goal of which is to create a truly democratic political system and a properly functioning economy. The success of all reforms should enable Ukraine to move from a post-Soviet to a European state. Ukraine has been making unprecedented efforts since 2014 to implement reforms and the current EU visa refusal rate for Ukrainian citizens is less than 2%.

The fact is that Ukraine has met all the conditions and also that all these conditions allow for visa suspension to happen but also allow for stability, security, prosperity and I personally believe that Ukraine deserves this treatment and I hope we will vote in that regard tomorrow.

It has taken some time, and I would like to thank the rapporteur for the very good cooperation and the Commission for its support.

One thing – which is not really a criticism – is that having the Eurovision Song Contest in Kiev in May is something that I fully support. Nevertheless, I personally do not think that it was a very wise decision not to let the Russian singer participate. The song contest should be something joyful for citizens from whichever country, and it should overcome the fears and the problems which exist in Ukraine with Russian warmongering, etc. The other point is even more serious. It is about the draft law on e—declarations, where civil society organisations will be obliged to submit e—declarations on their financial interests and assets. This is something that should go, and is going, for politicians and public officials. Yes, we as elected people also have to very clearly declare our interests, salaries and assets. This has been happening in Ukraine, but now legislators are going against civil society organisations – people who really fight for equal rights, more democracy, media freedom, etc. So this requirement is seen – and has to be seen – as a matter of intimidation that needs to stop. Let me make one final remark about another country that I am rapporteur for here – Kosovo – which still does not have visa liberalisation.

So we are now talking about visa-free entry to the European Union for citizens of Ukraine. Unlike Poland or the Baltic States, Ukraine has not implemented any democratic or constitutional reforms. Ukraine is about as free economically as Ghana or Burkina Faso. The poor house of the euro zone, Greece, has a five times higher economic output per capita than Ukraine. It's civil war in the country. The president is a billionaire oligarch, and his mailbox companies have now become public through the Panama Papers. And he's not on good terms with journalists. He prefers not to let them enter, especially those who want to report on corruption. They then have to reveal their financial circumstances, so they are harassed in a special way. The fact that the Netherlands rejected the association agreement with Ukraine does not seem to interest anyone here, it is simply ignored. The EU wants to bind Ukraine more and more to itself and - as has already been said here - ultimately get it into the EU, even if the rejection of the Netherlands is there, for example. And that goes step by step - salami tactics - with money and without a visa. Billions of dollars are flowing into Ukraine, but the European Court of Auditors has stated that we don't know where.

Even these shocks did not destroy the idea that Ukraine belongs to Europe. In September 2014, our European Parliament and the Ukrainian Parliament ratified the Association Agreement, and tomorrow we have to approve visa-free travel for Ukraine.

Apart from the unanswered questions such as corruption, nepotism, fundamental freedoms and human rights, the necessary development costs for the member states and especially for the net contributors would amount to horrific billions and would mean an additional budget burden. The Union is therefore well advised to actually take the Copenhagen criteria that it has set itself seriously and to draw lessons from the enlargement problems of recent years.

This would eliminate the hours of waiting at the borders, and we could ensure entry conditions of European standard. Ukraine needs to be supported in implementing the necessary reforms through foreign and domestic policy and economic stabilization. The EU must send clear signals to Ukraine that democratization and the pursuit of European integration are not enough to be declared, but must be borne in mind in the measures. Thus, for example, it is unacceptable for the linguistic and educational rights of minorities living in a country to be curtailed in a discriminatory manner or to allow extremist groups to create tensions between the majority and minorities.

Since then the political, social and economic situation in the country has not improved. The political polarisation and institutional confrontation has further escalated, the economic situation is dire, the shortage of food and medicines has increased, there are reports of alarming child malnutrition, and the insecurity is only getting worse. I would therefore like to thank the Parliament for the continuous attention you have been paying to the situation in Venezuela. Today’s discussion is timely as the dialogue between the government and the opposition has stalled and the country urgently needs to find a peaceful and democratic solution to this crisis. Important efforts by the Vatican and UNASUR facilitators to establish a dialogue between government and opposition have been taking place since May 2016. Unfortunately, although the first two sessions of the dialogue in October and November had encouraging results, the commitments were not respected. The establishment of an electoral calendar, respect for the National Assembly’s access to external assistance to address the most urgent needs of the population, and the release of political prisoners, remain key issues on which there has been little or no progress.  The EU has not been observing the situation passively. We have been providing political and diplomatic support with a view to a meaningful and effective dialogue that can bring lasting and democratic solutions within the constitutional framework and in full respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms. To this end, we continue our constant contacts with countries in the region and beyond, and with international and regional organisations from the United Nations to the OAS and UNASUR, to share views and coordinate actions wherever and whenever appropriate. The EU has repeatedly been calling for respect for the Constitution, democratic principles, the rule of law and the separation and independence of powers which are crucial for the country to achieve a peaceful outcome to the current difficult situation. That is why we reacted immediately to the recent rulings of the Venezuelan Supreme Court suppressing the competences of the National Assembly and the immunity of parliamentarians, calling for full respect of the constitutional role of the National Assembly and for the immunity of its members. For the democratic order to be guaranteed Venezuela needs to establish an electoral calendar, as foreseen in the Constitution, and to organise elections that are free, fair and inclusive. In 2017 the election of governors should be a priority. The EU remains ready to reinforce its support to help address the most urgent needs of the population, thus contributing to dealing with current humanitarian challenges. For the moment, our assistance remains limited due to difficulties of access to the country and it focuses on the distribution of food and medicines to the most vulnerable population, but other possibilities of support are also being explored.

Days later, in the midst of enormous international pressure, the Supreme Court reversed, trying to convince Venezuelans that everything was, at bottom, a kind of misunderstanding. In addition, cynically, Nicolás Maduro sought to appear as a virtuous arbitrator who would have resolved the matter in an expeditious and effective manner. The truth, however, is different. The truth is that the autocratic regime never accepted the result of the December 2015 elections. We cannot forget that soon, on January 11, 2016, the Supreme Court of Justice - which the regime handles as it sees fit - decreed that the National Assembly he was in contempt, and therefore all acts emanating from him were null. And even then, the same court threatened to resort to the Constitution and replace Parliament. What happened was not, therefore, a mere madness. But something is changing in Venezuela. Nicolás Maduro's turnaround reveals that his strategy of antagonizing the opposition has apparently reached its limit. Maduro's turnaround shows that, after all, there is a red line. This red line has been drawn - or is beginning to be drawn, and we believe that - within the officiality itself. This was openly done by the Attorney General of Venezuela, Luísa Ortega Díaz, who spoke of a rupture in the constitutional order, but also in an invisible way, apparently, by some military hierarchies. This is a positive fact. It means that there are segments in the sphere of influence of officialism that do not fully adhere to the strategy followed so far and that, despite everything, are not willing to abdicate some constitutional principles basic.The climate of political polarization in Venezuela today has reached such a point that it can only be clarified through elections.In the meantime, Venezuela's economic, social and humanitarian crisis requires the promotion of a dialogue between the executive and the legislature.We believe that this is the path that must be followed.But in the meantime, we have to make, once again, a very strong and very clear call to promote the release of political prisoners who are incarcerated in Venezuela's jails and to proceed to the marking of the regional elections that should have already taken place.accomplished.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PSE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 371, "date": "2017-04-05.json", "name": "Charles TANNOCK", "mepid": "4521", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Group. – Mr President, it is almost a year since we last discussed Venezuela in this House.

National Assembly elections held in December 2015 saw President Maduro’s party lose to the opposition. However, this has led to little change, given Maduro’s and his government’s efforts to block all of the National Assembly’s initiatives. Having initially been achieved by means of using the Supreme Court to strip the assembly of its power, Maduro is now reverting to the far more conventional dictatorial tactics of arresting opposition politicians and sheer brutality. Continuing to cling on to power in these circumstances is concerning, given the situation on the streets, and it is difficult to see that the current situation is tenable until the  scheduled Presidential elections in October of 2017.

And it would be necessary and it would be more pertinent if a normal functioning of the Assembly could be reestablished, also resolving the dispute that exists over those three deputies who are, at this moment, an obvious element of concern. At this time there is —and our Group shares it— a concern about the confrontational spiral that may come, about the political confrontation that is sensed and that could degrade the situation in the country. That is why it is necessary, at this time - and we want to call for calm - to seek and help as much as possible to have the necessary mechanisms of relaxation.

first of all thank you for the opportunity to speak to you today and to update you on the state of implementation of the privacy shield and our plans for the upcoming first annual review. Today’s discussion is very timely, as I have just returned from Washington and can inform you of the latest state of play. As you rightly note in the motion for today’s resolution, the privacy shield has attracted a lot of interest, with more than 1 900 companies that have been certified under this framework. This shows the importance of the instrument for our trans-Atlantic relationship. It also means that an increasing volume of the personal data that is transferred across the Atlantic benefits from the many protections that the privacy shield offers for individuals. I know that some of you had hoped for more, and I too would one day like to see a fully fledged comprehensive data protection law in the United States, but in the meantime, our assessment is that the privacy issue of framework lives up to the requirements of our data protection laws, as interpreted by our highest court. Our highest court has clarified: adequacy does not mean that the rules in the third country have to be an exact photocopy of our rules. Rather, what the Commission has to assess is if that third country offers in law and practice an essentially equivalent level of protection to that guaranteed in the EU legal order. Clearly the privacy shield is a substantial improvement when compared to the old safe harbour. This is the view of our data protection authorities, and I am glad to see that your motion contains the same clear statement. However, putting in place the privacy shield framework, the privacy principles, together with the commitments and assurances by the United States’ government, was only part of the work. It is equally important that these rules also fully apply in practice. This is why our focus since the adoption of the decision has been on the effective implementation of this new framework. This involves several actors, and I am happy to report that our data protection authorities and the United States authorities have cooperated closely in working out procedures to ensure a robust oversight and enforcement of these new rules. Representatives from the Ombudsperson’s office as well as the Federal Trade Commission and Department of Commerce have come to Brussels on several occasions to discuss with the Commission and the Article 29 Working Party the details of this cooperation, and to report on their implementation work. During my visit to Washington last week, I put a particular emphasis on some of the key foundations on which the privacy shield is built. This concerns in particular the limitations and safeguards that apply in the area of government access for national security purposes. A central element of this is Presidential Policy Directive number 28, which specifically addresses the privacy protections afforded to foreigners. Another key element is the Ombudsperson mechanism, which ensures that Europeans have a possibility to obtain an individual review if they believe that intelligence authorities have broken the law when accessing their personal data. A third one is the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board. For the sustainability of the privacy shield it is essential that these elements are part of it. We will closely monitor any relevant developments in the United States with a possible impact on the privacy shield, including the upcoming debates around a possible reform or prolongation of Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which expires at the end of this year. This is the message we have been sending since the start of the new administration. I have repeated this message during my recent visit to Washington and my meetings with the White House, the Commerce Secretary, the Attorney General State Department as well as Congress, and I received assurances that this message is well understood by our US counterparts, both as to the value of the privacy shield and the need to keep all of its elements in place. Let me make this point very clear: If we are faced with any developments that could negatively affect the level of protection afforded under the Privacy Shield, the Commission will take its responsibilities and use all available mechanisms, be it review, suspension, revocation or repeal, to promptly react. My focus is now on the first annual joint review. This will be a crucial moment: a moment of truth where we take stock of how the privacy shield functions in practice and to see whether there are things that need to be improved. I have agreed with the US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross that the first annual joint review meeting will take place in Washington in September. All the various elements that are relevant for the functioning of the EU-US privacy shield will be covered by this review, inter alia: first, how US companies comply with their data protection obligations and the mechanisms they have put in place to ensure a speedy handling of complaints. Second, how the Department of Commerce and Federal Trade Committee certify companies, monitor compliance and cooperate with our data protection authorities in the enforcement. Third, the operation of the rules regarding access by public authorities and the rules and procedures to ensure that the Ombudsperson mechanism functions well. Fourth, in addition, in the issues identified already in the Commission’s adequacy decision, such as the dialogue on automated decision-making, as well as any developments in the United States law that might raise questions concerning the EU-US privacy shield and its operation, will have to be discussed. As partners in this review, we will of course discuss the precise parameters of the review with the Article 29 Working Party. The input from business and from civil society will also be of crucial importance. I met both sides in Washington, and they are committed to contribute. On the US side, we expect the joint review to involve the Department of Commerce and the Federal Trade Commission, but also the Ombudsperson and representatives from the intelligence community. Directly after the joint review we will report our findings to you and to the Member States in the Council.

It is important that we give our companies, SMEs and startups, etc., legal certainty, and also provide a concrete legal basis for the transatlantic data exchange while at the same time safeguarding data protection. And in my opinion, the data protection shield combines both. In all these years, recently, the Commission has achieved a great deal on the one hand in terms of data protection and on the other hand in terms of the data protection shield. We will never be able to get the 100% that other groups in this House would like to have, but there is no reason to speak so negatively about this privacy shield right now. We ourselves in Parliament already adopted a motion for a resolution on the free movement of data here in June 2016, where we also rate the data protection shield positively. But now there is really no reason to be right in the middle of it - it has been running since June or July of last year, and now we actually have to wait until the new report comes in September, and then there might have been a reason to evaluate it. So we neither have the practical experience that we can evaluate now, and theoretically this simply cannot be easily penetrated here. You have all highlighted the positive elements, and compared to the Safe Harbor Agreement, that is a huge step that we could not have expected in itself. In particular, you have achieved more than what we ourselves are willing to give in our own Member States, and that is a good thing. This interface with national security will always be difficult to overcome, but I believe that both sides benefit from these transatlantic data flows in the end, and it is also an indispensable opportunity for both sides to continue along the way.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 401, "date": "2017-04-05.json", "name": "Claude MORAES", "mepid": "4519", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group. – Madam President, to be very clear, the purpose of this resolution is because we have a September evaluation. I really believe that the members of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs – and indeed other Members who have expertise and interest in this extremely important topic – need to give their views to the Commissioner. I do not see any problem with this. In fact, I think this is a positive and important part of our work.  I want to begin with what you said about your trip to the United States. I think it is very important, Commissioner, particularly for the Civil Liberties Committee, that we have an interaction with you before we go to the United States in September. Why are we doing this? Why are we proposing this resolution? We are not doing it because there have not been significant and key improvements on Safe Harbor thanks to Privacy Shield, but because we want to ensure in Parliament that Privacy Shield stands the test of time and that it does not have weaknesses that would be difficult for the future. We know that Privacy Shield protects the fundamental rights of anyone in the EU whose personal data is transferred to the United States, as well as bringing legal clarity for businesses relying on trans-Atlantic data transfers, and we cannot allow that to fail. So the resolution acknowledges that the final agreement on the Privacy Shield, adopted in July 2016, has taken a number of Parliament’s concerns into consideration. We know that key improvements have been made compared to the former Safe Harbor. We note also that the agreement will facilitate data transfers from the EU to the US, particularly from SMEs and business in the EU, and that the EU Data Protection Authority’s supervisory powers remain unaffected by the adequacy decision, including the power of suspending or banning data transfers to US companies that are members of the Privacy Shield. We also take note of the clarifications and interpretations of the US Administration, in particular as regards the processing of personal data by security agencies. However, several issues must be resolved. The resolution highlights issues of concern that remain unclear, particularly, for example, those made by the Article 29 Working Party, which – as we all know – is deeply involved in these matters. These include concerns regarding the principle of data retention, the bulk collection of personal data for national security purposes, the need for sufficient judicial redress, and the effect of independent oversight, as well as several law enforcement issues. If these concerns are not taken into account, the Privacy Shield risks not achieving its purpose and could face further challenge in the courts. This is one of our deepest concerns. Both citizens and businesses relying on transatlantic data flows need that certainty of a robust legal framework, and this text calls on the Commission to conduct that proper assessment. It does not doubt that that will happen, but we are doing our job in ensuring that every part of this detail is covered.  We will raise these concerns during our LIBE delegation with our US counterparts, and we are now experienced in these negotiations. The Parliament has consistently called for a stronger agreement, following the invalidation of Safe Harbor in October 2015, and we now want the protection of personal data which meets the requirements of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the data protection legal framework. Commissioner, today we are calling on you to conduct a proper assessment to ensure this legal certainty is provided for citizens and business alike. We in the Parliament simply want to do our job. That is what the resolution is saying today.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 402, "date": "2017-04-05.json", "name": "Helga STEVENS", "mepid": "125105", "text": "on behalf of the ECR Group. - First of all, I regret that certain political groups did not want to wait for the first evaluation by the Commission.

Let me emphasize a few things from this. First, transatlantic data transfer is essential to our economy, trade and security. No one can deny this and please let us not put it aside in this debate. Anyone who is pushing for a suspension of the Privacy Shield should consider the consequences of the legal uncertainty that this entails. Second, with the Privacy Shield, we achieved an unprecedented level of data protection. A gigantic step was taken in the right direction. The rights and legal protection of EU citizens when data transfers to the US are advancing enormously. Of course I agree that the Commission should always strive for the highest possible standard of data protection, but some political groups and Members of Parliament continue to believe that only a copy of the European rules will suffice. However, the United States is an independent nation. However, while the country is an important strategic ally of the EU, we should not forget that it is not a member of the Union.

We had already expressed very serious concerns under the Obama administration and, for some reason, the changes that have been made by the Trump administration do not alleviate my concerns. I do not know why, it is probably me. Indeed we do not expect the US law to be identical, but we do expect it to be essentially equivalent, because that is what the judges have said. So that is not a party political request but an obligation for the EU institutions, and the Commission is responsible here.  I do not need to outline all the questions that we have put in the resolution. I am actually a little bit disappointed. The resolution has been available in the public domain for some time now. I would have expected the Commission to have already responded to the questions which are in there. What about the privacy and civil liberties oversight board, which is under quota? What about the Ombudsmen, who has not been replaced? What about the impact of Section 14 of the Privacy Act? What about the legal status of the assurances? What about the definition of bulk transfers? What about the interpretation of PPD—28? The Commission could have addressed all these things in its statement.  I would really urge the Commission not just to repeat what should be done, but actually to  be on top of things. That is the way the Americans would do it, so why do we not do it on behalf of our citizens? Two final issues, because this is not about party politics, Mrs Stevens; there is a legal challenge before the ECJ. There is also the other issue, namely that national DPAs may actually decide to suspend the transfers and then we have legal uncertainty.

It is exactly like that. No, we cannot make peace with the privacy shield.

Anyone who still talks about a protective shield is a dreamer. The privacy shield we are talking about here is an open barn door for arbitrariness at the expense of fundamental rights. And it can get even worse if it is the case that the US Senate and the House of Representatives have actually overturned a ban, that the ban on the FCC telecommunications regulator has been overturned, so that Internet providers then collect and use private data with practically no consent from their customers can sell.

When the Americans claim national security is at stake, analysis of bulk data remains possible. Let me repeat and underline that again: under the Privacy Shield, bulk data may still be analyzed. That in itself is enough to dismiss the Privacy Shield. The European Court was clear, wasn't it? Storage and analysis of bulk data is prohibited. So we can set the clock: the privacy shield will die, just like Safe Harbor in Luxembourg. So the resolution we will be voting on tomorrow reiterates what we all know: under the Privacy Shield, our rights in the US remain substantially lower than here in the European Union. Not equivalent, no, lower. So what do we do? Are we stubborn and are we waiting for Max Schrems and his companions to travel from Ireland to Luxembourg and the Court to reprimand us?

Only after the European Court of Justice declared the Safe Harbor regime null and void did the Commission try to create better rules for data transfer to the USA. However, despite some progress, the overall result cannot convince me. It is still difficult to legally defend against misuse of your data. The US ombudsperson is not independent enough. US companies are not required to delete personal information when it is no longer necessary. The biggest problem, however, is that the new Privacy Shield does not rule out mass surveillance either. In its ruling on the repeal of its predecessor “Safe Harbor”, however, the European Court of Justice made it clear: general access to the content of electronic communication violates the essence, the core of the fundamental right to respect for private life. The first review of the privacy shield is due soon. It is important to us Social Democrats that the points of criticism mentioned receive sufficient attention there and that legal certainty is created. Parliament cannot suspend the privacy shield, but the Commission can if the deficiencies in the protection of fundamental rights are too great. I very much regret that the Conservatives in the Home Affairs Committee did not want to support our jointly negotiated resolution. It seems that they are more important to quick solutions for companies than sustainable, fundamental rights-friendly approaches, which also offer more legal protection for the companies concerned.

These principles necessarily apply to transatlantic data transfers to ensure legal certainty for companies and citizens, within a legal framework, robust in equivalent data protection regimes and less vulnerable to criminal and misuse. This European Parliament resolution recognizes that the privacy protection shield between the European Union and the United States contains significant improvements with regard to the clarity of the rules, in comparison with the old regime, called safe harbor, as a result of the efforts of the European Commission to address the shortcomings raised by the Court of Justice, the Article 29 working group and the European Parliament, among others. Even so, Parliament points out a number of reservations, both the commercial aspects and the access by the United States public authorities to data transferred from the European Union. And there are just a few, such as the absence of specific rules on automated decisions and the application of the principles of the shield to subcontractors. The absence of a general right of opposition on the part of citizens, the need for guarantees on the independence and powers of the mediation mechanism and the absence of guarantees on the failure to carry out a mass indiscriminate collection of personal data which is prohibited by the European Charter Fundamental Rights. All of these concerns can lead to a challenge of this regime to the courts. In addition, the political situation in the United States today is clearly different. We cannot ignore, Madam Commissioner, the impact of the election of Donald Trump on the fulfillment of the agreement and the guarantees given by the Obama administration. Trump has already shown complete contempt for deals signed by the previous administration. Just this week the President enacted a law that gives Internet operators in the United States the freedom to sell their customers' data, such as browsing history and other private information, to the advertising market, without the consent of the persons concerned, the which demonstrates the contempt of the new administration for the minimum guarantees to protect privacy and personal data that existed previously. That is why, on the occasion of the first annual joint review, the Commission must proceed to an in-depth analysis of all the gaps and deficiencies that are mentioned in this resolution and has to verify the compatibility of Trump's new laws and executive orders with the commitments made within the framework of the privacy protection shield, as well as its impact on data protection ...

I am grateful for hearing your views, including the critical voices, because we take all of them very seriously and share many of them. That is why – as I also said at the beginning – we are closely monitoring the situation in the United States. It is not true that we only say what should be done. I am informing you about the things we are doing. This is something I want to emphasise very strongly.  I am aware of the fact – as Mr Moraes, Mr Voss and some others clearly said – that at the moment we still do not have a full assessment of the functioning of Privacy Shield, because this is just the beginning. It is also for this reason that I am glad about the idea which we discussed today with the Chair of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, namely that I could come in the first half of this year to give full information about how we see and assess the functioning of Privacy Shield. This is my commitment which I would like to repeat here in the plenary. When I say that the first annual review will be the moment of truth, I mean it very seriously. This must not be just another report. I want to give an honest and true reflection of the situation. That is why I want to use all possible channels to have this fully-fledged review which will reflect how Privacy Shield protects the privacy of Europeans and whether it fully protects according our requirement, the requirement of European law, and the requirement of the court ruling.  That is why I want to take all the inputs from the State Administration, from the Article 29 Working Party on the European side and the Federal Trade Commission on the American side. I want to take on board all the critical comments from the NGOs. I spoke to NGOs on both the European and American sides. They are very critical and share some of the concerns which you voiced here today. I want to a create a precise and detailed questionnaire which will be sent to the certified companies – the companies which have been certified under Privacy Shield – so that we receive information from them about the number of requests from the intelligence services and security bodies on the American side, and much other detailed information. I also want to use the media reports about the atmosphere, tendencies and trends in the United States to capture something which I call a real feel for how to look at the situation in the United States. We must focus on three main things: the legal environment in the United States; the capacities which the United States partners invest in the full functioning of Privacy Shield; the way Privacy Shield is used and respected by the certified companies; and the way Privacy Shield is used by the citizens themselves, because, as you know, an important part of the Privacy Shield mechanism is offering new ways of redress for EU citizens. These are the things which we are going to fully focus and reflect on through the first annual review. Mrs in 't Veld asked for a specific answers to some questions. I will try to answer them now but, as I said, we are ready to give you more detailed responses whenever you ask. On the Ombudsperson, the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB) and the Federal Trade Commission, what I said before is relevant, namely that we are focusing on the United States institutions to be fully equipped as regards the capacities and the responsible leadership to keep Privacy Shield running. We shared our concerns in Washington about the fact that we do not see any persons nominated or appointed to these positions. We now have to face the reality that the new American Administration still has to appoint about 5 000 people to senior positions in the State Administration, out of which 1 000 must also be also endorsed and authorised by the Senate. The Ombudsperson, for instance, is one of them so we will now have to negotiate with and monitor the work of the acting Ombudsperson. My colleague has spoken to this person, so we are in contact and they understand how important this is for us. As for the Ombudsperson, I will rely for the review on the information from the Ombudsperson’s office because there should not only be information about the complaints he or she received, but also information about how many requests were sent from the intelligence services to the companies. I will push hard to get such information because we also want the Ombudsperson to act as the relevant source of trustworthy information for us.  On PCLOB the situation is similar. We urge the American side to have the full capacity of the Federal Trade Commission. I spoke to its acting Chair, and we made it very clear that we are waiting for the official new representation. On PPD-28, we have been assured that no changes are foreseen, but we will of course keep monitoring this. We also have strong allies in the Congress and among the experts who are monitoring the situation on this piece of legislation, which I made absolutely clear to our American partners is the main pillar, as it is for the American legislation, for keeping Privacy Shield running. This is what we need to see in place and fully functioning. Regarding Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), still no information can be received on whether there will be amendments or whether it will continue in the same way as it is in force now. We have to follow all the information we receive in the months to come, but I am rather sceptical about whether before the review we will have anything more concrete about whether there will be any changes. I made it very clear that, if there are changes to the detriment of the situation for the protection of Europeans’ private data, we will have to act because this is an absolutely crucial piece of legislation for Privacy Shield. The situation on the executive order is different, according to our legal analysis, because the protections of Privacy Shield are not based on the US Privacy Act. Therefore the executive order which you mentioned has no impact on this. This is the executive order on enhancing public safety. In Section 14 this concerns protections under the US Privacy Act of 1974. The Privacy Act only applies to US citizens and permanent residents. The Obama Administration had instructed federal agencies to use their discretion also to apply these protections to others in the context of migration databases and this policy has now has been reversed. But let us be clear: as I indicated, the Privacy Act never granted any rights to Europeans. That is why we had to negotiate new arrangements, notably the umbrella agreement and the accompanying Judicial Redress Act, to ensure the necessary protection for Europeans and these remain unaffected by the executive order. This has also been confirmed in writing by the United States. Let me conclude by saying that for us the main message to take to Washington was that we can see that security is a very high priority in the United States. I made it absolutely clear that for us the protection of Europeans’ private data is a very high priority and a fundamental right which must also be protected in the transfer of data to the United States. I think that this was well understood by all our key American partners. I would say that the protection of private data must remain great, not be made great again.

We will write our closing remarks when the expected shift in the crisis takes place in Macedonia. With the active participation of all shadow rapporteurs and after comprehensive consideration and support in the European Parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee, a document has emerged that clearly supports Macedonia's integration into the European Union and Euro-Atlantic integration, provided the protracted political crisis ends a new government that will take into account the results of the elections on 11 December last year and the relations and possibilities of coalition cooperation in parliament based on them. Today we can only conclude that the crisis continues, that the work of parliament is practically impossible, that the basic rules of parliamentary democracy are not observed and that instead of committing to the long-term interests of the state, the political confrontation of parties is dominated by tones. Instead of allowing the country to move along the outlined European path, urgent and profound reforms are directing the disgruntled politicians of the masses of their supporters into street protests that encourage interethnic mistrust and intolerance. Almost four months after the snap parliamentary elections, which were held in accordance with democratic standards, we concluded that the constitution of the parliament and the formation of the government could not be due to systematic obstruction of the process by the strongest political party VMRO, which failed to form the required majority. for refusing the President to entrust, in accordance with the rules and practice of democracies, the mandate to form a government to the leader who has given him the necessary assurances that he has the majority support of Parliament. The highest representatives of the European Union, NATO and the leaders of many European countries have clearly and critically commented on the conduct of President Gjorge Ivanov. They all are called on the President to use his powers to enable the normal functioning of parliament and the formation of a government on the basis of the generous majority available to the potential ruling coalition. President Ivanov insists on a position that reveals above all his party affiliation and prolongs the crisis. It is still time to change its position and align it with the demand and principles of parliamentary democracy, to restore peace and hope for a better life in peace and mutual respect to all citizens of their country. Ladies and gentlemen, the report, the content of which I prepared as rapporteur in constructive cooperation with you, the Commission, colleagues in the mediation team on behalf of the European Parliament and in close substantive cooperation with Commissioner Johannes Hahn and his Cabinet, will need to be updated as the crisis unfolds. Macedonia before we put it to the vote. I am convinced that Macedonia deserves more encouragement than criticism. He has been waiting too long for negotiations to begin over the anachronistic name dispute. The report takes the view that bilateral issues and disputes should not be an obstacle to the country's progress towards Euro-Atlantic integration. The recommendation to start accession negotiations, conditional on resolving the political crisis and accelerating work on reforms based on the Pržino agreement and the document on urgent reform priorities, would encourage progress and the much-needed participation of all political parties on the national priority. EU. Macedonia and the region around it need stability and peace. At the moment, it also needs reconciliation and reconciliation as a condition for a different, inclusive policy. (One more sentence, please.) Macedonian politicians should resolve their relations in a democratic way.

On 9 March 2017, the European Council discussed the situation in the Western Balkans. It stressed the EU’s commitment to the region and reaffirmed its unequivocal support for the European perspective of the Western Balkans. President Tusk visited the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia earlier this week and confirmed this commitment. On behalf of the Presidency I wish to reiterate our commitment to advancing the enlargement process in full respect of the basic principles of conditionality and on merit.  The early parliamentary elections finally took place on 11 December 2016, after having been postponed twice. We take good note that the OSCE considers that the elections were competitive, but that they took place in an environment characterised by widespread public mistrust in the institutions and the political establishment. Unfortunately, the government has not been formed to date, and we are concerned at the current political impasse. We look forward to the formation of the new government without further delay in line with democratic principles and the constitution.  In Skopje on Monday, President Tusk called for statesmanship and unity in order to find a way out of the current deadlock. We also remain worried about the continuation of the political crisis and the partial implementation of the Pržino Agreement. We share your view that political will is necessary to ensure its full, tangible and sustainable implementation. The country continues to suffer from a very divisive political environment, polarisation and the lack of a culture of compromise, with backsliding in important areas such as the functioning of the judiciary, which should be allowed to work independently.  Let me also reiterate the importance of a thorough and independent investigation, without hindrance, of the allegations of wrongdoing brought to the fore by the wiretaps and the related failures of oversight. In this respect, I would like to recall the importance of the mandate and the work of both the Special Prosecutor and the parliamentary committee of inquiry to look respectively into legal and also political responsibility. It is also important to restore trust in the national institutions. We also back your call on all parties, including those forming the future government, to take ownership and to honour the undertaking to implement the urgent reform priorities, and also to address systematic rule of law issues, including in relation to breaches of fundamental rights, judicial independence, media freedom, elections, corruption, politicisation of state institutions, state or party blurring, and failures of oversight. We also welcome the Commission’s intention to continue the close monitoring in order to assess systematic failures in the areas of justice, corruption, fundamental rights and human affairs, as reflected also in the urgent reform priorities. We expect the new government to urgently, as a  first priority, address overdue reforms, including the one I just referred to – the urgent reform priorities – for the benefit of the country and its citizens, and also in order to return the country to its European path.  The Council also acknowledges and encourages the constructive role played by civil society in supporting and improving democratic processes. I would also like to stress the importance of good inter-ethnic relations. The review of the Ohrid Framework Agreement needs to be completed by the new government as soon as possible in an inclusive and transparent manner, and its recommendations implemented. Let me finally underline that maintaining of good neighbourly relations, including a negotiated and mutually accepted solution to the name issue, under the auspices of the United Nations remains essential. We all agree that there is a need to bring the longstanding discussions on the name issue to a definitive conclusion without delay. Let me welcome the fact that the confidence-building measures have started to produce tangible results. Actions and statements which negatively impact on good neighbourly relations should also be avoided, and we note the continued high level and expert contacts with Bulgaria aimed at strengthening good neighbourly relations. We look forward to their timely translation into concrete results. We also welcome the fact that the Commission is prepared to extend these recommendations to open accession negotiations, conditional on progress with the implementation of the Pržino Agreement, and substantial progress in the implementation of the urgent reform priorities.  The Presidency is ready to revert, when appropriate, to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, including on the basis of an update from the Commission once sufficient progress has been made on these issues and in line with the previous Council conclusions and established conditionality. The political leaders now have the responsibility to take the necessary steps and put their country back on the Euro-Atlantic path. The European Union stands ready to support them in these endeavours.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 415, "date": "2017-04-05.json", "name": "Neven Mimica", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, first of all, I would like to thank the Parliament, and in particular the rapporteur, Ivo Vajgl, for the report which is before you today for discussion. We find it balanced and in line with the main findings of our 2016 report on the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. As you all know, the political situation in the country is of very serious concern. The Commission, therefore, greatly appreciates the work of this House, and in particular the efforts of honourable Members, Ivo Vajgl, Mr Fleckenstein and Mr Kukan, and, before that, Richard Howitt. In very close coordination with Commissioner Hahn, they send common messages to the political leaders during their recent visit to Skopje. President Tusk was also in the country on Monday. More than ever, we need to continue speaking with one voice. The early parliamentary elections last December were a key part of the political agreement which the country’s leaders signed in 2015. But they were only a start. We are all deeply concerned about the latest developments and the continued refusal of President Ivanov to give a mandate to a coalition which is clearly supported by the majority in the assembly. This risks undermining the stability of the country and its credibility. We are also gravely concerned about the emergence of inter-ethnic inflammatory rhetoric by some actors. Such rhetoric means playing with fire. It could have broader regional implications and must, therefore, stop immediately. I therefore strongly encourage all political leaders in the country, including the president, to respect the results of the elections and the clear parliamentary majority. We expect the president to let democracy proceed and a new government to be formed. I know that, especially, this House feels strongly about the central role of national parliaments, and we expect all political leaders to stop fuelling inter-ethnic tensions. The rapid formation of the new government will, however, not to be sufficient in itself to return to business as usual. We will continue to insist on the implementation of all parts of the 2015 Pržino agreement, including key reforms on the rule of law. We need to see a clear and firm political will to tackle these issues. Substantial progress is not only needed in the implementation of the so-called urgent reform priorities, which address the serious rule of law issues in the country. This also means that the special prosecutor’s office should be given time and resources to complete its work. Let me at this point also emphasise the crucial importance of empowered civil society and good neighbourly relations. We are concerned about the criticism and attacks faced by civil society organisations. An empowered civil society is a crucial component of any democratic system, and should be recognised and treated as such by state institutions and politicians. Good neighbourly relations are also essential for the country. Resolving bilateral issues with the neighbours is crucial and finding a solution to the main issue remains a priority. We should all come together to support this goal. Last but not least, the country was also at the front line of an unprecedented migration crisis in 2015 and 2016. It has received very considerable support from the EU and from individual Member States. The Commission remains committed to continue helping with this challenge, despite the situation being much calmer now. Let me, however, also say that our good cooperation on migration issues does not mean at all that we will close an eye to the aforementioned democratic and rule of law issues. That would be extremely short-sighted, and I know this is not how this House sees enlargement. In short, the European Council has just reaffirmed the accession perspective of the entire Western Balkans region. It is now up to the countries in the region to use this momentum, with our help. This is a long, complex process so there is no time to waste. This is particularly true for this country. I now look forward to the debate.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 416, "date": "2017-04-05.json", "name": "Tunne KELAM", "mepid": "28424", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Madam President, I very much appreciate the constructive approach by Mr Vajgl. We are still optimistic about this very complicated programme and on behalf of the EPP Group I can say that I fully support his stand.  I think the key word was provided by President Tusk a few days ago when he said that Macedonia can count on EU support once the domestic political crisis is solved, based on democratic principles, decency and common sense. I think we can interpret this as meaning that the EU wants Macedonia to move towards the EU and NATO membership. The internal situation remains extremely complicated but we must understand that it is our shared worry and shared responsibility.  The EU has a responsibility, especially now, to play a stronger role in the region or, as we know, there will be other powers to fill the void. The external influences have already fuelled internal divisions in Macedonia. If we are hesitant or slow to bring Western Balkan countries closer to the EU others will not hesitate to drift them away from us.  The major problem remains national reconciliation, which means serious efforts to develop inclusiveness and mutual trust.

I would also like to thank Mr Vajgl for his good report, even if we cannot vote on it today. We cannot vote, although he, Eduard Kukan and my predecessor Richard Howitt made every effort to work with the parties to find a solution to end the crisis in Macedonia. And this solution was called democratic elections, which are also recognized afterwards. And these elections took place, and they also took place in an environment that one could say: the work was worth it. But the work was not worth it if democracy only works if the respective party wins. That is why I say very clearly: the result is clear, 67 MPs have formed a coalition, and we expect those who have been voted out to leave their offices, do proper opposition work and maybe return in four years when this government is in place who now comes into office has done a bad job. But what is not possible is to take an entire country hostage just because one's own claims to power are what they are. And there is no need to fool around - you have to be very clear: If you continue like this, the road to Europe will be closed at some point. There can be no recommendation for any form of negotiation if the largest party in a country is of the opinion that democracy only works if it wins.

What is certainly not good is the sequence of events after the early elections held in December. Faced with the loss of power, the long-standing ruling party, its leader and the President of the Republic from its ranks have put the country in a difficult situation. After the president repeatedly refused to give a mandate to form a new government to a leader who managed to secure a majority of MPs elected in the election, Macedonia has returned to a period of internal strife. Encouraging protests in the streets, unsubstantiated accusations that the new government will threaten the country's unity, ignoring European Union officials who advise respect for the Constitution, are becoming instruments of maintaining tension and forcing new elections. At the same time, the former ruling party is blocking the functioning of the new parliament, so that regular local elections scheduled for May have not been called. What seems crucial to me is that the dividing lines deepened by the former prime minister and his party do not leave a mark on the European Union's common approach to the crisis in Macedonia. Such an approach by the European Union and the international community has already yielded good results on several occasions. By discussing the long-lasting and increasingly serious crisis in Macedonia, we are actually answering the growing dilemma of what kind of political arrangements we want in the countries of the Western Balkans. Because depending on the clarity of our views and the insistence on consistent adherence to democratic standards, we will send a message to all the protagonists of violating them. No one disputes the results of the early parliamentary elections recently held in Macedonia. I can say this as a direct observer of these elections. The election did not yield an absolute but a relative winner. A winner who failed in his attempt to renew the coalition with his previous partners. But that same party is after that opposed a coalition of former partners and immediate rivals.Political communities can run into crises because that is the nature of relationships in societies.However, it does not matter how a political community recognizes the crisis and how it emerges from it.Let's not forget that party conflicts in Macedonia are inseparable from ethnic tensions.Fortunately, the current disputes have not caused the crisis to spill over to a wider area of the already sensitive region.That is why our reaction must be consistent and timely.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hr", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 424, "date": "2017-04-05.json", "name": "Arne GERICKE", "mepid": "124815", "text": "- Madam President, ladies and gentlemen!

And our European Union is also guided by this principle in its external action, because women's rights and gender equality are not only fundamental human rights, but also necessary measures to promote development and reduce poverty, and the basis for a peaceful, prosperous and sustainable world. The European Parliament in February adopted its recommendations to the Council on the EU's priorities for March this year. The 61st session of the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women, held in New York, was dedicated to strengthening the economic power of women. The European Parliament's priorities covered five main areas. Firstly, it is a framework for strengthening the empowerment of women and girls, which means giving women the tools they need to become economically independent, equally represented and equal in all areas of life, gain more power in public life and control all decisions that affect their lives. Secondly, it is strengthening women's economic power and removing barriers in the labor market. And measures such as reconciling work and family life, closing the pay and pension gap, are very important here. Third, equal participation of women in decision-making at all levels. Fourth, the needs and problem-solving of the most vulnerable women, and these are women with disabilities, women refugees, women living in rural areas or in poverty. Finally, fifth and very important: all these issues and all these problems must have a sufficient budget, sufficient resources. So I now turn directly to the Council. Can the Council answer the following questions: how has the Council taken account of the priorities set out in Parliament's recommendation in formulating the European Union's position, and which points have not been accepted by the Member States? If not, why not? What were the main features of the European Union the progress made in negotiating the conclusions of the Commission on the Status of Women and to what extent was it possible to translate the European Union's priorities into a harmonized text of the conclusions? Finally, is the European Union achieving any results on global commitments in the field of women's health, and in particular on action to combat the negative effects of the so-called universal silence rule on women? As you probably know, the new US administration has announced the cessation of funding for the United Nations Population Fund, i. y. it is an agency that supports family planning policies around the world. Knowing that the US financial contribution to this program is particularly significant, such knowledge is really worrying in this case, as the United Nations Population Fund has saved the lives of tens of thousands of women around the world by providing access to family planning services, preventing unsafe abortions, supporting mothers and baby health. So how does the Council view such a message and how do you see the potential for strengthening the European Union's role in this area? It is clear that with the withdrawal of the United States from funding such important programs, the European Union must become a leader in this area. Another question that needs to be answered. Parliament supported the proposal to draw up an International Labor Organization convention with a view to establishing an international standard for tackling gender-based violence in the workplace, which is, in fact, very relevant. So, are there any plans to take any action in the future in relation to this convention to make such a convention come into being? And finally. Mr Borg, I thank you in advance for your answers and, of course, thank you for your cooperation with the Council. I also just want to emphasize and ask that, in future, we really need to strengthen institutional cooperation and coordination, because we have one common goal: ensuring women's rights and gender equality.", "language": "en", "original_language": "lt", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 441, "date": "2017-04-05.json", "name": "Ian Borg", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "President fil-Kariga tal-Kunsill. - It is considered that the flowers and plants have not yet undergone any treatment other than that in which they have been obtained.

Year by year, the UN session on women's rights is gaining importance, involving more and more and more and more important institutions and people. This is linked to the fact that there is a growing understanding of the socially and economically important issue of women's rights and equality. This year's session was devoted to the economic empowerment of women, and we all hoped that the voice of the European Parliament, which adopted joint recommendations especially for the session, would be properly heard. It is hard to find an institution in the world that can boast a longer experience in successfully promoting women's rights than the European Union, especially in terms of access to education and the labor market. Despite such strong legitimacy, we are not sure what our contribution was to the final conclusions of the 61st session in which we attended as Parliament's official delegation. The question of the results of negotiations is important in the context of the backlash phenomenon, which we observe worldwide in relation to women's rights. Backlash poses a huge threat to further progress, but also to the implementation of decisions already agreed. Ladies and gentlemen! Regarding the negotiations, I am particularly interested in the results of these talks on access to high-quality education. We know from European experience that education alone is not enough. Women graduate more often than men, but work in lower paid jobs and in lower positions. The more attractive the sector, the higher the position - the less women. These gaps are particularly visible in the ICT sector, which is the backbone of the economy of the future. Only 3% of tech start-ups are run by women. Women less frequently use the Internet and Internet services, bank, buy and sell online less frequently, and work and learn online less frequently. Internet and high technologies, which are a potential tool of change in the field of equality, which could facilitate the equalization of opportunities, become another cause of women's exclusion.This problem can only be solved by the appropriate quality of education, by appropriate programs and policies in this area, which is mentioned in the recommendations.That is why information on the effects of the negotiations is so important: what of the presidency's postulates were included in the conclusions in this area?", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 443, "date": "2017-04-05.json", "name": "Anna HEDH", "mepid": "28131", "text": "for the S&D group. - Madam President! Often, several times per session, we discuss the situation and gender equality of women in this House, tonight on the theme of women's economic self-determination. I am the rapporteur for the forthcoming report of the Gender Equality Committee on the same subject, and I attended the European Parliament delegation to New York and the 61st summit of the UN Commission on Women earlier in March. The European Parliament has recently stepped up its efforts for gender equality despite massive opposition, not least in response to, among other things, the United States' recent attempt to restrict women's right to their own bodies. Women's economic self-determination is fundamentally a matter of freedom for women. It is about the right to individual financial freedom. For me, economic self-determination is a central issue in gender equality work, but there are also other factors that today prevent women from enjoying the same rights as men. The fact that the right to one's own body, and the right to decide over it, does not always apply to women is incomprehensible to me. Since Donald Trump reintroduced \"global gag rules\", it is estimated to mean a financial deficit of about ten billion dollars, and most recently the United States withdrew its money to the UN Population Fund, about 32 million dollars. This development we are seeing, not just on the other side of the Atlantic, means that women will actually die. Women who do not receive the medical help they need are now falling victim to the policies pursued.

When we talk about the United Nations Population Fund, he does point out in his program that he does not promote abortion as a method of family planning, but supplies a drug called “misoprostol” that is also used to induce abortion. I wonder why so-called family planning organizations put abortion promotion at the center of their work, instead of helping millions of women who want to have children, which they can’t.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hr", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 452, "date": "2017-04-05.json", "name": "Michaela ŠOJDROVÁ", "mepid": "124710", "text": "- Madam President, I would like to say that the empowerment of women has been the subject of this year's 67th session, but it has also been the subject of many parliamentary reports over the last two years, such as the report on women's poverty, reconciling family and working life. on the promotion of women in business and rural conditions. That is why I was interested in what position the Council defended and how satisfied it was with its results. I would like to say to the representatives of the Council that there are more of us here, and you have heard the speeches of speakers who do not agree with the European Union financing the abortion as a form of planned parenthood. This is not a measure that can help women. As a member of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, one student asked me this week about the balanced representation of women and men on this committee. I must have been ashamed to say that there were only 5 men out of 36 members. This is therefore not a balanced representation of full membership.

Because, as the Presidency has said, yes, efforts have been made, but, in practice, we have 14 Member States that have not ratified the Treaty of Istanbul and we are going as the European Union to the UN to teach lessons to others. So there are serious contradictions within the European Union that need to be overcome. And I think the European Parliament is setting the tone.

The Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality criticised the US Government for how it spends its money on foreign aid and the new conditions it puts on its aid. The US is a sovereign country and only accountable to its own citizens. We, as the EU, also do not want to be criticised by others when we put conditions on the aid we give. I think the EU should rather attend to the aid it gives itself.  The 79 ACP countries that welcome EU aid sometimes find the conditions we ask on our aid to be socially oppressive. We are in no position to criticise the foreign-aid practices of other countries.  According to the UN regulations and regarding the wording, I think the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality should always remember one thing – abortion is no form of reproductive health or family planning.  Under this emphasis I would kindly ask Mr Borg to analyse the negative effects on women, especially mothers, of the global gag rule. We should by no means develop an own method of discrimination against mothers.
