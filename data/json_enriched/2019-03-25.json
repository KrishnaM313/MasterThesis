I have already expressed our condolences to the Dutch Prime Minister, Mark Rutte, at last week's European Council meeting. Today I would like to take this opportunity to express the condolences of the whole House to the Dutch people and to the families of the victims of this terrible attack, which deeply saddens us. We must also remember the victims of the massacre in Christchurch, New Zealand, an attack in which fifty people were killed and brutally murdered while they were being gathered in prayer in two mosques. These episodes remind us once again that we must not lower our guard against racial and religious hatred: if we want to defend our values and our freedom from these barbarism, we must redouble our efforts against all forms of violence and racial discrimination. We also express our solidarity and closeness to the victims of Typhoon Idai, which has hit Zimbabwe, Malawi and, above all, Mozambique, where it has caused many terrible victims and devastation. Finally, today marks the 70th anniversary of the mass deportation from the Baltic countries, which began on 25 March 1949: in a few days, 32 000 Lithuanian citizens, 42 000 Latvians and 21 000 Estonians, mostly women and children, were deported to Siberian prison camps. Operation Priboi was a terrible crime against humanity, as established by the European Court of Human Rights. And since we are obliged, once again, to remember so many innocent victims, I invite you, as requested by some Members, a request with which I agree, to observe a minute's silence for the victims of these tragic events.

The resolution is extremely balanced and factual and I fail to see how that would be unduly influencing the elections. I really do not think there is any risk. The resolution is partly critical, but it also establishes that progress is being made, in particular in the two countries that you mentioned, so I really don’t think that there is a risk. This is a non—political issue. The resolution has already been voted on in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) and that was before the first round of elections in Slovakia. So I really don’t think that there is a risk, and we should not politicise these matters by taking it off the agenda.

We conclude many years of work of this Parliament fighting against tax evasion, tax avoidance and financial crimes. What we have before us is the most comprehensive work done to date by this Parliament in fighting tax evasion and financial crimes and also tax avoidance. Take the example of tax evasion and avoidance: it costs about EUR 1 trillion a year. That means EUR 2000 per European citizen per year – money that has to go to hospitals, to schools, to ensure that our society has money for the weakest and the most vulnerable people. Tax is stolen, is actually stolen from the most vulnerable people. So, therefore, this fight is so important. In the European Union we have the biggest single market. We are attracting a lot of money and business, but at the same time, we are not effective in stopping financial crimes and money laundering. Dirty Russian money, a lot of money is coming into our single market without proper detection or prevention, but also without proper law enforcement and also without proper sanctions of the institutions and banks that let us down when we see big money laundering scandals. In my own country we had the scandal of Danske Bank where money flew through a branch in Estonia, up to EUR 200 billion of suspected money, a lot probably laundered from, for example, Russian oligarchs or criminals, into our single market. We have to detect it and stop it much better. Therefore, in this work we have a lot of good recommendations. First of all, having an effective minimum corporate taxation in Europe is really what we need now in our single market to stop the race to the bottom on corporate taxation. That’s the first thing and we will fight for that. Secondly, we need to end harmful cross-border tax practices by Member States. Some Member States are facilitating this but they should stop doing this, we should have fair taxes in Europe. On money laundering, we need a centralised process where we cooperate between European countries, because today it’s too easy to bring your dirty money and make it clean and use it all over Europe. This is a threat to our financial and economic stability. It’s a threat to our justice system in Europe and we need to do something about it. For example, we need a centralised Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) that could cooperate and ensure that our national law enforcement really implemented the anti-money laundering legislation we have adopted in this Parliament. We have a problem of implementation. We also see that when the biggest corporations on this earth, the tech giants, are doing good business here, creating a lot of value in their interaction with European users, they do not pay fair taxes on the value they create. We need to also call on them to pay fair taxes and we need legislation to ensure that that happens. We need a common, consolidated corporate tax base. We need transparency, so we need country-by-country reporting when it comes to corporate taxes so we can also see whether they behave in a socially responsible way. And we need our countries, our Member States, to ensure that they follow the standards they should. I have to say that it’s a big step forward that this Parliament and Commission and Council has taken to make a list of third countries’ non-cooperative jurisdictions. But, if you applied some of the same criteria that we use on third countries on European Member States will see that some of them fall short. They also facilitate aggressive tax planning and that had to stop – our own government has to stop this practice that is harming their neighbour, even in the European Union. Therefore, I think before us we have a very good and comprehensive report but I have to say that a lot has to be done in the future as well.

We discuss not only money laundering or tax fraud, but also digitalisation, distances and growing interconnectedness. It seems that existing tax systems are not addressing this issue properly, and we are facing big problems in the area of tax collection. Our report also reflects the previous revelations of the TAX2 and PANA Committees, as well as the work done on the reports, especially the report on increased transparency of corporate taxation that I had the pleasure to prepare for Parliament with Anneliese Dodds. Since the first initiative of the Parliament in this area, many things have changed. There is an improvement in transparency. We are improving the fairness of taxation and trying to simplify the tax regime and improve cooperation between the Member States in the area of the exchange of information. There has been a significant improvement on a global level. I am not only talking about the BEP Initiative that is introducing new standards in this area globally, but also about upcoming work in the area of digital taxation. As a result of that, we are witnessing an improvement in transparency in taxation all around the world, but we should also be pushing to find good ways to modernise and strengthen tax systems in order to assure the fair collection of taxes.  At the same time, we must ensure that those who pay their fair share of taxes – especially SMEs – are not burdened by excessive red tape and that tax collection itself is not too costly and inefficient. Dramatic changes are also associated with the bigger role of digital taxation, and we must find a new concept of how to deal with the new situation in the economy. It’s a pity that the Council is not able to proceed with key initiatives in this area, including the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base (CCCTB) and digital taxation. I hope we will play a role in the global economy in an effort to find a good solution to the problems that emerge with the changes in the economy.  I must say that the TAX3 report is also a good example of finding agreement across the political spectrum. I am proud to be a part of finding this agreement. We don’t always agree on everything, and this is not surprising. I believe in common solutions in the areas where we cannot find solutions at the level of individual Member States and their governments, but I still believe that a significant part of taxation is the sole responsibility of the Member States and we should respect that, especially if it applies to the setting up of the minimum effective tax rate. I very much support the work of the OECD in this area, but I still don’t support the proposal made by Members to create an 18% minimum effective tax rate. I believe that many areas in the area of taxation are within the competence of Member States. But I would say that, in the majority of cases, we are able to find very strong common ground. I am glad that, after the Council, in cooperation with the Commission, introduced a list of non—cooperative third jurisdictions for tax purposes, the Commission also looked at the EU Member States and evaluated some indicators that suggest that aggressive tax planning is being facilitated by those countries. This is very important. I also very much appreciate – and I guess we all appreciate – the improved transparency in the work in the Council, especially in the light of changes in the behaviour of the Code of Conduct Group. I hope there will be a growing will among the Council Members to move forward on the most important issues that will improve the functionality of the single market.  Throughout the work of the TAX3 Committee, we dealt with many money—laundering issues. I regret that the Commission had to open the infringement procedure as no Member States transposed the Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive properly. Our legal framework is very strong to protect our financial system, but it will only work if it’s implemented properly. Unfortunately, we are not moving in this direction.  We also dealt with other issues, especially the issue of golden visas, where the Committee strongly believed that were only very limited, if any, benefits on the side of the Member States that provide this solution. That’s why, in our report, we call for golden visas and similar instruments to be banned and for an increase in transparency and due diligence requirements in the meantime before this will be fulfilled. Let me finish by thanking all my colleagues who worked on this report, especially Mr Kofod, our co—rapporteur, and the other shadow rapporteurs. I especially appreciate the work of the staff members of our teams and the members of Parliament’s Secretariat.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased with this opportunity, which will probably be the last for me in this Parliament to take stock of our common struggle for fairer taxation. First of all, I want to thank you and pay tribute to the work you have done, both enormous and meticulous, and to salute the rapporteurs. The TAX3 committee met thirty-four times, carried out five fact-finding missions, interviewed hundreds of experts and commissioned six studies on specific subjects, which were then meticulously analysed. The report we are debating today extends the work of the previous PANA Commission of Inquiry and concludes a 12-month term. Congratulations to this committee and congratulations to this Parliament for this very great work done. Over the past four years, I think we can say that our two institutions have become natural allies in the fight for fiscal justice. This latest report lays out a roadmap for this fight, with another Parliament, with probably another Commissioner, with another Commission in any case, to continue. I hope it will inspire us all. To open the debate, I would like to respond to the report's most emblematic recommendations in the area of combating fraud and tax evasion and money laundering. I have said a thousand times here: the international tax system is no longer adapted to the reality of the twenty-first century. Indeed, its rules do not allow us to grasp the mobile and immaterial nature of the new economic models, which is why it needs to be reformed urgently. Having said this, I regret that an agreement could not be reached on the proposed tax on digital services at the ecofin Council meeting on 12 March. However, I believe that this work has made good progress and that the support base, which was initially extremely limited, has in the end become extremely broad. I would add that they had a merit, effective already, which was to have accelerated the international discussions. It is now at this level that the work will continue and, of course, the European Union and the Commission will get involved. We know that these discussions will be centred around two main pillars that will go beyond the digital economy: the revision of the rules for the allocation of profits and taxed duties and the introduction of new minimum taxation rules. To weigh in on this discussion, and this is the will of the Union, we must bear in mind that we are not just a set of twenty-seven, and who knows, perhaps twenty-eight Member States. We represent an integrated market, rich in 500 million consumers, with a very high average purchasing power and this is our asset on the world stage. That is why the message I want to get out here is that it is imperative that we coordinate ahead of the G20 summit. It would be absurd if there were two, three, four or even five proposals coming from the European Union, that would weaken us. Speaking with one voice will enable the European Union to better defend its interests, to better assert its commitments: a simple tax system, conducive to investment, but also, and above all, fair taxation. Having regretted the failure of the digital tax, I am pleased that the Member States have reached an agreement for a European list of 15 jurisdictions considered non-cooperative. I would like to see an end to this perpetual self-denial which weakens the work of the European Union. Success, because it is one, is of course in the list, since as such it is credible. It is the most important list in the world. But the success lies mainly in the process, in the method of dialogue used, in the many reforms it has enabled. Dozens of jurisdictions around the world have cooperated with us and put in place real tax reforms, either to get off the list or to avoid entering it. Now the situation of countries that do not have a corporate tax or offer a zero rate is taken into account, both by the European Union - but again, we have influenced the international debate - and also by the OECD. I, of course, hear the criticisms about the selected countries and the absence of some Of the Member States that have been singled out in your TAX3 report. It is a matter of difference between us, on which I sometimes find it difficult to explain myself, or at least to make myself understood. I maintain that there are no tax havens in the European Union in the sense of international standards of good governance. To say otherwise actually weakens the effort we have done together to get the exchange of information across the European Union, for example. There has been progress in transparency. That's not enough to make everything perfect, I'm going to talk about tax black holes myself. Let us say that there are still a number of countries , and here we find ourselves - that have practices that are too supportive of tax optimisation or aggressive tax planning. In order to combat these aggressive intra-European tax practices, which I refute, which I refuse, which I condemn, we have other instruments than a list: European legislation, which we have considerably strengthened, the code of conduct, state aid procedures, the European Semester. There is a nuance between us, but in truth there is above all a very broad agreement. I believe that it is imperative that we strengthen these instruments and continue to improve our legislation in order to move towards more justice and more tax transparency in the European Union.  When taxes are not collected, we know that it is the most fragile, the most vulnerable, the poorest who are deprived of the public goods they need. And it is the consent to tax that is at risk. If the richest do not pay taxes, then why would we want the most modest to pay taxes? We can go even further to eliminate harmful tax practices. I am thinking first of all of the \"rulings\", the multinationals who abuse them to transfer their profits. In order to avoid this, we must ensure that our transparency rules are integrated into the day-to-day work of tax inspectors. Administrative cooperation must be strengthened, ensuring that Member States devote the necessary resources to it, as we are seeing with the recent scandal, the failure of cooperation has been able to create opportunities that have been duly exploited. I am also thinking of the tax advisors who play a key role in the development of aggressive tax planning arrangements. Together we have introduced rules aimed at improving transparency on these arrangements with regard to tax administrations from 1 July 2020, which will be accessible to the Union's tax administrations, this is a very significant step forward. Again, we will have to be very vigilant about implementation. Then I think about the fight against money laundering and the financing of terrorism. Under the leadership of my colleague, Vera Jourova, important progress has been made, whether it is the anti-money laundering directive or the right of access to information for Member States. Finally, I am thinking of the fight against VAT fraud. We have strengthened the power of national administrations to detect fraud early in the investigation, we have promoted the sharing and exploitation of tax and customs information, but also cooperation between Eurofisc agencies, Europol and Olaf. We will continue to make Eurofisc even more responsive, I believe that there is a path for the future that is very important. I do not want to be exhaustive here, your report is self-sufficient, but in conclusion I would like to dwell on an emblematic recommendation of the report, which is also for me a form of political message for the European elections, for the next Parliament, for the next Commission, for the Council in the future, it is the gradual transition to a qualified majority. Not only do I fully support this approach, but I support it by proposing to use the gateway clauses to achieve this. I see three reasons that make it not only necessary, but vital, to move from unanimity to qualified majority in tax matters.  Firstly, the European Union would thus have the capacity to react more quickly and effectively in an area where, as we know, the challenges are now global, where the expectations of Europeans are immense and where the unanimous vote is unquestionably a hindrance. Secondly, qualified majority voting would strengthen the democratic legitimacy of tax decisions taken in the European Union. The European Parliament, I know you are attached to it, would be a co-legislator of the interests of all Europeans because you are their voice, and they would be better represented. Finally, the scope of tax policy in Europe would be broadened. I talked about public goods: yes, we absolutely have to have an energy tax, the fight against climate change from corporate tax. I continue to advocate for the consolidated common corporate tax base, and for that we need qualified majority voting. We will also be able to pursue broader social objectives. I talked about environmental protection, I am also thinking of the regulation of financial markets. I therefore call on the European Parliament, but also the European political parties that make up it, to seize this proposal, to bring the debate to life, because this reform is also a way for your institution, not only to strengthen its powers, but to make heard a voice that Member States sometimes find difficult to listen to, that of the general European interest. And if tomorrow, in the next European Parliament, there is a majority as wide for this proposal as the one which today fights for the fight against fraud and tax evasion, then it will be a considerable step forward for democracy, for efficiency, and it will change profoundly, and the rules of the game and the game itself.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": null, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 31, "date": "2019-03-25.json", "name": "Werner LANGEN", "mepid": "1928", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Mr President, I would like to thank the I would first like to praise the report.

Money laundering has been, and unfortunately remains, a big problem within countries and across the European Union, and the fight against it is still a priority. I think the report has made a good road map of what should be improved. Cooperation with Financial Intelligence Units (FIUs) and also the Golden Visas issue have already been mentioned, but still there remain some differences which in my opinion could be fixed during the plenary vote this week. First, whereas the report appropriately condemns some banks for money laundering, it is clear that the problem is wider. My relevant amendments which noted the systemic issues of money laundering were voted down in committee and I think we can commit to this issue because it’s not only due to a few bad apples in a given year, or in a particular country or particular bank, but I think we have to understand that there are some kinds of areas in the banking sector which do some kinds of ‘pre-wash’, and some ‘main washes’ follow in other places in the European Union, unfortunately. Second, the report suggests that the EU should speak with one voice in the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).

Tax evasion is illegal and should be stopped. Tax avoidance, the limiting of tax exposure for companies and individuals, is perfectly legitimate. No one wants to pay more taxes than required. In British law, directors are obliged – obliged – to limit shareholders’ exposure to taxation. The purpose of business is to benefit the people who have worked and invested in companies, not to provide a pool of money for the excessive EU salaries and madcap social job creation schemes which do not work. Only business creates real long-term jobs, not state bureaucrats. Britain cuts bureaucracy to help small- and medium-sized businesses to build employment, which is why our small business sector is strong and unemployment low, unlike France – ask the gilet jaunes, Mr Moscovici, they don’t seem to agree with the way France is run.

It has been put forward by the Commission and it has been supported by the European Parliament and now we have to bring it into the international discussion in the OECD. The European Union has a united point of view which shows that apportionment of profit is a way to block the shifting of profits on paper, of shifting real activities. Second, there is ample evidence that at least five EU Member States are tax havens in everything but name, damaging other Members in the Union, depriving them of essential tax revenues. It is time to call a spade a spade, to call Luxembourg, Ireland, the Netherlands, Cyprus and Malta EU tax havens.

My group has tabled an amendment to this effect. It must be clear that we are working together across committees here, because we are all taking a different view of things.

Tax havens, the transfer of profits to tax havens, transparency, automatic information exchange, and we must also question this sacred cow of the European Union which is the total freedom of movement of capital, because the truth, and few admit it, but tax fraud or aggressive tax planning is inseparable from the capitalist system and expresses the class dominance of multinationals over political power.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "GUE/NGL", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Left-wing"}, {"id": 77, "date": "2019-03-25.json", "name": "Pierre MOSCOVICI", "mepid": "1983", "text": "   Member of the Commission. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for these dynamic exchanges, these many remarks which show your interest, and more than your interest, your involvement in these subjects. I believe that we can be collectively proud of the progress we have made in strengthening tax justice in the European Union. Since 2014, we have managed to get 14 proposals adopted, including 8 against fraud and tax evasion, despite the unanimous lock. That is more than the last 20 years and I think we do not have to be ashamed of that.  But, among the struggles that remain - because there are many left, as your report is very rich and like many parliamentarians, I would like to defend several ideas that I submit to the sagacity of those who will succeed us. First, to cut the patterns of transfer between companies within the internal market through an anti-abuse clause which I believe is absolutely necessary. Secondly, the idea of minimum taxation in discussions within the OECD seems to me, of course, to be studied but also to be defended.  Of course, we must continue to advocate for greater transparency in Member States' tax schemes - whether we call them tax havens or not, but the cause of transparency applies to everyone. There should no longer be any tax black holes or countries that may be suspected of practices that are too favourable to tax optimisation.  We must, of course, promote taxation that is fair and transparent for businesses. For me, this naturally requires the consolidated common corporate tax base, on which Paul Tang and Alain Lamassoure have worked remarkably during this mandate. We must continue the reform of VAT in order to put an end to the massive fraud that affects it. For extraterritorial VAT alone, between borders, it is 50 billion euros that are affected, of which we could easily make 40 billion savings per year. Finally, we must fight against aggressive planning between Member States. It is an important cause.  All this will require determination, ambition, combativeness on your part and ours, but also a change of rule. That is why we absolutely have to focus the debate on the passage of qualified majority voting. Again, it's not just a rule change, it's what makes it so much about changing the world, changing the air and finally being able to grasp the reality of today's taxation. This will also allow us to have an attractiveness in the world, because we are weakening if we are not able to create this fiscal sovereignty together.  For me, this must become a central theme of the European election campaign. I count on each and every one of you to defend this solution. I'll do it for me. I noted that it was defended on many benches from left to right. I am a realist, I know that it will take time to get this proposal passed because we have, unfortunately, the duty to seek unanimity in order to move from unanimity to qualified majority. Today, it is far from being met among the finance ministers who spoke about it for the first time in an Ecofin council. They will discuss it again in the coming weeks under the Romanian presidency. In any case, I fervently hope so, I ask it here in this chamber, in this Chamber. I have seen reluctance or resistance. To defeat them, we need the pressure of a Parliament, a Parliament that represents a people and that is why it is absolutely fundamental that we can position ourselves under the gaze of European citizens and influence the Member States. Many of you have noted your responsibility, I share that view. In any event, the Commission and the European Parliament will have to continue to fight side by side to promote tax justice in the coming campaign and beyond this campaign. They will be offensive and encourage all parties to seize this issue, to push them to make it a central topic of their programme for the Europe of tomorrow, to ensure that it is a common fight for fiscal justice that can continue in the future, especially in the next mandate.  But, since it will surely be my last speech, at least on this subject, in this mandate because I will still be there for the next or for the beginning of the next, I mean my conviction, after almost five years with you, that this is a subject that brings people together, which is one of the unifying subjects of the idea of Europe for tomorrow. It's true that there have always been expressions of sensitivity a very large majority, very broad, who express themselves in support of your reports to advocate for this cause. This cause has become that of the Europeans. She is the one that unites us and brings us together.  Finally, I would like to thank the European Parliament again for the great work it has done to move this great cause of transparency and tax evasion forward with us. We've done a lot. Much remains to be done. This is a fight that must continue and we will continue to do so together.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": null, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 78, "date": "2019-03-25.json", "name": "Jeppe KOFOD", "mepid": "124870", "text": "  Rapporteur. – Mr President, allow me first to thank all my colleagues for this very, very good and important debate and support for the report, and especially to thank Mr Niedermayer, my co-rapporteur, and all of the Members of the TAX3 committee and previous committees that worked so hard on tax issues and also financial crimes and money laundering. I also want to thank the Commission in particular, and now also Commissioner Moscovici but also Commissioner Jourová who is here. Thank you so much. We worked very closely with you on anti-money laundering, but also on tax, of course. On taxation, I want to say that we managed to get 14 new pieces of legislation through this term, but I think we have much more to do when it comes to fair taxation. Commissioner Moscovici, you are absolutely right. I think Europe has to show the way for a 21st-century corporate tax system that is fair to citizens, fair to Member States, and of course fair to businesses. I heard in the debate today from Mr Coburn that this is the punishment of big corporations, but the Commission itself revealed that small- and medium-sized enterprises have a tax burden 30% higher than multinational corporations, so if we want to ensure fairness and equal competition we need to do something about big corporations tax dodging. I always wanted to say that during our work we saw that if you are rich enough, or if you are a rich enough and big enough company, you put yourself above the law and the spirit of the law. I think that type of behaviour should not be tolerated. I think we in Parliament, as representatives of the people of Europe, should take a hard stance against the big corporations or ultra-rich people that we saw in the Panama Papers that were not only putting themselves before tax laws, but also before laws as such. So colleagues, I want to say thank you. I look forward to the vote tomorrow, but I think we have only just started our work.

Tax evasion, tax avoidance and financial crime have serious consequences for the European budget, unduly taking away resources intended to provide services to citizens. Furthermore, financial crime and money laundering, in addition to depriving states of tax revenues, distort fair competition between companies, and are sometimes exploited by terrorist networks and organised crime groups to finance their own illegal activities. I therefore believe that, in order to counter these serious threats, The Member States must further strengthen the exchange of information between national authorities, as well as fully implement the existing European anti-money laundering directives. Indeed, nowadays, technological developments facilitate the mobility of capital by allowing large sums of money to be moved from one country to another in a very short space of time. That is why I believe it is essential to strengthen cooperation between national FIUs and law enforcement authorities by setting up a European FIU to coordinate the flow of information. With a view to strengthening supervision at European level, I also believe that it is appropriate to extend the powers of the European Banking Authority (EBA) in the fight against money laundering, and also to establish a genuine financial police with investigative capacity within the Europol agency.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 81, "date": "2019-03-25.json", "name": "Pavel TELIČKA", "mepid": "124706", "text": "  The next item is the debate on the oral question to the Commission on the situation of rule of law and fight against corruption in the EU, specifically in Malta and Slovakia, tabled by Claude Moraes, on behalf of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (O-000015/2019 – B8—0017/2019) (2018/2965(RSP)).

We are discussing today the oral question and the draft resolution that we will vote on later this year. It has been drafted together with all the main political groups by the rule of law monitoring committee, and it is the result of almost a year, 10 months, of hearings, on-site visits, meetings, correspondence, video conferences with governments, with the police, public prosecutors, journalists, NGOs, experts, farmers and many, many more. I think that if we look at the text of the resolution as it is today, it focuses on Malta and Slovakia, but not exclusively. It is on the one hand highlighting concerns and criticisms and shortcomings, but I’m happy to say that it is also welcoming and noting some very positive developments, and I think the lesson that we can draw from this is that Europe works. It is clear that the intervention of the European Union helps the Member States come back on track where they risked running off the tracks when it comes to the rule of law and fundamental rights. The resolution makes a couple of recommendations which are also summarised in the questions to the Commission. We have some specific common recommendations on Malta and Slovakia. One is a recommendation to the European Commission, inviting the European Commission to start a rule-of-law dialogue with Malta. We think that that would be justified. At the same time, I also intend to put forward amendments recognising the fact that the Maltese Government has now announced that they will implement the recommendations of the Venice Commission – but nevertheless, I think a dialogue would be appropriate. We would also recommend that the brain behind the murder of Daphne Caruana Galizia is caught. Not just the people who committed the murder, but also the brain behind it. And we also have a general call to end the scheme of golden visas and golden passports, not just in Malta but in all Member States. With regard to Slovakia, we note that the probable brain behind the murder has not only been caught but also charged with, amongst other things, the murder of Jan and Martina and I’m happy to say that further inquiries into corruption and connections with organised crime are being conducted. Nevertheless, some concerns remain concerning the so-called system of revolving doors. We see some of the people who stepped down actually coming back in other jobs. And we would also urge the Slovak Government to end the deadlock in the nominations to the Constitutional Court, and to refrain from adopting the new media law. And finally, there are some general recommendations to all of us. First of all, it has become clear to me in the course of the work of the rule of law monitoring group that we need to strengthen Europol because now Europol can now basically only do its job when it is invited by the Member States. People will say, yes, that’s subsidiarity. But we also see that when public authorities themselves are engaging in wrongdoing, we should have the means, as the European Union, to come in. Why? Because we are a system all together. If one of the Member States undermines the rule of law, if one of the Member States doesn’t apply our common rules and standards, then basically the whole European system is broken. So I think we have every reason to strengthen that system and strengthen Europol. I would also call on the Commission to reinstate its annual corruption report, because we don’t feel that the current formula in the European semester is strong enough. And finally, we would urge the Commission, in particular Mr Timmermans who is not here today, to finally respond to the call, the repeated calls, of the European Parliament for a comprehensive mechanism, the so-called DRF pact – the democracy, rule of law and fundamental rights pact. And I see that neither Spitzenkandidat, Mr Weber and Mr Timmermans, is really committed to a comprehensive, non-political objective mechanism, and the Member States only want a peer review mechanism.

The Commission has taken action by initiating, for the first time, the procedure set out in Article 7 of the Treaty in relation to the actions of the Polish Government. The European Parliament initiated the procedure in relation to the actions of the Hungarian Government. The Commission has used its role of guardian of the Treaties by launching a number of infringement proceedings related to the rule of law. All EU Member States are monitored by the Commission in the context of the European semester. In 2019 the Country Report on Slovakia stresses, in particular, that long-standing concerns regarding the independence of the judiciary remain largely unchanged and do not appear to have been addressed. The 2019 Country Report on Malta underlines that recent reforms have not fully ensured the independence of the judiciary, as also confirmed by the Venice Commission of the Council of Europe, and I agree that we have to continue the dialogue with Malta, and we will do so. The European semester assessment also increasingly prioritises the fight against corruption. This is important for our economy and society. Since 2015, Slovakia has received recommendations on fighting corruption on a regular basis. The Commission raised concerns about the accountability of the police and the low number of criminal prosecutions, as well as the insufficient protection offered to whistle-blowers. As for Malta, the Commission is concerned about the lack of efficiency in handling high-profile corruption cases at both the level of investigation and prosecution. The Commission addresses these recommendations on a yearly basis with both countries. Let me now turn to the safety of journalists and media freedom. As regards safety of journalists, the Commission stands firm on the protection of freedom of expression and media freedom. Democracy cannot survive if journalists are no longer able to report freely, if they are intimidated, harassed, threatened or even killed for doing their job. It is crucial that the masterminds of the assassinations of Daphne Caruana Galizia and Ján Kuciak and his fiancée, Martina Kušnírová, are brought to justice. Law enforcement and police investigations into individual crimes remain an individual Member State competence, but Member States have a number of obligations when investigating such crimes. They also have positive obligations to create favourable conditions so that freedom of expression can be effectively exercised. I have to repeat again exactly what I offered both to Malta and Slovakia, that our agencies Europol and Eurojust are fully available to support the investigation into those horrible case. Now let me turn to the investor citizens schemes and investor resident schemes. As regards investor citizenship and resident schemes in the EU, the Commission adopted a comprehensive report on 23 January 2019. As a next step, the Commission proposes to set up a group of experts from the Member States to look into the specific risks that arise from investor citizenship schemes. This group will develop, by the end of this year, a common set of security checks for investor citizenship schemes. The Commission intends to present in June an initiative on further strengthening the rule of law within the Union. To prepare this, the Commission intends to adopt a communication on the state of play and the possible next steps for further strengthening the rule of law in the Union, with the objective of consulting all institutions and interested parties. The work of the European Parliament is particularly relevant to feed the reflection on the future initiative. The Commission will take due account of the resolution on an EU pact on democracy, the rule of law and fundamental rights. In this context, it will also consider proposals including those relating to the use of possible peer-review mechanisms on the rule of law.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": null, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 84, "date": "2019-03-25.json", "name": "Roberta METSOLA", "mepid": "118859", "text": "  f'isem group PPE. – Jiena kburija b'pajjiżi, kburija bil-poplu Malti, kburija li aħna membri tal-Unjoni Ewropea, ta' din l-unjoni ta' valuri.

Trust is only possible if rules are respected, corruption and political arbitrariness are prevented and freedom of expression is respected. This applies not only within the state, but also intergovernmentally. Concern about developments in individual Member States is therefore not interference in internal affairs, but rather a pan-European responsibility.  In many Member States, there is cause for concern as to whether this basic understanding is actually being respected. In the case of Poland and Hungary, article 7 procedures are already under way. In Malta and Slovakia, the murders of Daphne Galizia and Jen Kuciak, who were on the trail of the criminal dimensions of corruption in their countries, have unsettled the European public.  Our working group has worked intensively on the process of investigating these crimes and the structures in the judicial system of the countries concerned. The question of whether this is a systematic violation of the rule of law was also decisive. In both countries, there are indeed structural problems. In the case of Malta, therefore, the Venice Commission has also been tried, and its proposals are also being taken up. The European added value of Europol's activities should also be highlighted positively. Unfortunately, there are also legitimate doubts as to whether the consequences are truly sustainable – both in terms of the independence of the judiciary and the freedom of the press.  We must not let up right now. We need a European awareness of the rule of law.

I led the mission to Malta after the murder of Daphne Caruana Galizia. I find it unbearable that the assassination officers have not yet been arrested and that perhaps, and I fear, the release of the performers is being prepared, because the investigation is blocked by Prime Minister Joseph Muscat who commands the police and the attorney general.  Because there is indeed no separation of powers in Malta and that is why they are now making the such changes that my colleague Miriam Dalli spoke of. In Malta, as in Slovakia, everything points to the mafia's capture of the government behind these murders, the murders of Daphne, Jan and Martina.

We spoke about the rule of law and freedom of the media. We didn’t speak so much about the necessary space for civil society, which is also part of the same thing. Whenever we see a worsening of the situation in a Member State, we see that it usually refers to all three of these pillars, which we should pay attention to. I will now stay more with the rule of law principle and the mechanisms the Commission uses to uphold and monitor the rule of law in the Member States. As I said before, we use the whole toolbox and all the instruments available. We launched Article 7 for the first time. We are covering this important issue in the European Semester. We use infringements where possible and where needed, and we also use something which I didn’t mention at the beginning, the Justice Scoreboard, which is a very useful yearly benchmarking exercise and shows, among other things, how the people, the citizens and the businesses in all the countries grasp and perceive the independence and quality of the judiciary system. We are also newly adding the criteria of how the fight against corruption is done in the Member States. So these are all the instruments we have in our toolbox. Let me now say a few words about the new initiatives. As I said at the beginning, we plan the communication on the rule of law to clarify what we mean by the rule of law – that it is not purely a Member State issue, but is a European issue which has been covered by the recent case law of the European Court of Justice and which will be fully reflected in our communication on the rule of law. Another initiative is the linking of the rule of law with the new budget. I think that this should also be mentioned here. We also adopted the new initiative on the protection of whistle—blowers and, last but not least, the European Public Prosecutor’s Office, which should start working from 2020, is a very important contribution to the fight against corruption and financial crime related to EU money. This is a long list of initiatives. We need to enforce the law, to bring all these initiatives to life and to explain to the citizens of the EU why we are doing this and why it is very important. I spoke about the need to uphold the rule of law and to run all these initiatives from the side of the European Union. At the same time, as a citizen of the Czech Republic, I would like to add that maybe I feel a similar thing to some of you, namely that we should trust more the people living in our countries and our Member States, that there are democrats and that they have enhanced a way to solve the problems. They should not be put aside. We should trust them and we should trust the active citizens. That’s why I also mentioned civil society organisations and the active citizens who raise their voices and express their dissatisfaction if something is wrong in their country. I am not calling for demonstrations, I’m not calling for riots, I just say we should trust more the people living in our Member States because they are democrats and they know what to do – among other things, to go to the elections and vote for democratic powers.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": null, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 105, "date": "2019-03-25.json", "name": "Pavel TELIČKA", "mepid": "124706", "text": "  The debate is closed.

Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating Mr In a few days, we're going to change the clock for daylight saving time again. It will be the second time in the last six months that we are changing our clocks. We have had this change of time, which we have been carrying out twice a year, for decades. The purpose when the time change was introduced was to save energy. But that's no longer the case. With new technologies and other living habits, we earn nothing from the transition. We don't save energy.  I have been an MEP for ten years and during these years I have received countless emails and letters and calls from people on a variety of issues. But one of the issues that has come back at regular intervals is that you feel bad about the time change. Those affected, affected differently. For some it is not so much trouble, others react very strongly. It is mainly vulnerable groups such as children, the elderly, long-term sufferers and groups that already have physical, and perhaps sometimes mental, problems that suffer from the transition. Against this background, it is very reasonable for us to review the seasonal time change system. It doesn't save energy. It is likely to lead to a negative impact on many people.  Starting with the fundraisers and citizens' initiatives of people in different EU countries, we in the European Parliament have been given the views and experiences of very many citizens. In fact, there is no other subject that has touched and involved so many European citizens – ordinary European citizens who are not deeply involved in politics – as the change of time. Lots of people get in touch. They do so in letters to us in the European Parliament, they did so through a survey carried out by the Commission last year. It is about millions of Europeans. And then it is actually time that we, as elected representatives, listen to these reactions.  In the last six months, when we switched to winter time, I have been working on a proposal to abolish the change of time. It has since been prepared and voted through in seven of Parliament's various committees, which also shows, among other things, how many areas are affected by this change of time. The proposal now is that we should abolish the change of time in autumn 2021. It gives citizens a very clear message that we have listened and, at the same time, we also give clear information to the parties concerned that our internal market should have plenty of time to change and not be adversely affected. It must be done in an organised manner, this conversion, so that we continue to have a well-functioning internal market in terms of transport and a lot of other things.  The abolition means that EU Member States must decide on what permanent standard time they should choose to have accordingly. This must, of course, also be done in an organised and coordinated manner. Of course, we must not create a patchwork of different times in Europe.

As you are aware, the Commission decided last year to propose the discontinuation of the seasonal time change. This was done in response to calls from this Parliament, from several Member States and from many citizens that have been writing to me and to other Commissioners during our mandate. Available evidence suggested that the justification for the time change arrangement currently applicable has become irrelevant. It is equally clear that a discontinuation would help to make people’s lives easier and deal with some health issues that have been related to the current system.  The results of the Commission’s public consultation are very straightforward: 4.6 million Europeans responded, of which 84% supported the abolishment of the clock change. In this context, we very much appreciate the support given by the rapporteur and the Committee on Transport and Tourism (TRAN) for stopping the changing of clocks in the EU twice a year.  As you know, the Commission has been deliberately very ambitious and proposed to see the last seasonal time change already this year. However, given that the Council has not yet established its own position, we recognise that it becomes impossible to meet such a deadline. I therefore take good note of your report’s position in favour of stopping seasonal time changes in 2021. Allow me to comment further on some of the amendments tabled, which we see as more challenging. First, you have proposed to introduce a new coordination network involving Member States and the Commission to discuss jointly and assess Member States’ decisions on standard time and their impact on the internal market, and if the Commission considers that the choice of a Member State would significantly affect the proper functioning of the internal market, the Member State in question would have the obligation to defend its choice and explain how it will address its negative impact. The Commission sees very well the intention behind such amendments and shares the view that an adequate coordination between Member States is necessary. However, the choice of standard time is a Member State prerogative. There is no change here. The decision on standard time has always been taken at national level.  The Commission cannot support new legal provisions in the directive that would not be in line with this division of responsibilities between the EU and Member States and would not respect the principle of subsidiarity. This being said, I would like to reassure you that I know from my discussions with Member States so far that all of them see as clearly as we do the need for a coordinated approach. I am confident that they will choose their respective standard time in a responsible and coordinated manner. No one wants to see a patchwork of time zones within EU.  Secondly, the Commission has legal concerns with the proposed empowerment to postpone the application of the new arrangements via a delegated act. Such an empowerment should in principle only relate to non—essential elements, while the entry into force is clearly an essential element of the proposal. To conclude, let me thank you once more for all your constructive work. I now look forward to the debate and to your vote. Indeed, having the European Parliament adopting its position before the parliamentary recess will sent a very clear and strong message to Council that this House is ready to take this proposal forward towards a successful outcome.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": null, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 111, "date": "2019-03-25.json", "name": "Bolesław G.

More addition, this change has economic aspects on which I do not wish to comment, because they are probably very complex, especially with regard to the various activities of the common market. However, as rapporteur for the ENVI opinion, I would like to stop for a moment on health issues.  Firstly, all the studies in this area, also carried out within the framework of the new discipline of chronobiology, as well as public health statistics, such as the increased number of heart attacks, suicides, road accidents that occur during this period, support the fact that this is a phenomenon for public health and the health of the citizen. The ENVI Committee therefore supported the position that the seasonal time change should be abandoned as soon as possible and the European Union directive on the matter should be repealed.

The majority in the Committee on Industry has also clearly argued in favour of abolishing the time change in Europe.

And that is exactly the meaning of the agreement reached by the Committee on Transport to end, without haste but without pause, these seasonal time changes.  Without haste, because we have agreed to give two more years to allow the States of the Union to decide whether they opt for their daylight saving time or winter time, in an orderly and transparent manner; in a hurry, because we have designed coordination and evaluation mechanisms to ensure that decisions taken do not create dangerous new distortions in the internal market and its basic services.  Without pause, because many of us agree that biannual changes must end. There is a lot of evidence to support that these changes can harm, more than we thought, the health of Europeans, particularly that of the younger and the older. And it is also clear that they do not contribute to energy savings in the terms that motivated their implementation.  It is therefore a good idea to launch an evaluation committee between States and Community authorities which analyses, from April next year, the timetable proposals of each State and identifies, prevenges and helps to avoid possible problems. After this stage of pre-evaluation, seasonal time changes will end in an orderly manner by 2021.  The agreement also provides for extensive assessments which will make it possible to verify that what we have decided does not actually produce more problems than it intended to solve. Following this roadmap, we need to show the 4,600 000 citizens who participated in this public consultation that the European institutions listen, which are nearby, that they work seriously and rigorously on citizen concerns and that they are trying to play their part: to inform the the other, to moderate between countered positions and to decide, trying to set balanced positions with transparency.

Furthermore, this directive would have an unreliable and unclear effect on many cross-cutting sectors such as agriculture, trade, where competition could be distorted, and energy, which could see an exponential increase in annual consumption. In fact, the adoption of summer time in the summer months results in considerable savings in terms of electricity used each year within the Union, and the adoption of this bill could be extremely damaging in this regard. Another aspect that is not acceptable is the discretion left to the Member States in deciding on the time regime that they consider most appropriate, as a harmonised framework at European level is appropriate both internally and in relations with third countries.

It also appears that if this summer choice were endorsed by some countries, these inconveniences would persist with serious consequences on human, animal and plant physiology.

It is clear that the end of schedule changes is a necessity that must be accompanied by real, stable and sustainable coordination. But, again, by legitimately leaving the choice to each Member State to determine its daily schedules, the European Union opens the door to difficulties as only Europe knows how to create them when it builds and deconstructs in areas where it would have been well advised not to venture.  By trying to interfere in all the everyday acts of Europeans' daily lives, always in the name of their well-being, the Europe of Brussels has built brakes.

I welcome the change and I would like us to stop moving the clock as soon as possible. The reasons for this are not just economic. First and forth, there must be a man and the question of what artificially changing time means for his physical and mental health. Research warns of a higher risk in people with heart disease and a higher chance of heart attack. Problems arise in adapting to human biological rhythm. People are deprived of sleep, their ability to concentrate decreases, there are more accidents at work. Tired or sleepless drivers cause traffic accidents during the first period after changing the clock. Although it is only an hour's difference, this can have negative consequences for people's overall well-being. Obviously there are reasons to stop moving the clock, and that is what the citizens want. However, the transition to the new regime must not cause further difficulties. The proposal aims to make people's lives easier. No one wants ten neighbouring countries to have 10 different time arrangements under the new 10 different arrangements.

Before I comment further, please allow me to clarify one very important point. It is a national prerogative to decide on the time zone – today, already, it exists. As it was pointed out today, we have three times already in the EU and this does not represent any disturbance to the internal market. I would very much appreciate it if you take this into consideration when you are commenting on this topic. While I am still noticing some resistance in your comments, I see that after a long and thorough examination, you are ready to adopt your final position in line with the original proposal that was made last year. This is a very important message to European citizens because the response to the questionnaire about the time change was almost ten times bigger than the response to any other questionnaire and any other any other consultation we ever had at EU level. So people do care. We are obliged to respond. This issue can be seen as more complicated than one would expect at first sight. This is mainly due to the division of competences between Member States and the Union, and that is today. This is not something that the Commission came up with for the purpose of this file. It is really important to recognise this division and respect it while making decisions. As I already said, the Commission will ensure, within its powers, a close monitoring of the implementation of this Directive and we will work together to avoid any transitional disruptions for European citizens and economic operators. I am personally very confident that each of the Member States is equally aware of this and they will make well-considered and coordinated choices in the months to come. But it is their choice. All the Commission has in its power is to make sure that we all make decisions at the same time. This is something we will exercise. I even encourage Member States, in order to be sure which time to choose, to do the national consultations and I believe that the time that you envisioned will be sufficient time to carry them out in a democratic, open and transparent way. At the end, let me thank you, one more time, all of you – rapporteur and Members – that you dedicated your time to this file, and by adopting your position, this House will be ready to start the negotiations with the Council after the recess. I am sure this will lead to a swift outcome, most likely already under the Finnish Presidency.

Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating Mr Thank you very much to everyone who has used the opportunity to think freely and loudly on this issue. It is an extremely exciting debate, one of the most interesting people I have listened to and participated in for at least the last few years in the European Parliament. That says a lot about commitment, because it is a comprehensible question.  It is also a question of the Committee on Transport, which is such a practical committee, of course, never coming up with an adventurous proposal which in any way disrupted the internal market. I do not know, I am an old Minister of Culture from the beginning, if we had given the assignment to the Committee on Culture, it might have been a bit adventurous, but the Transport Committee is a committee that stands with both feet on the ground. This is about removing the time change that does not produce the energy-saving effect that we thought quite a long time ago. Instead, we shall now go back to an order whereby, as usual, the countries must coordinate. And then we have a time zone, we have an affinity temporally, which means that we continue to operate without interference. This is not a revolution, nor is it federalism, it is a very practical measure that will perhaps save money in addition, but which will be good for human health – and that is what makes us involved in this issue. So I would like to thank you all for an incredibly exciting debate. It has been very valuable listening to it. I feel like this could be something really, really good.

In addition to the general concern about the changes in time that I see among citizens in my surroundings, I based my decision primarily on scientific evidence, which has been discussed many times in the European Parliament, for the first time back in March 2015. The discussion has confirmed to me that changing time brings more difficulties than advantages. At the beginning of the last century, when the rotation of summer and winter time was introduced in various European countries, economic savings were the main motive. However, according to scientific reports, these assumptions have not been confirmed and in fact the savings are marginal. Similarly, there were predictions that changing time would reduce the number of traffic accidents caused by lack of daylight. However, studies show that the number of accidents during the spring time change has increased, in the context of shortened sleep of drivers.

The European Executive understood that there must be harmonisation at European level in this respect, and I believe that abolishing this practice will be positive for all Member States.", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 159, "date": "2019-03-25.json", "name": "David Maria SASSOLI", "mepid": "96864", "text": "   The next item is the joint debate on the report by Jerzy Buzek. on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the internal market in electricity (COM(2016)0864 - C8-0495/2016 - 2016/0380(COD)) (A8-0044/2018), – the report by Jerzy Buzek, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the internal market in electricity (COM(2016)0861 - C8-0492/2016 - 2016/0379(COD) (A8-0042/2018) – the report by Morten Helveg Petersen, name of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a European Union Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (COM(2016)0863 - C8-0494/2016 - 2016/0378(COD)) (A8-0040/2018) , and – the report by Flavio Zanonato, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, research and energy, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on risk preparedness in the electricity sector and repealing Directive 2005/89/EC (COM(2016)0862 - C8-0493/2016 - 2016/0377(COD) (A8-0039/2018)", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": null, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 160, "date": "2019-03-25.json", "name": "Martina WERNER", "mepid": "124826", "text": "  Deputy rapporteur. Mr President, Commissioner Arias Caete, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Arias Caete, for the work he has done on this report. Today I have the honour of representing my colleague Jerzy Buzek, our rapporteur on electricity market design. Parliament's actual rapporteur, Mr Karié, has successfully concluded the negotiations with the Council and the Commission, but is now Prime Minister in Latvia, and therefore, logically, he cannot be here today. However, I would nevertheless like to take this opportunity to express my sincere thanks for his commitment, for his conduct in the negotiations and for the very good cooperation. The European Commission published its proposals on the clean energy package in November 2016. The two dossiers on the new electricity market design are the most comprehensive, if not the most far-reaching, of the entire package. What exactly is it all about? The regulation introduces new rules for the European electricity market. The electricity market has changed enormously in recent years. The roles of individual market participants, from producers to consumers, have also changed enormously. It was therefore necessary to reshape the European electricity market and make it fit for the energy transition. In the electricity market of the future, electricity must increasingly be produced on a decentralised basis, investments must be made in sustainable energy sources, and the electricity markets, which are still nationally oriented, must cooperate much more closely regionally. Consumers have a central role to play in the future electricity market. That is what the directive will focus on. From now on, electricity customers will be able to actively participate. However, the directive also aims to strengthen consumer protection. To give a very concrete example, electricity customers will in future receive invoices, which they will then understand immediately. You probably all know this: Until you get the relevant information on the electricity bill, you have to scroll a few pages and then probably look in the footnotes. From now on, the most important information will appear bundled on the first page. In addition, certified websites will be available in all Member States, so that every single European can also compare the different electricity tariffs and then choose the right one for themselves. The European Parliament has attached particular importance to ensuring that vulnerable electricity customers are not neglected. Energy poverty is also a reality in the EU today, and it is precisely for this reason that the Member States are obliged to monitor very closely whether their national measures are sufficient to support people affected by energy poverty. I would particularly like to thank my colleagues from the European Commission, who, with their expertise, have also made a decisive contribution to the successful conclusion of this dossier. Many thanks also to you, Commissioner Arias Caete, for the always very constructive exchange, even in really difficult negotiations.  The Austrian Presidency has also made an enormous contribution to ensuring that we can finally vote on this report tomorrow. We only needed six trilogues in total. Well – the penultimate time we negotiated for 17 hours and then 16 hours in the last trialogue. Nevertheless, this is, of course, an enormous achievement, that this extensive dossier of really controversial issues within the Austrian Presidency has then led to success.  I would like to take this opportunity, and finally also to my colleagues, for their trusting and very constructive cooperation, including our staff from the ITRE Secretariat and all the other services in Parliament, the political advisers, the individual groups, and, of course, I would also like to thank the assistants in particular for their efforts. Together, we have achieved a great deal for the European energy transition and for the citizens of the EU.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": null, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 161, "date": "2019-03-25.json", "name": "Morten PETERSEN", "mepid": "124872", "text": "   Rapporteur. Mr President! I would also like to start by thanking everyone who has been involved in the negotiations here: the Commission, the Council of Ministers and, above all, all the good colleagues here from the European Parliament. We've spent a lot of hours together, negotiated whole nights away. But I think we have achieved a series of achievements that we can be proud of. We should also have done so, because my fear is that we are - and we risk being - losing the climate fight if we are not ambitious enough! We must be here in the European Parliament, and we must be among the governments across Europe. The paradox is that while politicians are hesitant, citizens are taking to the streets and demanding action. We see how teenagers across Europe are demonstrating for a better climate and demanding solutions to the climate change that will send people fleeing droughts and floods in the coming years. They are demanding solutions to the air pollution caused by the deaths of 400 000 Europeans every year.  Too many governments are stuck in narrow national interests blocking the important green transition, and the negotiations on the large energy package are unfortunately a good example of this, because although wind and solar are now cheaper than coal, the green transition to renewable energy is still going too slowly. Although a stronger joint agency, ACER, can help ensure that wind energy from the North Sea can give Europe green power in its sockets, many governments still prefer to keep old coal power stations alive. In our debates it was clear when we in the European Parliament tried to reinforce ACER, then there were national governments that tried to water down, and when we fought for a more independent ACER, there were some who resisted. It was a struggle to give ACER more powers and resources, and it still is, but fortunately we were able to set up ACER to charge fees, which is absolutely essential for ACER to carry out its important tasks.  The types of matches are of course a big problem, because the lack of common solutions is done at the expense of the climate. We also saw this in the negotiations on the electricity market regulation, where there were Member States fighting against open and free borders on energy. But only by integrating renewable energy across borders can we win the climate fight. Fortunately, we landed a good result - sometimes not so much because of the Council as it is despite the Council. Let me be very clear: the fight against climate change is the most important fight! That is precisely why it is so unfortunate that there are many heads of government who suffer from what I would call a green amnesia. They say one thing in Paris when they sign fine declarations, but then when they sit at the negotiating table in Brussels, everything can suddenly be forgotten! Unfortunately, we saw this last week when our heads of government met at the summit to shake hands on a carbon-neutral Europe by 2050. Unfortunately, it was only by the talk! But Europe must take the lead in the green transition and in the climate fight, and we must invest far more in research and new technologies than we do today. The money can be appropriately found by coming up with climate taxes on plastics and on fuel for aircraft and on coal for me, and it is time we put pressure on those governments that do not live up to any agreements they may make. I would like to thank once again all those who have been involved in all the negotiations we have been through: the Commission, the Council of Ministers and, above all, colleagues here in the European Parliament. I think we should remember that in two months' time we will be asking our citizens to go out and vote. As politicians, we cannot and must not ignore the citizens' demands to take the climate fight seriously. We must be inspired by the popular movements and take responsibility.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when we took the first steps on this crucial package of proposals for energy union, many months ago now, we knew that the path would not be easy. There were many interests at stake and resistance on the road to integration between energy markets. Well, although the path has in some ways been even more tortuous than expected, it is thanks to this frank and close confrontation, first in Parliament then in the trialogues, that the points of fall in negotiations and the best legislative solutions have been consolidated. In the area of risk management in the electricity sector, the result I proudly claim rewards the work of this Parliament on all the substantive aspects of the proposal. Let us remember the subject: today, when there is a sudden interruption in the supply of electricity – and this can happen for a dramatic event, a climatic event, a terrorist event, a particular overload, a rupture – the Member States are left to their own devices and to the good heart – let me pass this expression – of neighbouring countries, where interconnections allow this. The dynamic, as demonstrated by the winter 2017 crisis in south-east Europe, affects European citizens because it affects the usability of services, energy prices, the financial balance of households and industrial production. The question was, and is, how to promote - under conditions of energy crisis - the circulation of energy under certain conditions to where it is most needed in the Union, regardless of national political boundaries. As a Parliament, therefore, we had a task for everyone, namely to ensure that the criteria for mutual cooperation in the event of an energy crisis were properly stringent, both in terms of methodologies for assessing scenarios between countries and countries, and therefore on the principle of interoperability, as well as on the criteria for mutual assistance. I must acknowledge the Council's determination to defend its demands, without neglecting its willingness to dialogue towards compromise, and the Commission the invaluable mediation work at certain decisive stages of the negotiations, without whose contribution we would not have reached a framework agreement so soon. The text for the vote in this House therefore goes in the direction that Parliament wants. As for the definition of methodologies, which serve to frame crisis scenarios country by country and subsequently to allow interventions in the event of crises, these must be homogeneous, drawn up in accordance with a single model and free from the constraints of non-institutional market players. On the other hand, with regard to the principle of mutual assistance, it is reaffirmed in even more stringent terms, when it is specified that the only element which is recognised in the member states' mutual assistance obligations is only necessary and only if there is no infrastructure, where interconnections therefore allow it. The Member States have a duty to assist each other. There are also more detailed guidelines for the definition of compensation criteria, the nature of which is, however, left to the free will of the respective national authorities. We ran the risk of these negotiations becoming the instrument for changing the balance in the negotiations on the other dossiers of the package, a danger of which we were – I was also aware – well aware but which, I believe, we have overcome, also thanks to the fruitful cooperation with the other fellow rapporteurs. I would like to thank President Busek very much, who has given skilful coordination in the negotiations, my fellow shadow rapporteurs for truly excellent cooperation throughout the stages of this dossier, and Commissioner Cañete, who has worked very well with us.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": null, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 163, "date": "2019-03-25.json", "name": "Miguel ARIAS CAÑETE", "mepid": "1351", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, it’s a real pleasure to be here today to discuss the concluding building blocks of our Clean Energy for all Europeans package. These four legislative acts – the Electricity Regulation, the Electricity Directive, the Risk-Preparedness Regulation and the new rules for the Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators (ACER) – are the final pieces in the jigsaw. With this, we are completing the biggest legislative package the European Union has ever had on energy policy, and we are finalising a new, modern rulebook for the energy sector across our continent which is fit for the challenges ahead. I thank the European Parliament for its strong support throughout the constructive negotiations. This allowed us to secure a political agreement last December. My special thanks reach out in particular to the rapporteurs: Krišjānis Kariņš, whom I congratulate once more for having become Prime Minister of Latvia in January this year; Flavio Zanonato; and Morten Helveg Petersen. Of course, I would also like to thank Jerzy Buzek, Chair of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, all political group coordinators, and all the shadow rapporteurs involved, without whom these agreements would not have been possible. This close cooperation has made it possible to preserve the complementarity and the consistency of these proposals. We have agreed an ambitious package which will take us one step closer to the completion of the Energy Union. This was one of the priorities of the Juncker Commission that you endorsed almost five years ago. Taken together, the agreed legislation will ensure that the European Union electricity market is more secure, more sustainable and more competitive. In short, these new laws are good for consumers, good for the economy and good for the planet. From a consumer perspective, it is the first time that European energy legislation has included so many measures to protect and to empower consumers. Consumers can become active players and individually benefit and drive the energy transition. This is essential. The cleaner energy transition will not succeed unless we take consumers along and win broad societal support. Through our energy market legislation, consumers will gain better information. Household bills will become clearer so that consumers can better understand what they are paying for. Switching will become easier and faster. In principle, it will become possible within 24 hours as of 2026. Easily-understandable comparison tools will help consumers make rational choices and benefit from lower prices. In this context, I have to mention that the Commission will transmit for the minutes a declaration as regards alternative dispute resolution and on how we will assess the effectiveness of such mechanisms. Smart meters will help consumers save energy through adapted consumption and reaction to market prices. Again, this will help them to save money and benefit directly from more competitive markets. Consumers can become prosumers and can invest in global generation, consume, store or sell electricity to the market. They can do this individually or collectively. For the first time, the new legislation recognises the concept of citizens’ energy communities. With these measures, we will follow up on our pledge to put the consumer at the heart of the Energy Union. The new rules bring advantage also from a wider economic perspective. The rules on the electricity market will make markets more integrated and more flexible. The market will deliver better signals to prompt and enable more investment, in particular in clean and flexible solutions. This in turn will not only have a direct positive impact on the electricity price, it will also create more growth and jobs. We have reinforced regional cooperation and the rules to keep cross-border capacity open for trade. This will bring us a step further towards integrating national markets into a true internal electricity market, which is a precondition for a cost-effective decarbonisation of the power system. The same holds true for the new common framework on capacity mechanisms. This will ensure that such mechanisms will only be used where needed, and if so, that they will be open across borders. This will bring considerable economic efficiency gains. In this context, I have to mention that the Commission will transmit a declaration for the Minutes as regards the ambitious opinion of reform implementation plans, which may be in the context of state aid assessment or separate. Furthermore, the Commission will transmit a declaration as regards the definition of interconnectors, highlighting the difference between electricity and gas. Finally, energy security is vital for our business and economy. With the challenges of the energy transition, we must also ensure security of supply for the economy and for our citizens. The new Risk-Preparedness Regulation will make our system more resilient and will ensure better coordination among Member States and introduce a spirit of solidarity. I come now to my third point: to consider what the new electricity market design brings for the environment and sustainability in a more long-term perspective. We have already agreed ambitious targets for renewable energy and energy efficiency, and the new market design will make a major contribution towards achieving this and will help us to meet our Paris Agreement commitments. The markets will become more flexible, more free for increasing sales of renewable electricity. At the same time, with the new emission limit in future capacity mechanisms we will ensure that the solutions to our security of supply are consistent with our climate objectives. The agreed transition arrangements are realistic, and we will allow all players to adapt to these new requirements. All of the above will help European industry and economy by giving a clear sense of direction, but it will also reduce local air pollution for the benefit of our citizens. We know that our new rules are looked at with great interest also in other parts of the world. I want to underline again that, with this package of measures, we are the first party to the Paris Agreement to have adopted all necessary domestic legislation for fulfilling our commitments. At the same time, it puts us in a good position for the upcoming discussion on the long-term strategy. Thanks to your help, the European Union is showing a clear path for the rest of the world to follow.

It is not enough, however, to move forward. We need to take into account the choices and how they ensure the Union's leadership in the energy transition, industrial competitiveness and people's access to clean, healthy and affordable electricity. We must also ensure the principle of energy efficiency, first of all, to ensure a fair transition, to strengthen transparency and market regulation capacity and to give priority to dispatching production on the basis of renewable sources in order to reduce emissions.

It has to be a market where you can compete with fair standards in a transparent and coordinated way, without assing safety and innovation.

With the result, the new electricity market design, we are today setting the course for a decentralised, sustainable and secure power supply, so that the energy transition can also be achieved at European level.  The choice of energy sources naturally plays a central role in this. Renewables are the energy sources of the future. That is why, as negotiator for my group, I have also worked to ensure that electricity from renewable energy sources is first fed into the grids by means of feed-in priority and, in the event of bottlenecks, also switched off as the last. At the same time, we have ensured that emission-intensive energy sources, such as coal, will no longer be supported by state subsidies in the future. And we Social Democrats have also managed to ensure that citizens' energy cooperatives are given preferential treatment in future and are not subject to disproportionate, unfair and non-transparent rules and costs.

As shadow rapporteur for the regulation of risk preparedness in the electricity sector, I strongly welcomed the Commission’s proposal, which is very much needed, as was sadly shown by the uncoordinated cross-border response to the cold spell that affected southern Europe in January 2017. In line with the Emergency and Restoration network code, we worked on structured multilevel frameworks that oblige Member States to define and coordinate their strategies ex-ante. Timely assistance will be enhanced by programming solidarity interventions in a clear and predictable manner, in particular by fixing compensation schemes in advance. I believe the agreement negotiated by our rapporteurs has secured three key elements. It delivers a truly Union approach thanks to a unique risk assessment methodology approved but ACER and the strong involvement of the regional coordination centres in all phases of the planning procedure. It provides for greater transparency and incentives for data sharing, with safeguards for confidentiality, and it minimises collective costs arising from supply disruption and market distortion by allowing non-market-based solutions only as a last resort. The future implementation of this regulation will successfully lower the risk of black-outs and it will also lower the electricity bills for consumers while decreasing our Member States’ dependence on third countries’ energy supply.

Yes, and the question is also: is this sustainable enough for energy security in the coming years? And is that social enough? Our answer is – if we want to be honest: the glass is half full! We welcome the fact that regulated prices, for example in the electricity market, are maintained, and at the same time we criticise the fact that energy poverty is only half-hearted – with soft wording that we find here.  We are pleased that citizens' energies – and I believe this is a great step forward – are being given regulated rights for the first time, especially when it comes to increasing the acceptance of renewable energies, this is very, very important. But we are annoyed that consumer protection rights do not go far enough. We support the fact that in future the dirtiest coal-fired power stations will be left out of the safety reserve and can no longer be subsidised.

Madam President, which is essential to the operation of our businesses, to the lives of individuals and to travel, energy is, by its very nature, one of the main strategic policies of a State. If, for us, cooperation between Member States on energy is necessary and desirable, national sovereignty in this highly strategic area is not negotiable. Behind the stated objective of combating climate change and protecting consumers, the Commission's ambition is to create a large European electricity market where national logic will have to be erased before its will. The principles of increasing our cross-border trade, managing our peaks or troughs in electricity consumption in cooperation with our neighbouring countries, integrating consumer-generated renewable energy or adapting our production resources to new technologies are, in themselves, positive. However, these are natural steps that Member States have been taking between themselves and in their territories for decades. The Commission's dogmatic aim is to impose by ideology measures that will kill all forms of energy sovereignty and national initiative, both on the technical standardisation for electrical interconnections and on the management of flows between neighbouring countries. The emphasis should be on free cooperation between states, not on a gradual submission to arbitrary and ideological decisions by the Commission and its agencies. Moreover, the Commission is clearly showing its desire for full liberalisation of the energy market. It should be remembered that the non-European examples of excessive liberalisation and privatisation of electricity markets have, for the most part, ended in stinging and costly failures. Each of the four texts of this package is an additional stone to the edifice of the European electricity market and to the dispossession of the Member States of their energy but also diplomatic sovereignty.

Madam President! At the end of 2016, the Commission presented its major energy package. We are now coming to an end this week and looking forward to the next chapter after years of hard work. We will also have a lot of work to do in the next term of office. It can be said that in this we have, of course, focused on adopting legislation which, in the Commissioner's excellent words, is the largest comprehensive energy legislation in the history of the European Union, but these are only papers if it is not implemented. That is why, in the coming years, we will also have an important role in Parliament to ensure that the legislation is actually implemented. This is absolutely crucial to the climate fight, and I think it is fair to say that what we have experienced over the last few years has just been that it is Parliament that has helped to hold on to and even lift its ambitions. I think that is important to say here at the entrance to a European election campaign. We have set higher targets for energy efficiency and for renewable energy, but the renewable energy target depends on the implementation, of ACER, of the electricity market regulation, since cross-border electricity trade is the very prerequisite for green transition.  The next period is also about climate ambitions up to 2050, and to me there is no doubt that the European Union must take the lead. That is why we must aim for the EU to be carbon neutral by 2050. I myself recently experienced at a climate demonstration in Copenhagen that it is clear how the people are demanding action in this area. We must take responsibility for this!

Madam President, Commissioner Jourov, ladies and gentlemen. Having joined the European Parliament only a year ago, I am measuring the opportunity but also my responsibility to be the rapporteur of such a valuable reform for consumers in all European countries.  Tomorrow, we will make possible collective action against the illegal practices of large companies.  My task was not easy at first. Many feared, for example, that this reform could give rise to abusive, slanderous litigation, which was used to destabilize a competing company and thus reproduce the excesses of the American system. This will not be the case because I have taken special care of it. Others feared that this text would end up in catch-all where it would no longer be only the consumer concerned but the citizen, the individual in all its contours, who would use this remedy to ask a company, for example, to compensate it on the pretext that it would have contributed to the pollution of the air it breathes. This will not be the case because it would have been , as everyone would have acknowledged - distort the spirit of the text which aims above all to protect the rights of consumers. In fact, I think I can say that we have built, in close association with all the shadow rapporteurs, which I would like to thank here warmly for their excellent state of mind, a subtle balance which reconciles, on the one hand, the need for greater consumer protection, on the other hand, the necessary legal security of companies.  This text goes even further since it demonstrates, perhaps for the first time, that both, protection on the one hand, security, on the other, have every interest in going together. Ladies and gentlemen, adopting this text just a few weeks before the European elections could be a great demonstration that when we put ourselves together we make Europe concretely useful to the daily lives of each of our fellow citizens.  Thanks to the European class action, an air passenger, a car buyer, a washing machine owner will be able to take legal action with others against an illegal practice of his airline, his car brand or that of his household appliance.  These consumers will have their rights defended by a qualified entity whose funding will be transparent and will thus be redressed for their harm.  Finally, to establish its legitimacy, our European class action has set itself some fundamental principles. First, this remedy is not a substitute for those already existing in some states. Respectful of national legal traditions, it will be added or create new protection in the nine European countries that did not have it until now. The second principle is that the full compensation will have to go to the consumer. Qualified entities, which will only be vehicles for consumers to enforce their rights, will not be able to benefit from them.  Finally, to avoid abuse, we have established the principle that the loser at trial will pay for the proceedings, but we have also set the rule that one cannot be compensated twice for the same injury. Colleagues, I invite you to vote tomorrow in favour of this reform because it is not the text of any party, ideology or lobby. This directive has only one objective: to better protect the rights of all citizens of Europe.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": null, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 186, "date": "2019-03-25.json", "name": "Geoffroy DIDIER", "mepid": "190774", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Didier, for his dedicated work on this proposal, as well as all the other Members of the European Parliament from the Committee on Legal Affairs (JURI) and the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection (IMCO).  The Commission welcomes the swift progress on this file and hopes that Parliament will adopt its first reading position tomorrow. We can all agree that consumers across the EU should be able to enforce their rights effectively in ‘mass harm’ situations, and that is why the Commission proposed this directive. Via the representative actions for the protection of the collective interest of consumers, qualified entities, such as consumer associations or independent public bodies, will be able to act. They will be able to stop infringements of consumer law and help obtain redress for those consumers who have been harmed. This will especially help vulnerable consumers in situations where they shy away from defending their rights individually.  The proposal responds to the need for strong public and private enforcement of EU consumer rights. In line with the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality, the proposal gives Member States considerable room for manoeuvre on key procedural points. Our aim is to find solutions that safeguard consumer rights and ensure that traders are also treated fairly. From the beginning, we made it very clear that the Commission does not want to create a litigation culture in Europe, and the proposal on representative actions in no way lends itself to such an interpretation. We define a clearly European way of collective redress that is fair for consumers and businesses, that does not contain punitive damages, and is not bringing US—style class actions to the EU. In particular, we set strict standards for qualified entities which want to act on behalf of consumers.  I welcome that the report is pursuing the same objective. In particular, I note the proposed strengthening of the criteria for qualified entities and the preservation of Member States’ discretion as to the precise procedural modalities. Member States share the objective of ensuring clear and effective rules for an efficient and proportionate collective redress system suitable for the European model. I am convinced that, with the new deal for consumers, and in particular with the collective redress initiative, we are sending a clear message to European consumers that the EU cares about them.

My second regret is that the Council, wary of this point, has not found a common position.

Madam President, the European Union is a Europe of 'business' at the service of banks and lobbies, when it should have been a Europe of peoples. It now holds an opportunity to start catching up by strengthening consumer protection.  The draft directive before us is aimed at creating group action at European level, what the Americans call class action. The aim is to enable consumers, victims of the same prejudice, to come together to collectively defend their interests through joint action before national courts. There is an urgent need to create this procedure because only a few states in Europe, including France, already have it. The result is that American consumers are much better protected than European consumers. In the Dieselgate case, for example, Volkswagen paid 22 billion euros in compensation to its American customers, even though it has yet to pay virtually nothing to its European customers.  The procedure devised by the draft directive will undoubtedly improve the situation because it is wisely designed. It provides that the group action will be presented by non-profit associations.

In this time, we learned that European vehicle manufacturers have violated the EU rules on vehicle pollutant emissions. This has been detrimental in many respects. It has affected the air quality and the health of EU citizens, it has affected the trust of EU consumers in EU industry, and it has affected confidence in the whole EU regulatory framework on vehicles.  Together with the European Parliament and the Council, the Commission has spared no efforts to put an end to this scandal, to restore confidence and to avoid any repetition in the future. A lot has already been achieved. In May 2018, we put in place a more efficient regulatory framework that guarantees greater independence and transparency of vehicle type-approval. This will inter alia allow for EU fines, EU—wide recalls and EU testing of vehicles. We have also introduced more accurate testing for NOx emissions with the Real—Driving Emissions (RDE) test procedure. This procedure gives a more realistic picture of actual pollutant emissions on the road, and it also contributes to the effective reduction of these emissions. Let me give a simple example. Thanks to RDE, diesel cars now emit on average 40 mg of NOx per km. Before RDE, these emissions were on average 700 to 800 mg per km in real driving conditions. We now have one of the most effective emission regulatory systems anywhere in the world.  The procedure to measure CO2 emissions more accurately has also been modernised, with the adoption of the Worldwide Harmonised Light Vehicle Test Procedure (WLTP). This allows EU consumers to obtain realistic information on the fuel consumption of vehicles. Both RDE and WLTP are new tests that will be constantly reviewed and adapted where necessary. The Commission has also launched eight infringement procedures against Member States for a violation of the EU type—approval rules since December 2016. Six are still ongoing. They have already resulted in legislative changes and enforcement action in the Member States concerned. In February 2018, the Commission set up a platform in which Member States share the information on recalls of vehicles affected by Dieselgate. Based on this information, the Commission publishes regular updates on the state of play of recalls. So far, the Commission has no legal power to impose mandatory recalls. This still remains the responsibility of the Member States, which are bound to supervise the manufacturers and ensure that recall measures are effectively implemented.  As of 1 September 2020, the new Type-Approval Framework Regulation will allow for EU fines, EU-wide recalls and EU testing. For the time being, there is no comprehensive information on the effects of recalls on air quality. What is certain is that there are still about two million cars on European roads that require updating, and many of these cars are being sold to Central and Eastern Europe. We are moving our air quality problems from West to East. Some of the new rules put in place by the Commission have been challenged before the General Court. This is notably the case of one of the Commission regulations setting up the RDE procedures, and in particular, the so-called conformity factors used in this procedure. These conformity factors are necessary to reflect the statistical uncertainty linked with the new test procedure, as well as the margin of error of the portable measuring equipment. Last December, the General Court ruled that the Commission went beyond its powers when adopting these conformity factors. I want to inform you that the Commission has appealed that judgment. Germany and Hungary also appealed. The Commission is convinced that it did not go beyond its powers. These conformity factors are mere technical requirements that have no bearing on the emissions limits set by the co—legislators. Of course, at the same time I cannot guarantee what will be the outcome of this appeal. This is why the Commission is preparing a proposal, scheduled for adoption in April. The Commission will propose to the co-legislators the adoption of those conformity factors. They should also empower the Commission to lower the second factor as soon as technical progress allows. We have already done that once. So Parliament will now have the opportunity to set the conformity factors together with the Council. This is good news for you. To sum up, as acknowledged by the European Court of Auditors in its recent briefing paper on the EU’s response to the Dieselgate scandal: ‘The emissions scandal has accelerated many legislative changes to the EU system of vehicle emissions checks’. The European Court of Auditors also underlined that more could be done, and that it would take some time before the legislative changes have an impact on air quality.  Because deeds are better than words, together with the help of Member States, the Commission has prepared a ‘Roadmap towards clean vehicles’. It sets out benchmarks and tools for making sure that we will never have to go through a similar story again. The Commission presented the Roadmap on Monday, 18 March 2019, at the Automotive Industry Forum in Craiova. It demonstrates what the Commission is committed to. The Commission will ensure that the commitments made in the Roadmap are fulfilled, and it expects nothing less from the industry and the Member States. Let me also finish on a more positive note. We need to look at the future, and we spare no effort in this respect. We already have ambitious targets for CO2 reduction. We are about to adopt a major initiative to increase road safety and save lives, the General Safety Regulation, and we have to prepare for the revolution of connected and automated vehicles.

First of all, let us go back to this very elastic compliance factor applied by the Commission in the package on real-world testing, which was nevertheless overturned by the Court of Justice, a decision which, unfortunately, was challenged both by some States and also by the Commission. The Court had quashed the act of execution because this compliance factor was contrary to the Euro VI standards on nitrogen dioxide values, the standards that determine vehicle emission thresholds. However, on 20 February, when she appeared before the Committee on Transport and Tourism, in front of the Members of the EMIS Committee, Ms Bie-kowska announced that the Commission would put the same compliance factor back on the table, exceeding the legal benchmark by 110% and then by 50% by 2021. I can't hide my amazement. Giving manufacturers a right to pollute with such a margin of tolerance is an insult to this Parliament and, above all, seriously endangers the air we breathe. If the Commission presents such a proposal, we can only reject it. Manufacturers must take responsibility and recall all vehicles that do not comply with the Euro VI standard.  I note bitterly that the Commission is trying to buy time by launching into a legal battle with the Court of Justice. This time saved for the Commission is wasted time for the planet, but we have not a second to lose and we have no alternative planet. Millions of European citizens take to the streets every week to demand that we, as policy makers, act against pollution with the utmost urgency. The situation is particularly critical for the inhabitants of major European cities who are stifling with these nitrogen dioxide emissions, but it is not just nitrogen dioxide. WHO has established a fine particulate matter threshold not to exceed three days per year. Did you know that in Paris, we are already 19 days apart? 2019 is likely to be the worst year for air pollution, but this is nothing new and there is still no follow-up to the Commission's infringement proceedings against states, either on the part of the States or on the part of the Commission.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 202, "date": "2019-03-25.json", "name": "Mark DEMESMAEKER", "mepid": "117477", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Group. Mr President, to prevent a second dieselgate scandal, that is what we wanted with a series of recommendations from our committee of inquiry. I myself was vice-chairman of that committee and I continue to follow the case. I have to confess: it's spring, but there's still a lot of work to be done before we can harvest. Commissioner Bieńkowska recently said that dieselgate is not over, and a recent briefing from the European Court of Auditors is not very reassuring either. Newspapers headlined: second dieselgate is possible. Well, I find it difficult to understand that people do not seem to be learning enough from the mistakes. Take the relaxation of the nitrogen standard. In 2016 it was introduced and the introduction of practical tests on the road was rather linked to a weakening of that existing standard. We voted against this relaxation, because all technology is available to respect the nitrogen standard, even in real driving conditions and without a negative impact on CO2 emissions. The European Court of Justice considers that the relaxation of the nitrogen standard is de facto illegal, and what is the Commission doing? She's going to appeal.

The first is that Parliament never really received a proper response from the Commission to the committee of inquiry. Yes, we did receive a response from Commissioner Bieńkowska, but that was only on the recommendations, not the conclusions. And on some elements she wrote that it was the prerogative of the President of the Commission, so she couldn’t answer. That’s a bit weird if we consider the Commission a college. So this goes beyond air quality. This is also a matter of democratic accountability, and I certainly demand from the Commission before the end of this mandate a full and proper response to our inquiry conclusions and recommendations. The second point I would like to make is that we never cleaned up the mess of Dieselgate. We did come up with new legislation but there are still millions of fraudulent diesel cars being driven around European cities, and what we need is a very strong coordinated European approach. At the moment it is left to the Member States, and what we see happening is that individual Member States take measures in such a way that they might get rid of those cars in their own country, but they will be exported to other European countries. So it remains a European problem, and the effects on millions of European citizens are not being taken seriously. The only institution that can play that role, that can come up with a very strong coordinated European approach, is the Commission. So please, Commissioner, take this seriously and organise a huge summit with all Member States to get these cars off the road and force European car manufacturers to take back these cars and make them comply with European legislation through both software and hardware updates.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Liberals and centrists"}, {"id": 204, "date": "2019-03-25.json", "name": "Bas EICKHOUT", "mepid": "96725", "text": "  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Madam President, Commissioner, I think I will indeed just join the dissatisfaction of the Members here.

What my colleague Gerben-Jan Gerbrandy said – that there are still cars running on the streets, heavily polluting, knowing that they are just dieselgate cars, and that the Commission is not even taking action in getting Member States together on that – is really concerning.

We know that there are a couple of infringement cases  (by the way, Commissioner Bieńkowska always promised there will be more infringement cases – that was in the heat of the debate).

In other hand, it is not just a question of what our legislation looks like, what our actions look like, whether they are sufficient, but also of consumer confidence in the products that are manufactured and which we accept through the legislation. I would therefore see that we need to think more broadly about the whole of internal combustion engine technology, the future of diesel vehicles as a whole, and how they can be replaced and how to ensure that biodiesel made from waste and residues also enters the market when there seem to be difficulties.

I feel a little the same as my colleagues in this Chamber have also said: I simply cannot understand why the Commission can praise itself for the work that has been done. I am surprised that you can be so happy with it. Yes, we have new rules and yes, it is good that we got them and that they will apply from 2020. But the big problem is that millions of polluting diesel cars are still running on European roads. Many of our Member States have not even ensured that cars which do not comply with the rules are recalled and repaired! Surely it cannot be right that we cannot make it work. I believe that it is about twenty of our Member States that do not comply with these rules. It's a huge problem!  The problem with these diesel cars is that they pollute - they damage the environment and they damage people's health. We know this and we know which cars are involved. I cannot therefore believe that the Commission can be satisfied with what has happened when so many of these cars are still driving around. Something must be possible to ensure that the Member States do something - and in the future we also need to ensure that something is done! It must then be compulsory to recall cars if problems arise. In addition, we must also ensure that, after being adjusted and corrected, they are tested independently so that we can be sure that they are complying with the rules.  As has also been said, we need to have much more transparency on this at technical level. It must be possible for NGOs and others to help check whether the rules we have are being complied with. It is therefore extremely important that we ensure that the existing fleet of cars in Europe is also cleaner. It is important for public health and it is important for our environment and for our climate. In addition, we must also prevent these polluting cars from being sold on to Eastern Europe, where they may not have as much money and may therefore be tempted to buy them.

I found all your questions and comments to be very pertinent.  Many of you have referred to the infringement procedures concerning the follow-up to Dieselgate. In 2016, the Commission opened 18 infringement procedures against Germany, Spain, Luxembourg, Lithuania, Greece, the UK, the Czech Republic and Italy, which had either failed to impose fines on car manufacturers for breaking European Union rules or did not fully implement international legislative sanctions on car manufacturers breaking European Union emission rules. In 2017 and 2018, the Commission sent complementary letters of formal notice to Germany, Luxembourg, Spain and the UK to request further information. A letter of formal notice was also sent to Italy regarding the emission control strategy used by Fiat 500x Euro 6 diesel model. The information received from the Member States so far is neither fully satisfactory nor complete, and in addition, new cases of emission irregularities are being reported. The Commission will continue to follow up these cases.  Some of you also have referred to the recalls. Our Recall Information Platform was launched on 6 February 2018, and almost all Member States are regularly updating the information on mandatory and voluntary recalls and the results of this platform are public. Today, only eight Member States have issued a mandatory recall for vehicles of the VW group with illegal defeat devices. Those are Austria, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Netherlands, Portugal and Slovenia. In the European Union, the wide recall rate of the affected VW models, equipped with the EA189 engine, is at 80% as of 18 March 2019. Unfortunately, in some Member States, there are still recall rates below 50%. Our overall objective is to reach a 100% recall rate and as our first step, as announced in Craiova (Romania) in the Roadmap towards clean vehicles, a minimum European Union-wide recall rate of 90% should be reached by the end of 2019. You can be sure that the Commission is committed to making sure that we get to the bottom of Dieselgate. The Member States and industry must take all measures still necessary in order to be able to close the Dieselgate chapter. We will continue working on the implementing rules for the type-approval framework. We will make sure that the emission rules continue to be fit for purpose. We will also be vigilant regarding the implementation of the new rules and offer all the support the Member States need to put new market surveillance rules in place.  But it has to be stressed that implementation and enforcement is primarily the responsibility of the Member States themselves, as is the recalling of non-compliant cars from circulation and fixing them. So yes, there is still work to be done and we expect all the parties – Member States and industry – to work together in order to be able to turn the page. We count on the continued support and engagement of the European Parliament to achieve this goal.

I wanted to thank all the co-rapporteurs very warmly. General compromises have been reached despite the initially significant disagreement. Tomorrow's vote will determine a few things. It is important to look for sensible, viable solutions to implement, and unfortunately not everything today is possible, because there are no real technical tests. We therefore oblige the Commission to undertake some of its tasks before the next revision of the directive. But what is important for today? The transport sector accounts for one third of the Union's energy consumption and road transport accounts for 22% of total greenhouse gas emissions. Tyres, mainly due to rolling resistance, account for 5-10% of the vehicle's fuel consumption. The new tyre labelling model will provide consumers with greener, safer and quieter vehicles and reduce the decarbonisation of the transport sector. This is a significant step forward. It requires full information to users about fuel consumption, wet grip, external tyre rolling noise. The updated label will inform you about grip on snow and ice, which until now has not been. For the first time, truck and bus tyres, C3 tyres are included in the labelling and requirements, which in the future will allow retreaded tyres to be subject to the rules when a new method of testing their performance is required. This will increase efficiency and bring tyres into the circular economy. We have required an obligation to review the Directive in order to speed up work and force tests to assess the effect of tyre abrasion in the course and the secretion of microplastics. This is important for the protection not only of the environment, but also of the health of each of us. The requirements for label exposure are new, including for distance selling and online sales.  These new requirements will dramatically improve the visibility of all information to consumers. The Regulation also improves transparency and enforcement, as it introduces an obligation to register tyres in the product database. The same information should also appear on the tyre sales invoice provided to the customer or be attached to the invoice. Therefore, you will be able to better understand the products and compare them according to the relevant criteria. As a result, we have a transparent solution for consumers, accelerating the environmental quality of tyres and their functioning, healthier and safer.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 2, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": null, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 218, "date": "2019-03-25.json", "name": "Miguel ARIAS CAÑETE", "mepid": "1351", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, the existing tyre labelling regulation dates from 2009 and requires the Commission to review it in view of technological progress. After a two—year review, the Commission adopted a proposal to revise the existing rules for tyre labelling as part of the third mobility package in May last year. It is an important proposal because road transport is responsible for 27% of final energy consumption in the European Union and 20% of the European Union’s total greenhouse gas emissions.  Moreover, rolling resistance of tyres accounts for 5% to 10% of a vehicle’s fuel consumption. Therefore, having an up-to-date tyre label provides consumers with the necessary information to allow them to review their fuel consumption and save money. In fact, we estimate that an updated labelling scheme could save annually as much as 129 petajoules (PJ) of fuel by 2030, or savings of 10 million tonnes of carbon dioxide per year – the equivalent of removing almost 4 million passenger cars from European Union roads. For consumers, this would result in EUR 7 billion annual savings in fuel costs.  Let me start by congratulating the rapporteur and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE) on the progress made in Parliament. I believe that his report strengthens the Commission proposal on several points, and in particular on the rule for showing the tyre label on the internet, on the visibility of the tyre label vis-à-vis consumers in shops and with the links with international regulations on tyres.  I am also pleased that the report supports the Commission proposal as regards the inclusion of tyres in the product registration database established for energy labelling.  However, the Commission considers that it could be further strengthened in the following areas. Firstly, the report’s text leaves the performance levels and related label classes from the 2009 Regulation almost unchanged. However, in the meantime, tyres in the bottom classes (F and G) can no longer be sold on the Union market, as they are banned by the General Safety Regulation. Although the proposal removes the G class and greys out the F class, leaving the remaining classes as they are today means that there is no additional incentive for tyre manufacturers to innovate and bring more efficient and safe products to the market. Secondly, abrasion of tyres is the major source of microplastics in the environment. Addressing this is a key priority for the Commission under the recently adopted Plastics Strategy. Therefore, the Commission considers that as soon as a reliable testing method is available, new rules should be set as quickly as possible. Delegated acts would be a much quicker way of doing this than a full legislative proposal as envisaged now by the report. Finally, there are several other points of concern, such as the weakening of controls by Member States, removing the obligation to show the label in visual advertisements and making the inclusion of the ice and snow logo voluntary instead of mandatory.  I am confident that these issues can be addressed in the next phases of the co-decision process.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 2, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": null, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 219, "date": "2019-03-25.json", "name": "Edouard MARTIN", "mepid": "124947", "text": "  On behalf of the Group of S and D- Madam President, I also wanted to thank the rapporteur, Mr Boni, for his sense of listening and openness.

The European Union ensures freedom of movement for the labour force, but the structure and direction of this movement at the present moment are unfavourable for the majority of new Member States because the poorest EU countries are losing well—educated people, who are leaving for developed EU countries. This process promotes the degradation of the social structure and undermines economic cohesion. In the next legislative period, we must elaborate a system of direct EU financial support for several categories of highly skilled professionals in new Member States in order to motivate them to continue working at home. A compensatory mechanism may be applied up to the moment when the difference in salaries between the so—called ‘old’ and ‘new’ Member States becomes less pronounced and stops pushing people to leave their homes. I am speaking above all about doctors and other medical personnel. Let’s come back to this idea after the elections.

Increasingly, refusal to negotiate and maintain contact with those with whom one has disagreements is being practised – it’s presented as a brilliant diplomatic move. Even during the Cold War there were many diplomatic channels through which it was possible to clarify the situation, find acceptable solutions and, most importantly, avoid an armed conflict that could flare up even by misunderstanding. Now, some have begun to put an ‘equals’ sign between the act of negotiating and agreeing with the position of the other side.  In diplomacy, conducting a dialogue does not mean that you agree with the position of the partners in the negotiations. It is a way to hear and to be heard. Diplomacy is not about being proud and sitting in a corner and accepting a huge amount of aggressive and useless reports. It’s necessary to return to diplomacy as an instrument for resolving problems in relations between countries.

Brexit is dismantling the Good Friday Agreement. It’s knocking down its pillars bit by bit and the British Government is no longer even pretending to act with rigorous impartiality or political neutrality. It is appeasing unionism by scrapping 50-50 recruitment in policing and scrapping the Good Friday Agreement guarantees for rights and equality. Nationalism and republicanism have turned their backs on Westminster, rejecting all of the candidates who were willing to take their seats in that parliament, and this is because the majority of the people in the north of Ireland who voted to remain within the EU are seeing what the British Government is doing as a consequence of Brexit and the majority of the people in the nationalist republican community are rejecting the fact that the British Government is dragging us out of here against our wishes. So, once again, as I stand here, I say to you, to all the people who are listening in on the screens, that even though this is the last opportunity that I might get here on a Monday night to represent them, perhaps if the solution to Brexit, which is Irish unity, is something that is embraced by all then there may be an Irish republican back here representing the people of the north of Ireland in the future.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "GUE/NGL", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Left-wing"}, {"id": 241, "date": "2019-03-25.json", "name": "Sylvie GUILLAUME", "mepid": "96952", "text": "MYMEMORY WARNING: YOU USED ALL AVAILABLE FREE TRANSLATIONS FOR TODAY.
