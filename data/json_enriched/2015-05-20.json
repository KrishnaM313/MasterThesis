I am very proud that today I can speak about concrete actions the European Council and the Council have taken recently in response to the dramatic loss of lives of those seeking shelter in Europe, and I am sure that the Commission will complement that by presenting its view. Let me recall that, at its special meeting of 23 April 2015, the European Council tasked the Presidency and the Commission with ensuring appropriate follow-up to the orientations for tackling this issue and with reporting back to the European Council in June. The Presidency and the Council indeed ensured a swift follow-up. Already by the end of April we prepared, together with the Commission and the European External Action Service, a comprehensive document – a roadmap for the orientations given by the European Council. The Commission, too, did not hesitate. Last week, it presented the expected European Agenda on Migration, earlier than initially planned. I would like to thank the Commission for the comprehensive and immediate action. The roadmap and the agenda contain a number of proposals with a view to strengthening the European presence at sea, fighting traffickers, preventing illegal migration flows and reinforcing internal solidarity and responsibility. As an immediate action, in order to prevent further loss of lives at sea, a tripling of the resources allocated to Frontex has been recognised as a matter of priority. Hence, tomorrow, in the Committee on Budgets, the Presidency will start its first examination of the Commission’s proposal for budgetary amendments. In order to disrupt trafficking networks, special attention in the Council is devoted to stepping up EU efforts in this field.   Let me recall that this Monday at the joint meeting of Foreign Affairs and Defence Ministers, the Council decided to establish an EU military operation – EUNAVFOR Med – as a part of a comprehensive approach to solving the migration crisis in the Mediterranean. The operation aims at breaking the ‘business model’ of human smugglers and traffickers in the Mediterranean. In the medium and long term, we will focus on measures aimed at stopping illegal migration flows. Preventive and comprehensive cooperation with countries of origin and transit, development cooperation, and strengthening of EU delegations in third countries, are matters of particular importance. The necessity to deal with the root causes of the migration flows was emphasised at the joint meeting of Foreign Affairs and Defence Ministers this Monday.  Efficient response to the migration-related challenges is an issue of highest priority for the Council. Yesterday, the General Affairs Council held a thorough discussion on the follow-up to the special meeting of the European Council, and a first exchange of views on the European Agenda for Migration. The issue of broadening the development-migration linkage will be addressed during the meeting of EU Development Ministers on 26 May. The Justice and Home Affairs Council will continue this debate and examine the Migration Agenda on 16 June.  The policy debate covering both immediate and mid-term measures would serve as a contribution to the debate of the Heads of State or Government in the June European Council. The Presidency takes this task very seriously and stands ready to facilitate work in the Council. I can only underline that both the roadmap and the European Agenda on Migration serve as a very important contribution to the current discussion on the EU migratory policy launched by the European Council. Before concluding, let me assure you that the Council and the European Parliament share the same objectives: fair and robust migration policy, assuming responsibilities and showing solidarity. A European solution is necessary, based on solidarity and responsibility, and combining internal and external policies. All contributions are therefore welcome and deserve thorough examination. This is what we will do in the coming weeks.  I would like to conclude by noting that this is at least the fifth time under our Presidency that we have had a migration-related debate at the plenary. This is clear evidence of the prominent place this issue occupies in our agenda.

Leaders made a firm commitment to solidarity among Member States to address the common migratory challenges Europe faces.  The European Agenda on Migration is about turning words into action. It provides for the measures that are urgently needed to deal with a crisis in the Mediterranean and to build a structured response that can be used in cases of extreme pressure on other parts of our shared external border.  The input and support this House gave us in your resolution last month was very important to us in finalising the agenda. We have reacted with more funding and resources for Triton to help it manage borders and save lives. We are taking measures to disrupt the brutal people-smuggling trade and we are proposing hotspot teams to give support on the ground in Member States where the pressure is worse, to help identify, register and fingerprint incoming migrants. The Commission agrees with this House that we must do more to make a reality of the commitment to solidarity and to open up legal channels for those who are most in need of international protection.  Next week, the Commission will propose a temporary relocation mechanism by triggering the emergency clause in Article 78 of the Treaty to help relieve the immediate and exceptional pressure on frontline countries. This Parliament will be formally consulted and we count on your support, and later on we will come back to you to co-decide a standing mechanism for relocation that is automatically triggered whenever there are these extreme crisis situations. Let me underline that this is not about migration in general; it is about extreme crisis situations that demand a clear response. Under the relocation scheme, people of identified nationalities who are most desperately in need of sanctuary will be distributed to other Member States who will then take care of their reception and asylum processing.  The Commission has tabled a distribution key showing what this intra-EU solidarity means in concrete terms for each Member State and the Union as a whole. In parallel, we want to create safe and legal channels for those who really need protection to get to Europe without risking abuse, exploitation and their very lives in the hands of smugglers. We are therefore proposing a humanitarian resettlement scheme working with UNHCR. We are putting an extra EUR 50 million into the scheme, which should result in resettling an additional 20 000 people into the EU over two years.  Beyond the immediate crisis we are setting out a longer-term strategy to address the more fundamental issues of migration in a comprehensive way. These are complex matters and we need to act on all aspects if we want to be effective. That means tackling irregular migration at its source and all along the routes. It means securing our borders and saving lives, but it also has to mean applying our common asylum rules properly. Solidarity can be asked if responsibility is at the same time also taken by all Member States.  Everyone who needs sanctuary should find it in Europe, but those who have no justified claim should be quickly identified and quickly returned to their home country. Effective action on return and limiting the scope for abuse are crucial for the credibility and societal acceptance of migration policy. All too often in our countries people who deserve asylum because they flee war or prosecution are seen as profiteers because we have not been effective enough in having people who do not deserve asylum return to their countries of origin and this needs to change.  Getting these rules working correctly is also a necessary precondition for the serious debate we need to have on the legal migration Europe will need in the future. We will only get citizen support for legal migration if we get all the aspects of a comprehensive migration policy working together. If our people do not trust our asylum policy they will not trust a policy of legal migration. If they do trust our asylum policy because it is effective, they will be more relaxed about the necessity and possibilities of legal migration.  This European Agenda on Migration mobilises all the tools at the EU’s disposal. Our internal policies and our various European agencies should work together. But also, development policy needs to be put in place to address the root causes of migration, as well as a coherent and united foreign policy to bring migration management onto the agenda in our relations with key third countries. Third countries sometimes do not do what they need to do in taking back their nationals who do not have the right to asylum. It is a holistic agenda; an example of the benefits of the new working methods under the Juncker Commission.  These are bold proposals and they are already attracting debate, including among the Member States. But in our view, it is not acceptable for people to say ‘yes, we want you to stop people from drowning’, but at the same time stay silent on where these people should go once they have been rescued.  What the Commission is doing today is putting into practice the commitment the European Council made last month: more responsibility and effective application of our common rules to prevent abuses, going hand—in—hand with more solidarity. I know these are challenging proposals; I know they will prompt debate and controversy in Member States, but it is really not acceptable for people around the EU to say ‘stop the drowning’, and at the same time, to say ‘but do not bring the people here’.  We are setting out today a set of targeted and balanced measures and we will work closely with this Parliament and each of our Member States to match words with action.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 3, "date": "2015-05-20.json", "name": "Dimitris Avramopoulos", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, after years in which we have seen migrants dying on our doorstep and in which we have seen the trust of our citizens in the European institutions diminish, it was time to be visionary, to be bold. It was time for the Commission to fulfil its fundamental role as the engine of European integration, taking action on the big challenges of our times. Migration is one of these big challenges. Last year, as Members know, over 620 000 people asked for protection in Europe. The numbers for 2015 show that even that peak may be mild in comparison to the one we will record this year. Seventy thousand asylum applications have already been lodged every month in the European Union since the beginning of 2015. More than 80 000 migrants have reached our shores. Let me be clear: this is not due to any ‘pull factor’. This is because our immediate neighbourhood is on fire. It is because we are living in a time of instability and Europe is seen as a refuge in times of crisis. It is time we started being responsible about it, recognising that we need to start acting together in Europe. The Agenda we have adopted is more ambitious than that. We are proposing to act together on the global stage because managing migration is a shared responsibility across the world. The approval of a common security and defence policy mission in the Mediterranean on Monday by the Council and the efforts of Federica Mogherini to get the United Nations to pass a resolution that will allow Europe to take decisive actions against the criminal networks is a perfect example of this global approach, of this global vision. This effort is part of the immediate response that the European Agenda on Migration suggests in order to deal with the pressure in the Mediterranean and to give an immediate and solid follow-up to the deliberations of this Parliament and of the Heads of State and Government. We are doing so by expanding our capacity to save lives through the tripling of Frontex–led joint operations Triton and Poseidon and by adopting an action plan to fight migrant smuggling in order to respond to two fundamental, understandable and simple questions that we felt remained open. The first question is: ‘What do we do with those we rescue?’ We thought it was time to give a true European response to such fundamental questions, one where every Member State would do its fair share in order to promote the fundamental values of humanity and solidarity on which the European Union is built. This is why, next week, the Commission will propose the triggering of Article 78(3) of the Treaty, an emergency mechanism that was conceived precisely for situations such as those we are facing today: ‘a sudden inflow of nationals of third countries’. The mechanism will allow the transfer of those who are in clear need of protection from the frontline states towards the other Member States. In the past few days, since the adoption of the Agenda, I have heard many complaining that this system is far too oriented to the Mediterranean. Let me be very clear: what we are building today is not only an emergency response to the current pressure, but it is also an emergency mechanism to be applied in the future wherever pressure emerges. Those who help today will be those who may need help tomorrow. I think that this is what solidarity truly means in practice. The second question is: ‘What do we do with those that today use smugglers in order to seek the protection they deserve?’ If we are really serious about the fight against the smugglers, to the point of going to the United Nations Security Council, we need to be equally serious in opening alternative and legal avenues to come to Europe. Again, this is an effort where Europe needs to act as one, with a common and consistent approach. This is why the Commission has proposed a resettlement scheme to transfer 20 000 refugees to Europe from third countries, showing much needed solidarity with our neighbours which are already bearing the brunt of the crisis in Syria and Libya. The Commission will make available EUR 50 million in order to support the Member States. These two mechanisms will be based on a distribution key developed according to objective and clear criteria. I am ready to discuss the criteria retained but, let us be clear, we should not hide behind this discussion to do nothing. Beyond the immediate actions, the European Agenda on Migration also responds to the more fundamental challenges that European society faces. It is an agenda that looks at the medium to long term, in order to lead the way towards a truly common European migration policy in the European Union. In line with the priorities identified by President Juncker in his political guidelines we have built around four key pillars. Firstly, strengthening our capacity to fight irregular migration: in order to do that the Commission will adopt an action plan on smuggling next week and will reinforce the role of Frontex in return operations.  Secondly, protecting migrants in need of international protection: the Commission will promote and monitor the full implementation of the Common European Asylum System and will take action to fight abuses.  Thirdly, strengthening the shared management of our external borders: Frontex will be reinforced and more coherent standards will be developed.  Fourthly, the European Union’s demographic and skill needs mean that legal migration will be a necessary part of our future. So the Commission intends to develop a new policy on legal migration starting with revision of the Blue Card Directive. The principle is very simple. Europe will extend a helping hand to those in need and will strive to attract those we need, but this will be balanced by strong and targeted action for those who try to abuse our system. As I said, our objective is to give a comprehensive response and one that also encompasses the enormous demographic challenges Europe faces. While the working age population in the European Union will decline by 17.5 million, foreign skilled workers who can complement our own will be important to support Europe’s economic development. The Agenda is about concrete actions and initiatives, which are realistic and can be implemented if we all take part consistently in this shared effort. To do this, I need the support of this House, which has always been in the forefront in advocating true and effective solidarity. More than ensuring that the current system delivers its full potential, the Agenda finally launches parallel reflections for deepening our future European cooperation in the field of migration. This includes ideas such as the establishment of a European single asylum decision-making process or a European border guards system. I look forward to hearing your reactions.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 4, "date": "2015-05-20.json", "name": "Manfred WEBER", "mepid": "28229", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Mr President, Commissioners, commissioners, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. Before Going into the matter, I would like to sacrifice one minute of my speaking time and take a quick look back at the British elections. I am pleased that David Cameron has achieved good electoral success with his approach to fiscal consolidation and also with his approach to reform. Above all, however, I would like to welcome the election loser, our colleague Mr Farage. I would like to welcome the great election loser of Great Britain back here. I would like to emphasise that he has now found something positive about Europe, namely the fact that Europe obviously has a much better electoral system than The United Kingdom. Because if Europe did not have a proportional electoral system, it would no longer have a job today – let us say it – because its British voters did not vote for him. And I note that Mr Farage has lost all credibility. He has announced that if British voters do not elect him, he will resign as party leader. He has said he will resign and will not continue in office. You don't need to justify it by the fact that your great party executive has kneeled you to keep going. The fact is that you, Mr Farage, are not keeping their election promises. You are still here, you are further here as party leader and have broken an important election promise. Welcome back, and it's good that you're the big election loser. It was worth sacrificing one minute of speaking time, ladies and gentlemen. But now we are talking about the migration debate, and Here I would like to thank the Commission – Frans Timmermans, Mr Avramopoulos and our Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker – because the proposals on the table provide an overall proposal on how we can tackle the great challenge of migration. First of all, even if we look at the debates in the Council, the central question is: how do the citizens see this question? When citizens watch pictures from the Mediterranean on tv every night – in Great Britain, Poland, Germany, Spain: how do citizens see this? When people see the television pictures, there is a feeling that they say: as a British, as a Pole, as an Austrian, something is at stake for me? And I am convinced that most people in Europe say: yes, these pictures do not leave me cold, that concerns me. And if you are aware of this, it is also clear that we need European responses to the fact that we Europeans are jointly called upon to tackle this challenge. We welcome the solidarity mechanism, especially with regard to the UNHCR, and we welcome the criteria that have been considered. In my group too, I would like to say that there are still tough debates on the issue of the design of the solidarity mechanism, and there are still many discussions. But the basic approach is welcomed. We must put a stop to the smugglers. There are concrete proposals for this. The military option must also remain on the table. We welcome the partnership with the countries of origin: it is good that we are meeting in Malta to talk to the partner countries at the joint summit. We also welcome the fact that it is clear that we must also enforce the law. I would like to express my thanks to the two Commissioners for saying that we must also repate those who have just been rejected in the procedure under the rule of law, and that we must also enforce law in the European Union. Otherwise, we may lose citizens' confidence in our rule of law in the long term. I would also like to add that in some Countries of the European Union refugees from the Balkans – that is, from Europe – are a relevant group of refugees. This, too, must be addressed. It is difficult to explain that refugees who apply for asylum come from countries with which we are in accession talks to the European Union. That is why we must also address these issues, which are more difficult. Thank you to the Commission. Many of the European Parliament's issues have been included. The close partnership also shows this, and I am grateful for that. And now to the Council: there we have a plethora of 'no' sayers, of people who are already aware of what is not working. It is petty what we are experiencing there, namely only looking at one's own figures, at one's own personal situation, and, unfortunately, god does not look at the common task that is before us. I hope that the European Council in June will be able to overcome this, that we in the European Council really get a European view that the European Council will have a view of the Commission proposals are referred to and that the will to give the answers together will then also be apparent. I would like to appeal to the media not to always say – when these statements come from the Council – that Europe has failed because there is a clear will here in the European Parliament, because there is a clear will in the Commission. That is why it is the Member States that do not support joint European initiatives if it fails here. We are ready to continue the good job that the Commission has now put forward, and I would ask the Commission to make ambitious further proposals ... (Unrest) Finally, ladies and gentlemen, I would simply like to send my backing to the Commission, because the proposal is a good one. If you are now discussing with the Member States, you can point to my view, to the view of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, that we are jointly supporting these initiatives that have now been presented.

If a word were to sum up this strategy, I would say 'solidarity': solidarity with the men and women crossing the Mediterranean, solidarity with the peoples and Member States most exposed to migratory phenomena.  The Commission's strategy contains all the answers to the challenge of immigration. In the short term, the establishment of a quota system for asylum seekers will ensure more supportive and responsible management of flows, the strengthening of Poseidon and Triton will help to prevent further tragedies in the sea, and the mobilisation of the European Union alongside the United Nations must instead aim to defeat human traffickers and smugglers.  Let me be clear on this point: for us Socialists, there is no military intervention in Libya. The aim of our action must be to destroy the supply chains of traffickers, and to this end we must equip ourselves with all possible instruments. No pietism, no shyness with the merchants of death who profit on migrants.  In the text presented there is also a long-term vision, built around three pillars. First of all, we need to strengthen the common asylum system by reforming Dublin. The second pillar is the creation of a shared system of border management that controls our borders, without falling into the illusion that they can or should be hermetically sealed. There is, in fact, no direct relationship between terrorism and immigration. And then, finally, a European policy on legal immigration. These are the stages in front of us. A path begins, a path that is finally holistic, unified.  I would like to end with an appeal to the Member States. I appeal to all the Heads of Government, especially the most reluctant ones: do not throw this opportunity away, do not bow to blackmail by those who foment fear. Europe has often been accused of speaking, of speaking, of speaking but of not acting. With these measures we are finally demonstrating that Europe can work. Let us not miss this opportunity.

He is a man of his word, Nigel Farage. He has sent a letter to Nigel Farage saying ‘I resign’. Nigel Farage has responded to Nigel Farage saying ‘I refuse your resignation.’ That is the way it works! So, that said, let us come to the topic of today. Mr Timmermans, I strongly support the Commission’s proposal of last week on migration, because I think the Commission has assumed your responsibility, and that is not the case with the Council. The Commission has, in fact, taken a stance that is absolutely necessary because it promotes the interest of all, rather than focusing on single Member States, and that is what we have to do to tackle this problem. We cannot continue to say it is only the Italians who have to do their job; we cannot say it is the European Union which is at the source of this problem. What we need is a European solution to a European problem. I want to condemn very strongly those Member States who say officially that they are in solidarity but are already stating, as we have heard, that they will object to the use of the temporary protection procedure. With regard to the temporary protection procedure, I think, Commissioner, that Article 78(3) of the Treaty was especially created for that purpose. So let us use it now: it is only right that the Commission should exploit it. What I do not understand is those – like the Prime Minister of France, Mr Valls, last Sunday I think – who say ‘I am against quotas but I am for solidarity in this field.’ I do not understand this. It is either one thing or the other. Secondly, I agree with the Commission that the right approach is to start first with temporary protection and only then, at a later stage, to work on a permanent procedure to replace the Dublin rules. However, I think it shall be necessary to replace Dublin, and to do so not by recommendations, Commissioner, but through real legislation.  Let us also be clear in this debate that we cannot go down the road of what we are currently hearing: anti-European, xenophobic talk in which people are mixing everything up – asylum seekers, refugees, economic migrants. It is simply not acceptable to do as some people are doing and equate migrants with terrorists. So, colleagues, we have a responsibility as the European Union because – and let us be honest among ourselves – if we have such flows coming to Europe it is in part because of European Union inaction in our neighbourhood. We did nothing, after all, in Libya, and we did nothing in Syria, and that is one of the reasons why so many refugees are now seeking to enter the Union. We have to learn from that, which means we need to assume our responsibilities in our neighbourhood. Our Group supports the Commission proposals as a first step. Action is needed, Commissioner – joint action, common action, and that means European action.

Mr President, I would like to thank the Let me begin with George Orwell's vision. Winston Smith, Orwell's hero, begins his secret diary on April 4, 1984: \"Last Night in the Cinema,\" reads the first entry, \"loud war movies; a very good one about a ship of refugees being bombed somewhere in the Mediterranean; viewers very amused.\" Now I do not assume that anyone here in this room has been amused by this tragedy in the Mediterranean. But fiction can become a reality. The shelling or sinking of refugee boats as part of the overall package at least – and this must be made clear here – at least accepts so-called collateral damage, namely the deaths of people – refugees, boatmen and also members of the armed forces involved. In principle, however, I would also like to mention the criticism of the behaviour of the Member States here. The basis for what we are discussing today and the framework laid by the Summit of Heads of Government. And when the Commission talks about realistic, enforceable measures, its realism is shaped by and geared to the behaviour of the Member States. And therein lies the crux at the same time. With all due will, the package presented does not change the perspective of the suffering of the refugees. It still deals with the refugee issue, above all from a security point of view and from an economic point of view. The fundamental question arises here: What do we actually mean by security? Can security really only be achieved if we close our own borders and close Europe down? The package and the agreement of the foreign and defence ministers are primarily aimed at repressive measures against stakeholders. But repression, which destroys the conditions of existence of human beings, does not contribute to greater security, but to less. They continue to drive people into the clutches of terrorists and do not protect them from them. We do not deprive the business basis of organised smuggling with military intervention. The refugee problem remains. And so the question arises: why do we not cry out when it comes to cutting the World Food Programme, for example.B? Why do we not cry out when we see how many refugee camps outside the European Union people live in the most unworthy conditions? The refugee problem, as I said, remains. We are simply pushing it from our point of view and from our point of view from the Mediterranean to the Libyan border. And anyone who has seen that 190 dead people have been found behind the Libyan border in the last few weeks alone, and anyone who has seen the images of the refugee reception camps must simply ask themselves the question: what are we really doing, and are we prepared to approach the refugee problem in a very different way, mainly on humanitarian grounds? Are we prepared to accept that we must change ourselves, our lives, our standards, in order to really offer people the help they need? I can't see that yet!

A rich continent surrounded by countries at war or in poverty cannot afford to do so.

I do detect, however, in some of the smiles and laughter directed at me, a slight hint of nervousness – and so there jolly well should be because there is going to be a British referendum on whether we stay in or whether we leave this European Union. For the first time in many decades there will be a fundamental debate on the existence of this Union and the need for it in the modern world. I have to say that this referendum would not have happened without UKIP and its people’s army of millions of supporters.  It is pretty clear that, actually, when it comes to renegotiation, nothing substantial can be achieved, because already all the big bosses in Europe have said that the freedom-of-movement rules are not up for negotiation and that there will be no treaty change on this point. That, for us, is simply not good enough, and it goes to the heart of the debate this morning. What we want in Britain is an Australian-style points system so that we can choose who comes to live, work and settle in our countries. I would bet that, if such a proposal were put to all of your electorates in your Member States, they too would opt for that policy.

I was laughed at out loud here. People said I had no evidence for it. Well, now even the Libyan intelligence agencies are saying that ISIS are not only making money from trafficking people but are also beginning to send us their terrorists directly.

Firstly, it makes sense to have a crisis mechanism that takes place in times of crisis. Dublin makes sense when we have peaceful times, when there are few migrants and when a Member State is not overwhelmed. From the moment a Member State is confronted with a mass influx, there must be a functioning crisis mechanism and therefore also a correspondingly meaningful distribution mechanism. Secondly, I welcome the fact that there is also greater thought on the legal channels in terms of resettlement, humanitarian visas, temporary status options, but also in an attempt to strengthen these instruments. Because if the fight against the traffickers of human beings is taken seriously – and I believe that everyone in this House should be in favour of combating traffickers, because they are not friends of the refugees, but often criminals who accept their deaths, who torture them, who kill them, who use them for organ trafficking, who use them for all the evils that no human being can advocate – if we are to fight the fight against traffickers. , which I very much support, just as a military action of a targeted and targeted nature is taking serious action seriously, but then it also means that we, as the European Union, must make a contribution to facilitating and improving the refugee situation. However, an efficient return programme is also needed in the event that someone abuses our right to asylum or is in the countries illegally and a Member State alone may not have the strength to repate these people, but needs the support of the European Union to do so.  However, I would like to make one criticism very clear, and that concerns the staff, the personnel wishes.

What is lacking in this document remains a more far-reaching vision for migration policy in Europe, such as what a common European handling of asylum cases in order to ensure the same treatment and participation could look like. It is together that we can make a joint effort, that is, when all countries, in solidarity, take their share of responsibility for those who have to flee when the world is on fire. Because if all 28 countries share responsibility, we can together provide protection to more people and at the same time guarantee legal certainty in the asylum system.  Like the Commission, I too believe that this distribution should be based on quantitative data. It is also important to take into account qualitative data such as language, culture and family ties in order to facilitate integration as well. It is impossible to legislate for solidarity. Solidarity must be built when trust is built. I now call on the Presidency of the Council to take political responsibility for the Member States to stop shoveling responsibility over to someone else. It is not okay for six countries in the EU to take the greatest responsibility for more than 80% of asylum seekers, while 22 countries do almost nothing at all. I also believe that, in evaluating the Dublin Regulation in 2016, the Commission should benefit from the experience of redistribution of resettlement. I hope it can be the beginning of the end of the Dublin Regulation and the first-country of arrival principle. It is a failed relic of the legal situation and legal instruments of the 20th century. Asylum policy in europe in our time can and should be so much better when we share responsibility with each other. It is now time for us to move from words to deeds. I welcome what the Commission has done in this document, and it is wonderful that the European Parliament and the Commission speak the same language.

Approximately 2 000 people have died this year alone in the Mediterranean, and to single out just one example of a conflict, Syria has already produced more than four million refugees living outside Syria in camps for four years in unbearable conditions. That is the situation we are talking about.  And what do we do? We argue about 20 000 resettlement places with a ‘yes or no’ and about quotas with a ‘yes or no’. The only thing governments seem to be agreeing on is that they want to send their armies out against smugglers – as if that would help. The only thing that helps against smugglers is to open safe and legal ways of entry for refugees.  Mr Avramopoulos, you were rightly calling for that. But are we then going to stop at 20 000 resettlement places? Is that really all? I think we need to go far beyond that.  Regarding relocation: yes, it is absolutely right to have now a short-term crisis mechanism, but we should not stop there. We need to thoroughly reform the Dublin Regulation, because if a system does not work when it is really needed then it is high time to think about something else.  Solidarity should not remain an empty word here. We need solidarity amongst Member States, but also with those people who are really in need of protection. Mr Timmermans also rightly said that we need to increase acceptance; but for that I think we need governments to really work for that acceptance and to argue for that acceptance, and not claim that people fleeing from war and persecution are a problem that you can send the army against and that this is going to be the solution to it all.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "Verts/ALE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 38, "date": "2015-05-20.json", "name": "Laura FERRARA", "mepid": "124833", "text": "   Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, good morning, Mr Avramopoulos, good morning, Commissioner Timmermans. We have heard the Commission say that the European agenda on immigration wants to change words into action and that the contribution of the European Parliament resolution has been very important.  Well, I would now really like to see what impact the proposals presented by the European Commission will have on the facts, first ly the temporary and then permanent resettlement mechanism: Article 78 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union is invoked, which therefore provides for a temporary mechanism to deal with emergency situations of mass influx; no mention of the revision of the Dublin Regulation, no mention of the new legal avenues for access to the European Union. What does it actually change? When will certain situations be identified as emergency and when, say, everything will return to normal activity?  It seems to me once again to be the celebration of hypocrisy. In fact, Italy, like so many other Mediterranean countries, will continue to receive hundreds and hundreds of migrants who will continue to risk their lives aboard the dinghies. So I would like to understand, in fact, what is new about this Eu ropean Union agenda. Furthermore, with regard to the distribution between the Member States, there has been no mention of the refusal announced by France, the United Kingdom and Hungary. How do solidarity and cooperation apply here? Do they impose themselves? It seems to me that this is a real failure of those principles on which the European Union is founded. In conclusion, I would like to address the Council: I would have liked to have heard a few more news about this EUNAVFOR MED military operation. What is it, in fact?

I have taken note of all their remarks and concerns. We all know that addressing migratory challenges means making some bold decisions. Starting from the very beginning of the life of this Commission, commitment on this issue has been shown by the Commission itself, President Juncker and myself – you will remember my commitment before the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) during the hearing – and we have delivered results in a very short period. In the beginning some of you might have believed that we would not be in a position to do so. Well, here we are before you today after the public announcement of the new European Agenda on Migration. The time for decisions has come. Do we want to honour our responsibilities? Do we want to face the new reality throughout Europe? The European Agenda on Migration is not only an emergency response, it is a strategy that will lead Europe – that will lead us – forward in the next five, or even ten, years. During this period a lot of things will change but we have to strive towards our destination: to adopt and implement a comprehensive European policy on migration. This is why the agenda outlines a broader set of initiatives in the medium term in order to manage migration better. But we all know that any action alone will not be enough to solve the situation. This agenda requires political will and commitment, and this Commission has both. Solidarity shall not only be a slogan, as many of you have said. We need Member States to participate. We need their support. The important thing is to make a difference and to show that we are able to address the situation together. This agenda is based on the conviction that the European Union migration policy is not about opening or closing borders. Both of those options are unrealistic. The European Agenda on Migration is about managing migration better so that migration can take place in an orderly, safe and regular manner.  The Commission is already mobilising all its resources to implement these actions and will adopt a package implementing measures next week. Triggering this emergency mechanism means that more needs to be done together for those who are in need of protection. Let me say here that it is not a free ticket to another European country. It has become indispensable.  This package will include, among other things: firstly, a proposal for a decision, based on Article 78(3) of the Treaty, establishing an emergency relocation scheme. This proposal will also give details on how the regulation will work, including necessary safeguards. Secondly, we will present a recommendation on the establishment of a European resettlement scheme. Thirdly, an action plan on smuggling. Fourthly, guidance on fingerprinting. Finally, a public consultation on the future of the Blue Card.  The Commission’s European Agenda on Migration completes and deepens the commitments of the European Council and it is a response to the call by Parliament. Migration is a critical issue for the future of our societies and for the future of Europe. We need to regain people’s trust by proving that Europe is able to manage migration in an effective way. That means going beyond words and putting good intentions into practice. The European Agenda on Migration offers a comprehensive approach to address the migratory challenges. As I said before, it must be seen as a package, and all the measures proposed have to be implemented in parallel. No Member State can address this challenge alone. Thank you for this very fruitful debate. As I said earlier, I count on your support more than ever, knowing that Parliament shares our ambition finally to prevent and plan instead of only reacting to dramatic events. I hope that you can also help me to get support from Member States and citizens. We need this European Agenda on Migration. I am even more convinced of this after today’s debate.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 103, "date": "2015-05-20.json", "name": "Zanda Kalniņa-Lukaševica", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Mr President, I would like to thank you very much for this very important debate today. Parliament’s contribution is instrumental in finding the most appropriate answers to the challenges we have. This is one more step in the continued dialogue between our two institutions on the very important issue of migration, which we intend to pursue.  Given the seriousness of the migratory pressure on the EU, all contributions to this debate are welcome, in particular if they can contribute to finding a solution to the challenges we are facing. I can therefore promise you that we will take duly into account Parliament’s views on the different aspects of the European Agenda on Migration. In any case, this is just the first phase of a long debate. I am sure that the next Presidencies will also pursue this cooperation with Parliament on this very complex issue of migration.  As I have already said, at the beginning of this debate, as a result of swift action and cooperation between institutions we can already talk about substantial steps taken in the direction of addressing the humanitarian challenge the EU is facing due to migration flows.  I started my speech today by underlining that it is no longer time for words. It is time for deeds. This is the approach of the Council. The Council has already delivered concrete results and decisions. We have prepared the roadmap and have welcomed the presentation of the Agenda by the Commission. We also took the decision to prioritise the tripling of the resources allocated for Frontex and we have decided to establish an EU naval operation. More steps will follow when preparing for the June European Council. Some of you, in your comments, criticised the Council for its lack of support for the emergency mechanisms under Article 78(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Such criticism is premature as the Commission’s communication was adopted just one week ago. Even if some Member States have already expressed their preliminary views concerning the emergency relocation mechanism, the Council has not yet defined its position.  We are still waiting for the Commission’s concrete proposals. Once tabled, the Council will immediately activate its preparatory bodies. We will certainly have another opportunity to discuss the mechanism as decisions on provisional measures may be taken only after consulting Parliament.  I will be honest. It will not be easy to find an agreement in the Council on such a major and sensitive issue as migration policies, just as it is also not easy to find an agreement in this House. What is important at this moment is that the Presidency and the Council stand ready to respond to the Commission’s proposal. This House has today also shown a lot of interest in knowing more about the EU naval operation. EUNAVFOR Med will be conducted in sequential phases and in accordance with the requirements of international law. It will start by surveilling and assessing human smuggling and trafficking networks in the southern-central Mediterranean and will be conducted as soon as possible. The second and third phases of the operation will work to search, seize and disrupt the assets of smugglers, based on international law and in partnership with the Libyan authorities.  The EU CSDP operation is part of a set of comprehensive measures aimed at responding to the immediate need to save lives, address emergency situations and tackle the root causes of irregular migration, as requested by the European Council on 23 April.  The Council agrees with the need to have a European solution. It is important to have a comprehensive approach with a view to providing asylum for those in genuine need, as well as at the same time ensuring the effective return of those who do not have a right to stay. But the most urgent priority is to stop further loss of life.

Rather than solving the problem by creating channels for safe and regular migration, particularly for workers and unqualified migrants and for people seeking family reunification, as advocated by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, numerous social organisations and all those who have common sense and a spat esda of humanity, it intends to review the Blue Card Directive , designed to 'regulate' the immigration of skilled labour, exclusively depending on the needs of businesses in the EU, i.e. by selecting 'desirable' migrants from the 'undesirable'.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "GUE/NGL", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 134, "date": "2015-05-20.json", "name": "Alexander Graf LAMBSDORFF", "mepid": "28242", "text": "   I have received requests from the ECR Group for nominations and amendments to committees and delegations.

I am not planning to rehearse them again. I would rather hold up this meeting here as a symbol of the immobilism – the resistance to change – that all bureaucracies evolve over time. In fact, if you want a perfect physical symbol of what Milton Friedman calls the tyranny of the status quo, think of the trunks outside our offices. They date from a pre—e—mail age when it was necessary to move paperwork back and forth. Why do we still have them? Because an industry has grown up around their transportation: the lorry drivers, the removal men, and so on.

Of course, the crisis is hitting South Africa hard, with very high unemployment rates, but that does not alter the fact that agreements of this kind must remain in force only with countries that really need aid and cooperation in order to get out of underdevelopment.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "NI", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 211, "date": "2015-05-20.json", "name": "Alain CADEC", "mepid": "96849", "text": "  In writing.

The current European legislation in this field is outdated and not in line with international standards, which instantly puts us on the losing side in the fight against international terrorism. We all know very well that terrorist organisations are always one step ahead, both in using new technologies and in finding holes in our laws. A major countermeasure to the threat posed by terrorist organisations is the cessation or partial reduction of the cash flows funding terrorist activities.

In addition, central registers will be accessible to authorities, so-called 'obliged entities' (such as banks carrying out their duty to adequate customer verification) and, subject to certain conditions, to persons demonstrating a 'legitimate interest' (e.g. investigative journalists or NGOs) in relation to money laundering, terrorist financing and crimes that could help their financing, such as corruption , tax cimini and fraud.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 444, "date": "2015-05-20.json", "name": "Bart STAES", "mepid": "4751", "text": "  Written.

Despite clear warnings from those who were trying to assist people in mortgage distress in their dealings at the time with the banks, the government, in the legislation, gave the banks the final veto over whether or not a deal could be made, whether insolvency could be declared. It has been a disaster, so much so that now the government has been forced to move again. They will remove that veto but in the meantime, what of the damage they have done over the last two years, all the unnecessary added stress they have caused?

The EPP line imposes mandatory legislation on refineries and importers. Virtually all the minerals purchased by EU companies go through these channels, and focusing on these links in the supply chain is an accurate measure that lays the foundation for companies to be able to exercise due diligence while safeguarding jobs and growth.  This, together with active EU support for regional initiatives for conflict-free mineral extraction, strengthens the conditions for legitimate activities and for breaking the link between mineral extraction and the financing of armed groups.

An important step has been taken in the fight against the financing of conflicts in mining regions.

From my point of view, the Commission thus essentially wanted to reintroduce cadmium to the EU market, because, with a view to ending the original exemption in July 2014, some producers have already fully proceeded to withdraw cadmium from the products produced by them. The Commission's reasoning is that quantum dots without cadmium are not yet technically available. From my point of view, however, this is merely a trade conflict between two groups of producers, where some have already developed and successfully implemented the technology, others have not yet, so they are asking the Commission for more time. In view of this and on the basis of the analysis provided by the Legal Department of the European Parliament, which assured us that the refusal of this delegated act does not imply a ban on cadmium in quantum dots, as the original exception remains in force, I have decided to support a resolution that will not allow the use of cadmium in diodes to be extended.

After a ban on F-gases, the European Parliament is now fighting against cadmium. Cadmium is harmful to health while equivalent alternatives are available. That is precisely why the European Parliament objects to a proposal by the Commission to allow the use of cadmium in televisions and lamps.  By nature, cadmium is present in very low concentrations in the Earth's crust. As a result, our body cannot cope well with prolonged increased exposure. This leads to adverse effects, from high blood pressure to disturbances in bone formation. The Commission therefore imposed a ban on the use of cadmium, but with one exception: televisions. By placing so-called cadmium quantum dots in TVs, they become more energy efficient. The Commission considers that this benefit outweighs the adverse health effect of use. The Commission wishes to extend this exception. This while cadmium free quantum dots are available on the market.

It would have removed the quarterly reporting obligation and most of the procedural obligations relating to ethyl alcohol import licences, under the cover of simplification. Consequently, there would be a huge increase in ethanol imports on the EU market, which would result in the ruins of Hungarian bioethanol producers. We must prevent this, since the production of bioetanol, on the one hand, provides a stable income for maize growers and, on the other hand, produces a significant amount of GMO-free and healthy feed, which is needed now more than ever in the EU and Hungary. This legislation would have benefited the most important bioetanol exporting countries over union producers. The EU is negotiating free trade with many of these countries today, I can only refer to TTIP. The dismantling of customs duties and market access should be negotiated in free trade negotiations and not decided in a Commission legislation. In addition to the above, I have also raised environmental concerns. The major ethanol exporter produces bioet ethanol from GMO crops in third countries. On the other hand, rainforests are cut down in these places and farmers are driven from the land in order to establish huge monoculture maize, rapeseed or palm plantations for bioetanol production. If we allowed in large quantities of foreign bioetanol, the EU would also contribute to the negative effects mentioned above.

Paternity leave is a real solution to equality in the workplace, but a huge culture shift has to be achieved and governments in the EU are going to have to drive that.

Employees being absent is a cost to business; I recognise that, especially for small businesses. But I think we are going to have to accept that it is a cost to business just like rent, rates, holiday pay, electricity costs and other benefits.

Maternity leave is an organizational responsibility for the company. If it were longer, employers would see better the need for replacement. These replacement positions could therefore be an opportunity to return to work, especially for women who themselves return from educational leave. It should be noted that northern European countries, such as Sweden, have both the longest length of maternity leave and the highest employment rate for women.

The purpose of this resolution is to make the protection of pregnant or just-delivered women more effective, while the maternity directive is suspended due to persistent disagreements between States. It proposes to extend the duration of maternity leave to 18 weeks and thereby to standardise its practice (in accordance with ILO recommendations), but also to provide paternity leave of at least 10 days.

There is also no desire to reconsider the proposed measures in the light of the scientific evidence that has been presented on several sides so far, and this refers to the exclusion of the vine from potentially host plants in Xylella or to the damage to health and the environment caused by the use of large-scale pesticides. With the application of this decision it will be possible to eradicate healthy trees within a radius of one hundred meters from the infected tree and to prohibit the planting of all species only because they are potentially hosts, regardless of any controls and monitoring. We are talking about measures, therefore, which are myopic and which will certainly have European consequences because of the social, environmental and economic repercussions.

This motion for a resolution, even if it does not give enough room for the possibilities of action by States, has the merit of calling for the limitation of plant imports and increased controls on what enters the territory of the Member States of the European Union.

In 2013, olive decay occurred in southern Italy, in Puglia. The rapid spread and devastating effects of Xylella fastidos are of great concern. The bacterium causes damage to various plants, and olive trees are at the most at risk in Europe at this time. In 2013, 8,000 hectares of plantations were infected, and in 2014 the infected area increased further. This phenomenon poses a major threat to olive groves and olive growers in Europe, and action must therefore be taken and the disease spread as quickly as possible.  The total cut of olive groves and the use of toxins on huge surfaces are certainly not acceptable and are ecologically inappropriate. In addition, it is likely that the felling will not eradicate the disease and, after the destruction of the first million olive trees, a new million infected will be found. Other measures should be considered, such as the treatment of olive trees by injecting a 'medicine' against xylella fastidiosa.

Let me begin by emphasising that Turkey is very significant partner for the EU. Its dynamic economy provides a valuable contribution to the prosperity of the European continent. I would like to underline, in this regard, the important regional role of Turkey and its active involvement in its wider neighbourhood. The European Union has repeatedly re-affirmed the importance it attaches to our relations. Two days ago the EU-Turkey Association Council held its 53rd meeting in Brussels. It was a valuable meeting for relations between the EU and Turkey, despite diverging positions on certain issues. I want to start today with positive developments in our relations.  There have been a number of important positive signals in our relations over the last year. First, we welcome the dialogue and cooperation on foreign policy issues, in particular, active counterterrorism dialogue between the EU and Turkey and exchange of best practices on the prevention of radicalisation and recruitment to terrorism. The attacks in Paris, Belgium and Denmark prove how important such steps are. We should develop closer cooperation against ISIL/Da’esh and its funding networks, and enhance our efforts to stem the flow of foreign fighters.  Secondly, we acknowledge the important regional role Turkey plays. Here I would like to praise the considerable efforts made by Turkey in hosting around two million refugees fleeing the violence in Syria and Iraq. The EU will continue to support Turkey so it can deal effectively with the increasing flow of refugees, including through financial assistance.  Thirdly, we have seen the ratification of the EU readmission agreement and the ongoing dialogue on visa liberalisation. In this regard, we expect a full and effective implementation of the agreement by Turkey in respect of all EU Member States. This applies equally to the visa roadmap.   Now let me turn to the accession negotiations with Turkey. Further progress in the accession negotiations requires political will and courage and is in the interests of us all. In this context, we welcome the strong commitment to EU accession displayed by the Turkish Government in its EU strategy and look forward to its concrete follow-up. Progress under Chapter 17 on economic and monetary policy would in due course further support economic dialogue between Turkey and the EU and encourage alignment with the aquis.  Mentioning Chapter 17 brings me to reiterate that active and credible accession negotiations, which respect the EU’s commitments and establish conditionality, will enable our relations to achieve their full potential. In line with the negotiating framework, the EU continues to encourage Turkey to develop its foreign policy, in coordination with the EU, and to progressively align with the EUʼs common foreign and security policy.  I would also like to remind you that Turkey needs to commit itself fully to good neighbourly relations and to the peaceful settlement of disputes, in line with the negotiating framework and previous European Council conclusions. I would recall that on 24 October 2014 the European Council expressed serious concern about the tension in the eastern Mediterranean. It urged Turkey to respect the sovereignty of Cyprus over its territorial sea and the sovereign rights of Cyprus in its exclusive economic zone.  Under those circumstances, the European Council considers it more important than ever to ensure a positive climate so that negotiations for a comprehensive Cyprus settlement can resume. Turkey’s commitment and contribution in concrete terms to such a comprehensive settlement is crucial and we certainly welcome the resumption of talks, which took place on 15 May 2015.  The opening of further negotiation chapters continues to deepen our fulfilment of the requirements of the negotiating framework and accession partnership. Turkey’s full and non-discriminatory implementation of the additional protocol to the Association Agreement in respect of all Member States could also provide a significant boost to the negotiation process.  Let me reiterate that the EU is determined to continue to help Turkey in its reform efforts with a view to advancing the negotiations as soon as the respective conditions are met. The pace of negotiations can be accelerated by Turkey advancing in the fulfilment of benchmarks, by meeting the requirements of the negotiation framework and by respecting its contractual obligations towards the EU.  This brings me to my next point, which concerns domestic developments in Turkey. The EU extends its strongest political support to the renewed efforts for a peaceful settlement of the Kurdish issue. We encourage further engagement by all parties to move the process forward.  Concerning the ongoing reforms, we welcome the continued implementation of reforms adopted in previous years and, in particular, measures announced in the democratisation package. We are, however, concerned about undue interference by the executive in the judiciary, frequent changes to key legislation without the due consultation of stakeholders, and restrictions on access to information.  The Council, in its conclusions of December 2014, addressed the issue of the rule of law and respect for human rights – including the rights of women, children and persons belonging to minorities – freedom of religion and property rights. Freedoms and reforms should also enhance the implementation of all the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights.  Last year we also expressed regret at the continued response by the Government to the alleged cases of corruption. These actions have cast serious doubts over the independence and impartiality of the judiciary and demonstrated an increasing intolerance of political opposition, public protest and critical media. The police raids and the detention of a number of journalists and media representatives in Turkey in December 2014, on which this House also issued a resolution expressing its concerns, call into question respect for media freedom, which is a core principle of democracy. Let me underline that legislation on the right of association and the right of assembly should be brought into line with European standards. In this regard, we emphasise the important role of the constitutional court and we note positively the growing engagement of civil society in Turkey. It should be further supported and encouraged as a legitimate stakeholder. We consider that stepping up cooperation with the EU and strengthening common activities in the area of the rule of law and fundamental rights will bring Turkey closer to the EU and speed up work on possible future discussions in these key areas.  To conclude, we firmly believe that the EU should remain the anchor of political and economic reforms in Turkey and we continue to encourage work on the implementation of reforms.  Finally, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Kati Piri, for the tremendous work she has put into the resolution. The number of amendments is impressive and testifies to the great importance Parliament attaches to the EU’s relations with Turkey. Thank you all for a well-balanced and comprehensive end product.

First, I would like to thank the rapporteur on Turkey, Mrs Kati Piri, for delivering a high-quality report and for her endless efforts in procuring compromises. The report is balanced and addresses the key elements of EU—Turkey relations both in terms of achievements and challenges.  In order to tackle the serious global and regional challenges that we share, we need to engage Turkey even more. The human tragedies in the Mediterranean, the threat posed by terrorist groups, the severe conflicts in our neighbourhood, the economy and climate change are all issues we cannot effectively face alone. Concerning migration and border management: as you know from the European Council meeting in April, there is more generally a pressing need to reinforce our cooperation with Turkey on managing these issues, including the fight against the smuggling of migrants. At a working dinner last Sunday, Frederica Mogherini, Johannes Hahn and Turkey’s ministers Çavuşoğlu and Bozkir agreed to work together to prepare a plan on reinforced cooperation. This also underlines the high level of importance we attach to the visa liberalisation dialogue.  The situation in Syria and Iraq has called for the reinforcement of our cooperation on foreign policy issues and counter-terrorism. Turkey has made remarkable efforts to host about 2 million Syrian and Iraqi refugees and deserves our full support in coping with this immense burden. Turning to the Cyprus issue, the Commission believes that the time has come for all involved to embrace the current opportunity to solve the problem. The Commission stands firmly behind the UN envoy Espen Eide in his efforts to get the communities in Cyprus to successfully continue the settlement talks. The Commission strongly encourages all the relevant stakeholders, including Turkey, to contribute to a positive climate. Turkey has marked a renewed commitment to the accession process, notably through a new EU strategy and corresponding action plans. It is in the interest of both the EU and Turkey that the EU remains the anchor for Turkey’s political and economic reforms. We are, in particular, determined to fully tap into the huge potential of our economic relations. The Commission is also actively working towards developing a high-level economic dialogue and making progress towards the opening of Chapter 17 on economic and monetary policy, for which technical preparations are underway. Last week, Commissioner Malmstrom and the Turkish Minister for the Economy, Zeybekçi, building on important preparatory work, have endorsed the process of enhancing and deepening EU-Turkey trade relations and of upgrading the customs union agreement to improve its structure and function. The Commission will now be launching internal procedures, including a comprehensive impact assessment, in order to seek negotiating directives from the Council. The Commission intends to keep the relevant committees of this Parliament regularly informed on this important process.  Regarding energy security: in March, Vice President Maroš Šefčovič launched a high-level energy dialogue and attended the start of works on the TANAP Trans-Anatolian Gas Pipeline which, once completed, will contribute to Europe’s energy security. Regarding developments in Turkey, we share most of the views and concerns raised in your report on the rule of law and the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms. These are key areas where Turkey needs to prove its commitment to the accession process. We hope to see Turkey re—engage in reforms, in line with European standards and values, and actively consult all stakeholders. Providing a clear roadmap for reforms and defining the opening benchmarks for Chapters 23 and 24 will be in the interest of both Turkey and the EU. The Commission is ready to help, including through pre-accession assistance. Our assistance is to be based on sector reform strategies and will be result-oriented with the aim of increasing its impact and visibility.  To conclude, the Commission has high expectations for our cooperation with Turkey. After the election, I hope to see the new government and parliament re-energise the EU agenda in Turkey. It will also be an excellent opportunity for Members of the European Parliament to engage with their Turkish counterparts in a constructive manner on both positive achievements and challenges.

The EU and Turkey are important strategic partners and it is in the interests of both to have close and effective cooperation. We encourage Turkey to accelerate the pace of negotiations by clearly committing itself to respecting democratic values and principles. Parliament continues to support the EU accession process of Turkey as the cornerstone of our relations. However, in the report which will be voted on tomorrow we asked the Commission to reassess the way in which the negotiations with Turkey have been conducted so far, and how things can be further improved and intensified.  At a time when we ourselves are having intensive discussions in the EU – and indeed this morning in this Chamber – about how adequate protection can be given to refugees, we commend and praise all the efforts made by the Turkish Government in hosting more refugees than any other country in the world today. If we want to make sure that those in need of protection can find a safe haven in the region, we need to step up our efforts actively to assist Turkey in providing adequate shelter, healthcare and education for refugees and their children. Another area in which we strongly support and encourage efforts by the Turkish Government and all other stakeholders is the drive to achieve a comprehensive and sustainable conclusion to the peace process with the Kurdish community. But there is also clear concern in this Parliament about certain developments in Turkey. These are issues at the core of the negotiation process, such as the independence of the judiciary, freedom of expression and the freedom of the press. The pressure put on media outlets and journalists, which often results in the intimidation, dismissal or even arrest of journalists and widespread self-censorship, is of great concern to all of us. The recently adopted security package is, in our view, very wide in scope and bypasses the judiciary. Most investigations into the events that occurred in Gezi Park in May and June 2013 are still pending, and too little progress has been made in identifying the alleged perpetrators. We believe that the EU should remain a benchmark for reforms in the country. That means that we do not want to shut the door to Turkey, but we are calling for more dialogue and intensified engagement. The European Parliament report provides several proposals in areas where we believe it is of mutual benefit to increase cooperation. These are foreign and security policy, anti-terrorism, energy security and also, of course, specifically, the field of fundamental rights. Delivering the official opening benchmarks and a subsequent opening of Chapters 23 and 24, which has just been referred to by the Commission representative here, is the best way to promote truly effective reforms. We are ready to support Turkey in developing solid democratic institutions and effective legislation based on respect for human rights, the rule of law and defence of the interests of all sectors of Turkish society. Finally, Parliament also reiterates its strong support for the reunification of Cyprus on the basis of a fair, comprehensive and viable settlement for both communities there. We very much welcome the fact that the leaders of both communities have officially resumed negotiations under the auspices of the UN, and we believe that there is a unique window of opportunity now for a shared solution to the benefit of all Cypriots. We expect that Turkey and all relevant stakeholders will play a positive and constructive role in this delicate process. Let me mention here my gratitude and my thanks to all the shadow rapporteurs on the Turkey report, because if this had not been a joint exercise it would have been very difficult for me to stand here.

At the same time, I would like to thank the rapporteurs from the other groups. These were difficult talks that we had and we reached very good agreements – and everyone in this House knows how difficult this is on the subject of Turkey. So you really have to appreciate and acknowledge that. And something very special must also be acknowledged. This year we are in an anniversary year. October marks the tenth anniversary of the opening of accession negotiations with Turkey. But it was precisely with the start of these negotiations that the will to reform in this country faded, and now, on the contrary, there have been almost only regressions for years. Turkey is moving step by step further away from the European Union. It is not just a question of this country still not fulfilling the Copenhagen pre-accession criteria on any single point. We are talking about massive interference with fundamental rights and freedoms, and of course we are addressing this in our resolution. To trample democratic principles and the rule of law underfoot in this way is outrageous for a country that has been a candidate country for more than fifteen years. Nor has the policy towards the Republic of Cyprus changed. I do not have to go into this, enough other Members will do that. Dramatic developments, we hope for improvement. And in this situation, I really must say that I think it is wrong to call for the opening of new negotiating chapters. After all, that would also support the AK Party in the current election campaign. They would sell it as a reward for their anti-democratic policies. I am much more likely to think that we need a reassessment of the negotiation process. The Commission and the Council of Ministers should reflect on this in the same way as we did in our discussions in the run-up to this resolution. Yes, Turkey is important to us – as a trusting neighbour, as a trading partner with regard to security of energy supply and, of course, the fight against terrorism. And yes, Turkey is doing so much for the refugees it has taken in, and it deserves our recognition and support.

I must say I welcome the Commissioner’s undertaking to re-energise the relationship with Turkey but, in spite of lip service to Turkish accession, there is a fundamental dishonesty about whether or not Turkey will ever join the sort of EU that we have today. I have to say that many – not just in my own country but across Europe – would like to see a fundamentally different sort of European Union: a less tightly knit community of sovereign nations, with overlapping circles of engagement, an end to ever closer union, and a primary focus on making a success of the single market. I would suggest that this is the sort of European Union that would be far more hospitable to Turkey. The resolution reflects the ambivalence on the European Union side, recognising on the one hand the importance of Turkey’s position as a strategic partner, and particularly its significance in economic and energy relations, while on the other hand there is so much about Turkey itself which is subject to criticism. We cannot go on offering insults and expecting progress in return. Energy cooperation is a crucial issue. We should oppose the Turkish Stream project, which would bring Russian gas across the Black Sea to Turkey, and work towards the opening of Chapter 15 in order to encourage Turkey to continue to engage with the European Union instead. May I ask the Commission what other specific barriers there are to opening the energy chapter with Turkey? For many, the continued division of Cyprus is a useful obstacle to progress in relations with Turkey, and if the EU really wanted to do something useful it would devote much political effort to helping to resolve the Cyprus issue. Such a resolution would even be helpful in boosting economic and political confidence in Greece, may I add. Instead, the European Union continues to make lame, one-sided demands about, for example, the additional protocol, or fails to fulfil its own promises with regard to Northern Cyprus. The new president of Northern Cyprus, Mr Akıncı, has shown a great willingness to reach an accommodation. What more will the EU do to help? We need to make sure that Turkey continues to play its vital role as a strong ally in NATO and a partner of the European Union: part of the alliance confronting terrorism and instability in the Middle East and across the Black Sea, with a prosperous economy and anchored firmly in the democratic family of nations.

Madam President, I would like to thank the president for her Ten years ago, accession negotiations with Turkey began. On the recommendation of the Commission, this was decided by the Council. Even then, this decision was deeply dishonest and therefore unwise. There are a number of countries that do not remotely think of ever letting Turkey into the European Union. Our friends in Ankara know this, our friends in Istanbul know that, our friends in Turkey know that. When the Council says here at noon this afternoon that the European Union is still the anchor of political reforms in Turkey, I wonder: what planet are you actually living on? Turkey is reforming itself in the direction it wants to go, in the direction in which the democratically elected government wants to lead the country. Unfortunately, this is a direction that has little to do with the first Copenhagen criterion, the political criterion. We have heard it from you, Madam President-in-Office of the Council. Freedom of the press is in flagrant danger, the independence of the judiciary is not guaranteed, freedom of assembly is not guaranteed – these are essential criteria for a country's accession to the European Union.

No one in this House disputes that Turkey must be an important strategic ally of the European Union.

But everything is overshadowed by an accession process that has led to the poisoning of relations because it is so deeply dishonest.

Personally, I will focus mainly on the new effort to resolve the Cyprus issue, which is also of great concern to this report because there are real possibilities for resolving it. I believe that the European Union, through its representatives, should closely monitor this new process. I therefore call on the President of the European Parliament, the representatives of the Commission and, in particular, Mr Younger, to be present at the negotiations, in order to ensure that the proposals submitted are in line with the acquis communautaire and that the final solution is run through the basic principles and values of the European Union. So if the two leaders – I welcome here the appointment of Mustafa Akinji to the leadership of the Turkish Cypriots – reach an agreement on the internal aspect of the Cyprus issue, then pressure should be increased on Turkey on issues that, above all, concern it and which are guarantees and the military.

I myself come from Sweden, where there is very strong political support for Turkish membership. It is therefore very strange that some groups here could not accept wordings relating to accession, but that we have to end up with wordings on negotiations instead. I and my group, the Green Group, would have liked us to have continued to talk about accession and not just about negotiations. Although we are in favour of accession to the Union, we also feel that it is our responsibility to criticise when things are moving in the wrong direction. It has obviously been doing so for some years, for example, in terms of media freedom and the possibility of the opposition to act freely. Just yesterday, we received new information about attempts to stop critical media voices from using government infrastructure for communication. That is, of course, not acceptable and another in a series of restrictions on freedom of expression and the media.  Elections are about to take over in Turkey. The hope of us, and not least of the people of Turkey, is that the elections will be free, transparent and fair, but unfortunately this does not look like that, which we must be able to criticise. Another issue That I would like to take this opportunity to highlight is peace with the Kurds – that it is time. It is also important that aid shipments to the Kurdish part of Syria, to Rojava, arrive. We continue to receive information that aid shipments are being returned, and we cannot accept that either. In the situation where we stand today, where the Middle East is in flames, also on Turkey's border, neither Turkey nor the Kurds have anything to gain from a continuing conflict between them. A solution to the Kurdish question is crucial for the peaceful development of the whole region. Turkey has a key role to play there. I would also like to take this opportunity to ask for support for our Amendment No 9, which deals with the great construction boom that Turkey is in. It has been largely at the expense of environmental and natural interests.

Madam President, as we all know, since 2000, when discussions on Turkey's accession to the European Union began, little to little progress has been made. The Turkish Government is well aware that the country does not meet the Copenhagen criteria to become a full member of the European Union. However, instead of trying to make some progress, it accuses the European Union of being responsible for the delays in integration procedures which it is calling for to be speeded up. Turkey, too, is doing very well and is pursuing this policy which serves its interests. My question is why in the European Parliament, but also in the other institutions of the European Union, there are officials who, instead of demanding that Turkey be consistent with its obligations, are pressuring those who ask for the obvious to accept Turkey's behaviour and consent to the opening of other chapters, such as Chapter 15 on energy. , so that Turkey can supposedly make the necessary reforms. This policy is also utopian and reinforces Turkey's provocation.

As for myself, let me be clear that I am someone who has argued over a long period for constitutional reform in Turkey, as reflected in paragraph 6 of the report. That does not mean a super-presidency, as proposed by some. Three weeks ahead of the parliamentary elections it highlights the danger of any one party obtaining a majority, which could threaten the need to win a cross-party consensus for any constitutional change. I note the recent survey showed 60% of the Turkish public is against adoption of the presidential system. Next, the Kurdish issue. The message for the European Parliament today for all parties is that the peace talks with the PKK must continue in good faith. Any question against this would be deeply ironic, given the importance of the Kurdish population in bringing security to the region.  To those on the opposite side of this House who have argued against the opening of Chapters, let us address the unrest in the region, because surely this supports the case in the resolution for opening Chapter 31 on foreign policy. There is no strategy for promoting conflict resolution, counter terrorism, non-sectarianism and non-proliferation across the whole of the Middle East and North Africa that does not seriously include Turkey within its process.  To those who are concerned about the new Gazprom deal announced between Russia and Turkey, which is by no means their first energy deal, I would say that this is an argument for opening the energy Chapter to secure Europe’s interest, and not to fight shy of it.

The European Union has old and numerous links with Turkey, including a customs union. And it is also a candidate country for accession with which, as we all know, the corresponding negotiations are taking place. Accession requires major reforms in Turkey. European standards for the rule of law, independence of the judiciary and respect for human rights are the ones that must guide these reforms, which have to move forward. But on the other hand, Turkey is experiencing a difficult situation because of its neighborhood with Syria and Iraq and the consequent wave of refugees. We must continue to provide them with humanitarian aid. Moreover, Turkey and several Member States of the European Union have as neighbouring southern Mediterranean countries that face serious security and stability challenges. Cooperation between the European Union and Turkey on security and counter-terrorism is therefore necessary, as is migration cooperation. I therefore welcome the recent entry into force of the Agreement on readmission. We must also cooperate on energy. Turkey is much needed to diversify Europe's energy supply routes. And it is also appropriate to keep Turkey informed of the negotiations we are conducting with the United States on the trade and investment agreement. Turkey is an important regional player and has a strategic location. Dialogue and cooperation with Turkey on foreign and security policy is becoming increasingly necessary in a very difficult regional context.

I wonder why Chapter 23 and 24 on justice and civil rights should be opened when we have the events in Gezi Park and the flagrant arrests of journalists and the violation of individual rights? Why should Chapter 15 on energy be opened by a country that does not respect and ratify the law of the sea, the UNCLOS Treaty and illegally adopts Navtex directives on the EEZ of neighbouring Member States of the European Union? Why should Chapter 31 on foreign and defence and security policy be opened when Turkey still retains the casus belli, that is to say the threat of war in a Member State of the European Union, and indeed in force?

The process of negotiating Turkey's accession to the EU has been open-ended from the outset, but it represents a strong incentive to carry out reforms and democratic processes in the country and an opportunity to realise the full potential of our strategic partnership. I welcome the resumption of active dialogue in recent months, which is vital for strengthening mutual trust and I hope it will reinvigorate reforms in the country. Overcoming critical points in key areas such as respect for fundamental rights, the rule of law, solutions to problems with neighbours, which are the value foundation of the European Union, are conditions without which the process of European integration cannot continue.

So there's evidence. This issue has been the subject of my question, and Mrs Mogherini says that there will be action to ensure that Turkey tracks these weapons. But when will they give us an answer? The reality is that Erdoğan's Turkey makes fun of us. The reality is that it is led by a leader who responds in a threatening and mafia-like manner to the moderate words of peace of the Pope, guilty only of using the term 'genocide', because genocide scares this Turkey.

Turkey is an important strategic partner for the EU. This is political, economic, and that is perhaps why the European Parliament is compromising the Copenhagen criteria of 1993.

But what about the political criteria which require the country to have stable institutions that ensure democracy, the rule of law, respect for human rights and the protection of minorities? It was agreed in 1993 that when accession negotiations begin, it is a prerequisite that the candidate country meets the political criterion.  Turkey lacks European values.

Answering the question by Mr Lambsdorff on whether the EU is the anchor of reforms in Turkey, the Council’s answer is clear: both sides, including Turkey, have much to gain from the process of political and economic reforms.  During the debate, many of you also mentioned energy issues. Let me assure you that the Council fully supports the strengthening of EU-Turkey energy cooperation with the aim of facilitating and integrating energy markets. Here, I would like to refer also to the proposal by the Commission on energy union, which points to Turkey as an important strategic energy partner. The EU is committed to developing energy and climate diplomacy where it can use all its foreign policy instruments. In this debate we also heard several Members calling for the opening of further negotiation chapters, for example Chapters 23 and 24. Let me remind you that negotiating chapters may only be opened in compliance with the rules of the Intergovernmental Conference, according to the established procedures and in line with the negotiation framework. Unanimity in Council is required for this process. As a Presidency, we are committed to continuing the process. Together with the Member States and the Commission we are doing what we can to move things forward.

Turkey’s own progress in addressing benchmarks, as well as the requirements of the negotiating framework and accession partnership, continue to be the primary determining factors. Advancing the negotiations will not only require further general reform efforts, but also a great deal of political courage from Turkey.

It is indeed important that we can exchange views on this very important country. To start with, the Commission wishes to recognise Ethiopia’s active role in regional and international efforts to build a more secure and peaceful Horn of Africa region. Ethiopia is notably leading Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) mediation efforts in South Sudan. It has contributed a significant number of troops to the African Union mission to Somalia, in particular, fighting al-Shabaab with considerable success. This illustrates Ethiopia’s importance as a partner for the European Union in terms of regional peace and stability. We have common interests and similar positions on a number of global issues – on migration and displacement, for instance. Ethiopia is a key country of origin and transit, as well as a destination. It is host to more than 680 000 refugees, with all the difficulties this entails. It is actively involved in the Khartoum Process.  The recent killing of Ethiopian Christian migrants by ISIS in Libya has brought the issue of migration, as well as terrorism, to the top of the agenda in Ethiopia, and the government has expressed an interest in expanding cooperation on these matters with the European Union. On climate change, Ethiopia’s policy in global discussion is in line with the European Union position. The European Union intends to sign the Lima Declaration on cooperation with Ethiopia, as several EU Member States have already done.  In terms of economic development and poverty reduction, Ethiopia is considered in many ways a success story for Africa. The assistance that the EU and its Member States have been providing is bearing fruit in terms of progress towards the Millennium Development Goals for social and economic growth. The IMF estimate for economic growth in the current year, 2015, is 7.5-8.5%, which is rather impressive for the region. Moreover, according to a recent report by the World Bank, poverty in Ethiopia fell by one third between 2000 and 2011. These are remarkable achievements and I am glad that our support contributed to them. But we all know there is another side to the coin: as in many post-conflict situations, democratic transition in Ethiopia is taking time and does not always go smoothly. The Commission is well aware that the political environment is not conducive to transparent, credible and inclusive elections – and this is a concern which we have raised with the government during our Article 8 political dialogues and bilateral meetings, including at the highest level. We have repeatedly highlighted the need for genuine political dialogue with the opposition, and for full respect for freedom of speech, freedom of association and freedom of the press, as provided for by the Ethiopian Constitution. The government’s line is that their primary concern is stability and security for their people, and that they cannot permit destabilisation of the country which would jeopardise social and economic progress. Thus, we cannot say that we agree on everything, but we have an ongoing open dialogue on these issues, sometimes with constructive results. We are, for example, discussing the possibility of cooperating on improving the quality of the Ethiopian media, both public and private, as an outcome of a recent Article 8 dialogue on the media. Turning to the elections, you are all aware that progress in following up implementation of the recommendations of previous election observation missions has been lacking. The reports of 2005 and 2010 have unfortunately been rejected. We have not received an invitation for the elections that will take place next Sunday, and therefore the European Union will not send an election observation mission. Similarly, we have decided against financially supporting the UNDP electoral programme. The situation of journalists, bloggers, members of the opposition and other individuals is a major cause for concern. They have been imprisoned for having expressed their opinions publicly. The space for the media and political parties has been gradually reduced since just before the start of the electoral period in 2014. The EU delegation, together with Member States present in Addis Ababa, is closely following the situation and monitors all the relevant trials. We also discuss these issues, including the use of the anti-terrorism proclamation to stifle dissent, with the Ethiopian authorities, and the authorities are fully aware of our concerns and positions. Our global partnership with Ethiopia therefore does not mean that the European Union is indifferent to the difficulties that the Ethiopian population continues to face, as discussed in the Human Rights Subcommittee meetings in January this year and in September 2014, when the EU issued a statement on the political and human rights situation in Ethiopia. We will certainly continue to follow the situation closely and to react publicly when necessary. I will be happy to hear your views on EU engagement with Ethiopia.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1687, "date": "2015-05-20.json", "name": "Davor Ivo STIER", "mepid": "119435", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Club. – Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, with a population of 94 million, Ethiopia is the second most posse country in Africa and one of the key countries for the stability and development of a continent that certainly has strategic importance for our European security precisely for all the reasons that you, Commissioner, have mentioned before.  That is why we look with concern at the narrowing of democratic freedoms, and this is evidenced by the imprisonment of opposition politicians and journalists critical of the ruling People's Revolutionary Democratic Front. As in other African countries, Ethiopia has a visible link between lack of freedom, good governance and poverty. It is therefore important that this weekend's elections are fair, free, that the government is currently and unconditionally free political prisoners and journalists. Affirmation of the legal state and the initiation of an inclusive reconciliation process are indeed a key precondition for sustainable development in Ethiopia. Our development cooperation must therefore be geared towards these objectives, to support Ethiopia and as an important partner in the region. Why? Because it is important for us that Ethiopia continues with constructive regional cooperation. Although a poor state, today it accepts more than 680,000 refugees, and it is also important to us that Ethiopia remains a reliable partner in the fight against radical and terrorist organisations such as Al Shabaab. But that is why, because we want Ethiopia as a strong partner we must stand up for respect for human rights in Ethiopia, promote good governance and the rule of law.

Mr President, Commissioner, I have just returned from a mission in Addis Ababa where I spoke with the Prime Minister about the context of the upcoming elections, the situation in the country but also the regional situation. The image and opinion I have of Hailemariam Desalegn are those of a prime minister above the fray. The great interest is that he is foreign to ethnic quarrels but also to religious quarrels. He is a Muslim, Meles Zenawi was a Christian and yet they got along very well. In the context of this country, this is obviously an undeniable quality.  With 5,328 kilometres of borders, Ethiopia faces the fragility of its neighbours. This is all the more risky because Ethiopia is, without a doubt, in the crosshairs of the Islamist movement linked to Al-Qaeda. In January 2014, it agreed to include its troops in the African Union response force in Somalia. I firmly believe that it is essential for the European Union to have an intense political dialogue with this key country in the region. I would remind you that the country has 90 million people. That is not nothing. It is a giant in the Horn of Africa and it obviously plays an important role for stability. The United States, for that matter, has long understood the importance of supporting this country. I believe that we must help Ethiopia in its leadership role in the fight against terrorism in the Horn of Africa. The country was pulled up, albeit some think, by the visionary dimension of the late Prime Minister Meles Zenawi. His successor seems to be part of this continuity, emphasizing modernity, youth and accountability.

It is only right that Ethiopia should be encouraged to respect the rights of its citizens, but it would be foolish to take a holier-than-thou approach to diplomacy. Take, for example, the issue of villagisation, which revolves around the removal of people to villages in new areas often far from their tribal lands, all in the name of commercialising agriculture. Before emitting the usual gasps of horror, the EU and the Member States need to look in the mirror and genuinely consider whether the foreign aid they have provided is being used to support this policy.  Ethiopia fulfils many humanitarian obligations, as we have heard from the Commissioner: not least, accommodating more than 650 000 refugees, the largest number in Africa, including populations from South Sudan, Eritrea and Somalia. Ethiopia enjoys good relations with the West, and it is essential that this regional power, in a deeply troubled part of the world, is allowed to continue developing its economy alongside regional stability, including that of its promising neighbour Somaliland, which craves and deserves international recognition. Instead of a reactionary response to the crisis in the Mediterranean, and in an attempt to stop further migration, we should pursue instead the proactive development of the country through trade – an area in which the European Union has, of course, been destructive.

You are all familiar with the tragic events in Kumanovo in the north of the country close to Kosovo and Serbia. We have expressed our condolences to the families and friends of those killed and injured. We understand that these events were predominantly criminally and not inter-ethnically motivated. The Commission therefore welcomes the fact that all parties, exceptionally, came together in a multi-ethnic way to condemn the activities. One of the parties also played an important role in helping to negotiate a solution without further bloodshed. Let me now turn to the long-term political crisis from which those events cannot be a distraction. In response to the EU’s and others’ calls for political accountability for what is being revealed in the wiretaps, which the opposition are making public, we note the resignation last week of two ministers and the head of state security. We have already said that this is a concrete step towards political accountability and that we hope that this development will contribute to restoring faith in state institutions.  In this context we have also followed the two sets of demonstrations that were held in Skopje on Sunday and Monday. It is important that people were able to freely express their views on both occasions. This was done in a peaceful manner. A calm and appropriate handling from all sides will remain important. From the outset of the political crisis, the European Union has called for the restoration of normal political dialogue between the main government and opposition parties. I welcome that three of your colleagues responded to my colleague Johannes Hahn’s proposal to facilitate dialogue between these two parties. As you will be aware, three distinguished Members of this Parliament, Mr Vajgl, Mr Howitt and Mr Kukan, together with Commissioner Hahn, met here in Strasbourg yesterday and in the early morning hours of today with the Prime Minister of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Mr Gruevski and the leader of the opposition, Mr Zaev. This was an important meeting. It is clear that both sides are taking these facilitation efforts very seriously. In-depth discussions on divergent viewpoints took place and further dialogue will be needed.  The Commission commends the confirmation of the commitment of the parties to the EU integration process and democratic principles as well as their agreement to put the interests of the country first. We urge all sides to continue their engagement in this spirit; we welcome in this respect their readiness to meet again under the umbrella of this facilitation effort. Also, we welcome the fact that the four main party leaders met in Skopje on 14 and 18 May and that they have agreed to meet again on 26 May in an attempt to find a way forward, because the citizens of this country deserve better than a political stalemate. A stalemate that drags on simply does not respond to the aspirations of the population.  We call on the leaders of the country to take their responsibilities seriously and put the interests of the state above those of their parties. In parallel, the European Union has been calling on the relevant authorities to investigate all allegations of potential wrongdoing, including those being made public in the wiretaps, in a transparent and independent manner. The Commission has also sent a team of senior legal experts to look into some of the systemic issues on which the Commission had previously expressed concern. Arising from the wiretaps, these systemic issues need to be addressed to get this candidate country back on the right track as it deserves.  In conclusion: our collective approach to this crisis is a good example of how various EU institutions and services can work together using our various tools to deliver a clear European message. In all of this, we are also working very closely with our international partners on the ground to improve the situation.

He was speaking directly to the point, which was very helpful. First of all, let me express my hope that this discussion here and now will reflect our support to Macedonia, to its people and their European ambitions. I believe that the country is at a turning point. In this difficult situation we should be clear and decisive in carrying our message of support. Macedonia is facing a really difficult political crisis, doubled with the extreme security challenges that would shake the basis of any political system in Europe. After last week’s event in Kumanovo we know how serious the situation can get. The deep political crisis in the country needs to get more of our attention as well.  There are serious revelations coming from the wire-tapping scandal which have to be addressed by the relevant authorities. At the same time, politicians need to address the question of political accountability. In this situation we have to see reflection, political responsibility and more political dialogue. This needs to come from all sides of the political spectrum and across ethnic lines.  In a country with such severe challenges, it is important that the democratic institutions and mechanism work. This concerns especially the parliament, which is the platform for a political dialogue and mechanism for political oversight. It is important that all politicians show responsibility and openness. I mean the politicians in Macedonia, but also the politicians in this very House. Please, let us keep in mind that the European integration processes are in this situation one of the few tools which could help to overcome this crisis. We need to get Macedonia back on track.

The meeting last night, which was prolonged, dealt with the contentious issues, including commitment to the European perspective agreed by all parties, in a process which is continuing. To my fellow members of the European Parliament, I wish to make some comments of my own, not about the talks, but about the country. Firstly, the one-sided call to end the parliamentary boycott, without taking decisive measures to address the failings of the political institutions, is a partisan, not a cross-party, answer and it is therefore not an answer. Secondly, my group has never actively supported any parliamentary boycott or even the publication of wiretap tapes, and, if jointly we are to succeed, then members of the EPP Group – not Mr Kukan – should show the same discipline by not blaming the opposition, or indeed my own Group. Thirdly, no-one suggests that the leaked surveillance tapes which prompted this crisis are entirely fabricated, and this Parliament should support the demarche from the EU ambassadors that there must be accountability for the wrongdoing identified. Fourthly, the reforms in the very areas which have caused concern – the judiciary, the media, electoral practices, civil society – have already been part of progress reports, action plans and the high-level accession dialogue, so that any fresh commitment to address them must demonstrate why this time it will be different. Fifthly, no-one is above the law but, if an opposition leader is put in jail, our solidarity would be not simply with him but with the very notion of democracy in the country, which itself will be called into question by such a step. Last weekend I stood at the site of the terror attacks in Kumanovo amidst burnt-out houses whose walls were pockmarked with bullet holes and where the view through shattered windows revealed interiors buried in rubble. The families I talked to had hidden for their lives from a 30—hour firefight and suffered the trauma of witnessing 18 people dead. We all hoped that this was a one-off event with no repercussions for inter-ethnic relations, but the families told me they believe the event to be linked to the breakdown of political stability. This lack of trust is, in itself, dangerous. I have repeatedly warned that Europe’s failure to start accession talks risks a return to conflict, and this deadly attack is a tragic and urgent reminder that this warning is crying out to be heard. What happened in Kumanovo, and in the country, may not be the direct responsibility of Europe, but if we expect the political parties of the country to exercise their responsibilities – and we do expect that – then they can reasonably expect Europe to exercise ours.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1718, "date": "2015-05-20.json", "name": "Angel DZHAMBAZKI", "mepid": "124873", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Group. – Mr President, honourable Members, first of all, I express my deepest condolences to the families of all the officers who died at the Ministry of The Interior during the police operation.

There is no doubt that this country is currently in one of its worst political crises. The government in Skopje owes an awful lot of answers, responds to accusations of corruption, responds to recordings that leak into the public domain and shows an undemocratic way of government. Therefore, the local authority owes an explanation to its constituents, to its citizens. On the other hand, I fully support the integration of the state into the European Union and into THE EU, but this is done only through a good neighbourly treaty, this is done only through the outright denial of hate speech, the theft of the common history, the abuse of it, the recognition of all rights and legitimate interests of more than at least 90,000 Macedonian citizens with Bulgarian national consciousness.

We have recently supported Macedonia by a large majority in this House as the country we want in the Membership of the European Union, stressing that it has been fulfilling most of the conditions for starting membership negotiations for many years. That this has not happened before, and at a time when we have opened the door to candidates who are far behind Macedonia in many ways, the only reason is the absurd dispute over the name of the country. Unfortunately, the trigger for today's debate is not only the desire to repeat the positive view of Macedonia's progress as a candidate, but a serious political crisis with the tragic events in Kumanov, which have reminded us that there are still known interstate and inter-ethnic problems in this part of South-Eastern Europe, and that there are new threats of aggressive Islamic chauvinism and already transparent attempts to instigate Macedonia into Russia's geostratetic plans. The situation in Macedonia requires more understanding of the European Union for this potential member. It is time to find a compromise for the name or to start negotiations with Macedonia and remove this problem until their conclusion. Macedonia must be supported in the context of the comprehensive concept of collective security in Europe in an effort to become a member of NATO. The opposition of neighbouring Greece, a country that expects and enjoys aid and solidarity from us, must be rejected and called upon to take into account common interests. There are some bizarre things going on these days. Today, the Albanian prime minister threatened to block Macedonia's entry into NATO. Macedonian politicians, who are responsible for the escalation of the internal crisis, must take responsibility for the euro-Atlantic future of the country. Just yesterday, in Parliament, after more than ten hours of collusion with the leaders of the two largest Macedonian parties, we adopted a platform to overcome the crisis through dialogue. Let the consensus come to an end to the political crisis and a serious effort to stabilise the country!

In our neighbouring country there are serious problems in the functioning of the rule of law, respect for human rights, the implementation of the transnational agreement in Ahrid, respect for the principle of good neighbourliness and the lack of democracy in the country. It is precisely this that we, as the European Union, must focus our attention on.

Actually, Macedonia has become the Prince of Wales of European accession: it has been waiting for the start for a decade by now. Although we generally support the new Greek Government in breaking with the policies of its predecessors and we welcome its anti-austerity programmes, we think that there is now a very important opportunity for this new Greek Government to break with the past and revise their policies vis-à-vis Macedonia. I commend the efforts of our three colleagues in bringing the Macedonian political leaders to the negotiating table. However, we believe that the promise to continue the talks is not enough now. The government of Macedonia should immediately initiate fully transparent and impartial investigations both into the Kumanovo tragedy and the allegations in the wire-tapping crisis.

Macedonia - the former Yugoslav Republic, as a candidate country, is facing an internal political crisis and a multi-year blockade of the opening of accession negotiations. Following the tragic incident in Kumanov, the political stabilisation of this country is even more important for it and for the wider region than before. In this context, I welcome and support the launch of a political dialogue between the opposition and the opposition, including the parties of the Macedonian Albanians, which is supposed to lead to the normal functioning of the Macedonian Parliament and to transfer political debate on key issues of the state. I am grateful to Commissioner Hahn and my colleagues Kukan, Howitt and Vajgel for all efforts to support this dialogue.  I also welcome the political culture at the political rallies a few days ago. However, I call for such a dynamic of collusion so that, after a long period of time, the full functioning of the Joint Parliamentary Committee, which is a necessary element in the candidate's accession process, can be fully functioning. I believe that, in the interests of political stability, a better neighbourhood and a credible European perspective, all useful progress in the accession process must be made without anyone losing their face.  We must do everything to ensure that internal, not external causes do not lead to a new conflict hotspot on European soil.

It was not so important that social democrats also spoke. What was much more important was that there were a wide range of NGOs, that there were people of different ethnic backgrounds and that it was peaceful. Peaceful because the demonstrators were peaceful and because the police and the authorities behaved wisely. This attitude brings the country closer to the EU, and that is why we should support it.

In fact, Macedonia's big problem comes from this lack of a culture of compromise, of genuine dialogue.

This is not an easy attitude to read, both in negotiation and on the street. I am glad that Mrs Lunacek is interested in the relationship between the EPP and the rule of law, on the major issues, but I would also like to see the same attitude developed towards socialist prime ministers in Europe and governments that have condemned ministers in their ranks, for example in Romania. You may not have heard of it, but I think we have to be fair and not use the street to demolish institutions, and that is not the epp issue, it is a very serious political crisis.

Mr President, Commissioner, the fact that the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is vulnerable to incidents such as those in Kumanovo shows that there is a serious deficit in the functioning of democracy in the country. The government of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia does not respect the Ohrid Agreement and therefore the rights of the very strong Albanian minority in relation to the local population. But that's not all. The opposition has not sat on the benches of the Parliament in Skopje since the elections; the government has not convinced that an independent investigation is under way into the phone intercepts in which, incidentally, Prime Minister Gruevski's cousin, who is also here in Strasbourg, is also starring – he is accompanying the prime minister, according to the press. Prime Minister Gruevski speaks of a foreign finger in the political life of the country, while Russia, through Sergei Lavrov, sees behind the turmoil caused by the eavesdropping, an attempt to prevent Skopje from participating in the 'Turkish Stream' pipeline. These are all conspiracy scenarios, and it is clear that there is no respect for the rights, not only of Albanians but also of the Roma, and press freedoms are being violated. We have a responsibility to make recommendations to the candidate countries in the region, first of all the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, so that the tension can drop. And, indeed, after all this, does anyone here believe that the only obstacle to the start of the negotiations between the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and the European Union is their difference with Greece?

Madam President, we need to clarify the rules of operation a little. There are a number of colleagues: I, Mr Jakovčić and others, who often wish to use the 'Catch-the-Eye' procedure. To do this, there must be sufficient time after the end of the speakers.

However, if there are many speakers, then the person who has asked to speak under the Catch-the-Eye procedure should have priority.

Almost six years ago in Prague, we set out our vision of bringing the relationship between the EU and its Eastern European partners to a new level by deepening our bilateral engagement and building a multilateral framework for cooperation and dialogue.  Since then, we have achieved good progress in our partnership. We have a better understanding of the different interests, needs and ambitions of our partner countries within the Eastern Partnership. In Riga, we will take stock of the considerable achievements we have witnessed since Vilnius and chart a positive agenda for the future.  Since the last Eastern Partnership Summit in Vilnius, the signing of Association Agreements and Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA) agreements brought to a new level our cooperation with Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine.  The Association Agreements, including DCFTAs, with Georgia and the Republic of Moldova are already provisionally applied and the initial indications are very promising. Trade is already increasing between the EU and the partners concerned.  As regards Ukraine, the recent EU Summit with Ukraine reconfirmed that the provisional application of the Ukrainian DCFTA will start on 1 January 2016. As you are aware, Commissioner Cecilia Malmström, is holding trilateral talks with her Ukrainian and Russian counterparts to ensure that provisional application on 1 January takes place in the best possible environment.  The Riga Summit will be an opportunity to review the early stages of the implementation of Association Agreements and DCFTAs and to demonstrate the EU’s strong commitment to deepening our cooperation. The summit will reaffirm the importance of reforms which consolidate the rule of law and a competitive market economy as the best prospect for guaranteeing a European future for our partners.  We will highlight the EU’s commitment to supporting efforts devoted to advance cooperation in institution-building, mobility and people-to-people contacts, market opportunities and interconnections.   Therefore, I would like to stress that, on the margins of the Riga Summit, three large-scale side events will take place: the media conference on the role of the media in the Eastern Partnership, the civil society conference and the business forum. These events will emphasise the increasing role of civil society and business contacts as an integral part of the Eastern Partnership policy. Let me stress that the EU values our relationship with all six of our Eastern partners and we are ready to work for more tailor-made arrangements with them. For partners with Association Agreements, the path ahead is laid out in those agreements. For the other partners, there is work to be done.  We have reached an understanding with Armenia on the scope of our future relationship and we hope that the Council allows negotiations to begin on a new contractual agreement with Armenia. The relevant negotiating mandate is being prepared.  We currently await Azerbaijan’s ideas on how it sees its future relations with the European Union. Once we have received these, we will give serious consideration as to the kind of relationship that both sides need and expect.  We are also exploring ways to further deepen our critical engagement with Belarus.  We are convinced that developing bilateral relations in this differentiated way is the best way to ensure that all six partners have a stake in the Eastern Partnership and therefore remain committed to this unique framework. We have moved forward in the area of mobility. Since April last year, Moldova has enjoyed a visa-free regime with the Schengen area. Nearly half a million people have been able to take advantage of it.  Both Georgia and Ukraine have made good progress in implementing the benchmarks of their Visa Liberalisation Action Plans. Fulfilling the actions required in the recent Commission progress reports would allow these countries to complete their respective implementation of all the Visa Liberalisation Action Plans’ second-phase benchmarks. The Commission will continue to monitor and to do its utmost to support them and will report on progress by the end of 2015. The finalisation of the negotiations with Belarus on the visa facilitation agreement and readmission agreement and the launch of the Mobility Partnership in June is foreseen.  Let me stress that the Eastern Partnership Riga Summit is taking place in a new geopolitical environment where borders have been changed by force and where partners (and indeed Member States) have been subjected to considerable pressure. Let me stress once again that we do not share the zero-sum thinking based on rival spheres of influence or the use of coercion.  Let me be absolutely clear: neither the Eastern Partnership nor the bilateral relations between the EU and any of its partners have ever, nor will they ever, be directed against anyone. But let me be equally clear, the EU will continue to stand up for our partners as they make free, sovereign choices about their foreign and trade policies.  In addition to being a major opportunity to reconfirm our commitment to the Eastern Partnership, the summit in Riga will also be a valuable occasion to get our partners’ views on the future of the European Neighbourhood Policy. We want to make sure that in redesigning our policy for the future we have listened to our partners and taken their views fully into account. Let me re-state that we offer our Eastern European partners a genuine partnership. We do not impose choices on our partners. Differentiation in our bilateral relations will need to be further enhanced, taking account of each partner`s ambitions and needs. The full engagement of partners’ governments is crucial in bringing about the necessary reforms.  Nevertheless, no government is able to succeed in such an endeavour without the broad support of the people. Successful transformation is only possible if it emerges as a result of joint efforts of society as a whole.  The nurturing of constituencies for reform able to influence national decision-making is imperative. Local authorities, parliamentarians  (including this House), the business community and civil society have a very important role to play in the Eastern Partnership. We therefore count on this House to help us stand with our partners in delivering the chance their citizens desire.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1786, "date": "2015-05-20.json", "name": "Ulrike LUNACEK", "mepid": "97017", "text": "   I now have an answer for Mr Kelly and also for all the others who wanted to know.

I think it is deplorable that the Commission chair is empty at such an important debate. If this is a signal of the importance which the Commission attaches to the Eastern Partnership programme, then I am sorry for Riga. Now, please start my time. The Eastern Partnership is a well-designed policy of strategic importance and it is very much needed by the EU because it impacts on economics, prosperity and security and because the primary mission of the Union is peace. And it is very much needed by our neighbours because they want to transform themselves in line with the European model. The Eastern Partnership is a work in progress and it will continue, with necessary modifications and reinforcements. There was an attempt by Russia to derail the Eastern Partnership by pressing for Ukraine to refuse to sign it in Vilnius. Euromaidan gave a clear answer and stood up to the Russian pressure, and the people of Ukraine said: we want European values. Then Russia waged a war against their choice, but Russia will fail in trying to stop the Eastern Partnership and the free choices of free peoples. An old rule says ‘When a bear charges, do not retreat’. In Riga, the EU will stick to its plan and will stay on course. When somebody tries to stop you, you have two choices: either to backtrack or to progress further with redoubled energy. The second is our choice because, firstly, it is the strong will of our partners and, secondly, it is in the fundamental interest of the EU and it reflects our values.

It provides the EU's neighbours with a framework for political and economic cooperation, enabling intensive trade relations and greater social exchanges. The Eastern Partnership is an offer of cooperation as closely as possible to neighbours who do not want to be or want to become members of the EU. So there is nothing to stand in the way of good cooperation with Armenia and Azerbaijan from this point of view, simply because they have rejected the offer of an association agreement and an extended free trade agreement. However, foreign trade and external relations must also be able to orientate themselves there in line with our values. It is useful that the Commission has initiated a review of the Neighbourhood Policy. And, in view of the enormous security challenges in the neighbourhood, which Mr Saryusz-Wolski also addressed – now in Ukraine – it is probably not the right time to completely change the current policy. But the Riga Summit must send a clear signal that the EU wants to make its cooperation with its eastern partners not only better, but also more efficient. More solidarity, yes, but also more efficiency and effectiveness in concrete terms with the individual partners. It is time to remember the strengths of the Eastern Partnership, the concrete offers of cooperation and support for the strengthening of state institutions, for democratic reforms, for improved regional cooperation.

The pressure Russia has exerted on the three associated partner countries of Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine in recent years is enormous. This presents us with new geopolitical challenges.  I do not condemn the build-up of Russian troops on our Eastern European borders or their presence in Ukraine. Contrary. Russia is invited to determine the terms of the free trade agreement with Ukraine.   Last week I was here in Kiev and in eastern Ukraine with some of my colleagues. We saw the disastrous consequences of the aggression supported by Russia. Very direct for the many families that were under attack: this here is a scrape, a shrapnel from a Russian Grad projectile that destroyed the home of a family in Marioepol. Consequences for the whole country as well.  I want to warn you here. The conflict sucks the blood out of the country, not only financially, but also psychologically. The population is becoming tired and disillusioned. Reforms demand sacrifices from the people. They must nevertheless feel that Europe will reward their efforts. There is an atmosphere of defeatism. We must not lose these people. They expect a clear and positive signal from Riga. Clearer and more positive than is now the case in the draft text.

As a result, we have today three associated partners of the EU on the map of Europe: Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine.

We believe that the Riga Summit should act in an ambitious way and in the spirit of solidarity with our associated partners. Firstly, we call on the EU leaders in Riga to recognise the future membership perspective of Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine. Clarity on this, along with the criteria and requirements, will be the right step and is needed today, not tomorrow. Secondly, we urge in Riga to commit to extending the visa-free regime to the citizens of Georgia and Ukraine by setting definite deadlines, hopefully by the end of this year, for the completion of their visa liberalisation plans.

This is already demonstrated by the announcements of the summit, in which we talk about differentiated relations, but at the same time announce the continuation of the EU's previous policy, regardless of the expectations of the partners. Obviously, Mr Saryusz-Wolski, you are right to refer to the Commission's absence here in the Chamber. Contradictions also characterise the main points of the summit: strengthening the rule of law – yes. But we have to ask what the EU is actually doing to ensure that corrupt oligarchs in Moldova do not overturn a prime minister, that Ukraine cannot, contrary to our fundamental values, ban parties as we see fit. According to a recent survey by the Gorzhenin Institute of the government in Kiev, just over three quarters of the population of Ukraine certify that there are no real, profound reforms that have been long awaited since the Majdan protests. These are the realities against which the summit must be measured. Another reality for Riga is that it is difficult to leave out social rights and social justice issues from the outset: unemployment rates of just under 20% in Armenia and Georgia – which are much higher among young people – and an almost halved female employment rate, as in Moldova, signals profound socio-economic transformation processes that require more than the \"development of market opportunities\".

Therefore our Group has welcomed the review process initiated by Commissioner Hahn and the work on its broad conclusions as well – so far. Differentiation, which is the core word of this review, is reasonable and probably unavoidable in the Eastern Partnership. Nevertheless, we should not forget that three of the partnership countries signed an Association Agreement with us and under the DCFTAs, they are aligning their economies with that of the European Union. They should be offered primarily a credible European perspective, and we should help them in the short and the medium term to offset the social costs which are associated with that economic alignment.  The more-for-more principle of neighbourhood policies in general makes sense only if it also implies a less-for-less policy. We believe it would be right and proper to increase the more-for-more financial allocations which are currently at 20 % and direct them towards the associated countries. In order to be credible, the European neighbourhood policy requires proper financial support. The EUR 2 billion allocated yearly both to southern and eastern neighbours allows neither a credible commitment nor an ambitious policy.

Low ambition in Riga will mean a dramatic impact – a negative one – on Europe and on our eastern side. I call on both sides, the Commission and the Member States, to make sure that the Riga Summit sends the positive message our Eastern partners need. The EU cannot and must not suffocate the expectations and aspirations of our partners and their people, but must rather encourage and compensate their efforts, show them that the European integration path is even more open than before and offer them messages and opportunities that can also counter the heavy pressure from Russian propaganda. From this point, I see a clear and important step that should be taken, namely the free visa regime for Georgia and Ukraine. Let us not give something else, but something we can do and which should be done according to the efforts those countries have made.

For example, it is not clear why visa-free travel with Georgia, which has already fulfilled all the conditions, has not been introduced. I know that the Commission intends to take a positive decision in the near future, but I am not clear why this was not done.  It is a matter of attitude. We don't even notice that we act arrogantly. The problem is that the European Union is trying to play the role of big brother in this relationship, but that is a big mistake. Our partners are allergic to this from previous times.

At the same time, as a Presidency I can only underline that several Commissioners are already in Riga today because, as I mentioned, several side events – for example the first Eastern Partnership Media Conference, have started already. So we do appreciate also, as a Presidency, the very good cooperation with the Commission on preparation of this Eastern Partnership Summit and it is very important to have several Commissioners in Riga today already. Coming back to our debate, please allow me, once again on behalf of the High Representative, to underline that we have listened carefully to all that has been said here today during the debate. Please rest assured that we will be taking into consideration all the comments and proposals made by Members. Let me reiterate that the Riga Summit will demonstrate that the Eastern Partnership remains our priority and will send a clear political signal that, firstly, the EU is strongly committed to its Eastern Partnership and determined to pursue closer tailor-made relations with its independent and sovereign Eastern European partners. We will therefore continue to give every support to those partners which have taken on mobilisation on the most ambitious reform commitments through all the association agreements.  The summit marks a new level in our relations with our partners, the most ambitious: our bilateral association agreements with the three partners.  Secondly, our partnership involves six partner countries. I cannot stress enough the importance of maintaining the inclusivity of the partnership. The EU will therefore continue to engage strongly with all partners whatever their individual level of relations with the EU.  Thirdly, we will step up our strategic communication efforts to explain what the relations with our partners are about and what they are not about, and we will certainly argue that they are not directed against any third party. We will therefore continue our dialogue with those who challenge this.  Several Members also raised the question of the European perspective for Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine and the strength of the reflections in the Riga Declaration. Let me first of all stress that the drafting process of the joint declaration of the Eastern Partnership Summit is still ongoing.  Negotiations are of an inclusive nature between both our Member States and partners. Negotiations are still ongoing and therefore, at this stage, we still await the final outcome of these negotiations. The agreed consensus will have to reflect each country’s specific needs, priorities and aspirations and the common interests they share with the EU, as well as the EUʼs interests, while making a realistic assessment of what can be achieved within the next few years. In this context, Riga should highlight first and furthermost that we have moved to a new level in our relations with the three partners with whom we have signed the most ambitious ever bilateral association agreements, but it should also signal our readiness to work for more tailor-made agreements with others to ensure that the Partnership remains an inclusive framework.  I believe we share the opinion that preparation for the Eastern Partnership Summit in Riga is of such utmost importance that we could take much more time to discuss several topics and more details. But respecting your agenda, I will save time and, in concluding, I will just mention that I highly appreciate your commitment and support for the Eastern Partnership, and that relations with national parliaments and the role of Euronest in promoting and consolidating the Eastern Partnership are highly important. Together we must help partners realise their full potential.

Since then, Russia has annexed Crimea with military force, constantly seeking to destabilize eastern Ukraine. At the current riga summit, Europe must give a punchy response to the Russian threat. The entry into force of the new financial assistance to Ukraine, the Association and Free Trade Agreement, point in this direction.  The EU must equip eastern partnership policy with adequate political and economic resources to counterbalance partner countries against Russian punitive measures. Preventing further violence and the political and economic stability of Ukraine is in the EU's top interest. We cannot let Ukraine down after we have pulled away from the honeybee of EU accession. However, the EU cannot give in to its principles to Ukraine either: the independence of the Ukrainian judiciary, the sound rule of law, democratic principles and the suppression of corruption are non-negotiable.

Madam President, honourable Members, we have the next topic on our agenda. I am glad to participate in this discussion on the next summit between the EU and the Community of Latin America and Caribbean States (CELAC), which will take place on 10 and 11 June 2015 in Brussels for the first time.  It will be the second summit held with CELAC as a counterpart, but the eighth ever, since our partnership with the region was launched in Rio back in 1999. As Members are well aware, events all around Europe’s neighbourhood keep a good deal of attention focused there. But the EU, as a global player, does not lower its guard in its relations with other regions of the world. In some areas, we find regions which are luckily more stable, sometimes giving the false impression that the international community is less in demand.  Latin America and the Caribbean is such a region, and the upcoming Summit of Heads of State and Government in June will be a critical moment to infuse new dynamism into our relations. We want to create a real partnership for the next generation. Under the general heading ‘Shaping our common future: working for prosperous, cohesive and sustainable societies for our citizens,’ we intend to highlight the many dimensions of our relations.  Features such as a common cultural heritage, common values, a strong belief in regionalism and in an effective multilateralism – if combined well – have the capacity to unlock opportunities through our cooperation with the region.  The strategic bi-regional partnership that unites the EU and the region has been active for over 15 years. In this time, we have strengthened our relations, making the EU the main investor and a key trading partner, with 26 association or free trade agreements out of 33 countries. However, on the political front, we can still do more to tackle effectively global issues together. This is why part of the summit’s discussion will focus on exploring possible areas of convergence as regards key international processes.  Negotiations around climate change, the post-2015 development agenda or the international debate on drugs issues, in view of the Special Session of the United Nations General Assembly in 2016, will be the object of one of the three working sessions.  In order to materialise our common priorities, we also intend to adopt a reviewed and expanded EU-CELAC Action Plan, which will include new areas of cooperation such as higher education and citizen security. This shows how much we are linked.  Citizen security in Latin America and the Caribbean affects stability in our neighbourhood, through organised crime along the ‘cocaine route’, right into Europe. Our scientific communities on both sides of the Atlantic are working together on similar projects; they will link up more easily through a fibre-optic cable connection which the EU will promote.  The summit will also serve to highlight some historical developments taking place in the region. We will manifest our support to the ongoing reforms in Cuba. The summit will encourage the peace talks in Colombia and confirm the willingness to support peace implementation, including through an EU trust fund.  As a reflection of the change that the region has experienced in the last 10 to 15 years, the summit will also present new, innovative modalities of cooperation, for instance by means of triangular cooperation schemes. These will enable us to join forces with the more developed countries of the region in support of the less developed ones.  We must recognise that the region is diverse, and that while CELAC is certainly an inclusive political dialogue framework for our bi-regional relations, we need also to engage with the sub-regions and bilaterally. This is why, in the afternoon of the 11 June, we will hold two high-level political dialogue meetings, specifically with the Caribbean and with Central American countries. As was said before, the EU and CELAC share a strategic bi-regional partnership. Allow me to highlight the concept of ‘strategic’. I started out pointing out the challenges of instability very close to our borders. Through our relations with third countries and regions, it is also our intention to reinforce alliances around the fundamental principles of the international order which are currently under attack. Basic principles such as the rule of law, territorial integrity and sovereignty affect us all equally, beyond any particular geographical location.  Finally, I would like to highlight that the EU’s relations with the region are not limited to governmental relations. In fact, it is our aim that relations become ever-stronger between citizens, and their representatives. In this sense, I welcome very much the work being done by the Euro-Latin American Parliamentary Assembly (EuroLat), which will hold its Plenary Session just a few days before the Summit.  The EuroLat conclusions will be presented to the summit alongside other preparatory events, and will certainly enrich its outcome, precisely as a reflection of the multiple layers that we find in the relations with the region.

In the light of the forthcoming EU-CELAC Summit, Mrs Kalnya-Luka-evica. It is true, as Mrs Kalnya-Luka-evica has said, that it is the second already under this format, which is a good sign of the dynamism of this regional integration body, which we have certainly supported since its inception. In a world, ladies and gentlemen, increasingly economically integrated, but more politically fragmented, where crises are unfortunately no exception, but a constant one, it is of paramount importance to strengthen the vitality of our bi-regional relationship. Particular interest also arouses deepening our economic and trade relations. In this regard, we hope from this Parliament that the agreements with Mexico and Chile will be reviewed. We are confident of an early revival of negotiations with Mercosur. And we hope that the process for the approval of the agreement with Ecuador will develop as quickly as possible, and the country can be integrated in the successful Multiparts Trade Agreement with Colombia and Peru.  Madam President, we hope that the European Commission will speed up the visa waiver process for the citizens of Colombia and Peru, as it no longer makes any sense for this matter to take longer.  We also welcome the changes taking place in Cuba and the progress of our negotiations with Havana. We may attend a historic milestone if everyone live up to the circumstances. As friends, we hope that lasting peace can be achieved in Colombia.  Nothing would be more rewarding if bullets were exchanged for votes in that beloved country, as we once heard President Santos say here in this very House.  But also, ladies and gentlemen, since respect for the Venezuelan people, we must condemn without mitigation the unacceptable drift of President Maduro's government. We hope that, on the occasion of the Summit, Venezuela will not be the protagonist for its outings of tone but for its positive participation. And, at this point, you will find sure understanding and solidarity. Ladies and gentlemen, Latin America is the region of the world with the most elements in common with Europe.

I think we are taking a serious risk that Latin America's most dynamic countries will start looking more towards the Pacific than the Atlantic. Indeed, the Pacific Alliance is one of the most dynamic economic alliances at the moment in Latin America, largely as a result of a set of investments and trade agreements, not only with Korea or Japan, but also and especially with China.  I believe that in recent years, Madam Minister, the Council and the European Union in general have not been close enough to Latin America. We have wasted precious time even though, as you said, we are a fundamental strategic bi-regional alliance because we have a lot of common elements — such as a common history, common languages and beliefs in values, in democracy, in human rights that are common — to do much and good in the whole world: Latin America and the European Union.  It is this set of reflections that we will set out from Eurolat to the Summit of Heads of State, very happyly accepting the invitation they offer us in this direction. But the fundamental message is that we must intensify our work with Latin America; that we must indeed help to conclude new and better agreements with the countries with which we already have political and trade agreements; that Colombia and Peru must be relieved of the visa requirement, as has been said; to be helped in Cuba; to be helped in Colombia; that democracy in Venezuela must also be helped. We must help, that is, dialogue, and therefore make it easier not to destroy democracy in that country, and we will probably have to send some concrete messages for democracy in Venezuela to be saved and secured.

It will also be a decisive moment to correct some successes in relations between the regions of Latin America and Europe. The deadlock in the free trade agreement between the European Union and Mercosur has caused some of these countries to focus on preferential trade agreements with Japan and the United States.  The European Union, as its largest investor in celac countries, cannot be left behind. I believe, therefore, that we will have to strengthen our bilateral relations with some Latin American countries, such as Brazil, a true regional power. I would like to cite, as an example, the need to speed up the construction of a digital submarine cable, which will connect Latin America to Europe via Brazil-Portugal. Another example will be the strengthening of the aeronautical sector on both sides of the Atlantic through cooperation with companies such as Brazil's Embraer, whose large investments in my country have been a success story.

The EU continues to provide aid to the poorest Latin American countries at bilateral level with development cooperation, and it increased regional cooperation to foster integration. The overall budget for 2014-2020 under the Development Cooperation Instrument is about EUR 2.4 billion. You also asked about trade negotiations.

With a view to ensuring swift implementation, the Youth Employment Initiative was front-loaded and expenditure was made eligible as of 1 September 2013. Yet well over one year into the programme, the results on the ground do not meet initial expectations. Measures designed to allow for a quick uptake of funds have not led to a quick and efficient mobilisation of the Youth Employment Initiative, and opportunities to urgently address youth unemployment have been left unused. The initiative was initially proposed by the European Council, yet at present – over one-and-a-half years after expenditure was made eligible – Member States’ use of its resources falls far short of expectations, and progress is uneven. Besides a lack of liquidity to launch the Youth Employment Initiative, an issue now addressed by the proposed substantial increase in pre-financing, what is holding Member States back? How does the Council intend to urgently encourage swift and efficient implementation? The Member States faced with the highest youth unemployment rates and hardest hit by the crisis are, on average, lagging behind in using Youth Employment Initiative resources and implementing Youth Guarantee schemes, while long-term policies are needed to address this issue.  What specific hurdles do they face? What improvements can the Council promise? Can the Council ensure sound funding for the Youth Employment Initiative once the frontloading funds have been used? Parliament is expecting a quick, efficient and result-oriented use of the additional pre-financing within 12 months after the entry into force of the amending regulation. What measures does the Council envisage in order to assure the young unemployed, and Parliament, of this swift use of funds? How does it intend to report on progress to the young unemployed, to Parliament, and to other stakeholders involved? Can the Council promise an assessment of progress six months after the entry into force of the amending regulation? How does the Council intend to proceed where those results do not meet expectations, even after the current increased pre-financing?", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1859, "date": "2015-05-20.json", "name": "Zanda Kalniņa-Lukaševica", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Madam President, I am grateful for this opportunity to discuss with you the youth labour market situation in the European Union. The Presidency attached great importance to improving the conditions of groups facing the biggest challenges to accessing or remaining in employment. These groups include, in particular, young people, and among them especially those without proper education and skills.  Fighting youth unemployment and ensuring sustainable labour market integration remains a top priority for the EU. Indeed, the Europe 2020 strategy has put a special focus on implementing effective measures to address youth unemployment.  The reality is that youth unemployment is still at a very high level in several Member States, leading to underutilised talents, the loss of human resources and, in some cases, leaving damaging consequences for the rest of the working life.  In this context, the Youth Guarantee, together with the financial provisions of the Youth Employment Initiative, are highly relevant: both measures seek to support the fight against youth unemployment in the most affected regions, namely those with youth unemployment rates above 25%.  As a positive example, I would like to underscore the experience of Latvia. Latvia is one of the countries which started the implementation of the Youth Guarantee as of January 2014. We can already see the first results: the youth unemployment rate decreased by 3.8% in 2014. A lot depends on the programmes implemented by the Member States. Nevertheless, it is already clear that more needs to be done.  Despite the promising stimulus, the Youth Employment Initiative and the Youth Guarantee are not a panacea to solve Europe’s youth unemployment problems. They are part of a range of tools to address the issue. As we all know, the shorter implementation period of the Youth Employment Initiative compared to the Multiannual Financial Framework cycle means that concrete progress in the first years will be crucial for the overall success of the Initiative. This can help to tackle the problem faced by the millions of young Europeans who are without a job and who do not have adequate access to education or training.  Therefore, I am convinced that the honourable Members of the European Parliament share my view that any further delay in the implementation of the Youth Employment Initiative is likely to weaken the impact of actions undertaken by Member States to combat youth unemployment. One of the main obstacles in the implementation of the Youth Employment Initiative is the lack of sufficient cash flow to provide advance payments to beneficiaries. The Presidency wants to highlight the importance and timeliness of the current legislative proposal to accelerate the implementation of the Youth Employment Initiative. I therefore fully agree with the European Parliament that making funding available to Member States earlier in the implementation process is a key condition for improving the performance and generating tangible results soon. Sufficient liquidity at the beginning of the implementation process will allow for faster delivery of the relevant policy measures set out in the national Youth Guarantee Implementation Plans. We can be proud that the current amending legislative proposal has been finalised in record time. The Council adopted the draft proposal yesterday. Today, immediately after your vote, we, together with President Schulz, co—signed the text already. After the publication, which will occur in the coming week, Member States will be able to receive pre-financing.  In total, the initial pre-financing made available from the specific allocation for the Youth Employment Initiative will be increased to about EUR 1 billion in 2015.  I would like to take this opportunity to reaffirm that the Council will continue to actively monitor developments concerning the youth employment situation and the implementation by the Member States of the Youth Guarantee and the Youth Employment Initiative. At the same time, we need to keep in mind that the causes behind youth unemployment are complex. The increase in funding is complementary to other measures and reforms that Member States have to make in order to tackle the different crisis-related and structural problems behind the youth employment situation. All in all, to significantly reduce unemployment, we need to do more to create new jobs.

But this initiative for youth employment corresponds to a real need of citizens; you were talking about the importance of the number of unemployed young people that calls for a very strong reaction.  However, in the first year of operation of this youth employment initiative, there was a real weakness in the Implementation of the Member States. There are some good examples — you're quoting them right now — but that's not the case everywhere. Was it a lack of funding? We reacted immediately to the quarter turn. On this subject, for once, the reaction of the European Union has been of exceptional speed.  And in three months, we increase pre-financing from 1% to 3%. Thank you to all the political groups who helped us react. Thank you to the Council and thank you to the Commission.

Today, the European Parliament is calling on the Member States to show seriousness in tackling the scourge of unemployment among young Europeans. We need assurances that the Council is prepared to fight for its young people, whatever the cost: 'ready to do whatever it takes', to use a terminology that we are all well aware of.  We have said this before, I repeat today: Parliament has played a team game with the Commission and the Council in approving the amendment to the ESF regulation, thus allowing the release of resources for the Member States in record time. However, the time has now come to produce results, to launch programmes and to overcome obstacles once and for all.  This is not just a financial problem, though. Firstly, major problems linked to excessive bureaucracy in the registration of programmes for both young people and companies, the partners who would like to join, will have to be resolved. It will also be essential to strengthen the communication aspect of these programmes, which is totally inadequate to date. Many young people, especially those who need it most, do not even know the existence of the youth guarantee and the youth employment initiative. This is frankly absurd.  We need to change gears quickly. Efforts must be stepped up so that young people receive quality offers, preventing the risk of these instruments becoming an antechamber to precariousness or even an instrument of exploitation. All this must be pursued by the Member States, with the help of the Commission and with the supervision of Parliament. They must rise to a challenge that can define or cost the fortunes of an entire generation. The youth employment initiative alone is not capable of creating new jobs. There are no magic wands: alongside the rapid and efficient use of all the resources offered by the Union, we need to combine a policy of economic growth that depends on investments in strategic sectors. In essence, therefore, we need a European industrial policy, the ability to distribute income in a Union that is still too marked by inequalities to leave a better future for future generations.

I do not need to quote the youth unemployment figures. All of us in this House know that they are unacceptably high. The EU institutions have put forward the Youth Employment Initiative as their response to youth unemployment. We are supposed to be adding value at European level and yet, so far, unfortunately, there seems to be little European added value. If we are to be successful, the Council must play its role (and it is a hugely important role) in implementing the Youth Employment Initiative. There is plenty of flexibility within the Youth Employment Initiative: the possibility to provide traineeships and apprenticeships, the provision of first job experience, targeted and well-designed wage and recruitment subsidies, job and training mobility measures and start-up support for young entrepreneurs.

As important as this question is, I would assume that at least 99% of EU citizens do not have a clue what an oral question actually is and what this debate is about. So I thought I should explain. It is stated in the question that the financial and economic crisis ʽhas caused youth unemployment to reach alarming levels in many Member States’. Let me translate this statement briefly and bluntly.  Neo-liberal policies, following a deregulation agenda, have messed up European economies and created massive levels of youth unemployment in recent years. The group most affected by this are young people who had no opportunity to influence the policies that led to this situation. Now, as a reaction to this, we see a common pattern – youth is blamed, the EU reacts, the EU allocates money. For me, it is still far too little, but, well, the EU allocated money to fight youth unemployment that is now supposed to be spent by the Member States in the regions most affected by youth unemployment. The oral question reads: ‘results on the ground do not meet initial expectations’. Wow! This sentence is almost too diplomatic to even be translated, but I will try. Many Members of this Parliament, including me, are simply outraged by the fact that the money allocated to the Member States for the Youth Employment Initiative has still, after 22 months, not been properly taken up. We, as parliamentarians, thus use this tool of an oral question to tell the Member States very clearly that we need to see action now. I hope that many citizens will follow this example and go out on the streets, write letters and pose questions to their governments, urging them to take action.

Because, unfortunately, we are currently working in the emergency of a very serious problem, such as unemployment, which obviously does not allow us to make long-term projects, which does not allow us to think about the future, create jobs and innovate. Mrs Morin-Chartier made one point: she said that very often the youth employment initiative is confused with the youth guarantee, and this is a problem that ministers and Heads of Government very often have. Very often, unfortunately, I have to say that many people probably do not even know what the youth employment initiative is, and they also do not know what the guarantee is for young people, and not to make a difference between the two and to determine which is one and which is the other. This is even more serious, because if we knew what the opportunities were, if specific programmes were made that really take into account the needs of our young people, well, perhaps we could make policies that are much more effective, which is unfortunately not the case in my country. We missed all the goals.

Members have asked what is holding Member States back. At this point in time, it is still difficult to fully assess the actual progress on the ground, as the reporting cycle at EU level has not yet started. Aside from the financial liquidity issue, which is the most pressing one, I could refer to three other challenges to the sufficiently speedy mobilisation and uptake of Youth Employment Initiative measures: firstly, some Member States lack the implementing structures; secondly, there is the matter of finalising the designation of competent authorities, which has also been emphasised by some Member States; and, thirdly, there are a number of issues related to the administrative capacity of the national, regional and local structures implementing Youth Employment Initiative measures.  So how does the Council intend to urgently encourage swift and efficient implementation? The Council considers, in line with the European Parliament, that sufficient liquidity will also allow for a faster implementation of the relevant policy measures set out in the national Youth Guarantee implementation plans. The new proposal to increase pre-financing should contribute to a quicker mobilisation of resources and thus to increasing the capacity of national authorities to launch calls for projects and to process applications more speedily. The additional pre-financing will be paid to Member States immediately after the entry into force of the amending regulation. A positive impact could be expected soon. On the other hand, the implementation of the Youth Guarantee requires both structural reforms and measures targeting individuals. Member States are currently implementing a mix of national youth employment policies on the basis of their individual needs and priorities, with the Youth Guarantee Scheme representing one of these measures. All relevant Member States have submitted their Youth Guarantee implementation plans and the implementation at national level is being regularly monitored by the Council, based on contributions from the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs in a multilateral and indicator-based process. Exchange of experience between Member States is also important, as well as impact evaluation of the measures carried out.  To conclude, I would like to underline that Member States are currently in the process of submitting structured data reports on the implementation of the Youth Employment Initiative. These reports will provide an overview, also limited, of the progress made by Member States in the implementation of the Youth Employment Initiative, which will feed into the Commission’s analysis of further measures and into the regular monitoring by the Council.  Effective monitoring is thus one of the preconditions of successful implementation and continuity of sound funding. In this respect the Council, on the basis of the work of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, is pursuing a multilateral surveillance on implementation and undertaking a peer review on the progress in the implementation of the reforms addressed in the country-specific recommendations.  Last but not least, based on the experience of 2014 and with little improvement of the youth employment figures in some of the hardest-hit Member States, it can be expected that this issue will be addressed in the framework of the 2015 European Semester debate. In any case, the Council will discuss this issue in more detail at the June session in conjunction with a special report of the Court of Auditors. Member States will also have to further strengthen their efforts, focus on implementing relevant structural reforms and deliver quality measures to enable young people to participate in the labour market, training or education. These will also be very important measures. To sum up, the Council shares the view that more needs to be done to fight youth unemployment. I have just mentioned a few examples of measures underway in the Council and the Commission with the aim to make the system more effective. I cannot promise Members a miracle solution tomorrow, but I can firmly say that hard work is being done to find a solution as soon as possible.

At the time, youth unemployment in the Europe of 28 was around 23%. Almost two years later, in October 2014, the average youth unemployment in the Eurozone was also around 23%. In other words, an initiative in which, by 2020, we will give EUR 6 billion, has so far brought poor, if not minimal, results. Youth unemployment continues to gallop. In the countries of the European south, more than 40% of young people, and in Greece in particular, about 50% are unemployed. This tragic phenomenon was further exacerbated during the years of crisis and austerity. This clearly shows that the measures imposed by the dominant political and social forces in the European Union not only do not break the deadlock, but plunge us deeper into it.

Madam President, the last point in today’s agenda: Japanese whaling activities in the Antarctic. The issue of Japanese whaling activities in the Antarctic is not new, but it gained new prominence in 2010 when Australia filed an application with the International Court of Justice against Japanʼs programme called JARPA II.  In its application, Australia contested the legality of JARPA II as being incompatible with the International Convention on the Regulation of Whaling. The International Court delivered its judgment on 31 March 2014 and found against Japan on a number of counts. We read this judgment with great interest, as we consider it offers a definitive interpretation of the Convention and its Schedule, and clarifies the legal framework for scientific whaling. It is an important milestone for all contracting governments to the International Whaling Commission (IWC), certainly when it comes to assessing the necessity of having recourse to lethal methods of sampling where non-lethal alternatives exist. The Presidency, at that time, on behalf of the EU and its Member States, expressed this view at the meeting of the International Whaling Commission held in September 2014, in Portorož, in Slovenia. We supported the adoption of Resolution 2014-5, called ‘Whaling under Special Permit’, which offers, among other elements, directions for the Scientific Committee to consider when assessing new and existing special permit research programmes. Yesterday, the IWC Scientific Committee began its meeting in San Diego. Japan has submitted a proposal for a new special permit research programme in the Antarctic Ocean, which is currently being reviewed under what is known as the ʽAnnex P processʼ. The findings of the Expert Panel set up by the Scientific Committee will be reviewed and the Scientific Committee should make a recommendation to the IWC. The European Union and its Member States have always favoured an approach that would preserve both the independence of the Scientific Committee, as a scientific forum, and the policy prerogatives of the IWC as the ultimate decision-making authority under the International Convention. Under this approach, policy matters should not be discussed in San Diego.  We remain ready to engage politically with Japan at the appropriate level and in the appropriate forum, once the Scientific Committee has issued its recommendations to the International Whaling Commission.

Yes, let us not hide behind a finger: behind scientific research we want to disguise a purely commercial activity.

However, since then over 30 000 whales have been killed and Japan has contributed to this massacre, because it is one of only three countries continuing to hunt whales.  It justifies this under scientific research, but the rest of the world has always seen this as an excuse to continue whale hunting for food. The ICJ ruled this March that there was a lack of scientific merit in Japan’s whale hunting programs, yet, since the court’s ruling, Japan has announced another 12-year whaling program. It is truly horrifying that Japan continues such practices with no sign of scientific reports; there are just no excuses for the killing of whales.
