Terrorists who, on an unprecedented scale, have, with unprecedented brutality, ripped ordinary people, especially young men and women, out of their lives and murdered them in a bestial manner. Today, as an institution based in France, we are on French soil for the first time since these attacks. Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, by thanking all of you for your great sympathy over the past week in the expressions of condolences here, I repeat once again our full solidarity with the French nation, our attention to the families of those who have been murdered, our hope for the seriously injured people that they will soon recover. However, this also applies to the victims of the attacks in Bamako. This also applies to the victims of the attacks in other places where innocent people are slaughtered by insane terrorists. Ladies and gentlemen! We live in a time of enormous challenges. The number of attacks that we should remember here because we cannot make a hierarchy in the list of victims and each victim is worth the same to us – this list is long. That is why a commemoration of the victims in Paris and in Bamako is at the same time a commemoration of the victims, of the innocent in other places on the planet, and especially in Syria and Iraq, where this self-proclaimed Islamic State is trying to destroy all basic rights, almost civilisational values, with its brutality. Every commemoration is a tribute to the victims of this violence. In this sense, not only for the victims of Paris and Bamako, but for the victims of terrorism as a whole, I ask you to rise from your seats. (The House rose and observed a minute's silence) Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen! This morning I had the sad duty to represent the European Parliament at the State Act for the late former Federal Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany, Helmut Schmidt. With Helmut Schmidt, an outstanding politician died not only of the Federal Republic of Germany, but of the European Union. Helmut Schmidt, as you all know, was one of the creators of the European Monetary System, in particular with former President Valéry Giscard d'Estaing. Schmidt made a huge contribution to deepening European integration and to cooperation between peoples across borders during his time as head of government, but also later as a publicist. Helmut Schmidt was a head of government who, in the country from which I come, in the country from which I come, maintained a principle from which, I believe, we can learn today, a principle best expressed in Albert Camus's sentence: \"Those who fail in the reconciliation of freedom and security fail in everything.\" I believe that this should guide us for the next challenges ahead. We must make the security of our citizens, including our own, as effective as possible. But we must never allow those who want to frighten us to destroy our freedoms. That is the task of the European Parliament in particular.

We did not want to give the impression that we were going to adopt the commission's report and then decide later whether we would extend its mandate. We thought it was important to combine the two decisions so as not to create the impression among the public that this Parliament is not interested in the issue. In the meantime, I have received very clear messages from different political groups , and therefore from the majority, which is in favour of the extension, that the Conference of Presidents could take a decision on Thursday and put it to the vote of this assembly on Thursday at noon. In that case, the problem would disappear and we could adopt the report on Wednesday and vote on the extension of the commission on Thursday.

This will mark the WTO’s 20th anniversary and it is the first such conference taking place in Africa. This is a conference that is taking place at a critical moment for the WTO. Following the success of the last such conference in Bali and the adoption of the Trade Facilitation Agreement, there were high hopes that we would advance towards a comprehensive agreement on the Doha Development Agenda, and the EU worked really hard to achieve this. Unfortunately, many countries have not been able or willing to look for a compromise on cutting the trade-distorting subsidies they provide to their farmers. In Nairobi we need to free the machinery of the WTO from the constraints that have been holding it back for so many years. We need to move ahead. The Ministerial Conference needs to take decisions on parts of the Doha Round and agree on what to do next. We are now working in Geneva intensively to create convergence around three main outcomes that are attainable and where we all see that there are development credentials. The first one is to aim for an agreement to discipline the use of all forms of agricultural export support, which is an important long-standing and pro-development issue that needs a coherent, balanced and multilateral solution. Together with the Government of Brazil and a few other WTO members, the European Union has tabled a formal proposal for a comprehensive solution addressing agricultural export subsidies, but also export credits and other similar measures. I am convinced that this is a good basis for discussion and a compromise, and it also showcases the positive effects of the major agricultural reforms that we have been conducting here in the EU. Without them, it would have been impossible to achieve a situation where we table a joint agricultural proposal with Brazil. So we are now working on this in Geneva to gather support. Secondly, we also need to make sure that we can deliver for the benefit of the poorest and most vulnerable WTO members: the least-developed countries. Here we are looking at, for instance, duty-free; quota-free; cotton; rules of origin. The third item where we need to deliver is an outcome strengthening notification and transparency requirements in the WTO. Achieving consensus on these issues will be linked to the need for an agreement on the path forward for the WTO after the Ministerial Conference. This is going to be challenging. Our interests here are very clear. The WTO needs to continue the work on unresolved issues. They can only be effectively addressed by multilateral solutions – trade-distorting domestic support in agriculture, rules or regulatory issues, for instance – but we need to approach these issues with fresh ideas, as the old approaches have clearly not delivered the result, and in this connection large emerging countries must assume greater responsibilities. Similarly, we need to aim to ensure that the Ministerial Conference begins the process of opening the Organization to considering new issues and acknowledges the possibilities for WTO members to negotiate issues within smaller groups of interested members.

In the European Union, in the European People's Party we have always made a firm commitment to multilateralism and obviously the right framework to carry it out is undoubtedly the World Trade Organisation. An approach that, as demonstrated by agreements such as the Trade Facilitation Agreement, seeks in particular to improve the economic situation of all its member countries. Because let us have no doubt: the greater trade openness, the greater the economic development. There are many examples that prove it. Here I think it should be noted that the Ministerial Conference to be held in Nairobi, as the Commissioner rightly stressed, is going to be a turning point that we all want and we will all contribute to it being for the better, because we need economic growth, we need job creation, now more than ever.  Nor should we forget that multilateralism must not only coexist, but must also be complemented by bilateral agreements, regional agreements and plurilateral agreements through which trade is being liberalized around the world.

We live in a globalised world and our citizens and consumers want the barriers to trade removed. It is therefore difficult to hide my disappointment that we have, once again, failed to make progress within the WTO ahead of the 10th ministerial meeting next month. It appears that this meeting will be something of a damp squib, with a real danger that the parties will not even manage to produce a joint statement following the discussions in Nairobi. It is clear that the Doha Development Agenda has failed, yet somehow we must press ahead with the multilateral agenda and the important issues contained within it. As the Commissioner mentioned, agricultural issues continue to be the most difficult problems to solve when it comes to international trade agreements. Yet it is important to recognise some of the other ambitions that Doha was looking to meet, such as efforts towards making it easier for developing countries to gain access to the international trading market, in turn providing real opportunities for economic development. Instead, we have to make progress in areas that we are able to agree upon – but it looks likely that this will have to come under the framework of a different agreement. So we need a new reinvigorated agenda at the WTO level – one which is not associated with the failures of the past and which can build from the bottom up so that we may look upon the WTO as an organisation that works in the interests of its members. Until then, parties will be forced to work at the bilateral and plurilateral levels, which will be essential to maintain growth and jobs in this globalised world. Within this, the EU must use the influence that it has so that we can push this multilateral agenda forward to achieve real success for all.

We in the EU are undoubtedly a strong trading partner with a great deal of influence. We do not believe that it is desirable for world trade – and for the people of the EU – to impose our free trade agenda on weak trading partners. And we are not alone in this view.

Doha or no Doha, the European Union is a roadblock to free and freer trade. To give one example, which was just previously touched upon, European protectionism in food production has direct consequences which harm the developing world. First, the EU markets are closed to a greater or lesser extent to the export of agricultural products. Secondly, and more damagingly, the European Union dumps agricultural over-production, occasioned by its misallocated agricultural subsidies, onto the world market, and the effect of this is that farmers and food growers in the world outside – especially in those countries that have a large primary sector – are severely damaged. The people adversely affected are some of the poorest in the world. This is not fair trade. There are also other consequences. EU protectionism hurts and harms consumers in the European Union itself. Consumers here have to pay the hiked and inflated European Union price for foods and other goods instead of the world price. Professor Patrick Minford and his colleagues at Cardiff University have calculated that the cost of this to the UK consumer is 8% of the cost of living. It follows that, on Brexit, the cost of living in the UK would be reduced by 8% at least. We may be sure that in other Member States the figure would not be dissimilar. And so it is not just for my country: the dissolution of the EU customs union would be a huge plus for the whole world.

Mr President, today we are discussing the World Trade Organisation and how it, in cooperation with the other similar organisations, will be able to save the world from poverty.  Only for us, all these organisations are part of the problem and one of its main causes and they are obviously not part of the solution.  Advocates of economic and social liberalism want global trade relations to be defined through supranational organisations with the least possible intervention by states. Governments are the only ones that, albeit to a small extent, are somewhat controlled by citizens. On the contrary, these supranational organisations simply transfer power to multinationals and large capital while pretending to care and trying to protect peoples. In fact, it is these organisations that are promoting the liberalisation of markets from all kinds of obstacles and control with disastrous results for workers and for entire societies. Moreover, small and medium-sized enterprises are collapsing, powerless to confront the expansion of large groups actively supported by the World Trade Organisation, at the same time as everyone pretends to care about them. But unable to hide its true face, it is not enough for the World Trade Organisation to control the economic activity of all states. It seeks to impose their views on every aspect of society, on public administration management, tax policy, education, social policies and institutional reforms.

Trade liberalisation is an important tool for achieving sustainable economic growth, and international trade could become the most important external source of financing for development for least developed countries. The importance of trade for sustainable development was also recognised in the recently adopted Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development, where trade has been highlighted as an important tool for achieving new sustainable development goals and inclusive and sustainable development.  It is symbolic that the 10th WTO Ministerial Conference is being held for the first time in Africa, whose development is crucial for us in the European Union. The EU has always advocated and emphasised its commitment to multilateralism, while recognising complementary approaches and interim solutions such as bilateral, regional and plulilateral agreements that can significantly boost trade opening.  But to achieve at least some positive result of this WTO ministerial conference, it is also necessary to identify differences between least developed countries and those rapidly growing middle-income economies. The latter must take greater responsibility for further trade liberalisation as well as the achievement of the 2030 Agenda sustainable development goals. We must also pay attention to the conclusions of the 5th Trade Aid Review Conference, which focused mainly on the trade facilitation agreement, which seeks to help developing countries improve their trade capacity. Only improved customs procedures could, for example, increase global GDP by EUR 68 billion per year, with developing countries benefiting the most.  I therefore welcome the fact that the resolution calls on all WTO members to urgently address the ratification and implementation of this agreement so that it can enter into force before the WTO's 10th Ministerial Conference.

Let us remember that the creation of the WTO represented a fundamental step towards a more integrated and dynamic trading system. The WTO has also meant that developing countries, with economies in transition, and least developed countries can leverage trade to drive their development.  Through the WTO, the European Union has demonstrated its interest in fostering a multilateral framework for trade negotiations that coexists with bilateral, regional and plurilateral agreements.  Our environment is evolving; the international trading system has changed and will continue to do so in the coming years. We are in a more open system, with new countries in transition that are part of a reality to be taken into account.  We must therefore maximise the opportunities emanating from trade, and that is to support a structural reform of the WTO to ensure a more open and fairer trading system that takes into account the interests of SMEs, micro-enterprises and innovative new enterprises.

Firstly, I hope the EU will continue its support for special and differential treatment and put that at the core of some of our debates during the Ministerial Conference, particularly trying to target the least-developed countries (LDCs) to ensure that they benefit from the opening up of trade. As others have said this afternoon, we all welcome the conclusion of the Trade Facilitation Agreement. We should aim to try and get that signed before the Ministerial Conference, and I know the Commissioner is working on that. I do not pretend it is an easy task, but again, the symbolism of getting that done before Nairobi would be vital. We should also (I think it was Mr Rübig who raised the issue) try to push our Member States to deliver on their aid-for-trade commitments. The European Union institutions have largely delivered on the commitments made at Gleneagles a number of years ago; the Member States have almost universally failed to do so.

That is why a global trade agreement is so incredibly important. Yet we have spent the last thirteen years hardening with the DOA round and trying to get it to the finish line. This does not make it any less important – that it has taken a long time – that we achieve success in Nairobi. I would just like to point out three reasons that I think are particularly important at the moment with our success in Nairobi. The first is to kick-start the world economy. At the moment, uncertainty in the world economy is significant and the major risks lie on the downside. The second is that right now, more than ever, we need global rules of the game and global tariffs to meet the jumble of different rules of origin and tariffs that all the free trade agreements we have created, which have exploded in recent years. This is the only option when the multilateral negotiations do not go, which somehow corrects it so that trade does not become expensive and complicated, as it risks becoming. The third reason is that the credibility of the WTO is at stake. The credibility of the WTO as an arena in which negotiations are conducted and for free trade friends and not just an arena for dispute resolution. Just because it is important clearly does not mean that we can expect success. I have learned this in my 12 years of following the issue. As the Commissioner himself points out, I do not have enormous hopes that we will finish the round. On the other hand, I hope for one thing – because there are things that can be done – and that is the success of the sectoral negotiations, the plurilaterals that are taking place on the sidelines, such as the issue of a free trade agreement for environmentally friendly products. I believe that the European Union and the Commissioner can make an enormous difference there, and I very much hope that she can come home and present that we are abolishing tariffs on environmentally friendly products, because that is what the environment, Europe and trade need.

More than two-thirds of The World Trade Organisation's members are developing countries. Removing trade barriers and tackling new ones is an important tool for sustainable growth and development. Experts estimate that the successful conclusion of the Doha negotiations on this issue will lead to an increase in global GDP of up to $300 billion per year. Most of this growth will fall on developing countries and least developed countries, which in turn will have a positive impact on the material situation of their inhabitants and significantly reduce poverty levels. During the forthcoming negotiating round, the most developed countries should take on a greater share of the responsibility for the solutions implemented, adapting them to the capabilities and specificities of poorer countries. Liberalising trade and increasing market access for these countries will provide greater opportunities for South-South and developed countries to exchange, especially in the key agricultural area. This access should be facilitated by the abolition of quantitative restrictions and customs duties.

It is therefore necessary to develop fair and balanced trade regulations that serve social justice. In addition, each State should maintain its sovereignty in the regulation of its economic relations and in the allocation of resources in the various public sectors, in order to prevent speculation by large enterprises through imbalanced trade relations and trade.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 53, "date": "2015-11-23.json", "name": "Ivan JAKOVČIĆ", "mepid": "124754", "text": "   – Mr. President, Madam Commissioner, world trade must become an instrument and driver of development.

Even though there are some dissenting voices, there seems to be a great deal of support for your resolution, so congratulations on that. Like most of you, the Commission and myself are very committed to the multilateral system. We need to do everything we can to vitalise the WTO because, yes, we do need an international forum in which we can split up international rules and to which almost all the countries of the world now belong: 161 and growing. There are so many issues that we need to discuss at global level, so we need to free energy for that in the future. But first, of course, we need to deliver in Nairobi. The process is called the Doha Development Round, so we should not forget development: that is the reason for all the efforts made by the Commission so far. And yes, Mr Pereira, we have been working very hard to ally ourselves with other countries – like-minded ACP countries that have met many times – in an attempt to see how we can push forward a joint agenda. We need to make sure that the poorest and most vulnerable countries in the world become the beneficiaries of this agreement. And that is why we are looking at export competition. We have tabled proposals to address agricultural export subsidies because they are indeed very damaging to the poor world. We are looking at different development-related issues such as duty-free quotas, free rules of origin, cotton, services, etc. And we are also looking at increasing the transparency of the system. This is not easy. There are many different voices in there, so we are working very hard in Geneva. And I would like to say, for the benefit of the colleagues from UKIP (who have now all left), that when 28 countries speak unanimously with one voice, as we do in the WTO, then of course we have quite a lot of leverage. But that is not enough; there are 161 countries, so we need to move forward. It is possible to have different views on how far we have reformed the CAP, but it is true that we, the European Union, are the world’s biggest importer of food from the world’s poorest countries. We do not use export subsidies for our food today, and that is why we are pushing for their abolition in Nairobi, together with Brazil and many others. We are working hard. There are three more weeks. We need to make sure that there is an outcome, but it is not certain yet. We will do whatever we can until the very last moment in Nairobi to achieve an agreement on the way forward. And yes, Mr. Fjellner, I hope that we can also include trade facilitation and push for aid for trade and green goods if that is possible. We are also making progress on the Trade in Services Agreement (TiSA), but that would have a parallel track  rather than being dealt with in Nairobi. And I will be looking forward to regularly meeting the delegation from the European Parliament, who I know will be in Nairobi. Hopefully, when we next discuss this after Christmas, we can at least be happy that some conclusions were reached there.

It concerns the agricultural sector, where developing countries are demanding better market access, the reduction of import quotas and tariffs and the reduction of subsidies by industrialised countries, as well as market access for non-agricultural products, which comprise 90 percent of the world's trade, from mineral resources, raw materials for further processing such as.B oil to forestry and fisheries, as well as supply and access to services. , e.B. non-discrimination against third countries in public procurement.

Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to thank the commissioner for her work and for the work she has done Next week, on 2 December, the Prime Minister of Vietnam will come to Brussels and sign the trade agreement. I think this is a very good agreement that has been negotiated between Vietnam and the European Union. It has a very clear but asymmetric tariff reduction roadmap, standards have been agreed, 169 GIs have been accepted by Vietnam – 169 GIs – and other partner countries should take an example. Public procurement has been agreed and a level playing field has basically been created. In this respect, it is truly a remarkable agreement. And this agreement, too, made a clear reference in the preamble to the 1945 United Nations Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948. In other words, the trade agreement has a clear link to the issue of human rights and the safeguarding of human rights. There is therefore no question that the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, which was launched in 2012, has a legally binding link with the trade agreement and is therefore also relevant to the trade agreement with the human rights clause from the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement. I believe, ladies and gentlemen, that we all agree that human rights and trade are, of course, directly linked. I cannot imagine a trade relationship where human rights are not respected. Incidentally, in the TPP agreement, which Vietnam has also signed, progress in human rights development has been explicitly linked to market opening, in other words, an automatic system has been developed. Human rights are therefore part of trade. If you look at Vietnam now, we all know that Vietnam is a very dynamic country, is in a process of transformation and presents challenges and many issues of human rights must also be addressed, in particular, for example, the issue of freedom of expression. The human rights dialogue must, of course, be seen as an instrument, within the framework of the clause in the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement and in connection with the trade agreement. And there's a bit of the bunny in the pepper. The question of how to improve this human rights dialogue, so that it may be a little more active. Perhaps on five points, the question of whether we need improvements, that is to say the question of the definition of objectives for the human rights dialogue, we need concrete milestones in the talks. Sometimes, I feel like the conversations are a bit simmering. Secondly, how can it be better to involve civil society in the dialogue? We have the Civil Society Forum, we have Domestic Advisory Groups. I believe that the trade agreement will also develop into independent trade unions, we can guarantee clear rules of involvement and also material support, where civil society does not have the means to do so. Thirdly, we can improve the coherence of the EU, both at Commission and EADS level, but also at the various levels of negotiations and discussions, that there is real coherence in EU policy. Fourthly, what about the evaluation of the human rights dialogue? Is it possible to draw in even better benchmarks and indicators? Fifthly, transparency – this is a favourite issue for us – and that transparency can certainly be strengthened in the human rights dialogue. So, some questions about how to strengthen this human rights dialogue, especially in relation to Vietnam, but in view of the trade strategy, of course, for further agreements.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 60, "date": "2015-11-23.json", "name": "Cecilia MALMSTRÖM", "mepid": "4273", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, the Commission is, as you know, committed to promoting and protecting human rights in all our engagement with third partners, including, of course, with Vietnam, which we are discussing tonight. With this aim, we organised a Stakeholders’ Consultation in May, and the summary paper of the discussion published thereafter highlights the stakeholders’ suggestions for improving the situation of human rights issues and underlines our commitment to transparency and to regular and continued engagement with civil society. I can confirm that issues relating to human rights have been addressed in the context of the EU-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement negotiations, with the aim of embedding respect for human rights in the agreement, and also with a view to enhancing its positive impact and minimising the risk of adverse impacts. I have also personally discussed matters with the Minister. The preamble of the agreement reaffirms the EU’s and Vietnam’s commitment to key international human rights principles and instruments. There is also an institutional and legal link between the Free Trade Agreement and the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement with Vietnam. These links ensure that respect for human rights underpins EU-Vietnam bilateral relations, including the FTA, and enable us to take measures considered appropriate in the event of a breach of the agreement. The FTA also contains provisions ensuring the transparency and inclusiveness of the decision-making process and any legal proceedings, thereby strengthening the enabling environment for the respect of human rights, democracy and the rule of law in Vietnam. With regard to labour rights, the FTA includes an ambitious chapter on trade and sustainable development, and that includes not only respect for all core labour standards and ratification of fundamental ILO Conventions and their implementation, but it also pays special attention to corporate social responsibility and fair and ethical trade schemes. The monitoring of human rights development in Vietnam is, of course, very important. This will continue to be done primarily through the institutions and structures set up in the PCA framework, including the human rights dialogue – and there will be a meeting in a couple of weeks again. We also have a dedicated instrument, the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights, as you all know. The implementation of the commitments undertaken will be followed up in both the EU and Vietnam through the mechanisms and institutions established therein, as well as through the existing EU civil society dialogue and with ex-post evaluations of the FTA. I strongly believe – and I think Mr Lange said the same – that trade liberalisation and human rights can and must go hand in hand. The new Communication on trade and investment that the Commission published a couple of weeks ago makes it clear that EU trade policy must be for all: citizens; consumers; workers; the self-employed; small, big and medium-sized companies; and the poorest people in the developing countries. It must deliver growth, jobs and innovation, but it has to be responsible, and that means that EU trade policy must defend European values. It has to be effective at delivering economic opportunities and it has to be transparent and open to public scrutiny. Human rights are therefore a very important part of this trade strategy. The Commission wants to ensure that trade policy contributes to the advancement of human rights in the EU and in third countries, in conjunction with our other policies – foreign policy and development cooperation. Let me assure you of the importance of finding this balance between engagement and conditionality. The Commission is, as you know, convinced that the policy of engagement is more effective than a policy exclusively based on conditionality, even if that can also play a role. Engagement allows us to engage and to create channels for dialogue, keeping them open with a lot of stakeholders involved. We intend to make full use of those channels to promote change on the ground in Vietnam. Thank you very much for your contribution to this, and you can be sure that we will keep you informed very closely about the development once the agreement is finally concluded.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 61, "date": "2015-11-23.json", "name": "Santiago FISAS AYXELÀ", "mepid": "96729", "text": "  PPE Group. – Madam President, Commissioner, three years after the signing of the Global Framework Agreement on Partnership and Cooperation between the European Union and Vietnam in 2012, an understanding of the Free Trade Agreement was reached last August, by the way, with a communist country.

In a world of globalisation, if you want to get out of imitation and create something yourself, you need people who can think. Reflection, negotiation can only be done if there are human rights.

We think it is a good agreement. Trade, as an element of the broader EU foreign policy agenda, is one of the more concrete instruments and one where Parliament plays a leading and important role. But we should also think of development policies. We see, too, that citizens are increasingly and actively getting involved with this discussion, and we welcome this. People in Europe are very clear that they want to see human rights at the top of the European foreign policy agenda. I believe that human rights are key. I think that the EU has both the opportunity and the responsibility to lead in ensuring that universal human rights are respected worldwide. While trade must be an important lever, it cannot in and of itself be the solution to end all suffering and problems. Listening to the public debates, people sometimes have very high hopes of the impact that trade can have. But realistically, we must do what we can. I see this ambition and vision – tying trade and values – clearly reflected in the Commission’s new Trade for All agenda. Besides the anticipated boost to development and economic well-being, building on Vietnam’s efforts to lift people out of poverty, I would like to know what short-term measures are anticipated. How does the Commission address human rights in the context of trade and how does monitoring look after the agreement enters into force? There is a lot that has to be improved in Vietnam. Free expression, free association, freedom of assembly are all controlled and under pressure; torture and beatings unfortunately happen too regularly; and minorities, journalists, bloggers and opposition figures suffer as a result of this. In conclusion, these many challenges cannot be solved through trade alone. We need to work and build on the human rights dialogue and show political leadership.

It is an important and good agreement for Vietnam. After all, the EU is Vietnam's second largest trading partner after China. This agreement is indeed an agreement for growth in a country that needs development. I firmly believe that trade is the best way to get out of poverty. This is how Sweden and all the other EU countries became rich. If we can offer other countries the opportunity to make the same trip by opening our markets, that is of course a good thing. But as always when poverty reduction comes up in the context of free trade, opponents say that it is exactly the opposite. That trade threatens human rights, workers and the environment and that free trade takes place at the expense of the population. That's not true! Let me just say that the Vietnamese themselves want this agreement. I think, frankly, that it is a bit pathetic when you try to claim that you know better than they themselves know what is good just for Vietnam. In addition, this agreement contains strong, binding wordings on human rights, the environment and workers' rights. I don't think that's where the shoe squeezes. The truth is that protectionists always find another excuse than being protectionists, to try to obstruct free trade and open borders. I think this is another example. As we saw when it came to Burma, when Aung San Suu Kyi appealed to us to reduce their tariffs, they were opposed. As for Pakistan and Malala stood here and pleaded, they were against.

Thanks to this EFTA, we will now have an opportunity for a robust ongoing human rights dialogue with the Vietnamese. I hope we will also see a very effective domestic advisory group set up. That, to my mind, is a crucial point: we have to make sure that we fund a domestic adviser group, involve civil society in Vietnam and get regular reports about the situation there, particularly the labour situation. We must make sure that the ILO conventions are being implemented, that trade unions are allowed to operate, and that there are safeguards at the workplace.

It is also evident that the usual mix of instruments will not do the trick. Not only do they have their shortcomings, which have been widely documented; but can we really just blindly transpose this approach onto the most far-reaching FTA that has ever been achieved with a developing country? Some argue that the Commission’s timid approach to human rights is exactly why it is important that under the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement there is a communication mechanism between the European External Action Service (EEAS) and Parliament on the implementation of the PCA and capacity—building to enhance the settlement of complaints by the affected communities.

To explain all this, we will by the end of this year – in a couple of weeks – publish an ad hoc Commission paper explaining how the existing measures of the partnership agreement and the negotiated measures of the free trade agreement will contribute to human rights empowerment with the flanking measures that we will put in place and how the human rights I mentioned will be assessed once the latter agreement has entered into force. All this will, of course, be public and transparent so that you can follow and contribute to the dialogue. There is a conditionality clause in all of our agreements to cover very serious breaches, but we prefer whenever possible to work on engagement and to try to establish forums for dialogue to see if we can make improvements. If we have no agreement with Vietnam, we will, of course, say no to all such forums. I am not sure whether that would contribute to empowering the people of Vietnam. This agreement will be finally concluded next week. Very shortly after that it will be published so that you can read it and make your own assessment. Then, during the whole translation and legal procedure, there will be plenty of time for discussion, and the Commission is ready to enter into that dialogue with you. I can assure you once again that we will keep you informed at all stages and are always ready to take your input, ideas and views into account and to have a dialogue with you on this.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 91, "date": "2015-11-23.json", "name": "Mairead McGUINNESS", "mepid": "28115", "text": "   The debate is closed.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 92, "date": "2015-11-23.json", "name": "Mairead McGUINNESS", "mepid": "28115", "text": "   The next item is the debate on the Commission statement on the accession of Ecuador to the EU-Peru and Colombia trade agreement (2015/2656(RSP)).", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 93, "date": "2015-11-23.json", "name": "Cecilia MALMSTRÖM", "mepid": "4273", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, we welcome the resolution by Parliament on the EU-Peru and Colombia trade agreement and the accession of Ecuador. The accession of Ecuador has been agreed between the EU and its Member States and Peru and Colombia and is another step forward in our effort to engage with Latin America and consolidate our position in the region. That is important for us. The Commission considers that this agreement will be beneficial for both sides. It will enable us to consolidate traditional trade flows while also boosting and diversifying trade and investment on both sides. We also hope that it will act as an economic driver for social development in Ecuador and contribute to alleviating poverty and reducing inequalities. They are there, of course, in that country. The text of the accession protocol results in a comprehensive and balanced agreement, fully matching the ambition reflected in what was concluded with Colombia and Peru. It also takes into account the differences in economic development that obviously exist between the EU and Ecuador by allowing Ecuador longer periods for dismantling tariffs and making some specific adjustments that it has requested. The accession is of paramount importance for Ecuador because, as of the end of next year, Ecuador will lose its preferences as regards access to the EU market. Timely accession will not only ensure preferential access for Ecuadorian products to our market but also bring long-term stability and predictable conditions for bilateral trade and investment. And we will, as we discussed in the last item and as expressed in our trade strategy, pay special attention in order to make sure that the provisions on trade and sustainable development are implemented and used effectively, including by offering appropriate support through development cooperation. Ecuador, as you point out in your resolution, has shown its willingness to engage in an area of trade and sustainable development and agreed to sign up to all the provisions of the trade and sustainable development chapter. This will help us to identify a common agenda in which we can cooperate and exchange best practice. As is the case with other agreements, cooperation with you and with Member States and the input of civil society will be crucial for effective implementation, in particular of the sustainable development chapter. And to get it right, we really need your engagement and your input, and this resolution reflects your commitment. We have taken due note of your request to be regularly informed about trends in banana imports, including those from Ecuador, once the agreement is in place. I can assure you that close monitoring of banana imports and developments in the market situation has once again been proving effective so far. The resolution is a vital step in Ecuador’s accession process, but it is not, of course, the end of our conversation. We will continue the process leading to implementation of the agreement. The Commission will continue to take your views carefully into account and continue the dialogue that we have here. So thank you again for the excellent work on the resolution.

Today we are here discussing this proposal for a Resolution of the European Parliament which, together with the adoption of the Agreement itself and the Regulation on the Safeguard Clause, will complete Ecuador's accession procedure.  I would like to thank Mr Scholz for the work he has done and for the good cooperation we have had throughout the process. The PPE Group tabled some amendments to the motion for a resolution which we voted on in the Committee on International Trade, which were intended to enrich the text and give the Clear Support of the European Parliament to Ecuador's accession to the Agreement. I am pleased that the final text reflects this. This Agreement will boost trade and investment on both sides, enhance economic and social development and help reduce inequalities. We cannot forget that Ecuador is no longer a beneficiary of the GSP+ system, so ratification of the Agreement will bring significant benefits for Ecuador's exports to the European Union.  Finally, I would like to recall that, in its resolution of 13 June 2012, the European Parliament, before giving its approval to the Agreement with Colombia and Peru, asked the Andean countries to establish a roadmap on human, environmental and labour rights.

I regret that two years have been lost and I hope that accession will have the same benefits for Ecuador as those provided so far by this Agreement to its signatories. In Colombia alone, it has particularly benefited four million working families who have seen their exports grow by 21%. The Union is already Ecuador's main recipient of exports. In 2014 sales of our market reached 2.4 billion euros, with a surplus of 400 euros. Some scholars believe that 300,000 jobs offered by 1,400 companies, almost all SMEs, are directly linked to this trade flow and that the Agreement can improve short-term exchange by another 400 million. This policy of trade concertation has proven to be a first-rate tool to contribute to peace, stability and progress in the area. It provides growth, development and environmental and social guarantees. It produces social justice in an area of the strategic planet for Europe because of its situation, its potential, its size and its growth rates. A significant number of new Europeans or residents who arrived in Europe come from these countries. The negotiations further underline that very diverse political options value and endorse such agreements, which offer palpable, counting and sounding advantages to thousands of families and workers, who see opportunities born or consolidate their professional or business expectations. I hope that this will encourage Bolivia to join this alliance, which will be more powerful if it integrates the entire Andean Community. In short, it is a European contribution in terms of peace, justice and development to global trade.

Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to thank the commissioner for her work and for the work she has done The Government of Ecuador has decided to accede to the EU Free Trade Agreement with Colombia and Peru. It has thus also given in to the economic constraints imposed by the EU's competing neighbours on EU trade and the simultaneous cancellation of the GSP-plus benefits for Ecuador. In fact, Ecuador had proposed its own agreement on trade and development, also in order to be able to continue the remarkable development path for a social lyrical and environmentally conscious country in the Andean region, also in partnership with the EU. We all know that the European Parliament's approval of the agreement with Colombia and Peru has long been uncertain, even controversial. It was finally carried out on the condition that concrete steps be taken to improve the human rights situation, the social situation and the environment in the region. These are objectives for which the Government of Ecuador has been particularly successful in recent years. That is why we should take a close look. Ecuador's accession to this agreement is an important moment for the country itself, but also to check whether the provisions of the general agreement with the Andean countries and their implementation are in line with our expectations, both socially and economically. The first figures presented to us by the Commission on the development of trade with the other two Andean countries fall far short of initial expectations. And in this respect, once again, we must also look closely at the implementation of the agreement and stick to it.

Coming from the Canary Islands, the largest banana producer in the European Union, I would like to focus today on the need for this agreement not to become another threat to the already weakened banana sector of the European Union, which looks with concern at how an uncontrolled entry of bananas from Ecuador can now occur. Let us not forget that Ecuador is the largest exporter of bananas to the European Union and it is clear that exports are growing proportionately to lower tariffs.  Let us remember that in Geneva we adopt a declining rate of up to EUR 114/tonne; bilateral agreements reached up to EUR 75/tonne by 2020. We assume this as inevitable, but it is precisely for this reason that two issues must be addressed: the first, compensation to Union producers who may be harmed; and the second, the need to implement the safeguard clause with complete diligence in the event of excesses in the agreed amounts which may cause harm to Union producers.  Madam President, I vote 'yes' to trade agreements; \"yes\" vote for Ecuador to join the current Agreement; \"yes\" vote to the development of this country. But not at any price, not at the expense of banana producers in the Canary Islands and the rest of the European Union.  I'm not asking for any favors, I'm just asking for the agreed agreement to be fulfilled. There is a safeguard clause, the limits must be respected and, if not met, the agreed mechanism must be put in place, and it should be done automatically when they are exceeded. That is what we vote on mostly in this House and that is what must be fulfilled. Ecuador does not have to have better differential treatment than Colombia and Peru can have, and the Commissioner has said this: there is a safeguard clause that needs to be put into force and not look the other way.

Content of the question: The European Commission Communication 2012(0006) on the 2012-2015 Animal Protection and Welfare Strategy has been welcomed by the European Parliament and provides a clear roadmap for action in the field of Union animal welfare policy in recent years. The European Parliament was particularly pleased that the strategy introduces many aspects of Parliament's resolution 2009/2202 – own-initiative report of 5 May 2010. Parliament appreciates the progress made so far and encourages the Commission to make sure that the outstanding elements of the action are implemented in time.  So, firstly, will the Commission draw up a new animal protection and welfare strategy for the period 2016-2020 to ensure the continuity and clarity of the actions that are crucial to achieving further positive changes in animal welfare policy in the European Union? Secondly, will the Commission prepare, as a key element of the new animal welfare policy, a proposal to simplify the framework for Union legislation on animal welfare, which Parliament calls for in its resolution on the Union strategy for the protection of animal welfare for the period 2012-2015, resolution 2012/2043 , also an own-initiative report. That is the question of the European Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, and now my reference to the problem. The subject matter which is the subject of the question is systematically raised in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, in various forms and scopes, when working on many documents and on other occasions. Animal welfare has an important place in our awareness and values that are important to humans. It is also part of sustainable development.  This issue occupies a special place in the European Union, where we have done so much to improve animal welfare. The standards and requirements we have adopted are very high and we respect them, even though they are causing a significant deterioration in the competitiveness of our animal products on world markets. The reports discussed earlier today also address these issues. We should ensure that our standards in this area become global standards, which is very difficult. And such requirements should be placed on imported products from third countries.  We are currently dealing with key animal issues to varying degrees, in many areas, in many reports. I will mention only the titles of the documents that we have been working on or have been working on recently. These are 'Zootechnical and genealogical conditions relating to trade in breeding animals and their biological material used for reproduction and their importation into the Union'; 'Cloning of animals of the bovine, ovine and ovine species and horses kept and reared for rearing purposes'. The next topic – 'Animal health', the next one – 'Veterinary medicinal products or Community procedures for the authorisation and supervision of medicinal products for human and veterinary use and the setting up of the European Medicines Agency', finally 'Trade in seal products' and many, many others, which I do not mention here.  Problems of linking and affecting animal welfare on the quality of food products and thus on human health are extremely important. A number of discussions raise problems of hormones, antibiotics in the food and treatment of animals or the use of animals in scientific research, the results of which often ultimately contribute to improving animal welfare, despite previous doubts and reservations about the advisability of their use and scope. To sum up, I would like to say that animal welfare is and will remain an important value for us.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 109, "date": "2015-11-23.json", "name": "Vytenis Povilas Andriukaitis", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, animal welfare is an important and sensitive issue very close to the hearts of millions of European Union citizens. I, too, share the concern of many Europeans for the proper treatment of animals. The current European Union strategy for animal welfare adopted by the Commission in 2012 is still in progress. The priority of the Commission is therefore to work on completion of the remaining actions. Furthermore, there is work to be done on the strengthening and enforcement of existing rules, on improving dialogue with stakeholders and on exploring ways to better include animal welfare considerations in our international activities. On enforcement: the European Union has at its disposal a very extensive set of rules for animal welfare, covering many species, including broilers, laying hens and pigs; many activities, such as transport, slaughter and animal testing; and also products, for example, cat and dog food or seal products. We need to prioritise the critical issue of putting the existing rules into practice. Learning from our experience over recent years, we must focus our efforts on tackling widespread non-compliance. Against this background, I intend to work on improving compliance with a requirement to prohibit the routine tail docking of pigs and on the finalisation and adoption of guidelines on the welfare of pigs, as foreseen by the animal welfare strategy. Secondly, I look forward to the outcomes of the ambitious pilot project on best practices on animal transport, supported by Parliament. The project runs from 2015 to 2018. Thirdly, I would like to mention the Commission proposal to revise European Union legislation on official controls, which has the potential to improve enforcement of animal welfare requirements, for example, through our proposals to establish European reference centres for animal welfare. On stakeholder dialogue: I would like to see this dialogue amongst the wide variety of actors concerned with animal welfare developed further. I intend to promote, or first attempt to see if there is an appetite in the Community for, this kind of exercise. On the basis of the outcome, we could decide how to structure this dialogue for the future. Finally, on international action: clearly the concern of European Union citizens as regards the treatment of animals does not stop at our borders, and rightly so. We need to continue promoting our approach worldwide, also to protect the competitiveness of our livestock industry, which has made so many efforts on these issues in recent years. Such efforts can help us to keep European Union standards at a high level, despite the pressure that globalisation brings. I will explore, together with my colleagues responsible for trade and agriculture, how the potential market of animal welfare could be better valorised at global level. European Union animal production must seek to profit from its advantageous position as a world leader on animal welfare to steer this trend and to further explore markets demanding ethical production. Since the animal welfare strategy is about to end, we are evaluating further steps. In this case I would like to inform you that the Commission will launch, in 2016, a new Eurobarometer Survey on animal welfare which will represent a useful source of information, especially in the areas of consumer awareness and education.

The way to create the best outcomes for the welfare of animals is to have a sensible and workable strategy that is not implemented in a burdensome way for producers. We need to recognise the practical implications that exist for producers and be wary of unintended consequences which can ultimately have a negative impact on animal welfare. For example, the Commission’s proposals regarding medicated feed could potentially have implications for pig welfare by delaying the use of medication until the disease has spread and developed. The cost to farmers – or ultimately, of course, to consumers – must be recognised. Producers where I come from in the UK, as a whole, were to the forefront in implementing measures such as the sow stall ban, while others dragged their feet. The United Kingdom banned sow stalls and certainly lost their competitive advantage at that time. Similarly, there is a need for our animal welfare standards to be protected in any trade negotiations. We cannot allow a situation, for example, where imports from third countries have a competitive advantage over those produced within a Europe under our high animal welfare standards. Bovine TB is a problem which impacts on the welfare of cattle, and the associated restrictions place pressure on farmers and come at a cost to the public purse.

If any colleagues recognise the wording of the Committee on Agriculture, it is because it is the same issue that many of you signed just before the summer and which we have finally had up for debate. I am particularly pleased that the House is today deciding to bring a resolution to this written question and this debate. I would also like to thank Commissioner Andriukaitis for your commitment to the issues and for opening up some ways forward during your introductory speech that we will be able to discuss in the future. I would like to agree with the colleagues who have spoken before that we first need to make a proper evaluation of what we have had in the previous strategy. Next, I would like us to be able to ask for a new strategy for the future. Because, as Mr Nicholson said, it is extremely necessary that we take it in a package, that we have it balanced and that we also get it – which I think is extremely important – in a work that is done with Europe's farmers and not that it becomes a work that is against Europe's farmers. It's the core. I would also like to see that in that strategy, which gives us a broader perspective and a wider range of different instruments to work on, we also have a part that is to work towards common animal welfare legislation within the European Union. Many times in the political debate, it is said that we have a common agricultural market in the European Union, and we have that to a large extent. But there is also a great deal of national regulation that differs. We can see how many different directives have been implemented in very different ways in the different countries. If we take what is popularly known in Sweden as the Pig Directive, for example, where we got ten years of implementation process from 2003 to 2013, we can see in a survey from the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences that only eight out of twenty-eight countries have fully implemented this.

I was at the border for more than two hours. On the part of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I welcome the request that the Commission draw up a new animal welfare strategy for the coming period. We all know, especially as farmers, that animal welfare is a top priority. Only healthy animals, only animals that are kept well, also perform. We all want not only the animals to be kept well in agriculture, but also the pets. We should also include this in the new animal welfare strategy. However, I would like to point out one thing: we must not exaggerate the whole thing. If it leads to production being moved from Europe to other parts of the world, then we are sinning against animal welfare. Between 1976 and 2008, animal production and meat production in Europe increased by only 6% and in Asia by 385%. In other words, if we gag our farmers too much, we will be relocated to parts of the world where our animal welfare rules do not apply. I would therefore ask that we do this with a sense of proportion, that we keep an eye on the welfare of animals, but that we carry out it in such a way that production is maintained with us and that small farms in particular are not endangered. Strict rules mean that small-scale farms in particular are the first to close their farms. I can only take one example: if we really bring about the ban on cows, many small mountain farmers in the Alpine region will close their farms. I therefore ask that we find something sensible.

Because in Mediterranean countries they still find it fun to watch bulls fighting one another and bulls being baited. Now, you could say: when in Rome, do as the Romans do, and I might take that attitude. Unfortunately, because of the way the CAP works, British taxpayers are subsidising this activity. They are subsidising it because they are paying area aid on land that is being used to rear bulls for bullfighting and bull-baiting. I realise that this has been in the legislation – there have been amendments about it – but as yet, as far as I know, there has been no concrete legislation that says British taxpayers’ money must not be used for this – not that I suppose that would ever happen. But I should just warn you that there is a referendum coming up in Britain fairly soon on EU membership, and there is nothing that makes Europhiles squirm more than being reminded that they, with their taxes, are supporting bull-baiting and bullfighting. Now we move on to another subject, and that is wild stray dogs in Romania, which are apparently being shot and killed one way or another. That is an animal welfare issue, but I am more concerned about what happens to these dogs once they have been killed in whatever ways they are being killed. Are they buried? Well that would upset the EU because of the environmental rules about burying dead animals. Are they being incinerated? Well that will upset all you global warmers because of the CO2 that is going into the atmosphere. Are they being rendered down with abattoir waste to be spread as meat and bonemeal fertilizer, or are they actually being put into animal rations as a protein element? I mean, I would not put this past anybody, because it goes on in south-east Asia. But these dogs carry rabies; we understand about 20% of them have got rabies. That is zoonotic – that means human beings can get it, and those human beings could come to Britain because the borders are open.

Madam President, as the 2012-2015 Animal Welfare Strategy comes to an end, I welcome the fact that this issue is on the agenda and I hope that we will establish a new strategy for the period 2016-2020. If Article 13 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union tells us that the Union and the Member States take full account of the requirements for animal welfare as sensitive beings, we must go further in animal defence and remove all the ambiguities that remain in our animal welfare strategies. Thus, in agriculture, the proliferation of intensive livestock in France and Europe combined with the threat of TTIP makes me fear not only for animal welfare and the environment, but also for human health. I condemned, for example, farms such as the 1,200 bulls farm in Alsace, the 1,000 cows in the Somme, the 1,000 calves in the Creuse or the industrial piggery in Poiroux, in vendée. Another important point is animal experimentation. I regret that the citizens' initiative on vivisection has not been followed by the Commission. I also believe that it is necessary, in view of the current means of science, but also of the inconclusive results of experimentation on animals, that it be permanently banned and gradually replaced by alternative methods.  I would also like to draw attention to the appalling suffering of animals put to death without pre-stunning before slaughter. It is essential, first of all, to make detailed labelling on meat slaughtering methods mandatory. The same is true for furs. Then it is mandatory to stunning animals before killing or slaughtering and to remove exemptions as part of ritual slaughter. On the other hand, special care should be taken to better combat all trafficking in animal species and products such as ivory. The perpetrators of these acts will have to be punished more severely with sanctions that really no longer make them want to reoffend.

My own country, Austria, has truly exemplary standards in many areas of animal husbandry in Europe, for example in the implementation of the cagekeeping of laying hens, but also in the field of animal transport. While our domestic livestock farmers are strictly controlled, there are still some Member States in Europe that have not implemented the EU requirements, especially on laying hens. Animal transport is also often even more competitive.  I too would like to join the previous speakers, who have already pointed out that we are not contributing anything to animal welfare if we simply no longer make animal production possible in Europe. This also applies above all to third countries if, in the area of trade policy, we do not take account of the standards at which animal products are imported into Europe. Very often, EU money is also used here to build stables outside the European Union, for example, with less animal welfare. These products are then imported cheaper into Europe. This is partly insanity that can no longer be surpassed! I would really like to appeal to all those who are committed to even more animal welfare and even more requirements: please do not leave it to pure actionism, also inform consumers that this entails increased production costs.

Now we have an uneven playing field, high costs for the farmer and the citizen does not pay. Practice shows this, and we in this House recently discussed the crisis in agriculture. Therefore, continuation in this Parliament often means tougher demands for farmers, and I really cannot go along with that at the moment. We are now talking about animal welfare. But it should really be about human welfare. In Europe, we let refugees walk in the cold for hours - i.m. elderly and small children - while animals have heating, ventilation and drinking during transport. And we are talking about a reduction in driving time from eight to seven hours. In the Netherlands, the cabinet says that if there is no place for refugees, people should sleep outside in the cold, in the snow.

It is important that Parliament can debate this ahead of the work of the European Commission.  Animal welfare is an important issue for Europeans. Our citizens are increasingly seeking to consume responsibly. They also require to know the origin of food products and the conditions under which they arrive on their plates. In this sense, it is necessary for me to commend the efforts and progress made by the various sectors. In addition, breeders are involved in animal welfare, inseparable from quality production.  If the Commission is to continue its work with the development of a new strategy, it will have to be pragmatic and objective, including all stakeholders, professionals and consumers. In other words, it should not point the finger at those involved in the livestock sectors but should promote good practices and encourage progress.  On the other hand, as I have already pointed out many times, we cannot argue, on the one hand, in favour of animal welfare and, on the other hand, impose disproportionate constraints on our breeders. It is essential to ensure consistency between the laws we are putting in place and the consequences they can have on livestock models in Europe. The demands already made to the breeders must be taken into account.  The example of the NEC directive on Member States' emissions caps for the main pollutants is indicative of the difficulty of aligning the objectives with the reality on the ground.

All those options have been and are being discussed in my Cabinet and with the services, and we have decided to start with a Eurobarometer survey. This is not only a matter of interest for the general public but is also about creating added value – innovation enclosed in the European Union food chain – and therefore concerns a wide range of stakeholders. In the light of the completion of the European Union strategy on animal welfare, new information will become available in 2016 that could allow a response to the many varied yet legitimate expectations of European Union citizens and stakeholders. In addition, proper enforcement of the European Union acquis will continue to be a key priority. A study to be completed soon, and the result of the next Eurobarometer survey, will also look at what role responsible education and information to citizens can play in this regard. With the forthcoming adoption of the proposal on official control, the European Union will have the opportunity to create European reference centres for animal welfare, giving a strong impetus for promoting the issue among stakeholders.

In 2013, 26.5 million children in the European Union were at risk of falling into poverty and social exclusion. These are dramatic numbers. The policies that have impoverished the families of the European Union are the same ones that have thrown children into poverty, denying them many of the rights contained in the Convention on the Rights of the Child, including the rights to health, education and social protection.  In this report we make clear what the various studies have pointed out, but it seems that those who have insisted on austerity policies, called fiscal consolidation, have ignored it. The main factors contributing to child poverty are wealth redistribution policies, the effectiveness of government intervention through income support. It is clear that increasing employment is the most effective tool in the fight against poverty. It is clear that the degradation of wage policies and social protection systems at national level increases child poverty. But the job alone is not enough. The drama of today is that the risk of child poverty persists in families with high employment intensity, such as Romania, Lithuania, Portugal, Spain and others. Today it is known that working parents who do not have access to crèches are often forced to leave children in the care of another child or to resort to paid and uncertified in-service networks, which calls into question the safety and well-being of children.  Therefore, in this report we recommend that Member States legislate social rights, including an appropriate mandatory minimum wage that respects national practices and collective agreements and provides greater security for families and combats precarious links by promoting work with social rights.  That is why in this report we call on the European Commission to refrain from recommending reformulations and cuts in the public administration of the Member States, to promote the flexibilization of labour relations and the privatisation of public services, which have unequivocally led to the weakening of children's social rights.  But in this report there is a fundamental perspective: that effective poverty prevention policies are those that guarantee universal and free access to public services, not those that only care about compensating children already in child poverty. Studies show that universal support policies offer better protection against child poverty. Thus, in this report, we advocate public, free and universal services of high quality, particularly with regard to childcare, education, health, housing and leisure activities. We therefore advocate universal social subsidies for children, as their own intrinsic right. We encourage legislation that protects or increases maternity and paternity rights, safeguards women's return to work after pregnancy and maternity leave, and supports single-parent families, which are mostly female. In our report we consider not only monetary poverty, but also multidimensional deprivation, and therefore we advocate statistical methods that integrate multidimensional indicators. We also believe that better use of the European Union Structural Funds should be made to combat child poverty. We will vote against the parties that have been included in the report who believe that this tragedy can be resolved through the European Semester or the rules of economic and monetary union, because we believe that what causes the problem to a great deal must be tackled and cannot be part of the solution. Finally, we would like to thank all those who have contributed to this report, including to various Portuguese and international organisations that fight child poverty on a daily basis.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "GUE/NGL", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 161, "date": "2015-11-23.json", "name": "Romana TOMC", "mepid": "125104", "text": "   – Thank you very much, Honourable President, for the floor. I support the report because I believe that all children should be guaranteed the right to education, to healthcare, to housing and to grow up in a caring family environment. Unfortunately, however, the reality is different, as more than one in four children in the European Union are at risk of poverty and social exclusion.  The report states in its content that poverty among children is expected to deepen at the expense of austerity measures.

We have taken note of your analysis and we do share your concerns about the high levels of child poverty in many of our Member States. As you have pointed out, the risk of poverty and social exclusion is greater for children than for adults. Child poverty is a multifaceted issue that demands an integrated and – to the extent possible – preventive approach, looking at both the employment situation of the household and also the rights of the child. The fight against child poverty has been high on our agenda. In 2013, the Commission proposed the Recommendation ‘Investing in children: breaking the cycle of disadvantage’, which is currently being implemented by Member States. The Commission will keep working to ensure the full operationalisation of this recommendation. In this respect we take note of your suggestion to have a three-pillar approach: access to resources, services and children’s participation. We are also monitoring child-poverty related aspects in the context of the European Semester. In its 2013 recommendation, the Commission suggested that the best way to support parents and their children is through progressive universalism, which is a system of strong universal services and benefit rights topped up with targeted instruments for particularly disadvantaged groups, such as the Roma. The recommendation calls on the Member States to provide parents with access to resources, in the form of paid work and adequate family and child benefits, and to high-quality services such as early childhood education and care, health and housing. An integrated approach is key to ensuring children have the best start in life. The Commission has also been regularly monitoring the Member States’ progress towards the Barcelona targets to improve access to childcare. Good-quality childcare services have been shown to support the cognitive and social development of children, especially those from low-income backgrounds, and improve their academic and labour market opportunities later on in life. These services are therefore key to reducing the intergenerational transmission of poverty. Many Member States have made good efforts to improve the provision of these services, but progress is still slow and uneven. We are providing country-specific recommendations to many Member States where needed. In 2014 and 2015 many Member States received country-specific recommendations to improve income support for families, to expand childcare, as well as to make education more inclusive and to reduce financial disincentives for parents to enter employment. As far as creating a new financial instrument in this area is concerned, we would like to recall that there are already funding opportunities for children in the current European Structural and Investment Funds: the European Social Fund, the European Regional Development Fund, and others. These instruments have been, in fact, significantly strengthened for the current 2014-2020 programming period. Member States should make further efforts to use them to their full potential. In addition, Member States have agreed that 25.6% of the European Social Fund allocation of EUR 86 billion is to be earmarked for social inclusion measures, of which EUR 8 billion is set aside for access to children’s and childcare services and for measures fighting against early school leaving. In this regard, it is important that all key stakeholders at national, regional and local level are mobilised and form strong partnerships. The European Union funds are also supporting healthy nutrition for children. With the European Union School Fruit Scheme, EUR 150 million will support the distribution of fruit and vegetables in schools for 2015 and 2016. With these funds we can reach 12 million children across 25 Member States. In addition, there is national or private co-funding, estimated to amount to around EUR 32 million. All these financial interventions are extremely important for preventing and breaking the intergenerational transmission of poverty and social exclusion. As you know, the Commission is currently working on a European pillar of social rights to foster upward convergence of employment and social performance in the European Union. We want to ensure that our legislation and policy framework is in line with the realities of modern life – teleworking, digital work, combining work and family duties – and keeps pace with developments in the fast-changing labour market, adequately addressing needs and challenges arising from diverse and innovative forms of work, and that it invests in people through a modernised social framework for those in and out of work. We are also preparing a fresh start for working parents and caregivers. We believe that this new approach will reap benefits for all; in particular, for working parents and other caregivers who seek a better balance to their work and life commitments, but also for women, to support their participation in the labour market. Finally, as the employment status of parents is one of the key determinants of child poverty, this initiative will contribute to reducing the number of children who live in households at risk of poverty. Let me assure you once again that this Commission is committed to addressing child poverty across the European Union by restoring economic growth and upward social convergence, fostering job creation and ensuring social fairness. These are not mere abstract concepts. For the 40% of children in some of our Member States who live in households at risk of poverty, we need to come with effective solutions to foster employment of their parents and to ensure their full participation in society.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 1, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 170, "date": "2015-11-23.json", "name": "Anneli JÄÄTTEENMÄKI", "mepid": "28314", "text": "   The debate is closed.

Nevertheless, this initial step is an expression of determination, which can become an important factor in Member States where poverty has a major impact on the child population. Currently, at least 550,000 children in Hungary do not have access to daily hot meals during holidays and nearly 50,000 children are starving every day. This makes our country the third worst indicator of child poverty in Europe.  The seriousness of the problem is indicated by the fact that the Hungarian Government views child hunger as a problem it has long solved, and therefore did not support the recently launched civil initiative to eradicate this problem, which all other hungarian parties have stood by; instead, Hungary government swept the initiative off the table on the grounds of political utilitiness.

Children of long-term unemployed parents, children of single mothers and also children from immigrant families are strongly represented in this category. Child poverty thus becomes one indicator of the degree of effectiveness, or rather the ineffectiveness, of integration policy. Since the beginning of the economic crisis in 2008, the proportion of children living in poverty has increased quite significantly, even in the richest EU countries. There is also an increasing risk of poverty in families where one or both breadwinners are reliant on under-compliant employment contracts. These are the ones that have spread fastest in the labour market in recent years. Unfortunately, the measures proposed by the rapporteur do not take into account the new situation due to the influx of refugees from broken countries.

The report on inequalities, primarily focused on child poverty and social exclusion, highlights the imperious necessity of establishing EU and national targets that can genuinely indicate the social status of children, alongside their well-being. There must be a strong cohesiveness between existing funds and policies to guarantee children equal access to benefits such as health and education in order to ensure that they achieve their full potential. I therefore emphasise the need mentioned in the report of coordinated action at both European and national levels, as these objectives can only be achieved if awareness is raised at a systemic level and all available resources are aligned and directed towards the same goal – combating child inequality, poverty and social exclusion.

This report is made for people who very often do not have a lobby in this Parliament and in EU institutions. It is made for people who are very often overlooked and overheard when it comes to the distribution of EU funds. In the preparation of this report, I have seen examples of where this is still happening today in the European Union. In my hometown, Gelsenkirchen, I visited a school where I met two girls – two sisters, Denise and Michaela, 10 and 12 years old – who had recently moved from Romania to Gelsenkirchen. I met them in their class. They were curious, they wanted to learn, and they were really trying to get integrated into the school in Gelsenkirchen. But the question that came up in my head was: will Denise and Michaela have the same chances and opportunities that I had when I was growing up in Gelsenkirchen? Will they have the same access to resources I had? When we look at the situation of Denise and Michaela, there are challenges that they are facing, because very often they are being discriminated against or they are facing structural exclusion. This report can give the tools to cities such as Gelsenkirchen to create an integrated approach in order to give a chance to children like this, be it in education or with regard to housing, employment or health. We need to look at different fields of society in order to give a chance to people from marginalised communities. At the same time, we have to bring all the stakeholders together, be they from the local level, from civil society or the people affected themselves, in order to create the best programmes and to really make sustainable investments. And we need to give support for them to have a strong voice in the whole process – not only in the preparation, but also in the monitoring and evaluation, of the programmes. Secondly, we simply cannot afford to live in segregated societies, because in the long run, inequality and exclusion is much more expensive for us than inclusion and integration. This is why we need to make sure that EU funds actually reach the people that need them the most. This report will give a very clear signal to both the Commission and the Member States to do exactly that. Be it community-led local development or strong implementation of the partnership principle, or be it monitoring our evaluation mechanisms that need to be improved, we have these tools and we need to implement them in order to make EU funds more inclusive. Lastly, alongside the set of good measures and proposals that are in this report, we also need to speak very clearly about the problems. Let us not shy away from clearly mentioning the obstacles that we are still facing to have inclusive societies in the European Union. Be it corruption or fraud, be it the lack of political will or anti-Gypsyism, we need to name these barriers in order to create good implementation and overcome these problems. Human rights are the basis of the European Union. Let us mainstream human rights in all policy fields in this Parliament and make them also the basis of our work with regard to EU structural funds, because in the end, this is going to create societies where everybody has a chance and can live equally.

Thank you so much. It supports several of the novelties introduced by the legislative framework for the European Structural and Investment Funds for 2014-2020. These include the fact that funding for social inclusion and poverty reduction should amount to at least 20% of the Member States’ European Social Fund budget. In fact, Member States have allocated 25.6% of the European Social Funds’ total budget – the total budget is about EUR 21 billion – to measures aimed at social inclusion. This includes support for marginalised communities such as the Roma. I welcome the rapporteur’s recommendations, many of which are fully in line with our guidance to Member States. Let me start by stressing that ʽpromoting social inclusion, combating poverty and any discriminationʼ is one of the eleven thematic objectives of the European Strategic and Investment Funds. Under this thematic objective, marginalised communities can receive support through a dedicated investment priority. In fact, Member States have programmed about EUR 1.5 billion under this priority. I am pleased that the report supports the explicit, but not exclusive, approach taken by the Commission in the use of European Strategic and Investment Funds in support to marginalised communities. Other thematic objectives – on education and unemployment – can also be mobilised to enhance European Union financial interventions. The European Strategic and Investment Funds are geared towards delivery on the European Union 2020 targets and the ensuing priorities set out in the country-specific recommendations. A tangible illustration of this is the fact that Member States which received country-specific recommendations on Roma integration have all programmed support under the dedicated investment priority on marginalised communities in their programming documents. The new legislative framework has also ensured that an adequate policy framework is in place before Member States receive actual European Strategic Investment Fund support through so-called ex-ante conditionalities. With regard to the Roma, Member States are required to set up a national Roma inclusion strategic policy framework. This is crucial, as the implementation of national Roma integration strategies in countries with sizeable Roma minorities largely relies on European Social Fund and European Regional Development Fund funding. I would like to refer now to some of the recommendations you made in your report. The report calls on the Commission to guide Member States in defining marginalised communities. I would like to stress that it is the Member States’ responsibility to define the marginalised communities on the basis of national indicators, taking into account their national context. This is based on the assumption that Member States are in a much better position to define the target groups for their support. The report also rightly draws attention to the issue of segregation, a very difficult issue. Spatial and education segregation/desegregation are complex and critical issues which both the European Regional Development Fund and the European Social Fund address. The Commission prepared a guidance note for Member States on the use of European Union funds in tackling segregation. It should help support inclusive education and housing for Roma. Infringement procedures have been launched against some Member States because of discrimination of Roma children in education. The importance the report attaches to the involvement of all relevant partners in the preparation and implementation of programmes is well echoed by the strengthened partnership principle in the Common Provisions Regulation. Its enforcement has been carefully ensured by the Commission during the negotiation phase of the programme. You also mentioned the European Union Urban Agenda, which should help cities to improve the implementation of European Union and national policies on the ground. Following discussions between the Commission, Member State cities, experts and stakeholders, urban poverty has been selected as a priority area where Roma inclusion may play an important role. The reinforcement of the administrative capacities of public and local authorities, which has been identified in the report as a key challenge, can be strongly supported by the funds. A dedicated thematic objective on administrative capacity can be used to support public administration in delivering services to marginalised communities in a more efficient manner. I very much welcome your call to empower marginalised communities and to ensure they can get easier access to European Union funding. I am convinced that a greater use of simplified cost options, fundamentally simplifying the management of the funds, as well as territorial approaches, including community-led local development, will play a crucial role in ensuring such better access. Finally, the report rightfully underlines the added value of transnational cooperation and exchange of good practices. This will be reflected in the new URBACT programme as well as in the new European Social Fund transnational cooperation framework. As a final note, I would like to stress once more that it is the Commission’s firm intention to steer the European Union towards social fairness. This requires that no citizen can be left behind. I therefore express in the strongest terms possible my commitment to use all means at the European Union’s disposal to reach the Union’s marginalised communities.

The report paves the way for an annual process in which Parliament can address the global challenges in a deep and comprehensive way. For me personally, the most important achievements in this report are the recommendations on the substantial strengthening of the economic, social, environmental and developmental dimensions of the UN system. According to the report, this must be done in the first instance by means of structural and functional reform of the Economic and Social Council, but we also call on the EU institutions and Member States to consider the possibility of strengthening their role in the ECOSOC by developing it into a Sustainable Development Council. My draft was more ambitious. I wanted to give the Sustainable Development Council the same kind of status as the Security Council in dealing with all areas of global cooperation other than security. I proposed that the Council would have permanent members: the European Union, the USA, Japan and the BRICS countries and rotating ones. These ideas got a lot of support in the negotiations, but not enough in order to be accepted. This basic idea is not a new one: it was originally launched in the Rio Conference in 1992. It was then watered down by establishing only the Commission on Sustainable Development under the ECOSOC. Chancellor Angela Merkel proposed, in a speech to the World Economic Council in Davos in 2009, the creation of a UN Economic Council according to the model of the UN Security Council. I have in mind a council with a wider mandate covering all economic, social, environmental and human development in the world. When Barack Obama started his term as President of the United States with Hillary Clinton as his Foreign Secretary, he introduced the idea of ‘three Ds’ in US Foreign and Security Policy: development was lifted to an equal footing with defence and diplomacy. Now we should do the same in the European Union. In the negotiations on my EU—UN report, I felt that those who emphasise the importance of the security dimension of the United Nations were reluctant to strengthen the other parts of the UN system. I even heard the argument that they do not belong to the area of foreign policy, even if they have a prominent position in the foreign and security policy goals section in the EU Treaty and development has a more central role in strengthening security all over the world. In the Committee on Foreign Affairs (AFET), a report is going to be drafted on the global security strategy of the EU. I think that we should pay a lot of attention to development issues also in that report. In the case of the EU, the defence pillar cannot have a dominant role. We have to rely more on diplomacy and development.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 189, "date": "2015-11-23.json", "name": "Notis MARIAS", "mepid": "125069", "text": "  ECR). Mr President, we are discussing the role of the European Union within the UN, which is known to protect human rights and promote economic and social development. However, development and the fight against poverty need resources, which in developing countries and in the countries of the European region do not exist, since the repayment of state debts goes to the loan lenders and thus the economic life of these countries has dried up.  That is why the UN General Assembly decision which last September decided on procedures for restructuring and writing off the state debts of developing countries should enter into force. However, this decision of the UN General Assembly was not voted for by any member country of the European Union, not even the heavily indebted countries of the European South, as they followed the orders of Brussels, the troika and international lenders.

As High Representative and Vice-President Federica Mogherini stressed in Vienna, following the horrific attacks in Paris (which were, in fact, attacks on us all), the answer to these barbaric terrorists must be in joining forces and coming together. Now everybody is affected. After bombings in Lebanon, Turkey and Iraq, and the Russian plane crash, this is a global problem that requires a global response. The challenges we face today are truly global in nature, and effective world governance has never been so crucial. A strong, effective United Nations, as well as a strong, united European Union acting together to advance our foreign policy objectives, values and interests on the United Nations stage, are more essential than ever since its creation 70 years ago. The European Union has very close cooperation and frequent contacts with the United Nations Secretariat. On all main United Nations policies – peace and security, development of human rights – we support each other, ranging from humanitarian assistance to cooperation programmes to peace operations. Let us assure you that the European Union’s voice in the United Nations is strong and is clearly heard. Just to take two examples: first, the European Union spoke with a clear, united voice in the 2013 agenda negotiations and has thus had a major influence on this final outcome; second, the European Union regularly briefs the United Nations Security Council, including through High Representative Vice-President Federica Mogherini personally, and participates in United Nations Security Council debates. Many other United Nations member states regularly align with our statements, so we often speak on behalf of an even larger group than the European Union and its Member States. The European Union is appreciated as a reliable, positive and constructive partner, and often a bridge-builder. Strong European Union coordination allows us to appear as a solid and coherent political actor. It is more important than ever that we closely cooperate on the several crises we are faced with. The European Commission fully agrees with Members when they say that we need to take prevention and early action very seriously. Gender equality and women’s empowerment also remain one of our major common priorities in this context, and we pursue this very actively at the United Nations. While it can seem difficult when so many full-blown conflicts already demand attention, we cannot focus on symptoms alone. We must pay attention to drivers and the root causes of conflicts, extremism and forced migration. It is important to achieve not only a rhetorical shift but a change of mindset. A clear recognition of the close interlinkage between peace, sustainable development, governance, gender equality, human rights and the rule of law in the 2013 agenda for sustainable development was just last week discussed in the Security Council under the United Kingdom Presidency, where the European Union also delivered a statement. It is our conviction that the role of security and development actors should be complementary, and sustaining peace should be a unifying thread running through the work of the United Nations. We must preach peace, development and security, and we believe that, as a global framework agreed by all the United Nations member states, the 2013 agenda can help us to do this. The agenda is an important opportunity for all of us to depart from business as usual. It is also very relevant for the ongoing peace reviews. As Members will know, the United Nations is currently engaged in a period of strategic reflection on several levels, and we are following this with great interest in the European Union. Therefore, this report is very timely. It is absolutely essential that we keep up our regular exchanges between the European Union and the United Nations on so many levels, ranging from high-level exchanges to desk-to-desk dialogues, and this includes you, the Members of the European Parliament, who also regularly visit the United Nations capitals. Shared analysis together with our partners, including the United Nations, is essential for more joined—up strategic thinking. The attacks in Paris are a terrible reminder of the magnitude of the threat and the importance of joining forces on counter-terrorism. The European Union and the United Nations have decided on a number of actions in recent months, including on foreign fighters, terrorist financing and countering violent extremism. Our collective response cannot be a procedural exercise. It is clear that together we need to do more, more effectively, with a new sense of purpose and urgency. Solving the Syrian and Libyan conflicts clearly remains a top priority.

We must not let these moments of crisis overwhelm us or mask our inaction on a problem concerning the European future, namely the lack of jobs among young people. Even if we often forget to talk about young people and the many vulnerabilities of this category, this does not mean that the problems no longer exist. On the contrary, they are getting worse. Today there are still 4.6 million young Europeans without any occupation whatsoever. The European Commission needs to come up with concrete data on the implementation of programmes aimed at preparing and occupying young people, and we in the European Parliament need to convince our institutional partners that we need more major initiatives and investments to reduce youth unemployment. That is why we have proposed that these programmes should also apply to young people up to the age of 35.

This double anniversary is therefore a good opportunity to draw a balance sheet and to conclude that there is still a great deal of work to be done in putting in place and applying the minority protection passages of international conventions. Many of the points of the Framework Agreement are simply not being implemented, and in my view, it could help if the Institutions of the European Union adopted a legally binding framework for the protection of minorities.  Although we would expect the initiative from the Commission, Parliament, as a representative of the interests of European citizens, could also lead this process. 40 million EU citizens are directly affected by this issue, so the EU must address the problems of national minorities.

The film Mediterranea talks about the motivation and fate of African refugees. The film Mustang talks about a young generation of Turks, and the Bulgarian film Urok talks about family relationships, misunderstandings and conflicts.

For many people this brings the added dread of extra energy costs. Energy efficiency and renewables are a key means of ensuring that energy poverty is reduced long term. While much progress has been made on improving efficiency and reducing their cost, government support schemes remain crucial. The market alone cannot deliver this crucial investment, particularly for those living in social housing and the private rental sector. That is why the recent decision by the Tories to slash support for solar and onshore wind is such a deplorable act. With the right legal framework, solar power alone could generate GBP 25.6 billion for the UK economy and support over 8 000 full—time skilled jobs – a vital investment in our future, putting money into local communities like my own.

It would have a strong impact on employment in our economy, not least because China has a clearly aggressive trade policy. These fears are particularly important in the steel sector, where bosses and unions have the same view.  China is not a market economy, it floods our market with steel products at prices that do not respect the principles of fair competition. To recognize it as such would therefore be detrimental to hundreds of thousands of direct and indirect jobs, and more generally to our economy as a whole. To be recognized as a market economy in the European Union, China must comply with five technical criteria, but they are far from being met. We must defend the values of our socially regulated market economy and not grant this status to China.
