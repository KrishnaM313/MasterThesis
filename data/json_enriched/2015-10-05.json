He was a very authoritative part of the management of the PCI for decades and I had him as a master. With him goes the most anomalous, open, suggestive, popular and empathetic Italian communist. His strength was not anchored in an ideology, on the contrary it springed from life, from experiences, from emotions, even in their corporeity, generated from the contact – as he himself will say for him psychically unbearable – towards the injustice that is exercised on the last or, rather, on offenses.  For this reason his thought, which he wanted to keep to the last part, nevertheless had a great universal intensity.

Thirty-seven people, including 19 employees, were seriously injured. According to Doctors Without Borders, the trauma center of Doctors Without Borders in Kunduz was hit by several airstrikes between 2.08am and 3.15am on October 3. The central hospital building, which contained the intensive care unit, emergency rooms and a physiotherapy ward, was repeatedly hit every time the attack was carried out, very precisely. As early as September 29, the hospital's geo-data was communicated to the international coalition as well as to the Afghan military and civilian authorities, but the bombings occurred.

First, I wanted to start by saying that this is an exceptional situation that needs to be addressed with specific measures. Each of us followed the summit on 12 and 13 July, when eurozone leaders reached an agreement to support Greece, each aware of the need for urgent action, both the leaders of the euro area and the European Commission and, of course, the European Parliament. In this respect, Parliament's committees decided on a simplified procedure without amendments to this Regulation in order to contribute to the general conditions for supporting Greece and to allow the Regulation to enter into force as soon as possible.  On 17 July, the European Commission presented a legislative proposal that also includes exceptional measures and aims: First, to increase the level of initial pre-financing for cohesion policy operational programmes for the period 2014-2020 under the Investment for growth and jobs goal and for programmes financed by the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund in Greece. Secondly, increase the maximum co-financing rate for operational programmes for the period 2007-2013 under the Convergence objectives and the Regional Competitiveness and Employment goals in Greece to 100% and remove the payment ceiling under these programmes. Through this change of regulation, the proposed measures aim to address a critical liquidity gap in the Greek economy and provide an immediate and necessary investment incentive, enabling a faster launch of a larger number of projects. This proposal is budget neutral for the period 2014-2020. All colleagues have agreed to apply the simplified procedure. As regards the Committee on Regional Development, no member has objected to this procedure. However, the Council, chaired by Luxembourg, also considered this dossier to be urgent and will follow Parliament if it accepts the Commission's proposal as it is. If Greece does not speed up the pace of its payment applications for the programmes concerned before the end of 2016, it faces the risk of recovering the additional initial pre-financing. Last but not least, Greece should submit a report to the Commission on the implementation of these exceptional measures. In order not to end up with only technical aspects, I would like to stress that we are here in this plenary as representatives of the citizens of the European Union and we can express our concern. We might think that we now have more pressing problems, but we must also respect our commitment to supportIng Greece here and today. For this reason, I call on you to support the proposal.", "language": "en", "original_language": "bg", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 17, "date": "2015-10-05.json", "name": "Valdis DOMBROVSKIS", "mepid": "28618", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission. – Madam President, on behalf of the Commission, I would like to thank Parliament for supporting the proposal to amend the Common Provisions Regulation as regards specific measures for Greece. The proposal is an exceptional measure to address the unique situation in Greece. The Commission’s proposal follows the agreement reached in July at the Euro Summit. The agreement reached between co-legislators to maintain the Commission proposal – and the exceptional speed which with which they processed this – is a concrete sign of European solidarity. The proposal must be seen in the wider context of the reform process undertaken by Greece. Timely and effective implementation of reforms to modernise the state and the economy, as agreed under the third programme, is crucial to ensure financial stability, fiscal sustainability and sound economic fundamentals for investment, job creation and growth. It is crucial to dispel any uncertainty and ensure a sound financial sector. With capital controls in place, the financing streams of the real economy are strained at a time when investment is needed most. The EU funds have an important role in this respect. There are substantial means available from the EU budget for Greece but the implementation of the project, co-financed with EU funds, is held back by the tight liquidity situation of the Greek state. To help address this situation we have put forward three exceptional measures so that the investment supported by EU funds can take place, and take place swiftly. For the 2014-2020 period, it is proposed to increase the rate of initial pre—financing for Greece by seven percentage points for the European Regional Development Fund, the Cohesion Fund, the European Social Fund and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund. This frontloading should allow for starting more investments earlier.  For the 2007-2013 period, two measures are proposed: firstly to release the last five percent of the remaining EU payments, which are normally retained until the closure of the programmes in 2017 and, secondly, to remove the obligation to provide for national cofinancing and to apply the 100% EU financing rate. These measures should help bring the investment finance for the 2007-2013 period to a successful conclusion. All these measures would translate into EUR 2 billion available for Greece over the two years 2015 and 2016. Importantly, these measures are budget-neutral for the current Multiannual Financial Framework and would have no impact on the payment plan either. The additional pre-financing for the 2014-2020 programmes should be covered by payment application by the end of 2016. It is, of course, crucial to ensure that the money duly reaches the beneficiaries and does so as quickly as possible in line with the rules of sound financial management. To this end, a ring-fencing mechanism will ensure that additional amounts for the 2007-2013 period are used only for payments to beneficiaries. Greece has already put such a mechanism in place. Moreover, Greece is required to report on the implementation of these measures by the end of 2016 and in the final implementation report for the 2007-2013 period. The Commission has stood by Greece throughout the crisis with both financial support and technical assistance. We will continue to support Greece, both in the implementation of the reforms and in making the best use of EU funds.  Technical assistance is already being provided through the new Structural Reform Support Service which is available to all EU Member States. Technical meetings and ad hoc missions on the ground are being organised. As it happens, Commissioner Crețu is in Greece today. I am looking forward to your debate.

We particularly welcome the fact that frontloading is taking place. In particular, we welcome the fact that there is no need for any own subsidies from Greece. Greece urgently needs help. During the crisis, more than 250 000 businesses in Greece went bankrupt and were destroyed. In this respect, we urgently and quickly need aid for Greece. Personally, I would warn against saying too quickly now that we want a monitoring of success. It takes time to start this development and, above all, it takes time to make other investments that go beyond that, so that Greece has the chance to get out of this crisis, out of this crisis with European solidarity and help, and not, at the same time, destroy labour rights. We have to wait for this process. Patience is needed, including in this House.

As regards the whole package of the Juncker proposals and the related agreement reached in the summer, it is absolutely necessary that we deliver.

Secondly, the most important requirement – which is to have money available to finalise the projects that can benefit from this proposal – is what is at stake this evening and in tomorrow’s vote. But there is another aspect I want to touch upon, which is the control that Parliament wishes to exercise on the regional funds. The EPP Group has proposed that in this case for Greece – and especially regarding these measures where we take away co-financing and for which we pay 100% of the money needed for projects – we have a say on the matter and special control. That is why the EPP Group proposed, in the debate at the Committee on Regional Development, to have a special rapporteur, a permanent rapporteur, on Greece.  Greece now is the only country where 100% European funding is necessary. As has just been said by the rapporteur, it is a sign of solidarity in Europe. But on the other hand, we want to be sure that this money is going to the projects for which it is intended, and that the full control that applies to every other country in Europe, according to the regulations, is applied in the Greek situation.

It is the right answer. After the unilateral austerity policies of recent years, we now finally need investment in the Greek economy. How else can this country get on its feet if investment is not made? The only instrument that the European Union has for this is cohesion policy. We must finally make good use of this! The projects which have also been selected for the old funding period have been selected together with the Task Force for Greece set up by the Commission. And this task force has always been there for reporting in the Committee on Regional Affairs and has accompanied the projects that are now to be 100% funded in Greece in the coming months. What perhaps not every member of this house knows is that if we do not release this money, Greece will not only have the problem of having to pay 5%, but it will have to refund to the Commission the entire 95% that these projects have already cost. That would be an absolute disaster. Of course, there is a need for control. Everywhere must be checked. It is up to us as a Parliament to accompany this. That's right! But to pretend now – and unfortunately some colleagues are doing so – as if this were now a tragedy, that we are taking money in our hands in a budget-neutral manner in order to support Greece, to support the labour market and economic development, I do not think that is appropriate.

Greece must implement reforms that the Cypriot government ran away from last term, and voters recently rewarded it for this behaviour. I believe, therefore, that there will be no significant breakthrough for the better in implementing structural reforms in the coming period, which makes our efforts to help Greece somewhat futile. The proposal highlighted that Greece lacks the funding for public investment needed to foster a sustainable recovery. I believe that to be true, but I must express disagreement with such a strategy. Increasing government spending will certainly not lead the state out of the crisis because such irresponsible behaviour has introduced it. For our efforts to make any sense, the new Greek government must attract private investors and strengthen the private sector at the expense of the public. Is the Cypriot government ready for that? By what measures does he plan to achieve this? I'm afraid these moves don't help our Greek friends and partners in the long run, we push them deeper into the abyss. If Greece were not a member of the eurozone, in which it was admitted under suspicious circumstances, it would be visibly more difficult to borrow all these years and would be in much less trouble today. We may have stopped giving unconditional gifts to Greeks with European taxpayers' money, but we continue to encourage them to spend excessively with these formulations that make public investment a precondition for sustainable recovery.  A sustainable recovery in Greece can only be achieved by reducing public spending, cutting public sector cuts, reducing administrative burdens and attracting private capital.

It comes at the right time, recognises the problems facing Greece for many years and the Commission has shown maturity at the moment, and I want to say that, in all likelihood, Parliament will do the same. This Parliament will take by accelerated procedure all those necessary decisions in order to express to the Greek people at the moment the solidarity of the European Union, the Commission and parliament and all those who decide, and thus to help all those we know need help in Greece. In this context, the ALDE group, on whose behalf I speak here, supports this expedited procedure. Our rapporteur, chairwoman of the Regional Development Committee, did everything she could. At the meeting of our Committee we saw the need for an accelerated procedure without much formality, all that is at our disposal, precisely with the aim and with the only desire to help Greece.  Estimates suggest that around €2 billion will be saved for the Greek budget here, that almost 1 billion will accumulate further for the needs of the Cohesion and Structural Fund, as well as the Maritime and Fisheries Fund. These are significant assets. It will not solve all the problems in Greece, but it will be a very concrete and clear means that will bring a new chance for Greece and for the Greek government from which we expect a lot.  The Greek government went to the polls, recently regaining confidence. Cipras spoke here in Parliament, promised reforms. We expect these reforms. We expect the new government to respond in the way we have shown. We have shown solidarity, we have shown the decision to help Greece, but we also expect the Greek government to deliver on its promises it has made to Europe and thus do what we all expect – to make Greece a true part of our great European family again.

From the outside, we are now discussing very technical issues. We are talking about 7% more pre-financing, we are talking about two billion more co-financing from the European side, more rapid release of the 5% payment and technical administrative support. Outside this House and the Commission, few citizens probably understand what it means. In essence, however, we are discussing much, much more today. This is because it is a central decision of direction within the European Union. It is a question of whether we manage to solve pragmatic problems together in a crisis situation, or whether we sacrifice these solutions on the altar of populism. Right-handedness has repeatedly led to dead ends in Europe in the past. Only negotiations on an equal footing and reliable solutions can pave the way for a positive development in Greece. The Commission's proposal takes up just that. After all, the one-sided austerity policy of recent years has failed. The tough conditions, including from the European level, have helped to bring the Greek economy to the ground today. And now we have come to the point where the Commission also sees that we must turn words into deeds. The fact that Greece can benefit more quickly and easily from a European investment policy is a first step in the right direction. Because with these European structural funds, we have a very strong instrument in our hands to get Greece out of this impasse. That is why the investments must now flow. 25% of all public investment in Greece is from European structural policy. In order to boost the economy, this money must now be available, not in any way, but in a very targeted manner, for meaningful projects that create jobs that are environmentally sustainable and transparent. That is another reason why the fourth point in this proposal , the point on technical assistance – is so central. The Greek administration must now do a great deal, hand in hand, with the European Commission, in order to implement these projects in a meaningful way. There is a great deal ahead of us. Only if we move away from the national petty spirit can we manage to do so with common European forces. That is why the question arises today as to whether we are reliable European partners on this point too and whether we, as Europeans, stand alongside Greece, in these tough circumstances and in this tough situation. My group says yes! Right now, what European solidarity means is clear.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in view of the tragic situation in Greece, the 5-Star Movement is obliged to vote in favour of the proposal to increase cofinancing for the old programming and pre-financing advance for the current one. The 5-Star Movement has always advocated a policy of greater flexibility towards the Greek people, sharply criticising the austerity policies and the way in which the memorandum was negotiated that were imposed on Greece. I would stress that the proposal does not involve any change in the annual ceilings for commitments and payments provided for in the multiannual financial framework and that the annual allocation of commitment appropriations for the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund remains unchanged.  I would also like to point out that there is a mechanism in place to ensure that the amounts are used exclusively for payments to beneficiaries and for operational programmes, that is to say for citizens. The 5-Star Movement therefore votes positively but, mind you, our vote on these individual measures does not shift by a comma our assessment of the vexatious treatment imposed on Greek citizens in the name of austerity, budgetary constraints and rules that apply only to some and less to others.  I would also like to stress the enormous effort and great humanity that the Greek people, despite the very difficult conditions in which they find themselves, have shown in welcoming migrants who are men and women fleeing wars or in search of a better future and not, as is often passed in public, clandestine speeches.

Lenders are therefore handing out Greece's cloths in order to allow the unimpeded financing of the NSRF. Thus, with one hand the European Union gives funds to the NSRF, which Greece is entitled to anyway, and with the other hand takes them back double and triple. Moreover, according to European Commission data, more than 40% of the European funds allocated to Greece go directly back to the hard core countries of the European Union, such as the Netherlands, for the purchase of industrial equipment, raw materials, consumer goods and so on. For this reason, European funds must be invested in productive investment, in the primary sector, in new technologies, in infrastructure, in industrial development and in tourism. And certainly not in consumption and imports. The funded actions of the NSRF should focus on investments in sectors that bring domestic added value to Greece. But in order for Greece to enter the avenue of new development, it must throw the troika out of the country and get rid of the burden of shameful debt that must be written off.

They passed through easily and smoothly to come to this place.

I would suggest that ‘I am from the EU and here to help’ are perhaps the most terrifying words in the English language. Help never comes without strings and it is never straightforward. The Greek state reminds me very much of my uncle. He is a great chap, a likeable, top person, but he always needs and wants more than he can actually afford at the time, so he ends up asking for his money and his wages frontloaded. He never deals with the real problem, which is that he spends too much on beer and cigarettes. The Greek state should deal with the real problem. They should begin by leaving the eurozone: that is the obvious way forward for them. What will happen when other countries within the eurozone see what happens here, see this precedent and demand any funds to them to be frontloaded? It is unsustainable.

Athens lacks the funds for public investment, it has massive liquidity problems. Of course, in the past, European structural and investment funds have played a major role in attracting investment in Greece – after all, 25% of the investment comes from these funds. The Commission has therefore proposed a rapid procedure to improve the liquidity situation and boost investment in the context of the framework for the third Greek package. The rapporteur for this report has endorsed these proposals to amend the regulation and calls for additional advances from the 2014-2020 budget framework for the operational programmes of the cohesion policy and the Maritime and Fisheries Fund, the so-called frontloading. Secondly, it calls for a 100% increase in the cap on cumulative pre-financing and interim payments for programmes for the period 2013-2017 under the Convergence and Regional Competitiveness objectives – that is, a lifting of the ceiling on payments from these programmes. The lifting of the need for co-financing and the dropping of a ceiling are intended to enable an additional EUR 2 billion for investment in the Greek budget. In other words, the Greek budget can save these two billion. The Committee on Budgets in this Parliament has confirmed that the implementation of the programme before 2016 is important – as has already been said today – otherwise not only five per cent, but at the end of the day, 95 per cent of pre-financing would have to be repaid. That is why it is important that success is checked and that there should be a permanent rapporteur in the Committee on Regional Policy on cofinancing.

Greece has also been helped a lot. If we remember, the last multiannual financial framework provided EUR 42 billion in funding for Greece. And the subsidy rate has been increased from the usual 85% to 95%. This 10% addition is eur 4 billion. And yet Greece was unable to get two billion euros from these funds. This was partly due to the fact that the Greek administration was unable to meet all the requirements. What conclusions do we draw from this? Firstly, we are now increasing the EU's co-financing to 100%. In addition, these funds can now be called up early before all the necessary documents are submitted. It is also open to appropriations earmarked for later financial years. But I wonder: is this really the right medicine for this unfortunately sick patient? I think no! For one thing, we have a distortion of facts here – we are talking here about cofinancing the EU, but in reality it is full funding. Full financing, however, is always a strategic risk, because if a recipient of grants no longer has to provide their own services, the risk of no meaningful investments increases enormously. In addition, we must finally improve the administration in Greece so that the funds – which are available – can also be used in a meaningful way. Finally, what about the sustainability of these funds if we are now spending funds in the next one or two years that are actually intended for a seven-year period? None of this can work.

The Committee on Budgetary Control was there last week and visited seven projects from the 181 projects priority list. Above all, we have found a lack of money. The question is: where does the lack of money come from? It comes naturally from the fact that projects have been financed for many years. Fourteen years. Now the end of the flagpole has been reached. The question, Mr Vice-President, is, what are we doing with all the ruins of investment? The Commission's draft is a draft that does not help, which does not really solve the problems, because the problems are, of course, elsewhere. And it would be nice, dear Greek colleagues, if Greece were also to help itself. We have seen that there are major problems with land expropriations – long-standing procedures. Why are we not taking measures to shorten these procedures? Then we would have faster and better investments. Why, please, are decisions not made in such a way that those who have to make the decisions in the projects – namely the project managers – are allowed to make decisions? The government, like its predecessors, still takes everything to itself and does not want to decide. It would be nice if the Commission had presented which projects from the 2007 to 2013 list should now be financed. I would like to warn as a matter of urgency against continuing in Greece as it has been so far. The future selection of projects must be much sharper and much more thoughtfully, otherwise we will again be confronted with investment ruins at the end of the next period, where we will then consider which and how much money will have to be repaid. I consider what has been presented today to be a breach of the law and a serious error. I see that there is a broad consensus here according to the motto: a lot helps a lot. But it will not help. Let us at least learn from the past and avoid the worst mistakes for the future.

Firstly, it is undoubtedly a kind of response to an emergency situation, in other words, a statement that a change of approach is needed – the question is whether there is a long-term change or some short-term action that concerns a particular situation. We are changing certain rules for a limited period of time, because shared management also requires shared funding. At a time when we are giving up shared funding, we are dealing with management that is only partially shared. We must therefore realise that this is an emergency situation, that this is an emergency aid situation, but it can have consequences if it can happen, that it will also apply to other countries where certain rules will have to be changed.

Many of these programmes are related to the support of enterprises in the tourism sector. The Greek government increases the VAT levied on catering, but also the VAT levied on hotel accommodation.

It is important that the funds are used correctly. When they have the resources... when projects have 10 per cent co-financing, when projects also have an advance payment, there are also very many temptations, traps for various irregularities, malvers that, as we all know, have also happened in Greece in the past.

The debate was very interesting and very focused on the problems of both Greece and cohesion policy.  Allow me to make a few clarifications and respond to some of the lines that were presented here in the hall. First, I would like to point out that the Committee on Regional Policy very responsibly examined the European Commission's proposal at two meetings of its own, dedicated a special extraordinary meeting and then held another meeting where it discussed the issue. I accept all the considerations of colleagues who fear a possible lack of control. I would like to stress that this proposal does not give Greece a gift, this proposal enables the Greek side to use resources when it needs it, at a time when it needs this resource.  This proposal is extraordinary, requires extraordinary behaviour and extraordinary measures, but it does not set a precedent and does not increase funding for the Greek side, but allows Greece to use a resource that has already been agreed to be able to solve problems at the moment. Cohesion policy does not become a financial liquidity policy, cohesion policy through this type of emergency solutions fulfils its role to be effectively implemented under the conditions in each Member State. Whether the measures will be successful, we will see, monitor and control. Cohesion policy through such initiatives and such a measure enables the Greek government.

Above all, I consider it essential to monitor the proper use of extra payments thoroughly and closely. I would also like to draw attention to the fact that the proposal ignores a number of important principles such as co-financing, subsidiarity, additionality or equal treatment. These principles are decisive in cohesion policy, so I support the Commission's proposal for an amendment in view of the specific situation in Greece, but I think it is important that this be a one-off and individual measure and does not set a precedent or have an impact on the shaping of the future nature of cohesion policy.  I also consider it necessary to avoid the Commission presenting similar proposals for amendments in the future merely at the initiative of the Euro summit, as this will damage the participation of non-euro area Member States in the decision-making process.

These objectives are important for reducing poverty and improving the living of citizens in each region, but especially in urban centres and where there are, concentrated and in high density, populations living under miserable conditions, i.e. in slums, for example. The ultimate objective is to create conditions for the provision of effective Community services and development by local authorities.  The report builds on the post-2015 development programme and the Rio + 20 conclusions. The report therefore underlines the need for effective global cooperation both between the public and private sectors, as well as between states, local authorities as institutions of the various states and the social base. In the general axes of the report, it is stressed that development comes from the improvement of the mechanisms of action of local authorities and arises from the principles of local responsibility, democracy and capacity that local authorities must have in order to achieve predetermined objectives.  The importance of the participation of indigenous peoples is supported in order to achieve the objectives set. This means strengthening participatory democracy and increasing controls and therefore restrictions on corruption. If anyone listened to the previous debate, they would understand exactly what we are trying to say. It is clear the important role played by technology and the means it provides, as well as the importance of exploiting the natural resources of each region in order to achieve local development.  What should be given particular attention and emphasis should be placed on are relations between central authorities and local authorities, which vary according to the state systems of each country and, above all, the level of democracy. The quality and effectiveness of local authorities are relevant to the democratic power of the central authority and the political stability of the country. The powers and responsibilities of the Centre are important and essential when they provide an effective functioning, through local authorities and aim to combat poverty, social inequality with the ultimate aim of development. A major problem is the inability to cooperate with sound local authorities when the central authority is plagued by corruption.  At this point, I have also tried to put my personal experience of a 25-year-old action in Africa. In these circumstances, two important directions are relevant between relations between central authority and local authorities. Firstly, the granting, where necessary, of more powers and responsibilities to local authorities, particularly in large countries, for the purposes of decentralisation and effective administration. Secondly, the granting, from the centre to local authorities, of special powers. The first dimension is interlinked with the second and vice versa.  The European Union has an obligation to pursue a positive policy on the basis of mutual respect for developing countries, knowing that solving the problems in these countries also relieves us of many problems within the European Union, such as the continuous, uncontrolled and dangerous waves of migrants themselves.  Therefore, development in poor countries means, at the same time, fewer problems in the European Union itself and an increase in the conditions for cooperation for a better world, for the implementation of the human rights of every citizen, in all the lengths and widths of the earth. The proper allocation of development aid is based significantly on local authorities.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 87, "date": "2015-10-05.json", "name": "Neven Mimica", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, as this Assembly knows, policy is local and, as with any other policy, development cooperation policy also has to be local. That is why I would like to thank Parliament for its resolution on the role of local authorities in development cooperation. It highlights a common belief that the roots of democracy and well-being are local. Development starts at the local level. Most jobs, basic social services, political and civic rights are provided first and foremost in cities or regions or through local branches of government. Moreover, I agree with the resolution where it states that, in order to be adequate and legitimate, policies have to be defined through a bottom-up approach. This means that they have to start with local authorities.  I am convinced that the newly adopted 2030 agenda for sustainable development can only be of benefit if all actors are involved and mobilised. To that end, all public and private representatives, including local authorities, have to be involved in the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals. The world’s urban population will reach 70% by 2050. Having a specific goal dedicated to urbanisation is therefore of crucial importance. But beyond the specific Sustainable Development Goal, cities will be the frontline of all other issues, including migration, environmental sustainability, climate resilience, fragility and inequalities. Local authorities will need human, institutional and financial resources to fulfil their missions. The transfer of financial resources from central governments remains a difficult aspect of decentralisation, and it is often overlooked. All these issues are a question of sovereignty. We will address this through our political dialogue with partner countries, with the objective of ensuring coherent and efficient implementation. Since 2013, the Commission has been working on empowering local authorities in partner countries for enhanced governance and more effective development outcomes. This work will now be intensified. We have started to deliver on this commitment following four priorities, which are: supporting decentralisation reforms and local initiatives; strengthening the capacity of local authorities; addressing the challenges brought to the fore by rapid urbanisation; and engaging with associations of local authorities at all levels. These priorities are all covered by the resolution to be adopted in Parliament. As an example of our cooperation, in January this year the Commission signed the first framework partnership agreements with five global and regional associations of local authorities. These agreements formalise our reinforced support. We are also backing up our political commitment by providing adequate resources: EUR 450 million has already been secured from the dedicated programme of the Instrument for Development Cooperation on civil society organisations and local authorities. All EU instruments are gradually taking local governments into account as well. Approximately EUR 1.7 billion will be used to support decentralisation reforms, rural development and local governance in the period up to 2020. These precious resources must be used to ensure delivery and concrete results in empowering local authorities in the implementation of development cooperation.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 88, "date": "2015-10-05.json", "name": "Davor Ivo STIER", "mepid": "119435", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Club. – Madam President, here ten days ago at the United Nations summit, heads of state and government adopted a new agenda for sustainable development.

A great deal of work has been done, but now there is that many more difficult, challenging part, i.e. fulfill promises or transform words into actions. The implementation of as many as 17 sustainable development goals is a major challenge and requires the formation of a global partnership that will include all participants. Therefore, that is why I would like to support the rapporteur and congratulate her on this report, which deals with important global development actors, i.e. local authorities.  In its report on the new global development framework adopted last November, the European Parliament highlighted local authorities as key players both in the creation and implementation of the new development agenda. Mep Theocharous's report reaffirms the view of members of this House that good governance is needed at all levels of government – local, national and international – in order to achieve development goals, eradicate poverty and ensure a dignified life for all people.  In a final document adopted in New York, Target 11 on sustainable development in urban areas was also adopted. It is quite clear that the implementation of this goal is possible only with close cooperation with local authorities. However, local government participation must not be limited to this objective. Local authorities are key to achieving all other goals, but also for collecting data, measuring results for transparency and accountability. In addition to the best understanding of the need for local authorities as the level of power closest to citizens, decentralisation of power is also an effective tool in the fight against corruption, construction and democracy and the protection of human rights, and this is what many developing countries need most.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 89, "date": "2015-10-05.json", "name": "Louis-Joseph MANSCOUR", "mepid": "124725", "text": "  On behalf of the Group of President and Women, ladies and gentlemen, just a few weeks before COP 21, to be held in Paris, and while the international community has just adopted the new Sustainable Development Goals, this report and this debate are timely.  First of all, I want to congratulate the rapporteur. This text gives us the opportunity to recall the crucial role played by local authorities in defining and implementing European and international development policy. As a provider of basic public services such as health, education, including water and sanitation, we are measuring how much the expertise of these authorities in these key areas will play a key part in the success of our commitment to eradicating poverty.  The eleventh sustainable development objective for cities allows local authorities to be fully recognised as central players in international cooperation. I think that we can modestly see this as a victory for the European Union and, above all, for our Parliament, which has been constantly stressing the key role of decentralisation and decentralised cooperation in improving the living conditions of the world's poorest.  The Commission must now take up this report and the proposals it contains to promote a development policy based on multi-level governance. As such, it is high time that decentralisation became a full-fledged financial concentration of the European Union for developing countries. I will conclude my remarks by echoing the words of Kofi Annan, former Secretary-General of the United Nations who, at the launch of the Millennium Development Goals in 2000, stressed that their achievement would be local or not.

Likewise, the second experience I had when I was vice president of ARLEM, when we had cooperation with the southern Mediterranean coast in this organization that brings together regional and local authorities of the European Union and regional and local authorities of the southern part of the Mediterranean, was seen how important it is for them to have direct relations and direct cooperation with us.

I propose that the European Commission really maximises the cooperation between our cities, our big cities and smaller cities, as well as rural environments in developing countries and how essential for strengthening democracy, for strengthening development, is precisely to encourage cooperation and exchange of experiences that large cities in Europe have that are needed by large cities in African countries, for example Cairo which really needs our help in its business planning for example.

This report is first and foremost a translation of the failure of previous policies aimed at African states and in particular States.  Over the past sixty years, more than $1 trillion has been spent on development assistance. Nearly half of Africans still live on one euro a day. In the last half-century, wars and massacres have killed ten million people, eighty coups. Eleven countries have experienced civil wars in 15 years, which have cost, beyond human lives, nearly two hundred billion dollars, not to mention the corruption that is estimated by the African Union at one hundred and fifty billion dollars a year.  How, then, can we talk about development aid? A nascent economy requires stable institutions, functioning public services and opportunities for young people.  Addressing, as we do, lower communities will not solve anything. To combat corruption, control migration flows and promote development, three priorities are needed: to condition aid in a project logic and no longer in a window logic, to ensure transparency and control to eradicate corruption networks and to punish the actions of multinationals predatory raw materials or juicy markets without regard for local populations.

Local authorities are closest to their communities. Like no one else knows their needs. We also see this in our regions in the Member States of the European Union. Building this awareness in developing countries is crucial not only for central and local authorities, but also for citizens. The centres of government should support the decentralisation process and communicate good governance patterns, competences and funding so that they are used most efficiently at local level. Local authorities, in turn, must be open both to dialogue with residents and to cooperation with civil society organisations, other administrations and private partners. These partnerships have a real impact on increasing social inclusion by promoting education, strengthening micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, creating jobs and promoting sustainable economic growth in the region.

The key to success is the proximity to program management and the strength of the link that unifies those who help and those who receive help. Practice shows that, especially in rural areas, it is local institutions that best meet these requirements. At the local level, corruption risks are reduced and monitoring and evaluation improved. Locally, there is the key to sustainable territorial development and the promotion of more democratic governance. That is why the United Nations promotes and recognizes the local role in cooperation policies. Therefore, the local must be adequately recognised and integrated into the functioning of the eleventh European Development Fund (EDF). The success of these cooperation policies is one of the keys to promoting sustainable development in the most depressed areas of the planet. It is also a key to European immigration policy. It is, in short, the natural expression of the necessary coexistence between measures requiring a comprehensive approach, such as visa policy or the common security and defence policy, and this area of cooperation in which the local and regional take precedence. The report also concerns another particularly important issue also for the construction of a Europe that is indeed the sum of all its diversity. This is the financial adequacy of local and regional entities. This is another essential condition for harmonious development also in Europe and one of the keys to maintaining financial effort in terms of cooperation. The Basque Country, thanks to its commitment to these policies and a well-structured financing system, remains at the head of the Spanish State in this area.

This has been the case for decades, and it has become an almost cultural norm in many countries that find it difficult to make national and local government transparent and accountable. The idea that somehow bypassing the top layer of government will see less waste of our money is a naive idea, to say the least. The Turkish proverb ‘the fish stinks from the head down’ is very pertinent here. If you have a corrupt national government it is safe to say that there will be corruption within a nation at every level. The idea that it will be easier to police hundreds or even thousands of local authorities when you cannot do the job with dozens of national governments is ludicrous. One of the first duties of government is to ensure that the taxes that they collect from their citizens are treated with respect. If we cannot guarantee that the aid we hand over is managed within a framework in which we have confidence, if we cannot be sure that we are not propping up corrupt regimes or paying for fleets of Mercedes limos and private jets, then we should not be handing over aid at all. The message should be: get your own house in order if you expect our help. Paying local authorities directly undermines the nation state and could be used to gerrymander the overthrow of legitimate, but poor, governments pursuing EU objectives. If the EU directly funds tribal councils in Africa or the Middle East it will undermine national unity in the strength of legitimate central authorities.

Today's debate is, I think, important, because it takes place shortly after the adoption in New York of the 2030 Agenda on Sustainable Development. As is well known, it is an ambitious agenda, which also includes the desire to end extreme poverty and to engage all countries on the path of sustainable development by 2030. At the level of implementation, the involvement of local authorities and civil society will be crucial if, of course, the Sustainable Development Goals become a reality. As the Theocharous report points out, local authorities have a major role to play in ensuring the link between citizens and government, as well as in building democratic ownership of the development agenda at the level of each country. That is why it is essential to support the action of local authorities, in order to enable them to fully assume this role in the provision of basic services, but also to ensure participation and accountability at sub-national level, despite what Mr Schaffhauser said earlier, which does not see this level at all. I also think it is important to support the institutional capacity building of local authorities and, as the Theocharous report says, there is a need for a political dialogue between local authorities within the framework of our development cooperation. Finally, as a permanent rapporteur on the coherence of development policies, I want to stress that local authorities can also play an important role in this regard, because they can promote and monitor this concept. However, their role in development policies, development policy coherence, has not been sufficiently explored at European level or outside the Union. We therefore need, I believe, a specific framework for the policy of coherence for development to be carried out within an inclusive framework. Thank you for your attention.

I think it is very important to be able to support national governments, but also local authorities in developing countries, both through financial means and by providing technical assistance to them. It is necessary and urgent for the European Union to make effective use of its external and development policies to combat poverty, but also to the causes that generate and sustain conflict. Lack of education and prospects for young people, poverty, unemployment, discrimination, marginalisation and corruption make young generations the safe victims of radicalisation and extremism, as we have seen, and condemn citizens to poverty and insecurity. Preventing and resolving these conflicts and developing must be priorities within a coordinated global strategy of the European Union, which uses both diplomatic and security tools and economic and human rights resolution tools.  A good example is the financial support that the European Union has promised and must give to the authorities of Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey. It is extremely important to help these states, which have made an impressive humanitarian effort and not only in the management of refugee camps, but also in supporting local authorities, which have difficulty providing health, education and social assistance services for their own citizens.

The definition, in conjunction with local authorities, of a limited number of priorities should enable a better fit and ownership of the projects implemented. It is also a way of sharing responsibility with state actors who are as close as possible to the citizens. Secondly, I believe that it is time to make local authorities cooperate more closely for development because it is through them that we can promote the emergence of democracy, prevent and cure conflicts, which, as we know, are one of the main obstacles to development in many countries. Recognition of the role of local authorities must also improve women's participation in decision-making, as a matter of principle and because it is known that the positive development benefits are significant.  Finally, the commission's new communication guidelines on local authorities must be translated into concrete action today in the implementation of the 11th EDF. There is no more time to waste EU aid paying off: let us not turn a blind eye to the links between today's migration crisis and the perfectibility of our European development policy.  Finally, I hope that this report will be forwarded, beyond the Council and the Commission, to the local authorities of our Member States, to the African Union for example, to our ACP partners, to highlight precisely the role of local authorities in development cooperation.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 120, "date": "2015-10-05.json", "name": "Bernd LUCKE", "mepid": "124820", "text": "   Madam President, I would like to thank the president for her My group also supports this report.

Other instruments, such as the use of micro-credits or private sector participation and the raising of financial resources from the private sector, are also important elements of a successful development policy. However, I would also like to point out that what has been worked out so well here should also be applied in very different contexts. Because we have just had a debate on how we are getting the special aid to Greece off the market. And this special aid – where we have now suddenly made EUR 35 billion available from medium-term financial planning, which was supposed to last several years – is precisely not respecting the principle of subsidiarity.

Madam President, I thank the Commissioner, all colleagues for their contribution to the debate. I want to talk to you about a myth of my country, from Greek mythology: about the myth of the Danes, where the Danes had the curse of trying to fill a pit that had a thousand holes, with water. This is now the countries that receive development aid, a point that has a thousand holes and what we are doing is trying to close some holes by strengthening local government. We are not trying to solve the whole problem by raising the issue of local government. I would like to say to my fellow Members a few things to look out for: development aid is one thing and charity is another. Today we are not asking for an increase in development aid, but for an increase in its effectiveness. In other words, the point is, this aid that we give to make way, to create infrastructure, so that people can live better.  Because if the methods we have used to date were effective, our report would not even be needed, the report would not make sense. And we are not talking, of course, about local self-government in Europe, but we are talking about local government in some other countries, where if some colleagues knew what is happening in poor countries, they would talk more fearfully about what might happen in the world and some people would not insist that the European Union cannot export democracy. Commissioner, much of what you have said, rather everything you have said, overlaps with what is included in the report. I would point out that generalisations and rules cannot apply to all states, all mentalities and all regions of the earth. There are democratically elected local authorities, but there are also areas where local government is in the hands of the tribal leader. All these things must be taken into account, taking into account the level of democracy from then on.

As Chair of this Committee I fully understand, and regret to hear of, the difficulties faced by petitioners. Most petitions concern the situation in Spain but the same problems are also known in other Member States.  The Committee on Petitions is the bridge between EU citizens and EU institutions and, as its Chair, I strive for the EU to better take advantage of citizens’ direct experiences of EU law and also the experiences of national implementation, because these experiences can help us as legislators to further improve future legislation. In this role of bringing the concerns of citizens forward to this House, we have initiated this debate tonight. As I said, we have received a large number of petitions denouncing the violation of fundamental rights and infringement of EU legislation in connection with the lack of accurate consumer information related to practices in mortgage banking. Obtaining accurate information is crucial for making sound economic decisions, and of course vital when we talk about important personal investments for an individual citizen and his or her family.  These petitions highlight a number of abusive clauses and practices in the Spanish mortgage sector which have been identified by both national and European courts. A large number of citizens became victims of financial fraud as their savings banks sold them very risky financial instruments and they were not duly informed about the extent of the risks involved in the proposed investment; nor did the banks perform suitably tests to determine whether clients had the knowledge to understand the risk that they were undertaking. This has led to cases of terrible personal suffering and huge economic losses, where citizens have lost their home and all their life savings. Many tragedies have taken place before our eyes. However, I would like to stress that the aim of this question and the discussion tonight should be seen in a wider perspective. Our aim is to raise awareness and seek clarity regarding a general problem of bad banking practices that can be found all over Europe, not only within Spain. I would therefore like to stress that transparency and informed consumer protection will be essential components if we want to combat abusive terms in mortgage contracts and thus strengthen protection for borrowers. Nevertheless, on behalf of my committee, I would like to ask the Commission some questions related to this situation. I hope that the Commission’s investigation and conclusions will allow us to improve the situation for the petitioners and also to ensure that we can avoid this kind of practice in the future and consequently improve the application of European Union law. So, Commissioner, on the basis of the petitions, a number of questions should have an answer tonight. Do the petitions relate to the breach of banks’ obligations in relation to the information to be provided to clients under the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) I, as transposed by Spanish law? Has Spain properly transposed MiFID I or have Spanish national authorities properly enforced the applicable provisions? We are also asking what measures the Commission has taken or will take to address the abuses committed by companies selling financial instruments that affect small depositors and small owners of financial instruments such as preferred shares, which in many cases have been marketed without full compliance with EU legislation.  I would like to know, too, if the Commission is willing to take measures with regard to unfair clauses in Spanish mortgage law, in particular with regard to unfair commercial practices and the incorrect behaviour of the banks that provided all these people with the loans in question. I am looking forward to your answers, Commissioner Jourová, and also to hearing the views of my colleagues. And let me say, on a personal note, that we should be full of compassion for the people who have suffered terribly, but we should also make sure that future legislation is safe and sound for everyone in Europe.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 135, "date": "2015-10-05.json", "name": "Věra Jourová", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, let me first reply to questions number one and number two. Yes, many Spanish consumers, especially borrowers, have recently found themselves in a very difficult economic situation. Problems in the mortgage market triggered many legal disputes in Spain, where the fairness of contracts was challenged. The Unfair Contract Terms Directive is a powerful tool in the hands of national judges and, in many cases, Spanish judges stepped in and declared contract terms, especially in mortgage contracts, unfair and non-binding on consumers. Related cases referred to the Court of Justice were widely discussed and drew a lot of media attention. The Court ruled that Spanish law as it stood at the time failed to provide certain procedural safeguards to consumers. As a consequence, the Spanish law has been amended on two occasions, giving the consumer an opportunity to object to mortgage enforcement and to appeal if such an objection is dismissed. The amendments also obliged the court to verify contracts on its own motion. Transitional provisions of Law 1/2013 are currently being challenged before the Court of Justice. In parallel, the Commission has conducted a wider assessment of the Spanish legislation and is currently in a structured dialogue with the Spanish authorities. I started this dialogue to ensure that all of the rulings of the Court of Justice are fully implemented in Spain.  Let me underline that I welcome the changes already introduced in Spain, as they improve the protection of consumers. Nevertheless, it still needs to be determined whether the Spanish rules on civil procedure, including on mortgage enforcement proceedings, are fully in conformity with the Unfair Contract Terms Directive. The replies of the Spanish authorities received last June by the Commission are being analysed and further action will be considered if the answers prove to be unsatisfactory.  Finally, as regards the sale of certain financial instruments by banks to retail clients, as stipulated by the Memorandum of Understanding on financial sector policy conditions of July 2012 between the Commission and Spain, Spain has amended its legislation by setting a significantly high minimum amount of investment in complex financial instruments, thereby de facto barring retail clients from buying such products. On question number three: as far as arbitration mechanisms are concerned, in the context of the financial assistance programme for Spain, the Spanish Fund for Orderly Bank Restructuring encourages the banks under its full control to set up arbitration mechanisms to address mis-selling, in particular of preferential shares by these banks to retail clients in 2012.  Based on data provided by the Spanish authorities, it appears that between 2012 and early 2015 these arbitration mechanisms issued around 298 000 rulings in favour of the applicants, thus upholding around 71% of all applications. In conjunction with the fact that the Spanish Deposit Guarantee Fund bought back from retail clients substantial amounts of such preferential shares, which had been sold in a misleading manner, this issue seems to have been remedied in the meantime.  As for your question number four, with regard to new legislation in the area of financial services, let me mention some important pieces of EU law recently adopted by the co-legislators, namely the Mortgage Credit Directive and the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive and Regulation. Creditors are responsible for informing consumers about the risks they undertake when getting involved in investments. They have a duty to be reasonably patient vis-à-vis their debtors before starting execution proceedings. This issue has been addressed in the Mortgage Credit Directive. Member States are required to adopt measures to encourage creditors to exercise reasonable forbearance before foreclosure proceedings are initiated. The European Banking Authority’s guidelines on arrears and foreclosure adopted on 1 June 2015 provide greater detail on how effect should be given to that provision. As to whether further measures should be taken at EU level to enable debt settlement procedures: to date debt settlement procedures are dealt with at national level but some jurisdictions already provide a possibility for borrowers who cannot repay their mortgage loans to be released in full from the underlying debt by handing their mortgaged property over to the lender. This is precisely the case in Spain under certain conditions. The Mortgage Credit Directive does not prevent such a procedure from remaining in place or being introduced at a national level. Finally, with regard to bad information or misinformation on products, borrowers will be better informed about the loans on offer in the future, as the Mortgage Credit Directive enhances the quality and comparability of pre-contractual information. The Mortgage Credit Directive also introduces rules on the conduct expected by businesses with a view to ensuring that the creditor, credit intermediary or appointed representative acts honestly, fairly, transparently and professionally, as well as introducing appropriate knowledge and competence requirements for staff of creditors and credit intermediaries. The new Markets in Financial Instruments Directive applies to investment services. It will improve investor protection for financial instruments by strengthening organisational requirements and the rules on the conduct of businesses for investment firms to minimise the risk of mis-selling of financial instruments. Specifically, it introduces product governance rules and enhances disclosure requirements vis-à-vis investors, for the first time. The deadline for transposition of these measures has not been reached yet. Hence, it would be premature to state at this stage whether and what new further measures would be needed.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 136, "date": "2015-10-05.json", "name": "Rosa ESTARÀS FERRAGUT", "mepid": "96811", "text": "  PPE Group. – Madam President, first of all, the Government of Spain is very concerned about everything that has happened on the subject of preferred products, these complicated products which, in the absence of information, caused many difficulties for many Spanish citizens, and also the issue of evictions, given that the crisis has mainly affected the most vulnerable sectors. I have to say, on the subject of preferred ones, which were basically sold between 2003 and 2011, and when the People's Party Government arrived, it encountered this situation even though many directives, such as the 2008 Markets Directive, and agreements, such as the 2011 Basel Directive, had warned the Socialist Government, which ruled Spain at the time, to take action and take action so that customers could be informed. It wasn't done. The Socialist Government at the time was reckless, lacked seriousness, and it was a popular government which, at the end of 2011 and early 2012, undertakes a whole series of legislative amendments – as the Commissioner has pointed out – so that these products are never mass re-marketed among small investors and, at the same time, initiates arbitration proceedings , in which, the Commissioner said so, more than 71% of those affected have reached an agreement. You work on the subject and it looks like you're on the go. On the issue of evictions, it was also a popular government that first protected vulnerable groups. Think that the executions and evictions carried out in 2014 had their origins in mortgages signed between 2005 and 2008, and it was the people's government that put in place conjunctural measures to protect the most vulnerable sectors – as the Commissioner has said very well – with debt restructuring, with the remove and also with the payment. In fact, it was one of the first governments to have established the payment. And it has also taken structural measures to ensure that it does not happen again in the future. In fact, thousands of families have benefited. Still, we're still working. What I am going to ask my Spanish colleagues is not to turn this very important debate into an electoral debate, because I believe that the victims of evictions and the preferred ones deserve other kinds of debates.

And in Spain, moreover, it has become a social drama. It is true that the Spanish Socialists do not right to respond to this situation in its early days and do not hide it, but we do not accompany ourselves and we will avoid this injustice which, to this day, remains a debt to Spanish society. This is also supported by the fact that Spanish society has contributed to the recapitalisation of banking with 107 billion euros, which clashes with more than four hundred thousand evictions since the crisis began, or with the seven hundred thousand small users or savers who saw their savings trapped, of which they have recovered one in three euros, because the removes represent between 30 and 70%, and even today more than three hundred thousand small savers remain trapped. To this end, it is true that the Government of Spain has introduced twelve legislative amendments, but all of them partial and with a clear will that something seems to change so that absolutely nothing changes: voluntary code of good practice for banks and requirements that do not meet a small part of those affected. This is demonstrated by facts such as no payment damages, that only 0.4% of social rent has been granted and that there are now 3.5 billion euros trapped in abusive mortgages.  We say this and so does the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union, which states that, of Directive 93/13/EEC, Articles 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 are breached in Spain. In addition, the Advocate General himself of the Court of Justice of the European Union, in his May 2015 report, says very clearly that the amendments made by the Government of Spain are clearly insufficient. Therefore, I ask that we do not put any more patches, that we do not make the Spanish people suffer any more. What we want is a general response. I ask the Commission to make a serious and rigorous analysis to adapt our legislation to that of the European Union and to eliminate the thousands of unfair terms that we have today, and to give a solution to the small savers who continue to have their savings trapped.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 140, "date": "2015-10-05.json", "name": "Notis MARIAS", "mepid": "125069", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Group. – Mr President, mortgage legislation differs between the Member States of the European Union, with the result that there is a differentiation in the conditions for consumer protection and debt settlement.

Since the financial crisis, the situation in Spain has deteriorated, resulting in at least 700,000 citizens being victims of high-risk loans, while more than 350,000 exports have been recorded in the last six years. At the same time, the houses that came under the hammer came back into the ownership of the banks, which have been rescued from the money of the citizens of the European Union themselves, In Greece, red home loans reached 21 billion euros. There, the banks began selling the red loans to the well-known crows of the world market to aggressive hedge funds that are preparing to hammer, instead of lentil plates, the homes of the Greek people. In fact, with The 3rd, express procedures are also in place for auctions. More than 500,000 Greek borrowers are now at risk of losing their homes. Also, 70,000 Greeks who have taken out mortgages in Swiss francs are also at risk of losing their own homes.

I believe that today we can - and we can all congratulate ourselves on this - that an oral question with a resolution has come here, to the House, and we are discussing it. It is great news, because it is not often that the Committee on Petitions, which is the open window of European citizens to this Parliament, is present in this way, and I believe that, since 2012 - since the Marrakesh Treaty – we did not have such an occasion. We are here because we have a purely European issue to talk about. We are talking about hundreds of thousands affected by abusive mortgage clauses and preferred ones. We don't know how many they are, it can be 300,000, it can be a million, two million... The point is that in the Committee on Petitions we received tens — almost a hundred requests — from European citizens who were affected by their rights as consumers in Spain.  That is why this is a purely European case because we are talking about European citizens living in Spain who, from the Committee on Petitions, are responsible for protecting, and whose requests we have to review and keep open, and above all it is up to us to build consensus, which is what I think we are looking for here.  Spanish consumers are in a situation of unprotection and helplessness in this area. This was stated by the Court of Justice of the European Union in its judgment, which justifies the intervention of the European authorities. In addition, we are talking about a purely European issue because it is a bad transposition of European directives. In fact, these requests denounced this poor transposition and non-compliance with a number of directives: both from the mortgage lending directive and from the directive on financial instruments , which governs the provision of investment services, including preferred ones, from the unfair terms in consumer contracts and, of course, from the market for financial instruments.  It seems to me that, although there are still many shortcomings in the effective and correct transposition of this directive in Spain, what we are here for is to prevent it from happening in the rest of Europe. Here's what's important. It doesn't matter where rights are violated. It does not matter in which country of the Union, in which Member State, it is up to us to monitor, denounce and ensure that we have the tools to guarantee European citizens that their rights are adequately protected.

And I don't say it, they said it, and also in writing. But they're right about that. The left is making absolutely reprehensible use of what is the pain of citizens. The problem of preferred ones is an issue of concern and occupying the Government of the People's Party. It is a matter that should have been tackled earlier, but the previous government ignored it. On the contrary, legislative action has now been taken and arbitration procedures have been put in place which are assisting those affected, as the Commission itself acknowledges. But many of you don't care about this. They are more interested in who publishes the first press release, who makes the most noise and how to monetize it. Nor are they interested in seeing how from the Spanish Government we are working hard to solve the problem of those who have difficulty paying their mortgage dues – thousands of families in Spain – a painful situation, undoubtedly dating back to years prior to 2008, with this Government facing the problem with decision and courage.

Tens of thousands of families have lost housing and work in these years. Tens of thousands of endorsers, usually retired people who supported their children in the disaster, have followed the same path without even the so-called second-chance law solving a problem that creates situations of real social and humanitarian emergency. That is why, Commissioner, Brussels must oblige the Spanish authorities to make codes of good banking practice mandatory. Creditors and debtors must be encouraged to have equal weapons in insolvency resolution processes and modules relating to these problems must be incorporated into the field of education.

There are two general principles which form the basis of the matter which need to be highlighted because they go beyond the specific case to which our request refers. The European institutions, especially when it come to human rights, must ensure that the rules that must apply to everyone and everywhere are respected and that strict controls are carried out that are capable of punishing those who do not comply with them. The Hacking Team case cannot go without consequences, but we must not be content to punish companies guilty of unlawful espionage and violations of minimum freedoms. The real problem is not Hacking Team or the next company that will give the way to talk about the issue again, the problem lies in a weak regulation not concerted with other countries and that is too easily circumvented.  We are not credible if we claim to protect cybersecurity and human rights in distant countries, while at the same time allowing our companies to market with these same states some of the products that are banned precisely because they violate these same human rights. The sale of surveillance technologies is too little regulated and action at Community level is urgently needed, although it can only be a first step towards an overall global modernization based on the Wassenaar Agreement.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to remind you that Hacking Team is a company in Milan, Italy, which deals with cyber espionage and has developed a new generation of viruses capable of spying on and controlling PCs and smartphones, designed to target criminals and terrorists but, if in the wrong hands, also activists, human rights defenders and journalists. In Italy the software was used by law enforcement, but the real business the company did by selling them to Sudan, emirates, Colombia, Morocco, Kazakhstan, Lebanon, Egypt, Russia, Mexico and others, violating the law, but above all human rights. And we know all this because, ironically, the Hacking Team was hacked. Its state-of-the-way spying software was stolen from a cyberattack, with all the risks that come with it. I have just heard what Mr Moscow said and I wanted to add one detail: to sell this software to regimes and dictators we needed the authorisation of the Ministry, an authorization obtained thanks to pressure from the Italian Prime Minister, that is, Matteo Renzi, and it is not I who says this, but the chairman of Hacking Team himself in an email intercepted and published on WikiLeaks. Congratulations, My colleague, I very much appreciated your fine words of condemnation, but now I would like you to say these words to the journalists arrested by the regimes with which you have done business. Then I would like to understand why, you who are in government in Italy, have not blocked the authorizations for the sale of these software? Talk about human rights, but do business with dictators. You are the perfect expression of your party's coherence. These surveillance tools are part of dual use, dual use, because they are not technically weapons of war, but they can become in the wrong hands. A compromised computer is more useful than a spy satellite; for this reason an authorization is needed to export these software, especially to un democratic countries, authorizations that the Hacking Team has deliberately ignored or obtained too easily from the Italian ministry.

It is indeed a key concern that the export of cyber-surveillance technologies could be misused for supporting oppressive regimes or the violation of human rights. Firstly, in late 2011 and early 2012 respectively, the EU arms embargoes on Iran and Syria were both updated to include prohibitions on the export of interception technologies for internet and telephone communications. Secondly, the EU and its Member States promoted, in a timely way, multilateral controls on certain surveillance technologies, notably in the relevant multilateral forum known as the Wassenaar Arrangement. In December 2013 an agreement was reached to control internet surveillance equipment and intrusion software. The Commission followed up quickly to implement this international agreement and adopted a Commission delegated regulation in October 2014 ensuring that the export of those technologies is controlled. Those technologies fall into the category of dual-use items. These are wide-ranging categories of goods, software and technologies normally used for civilian purposes, but which may have military applications or may contribute to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, such as nuclear materials, electronics or navigation systems. The current EU export control system for dual-use items allocates the responsibility for assessing export transactions involving these products to national competent authorities. However, the Commission monitors and supports the consistent implementation of the controls by Member State authorities. To that effect it set up in September 2014 a surveillance technology expert group with Member State experts, which has been meeting on a regular basis since its establishment. In addition to that immediate reaction, the Commission recognised in 2014, in its communication on the export control policy review, that although the EU export control system is robust and effective, it cannot remain static and must be upgraded in order to face new challenges associated with new technologies of concern. This communication identified options for an ambitious modernisation of the system. This includes options to address human security issues as the ones we are discussing here today. The Commission is now conducting a public consultation and will finalise the impact assessment on those review options with a view to presenting, as appropriate, proposals to upgrade the EU legal framework in early 2016. As regards the incriminated exports’ compliance with the regulations in place at the time, the Commission has obtained assurances from the Italian authorities that the exports from Hacking Team did not violate applicable sanctions and export control regulations. It should be noted in this respect that controls on intrusion software became effective in the EU only on 1 January 2015.  The Commission has taken note of concerns regarding possible unintended effects of controls on security testing tools which could possibly hinder research and has initiated dialogue with Member States, industry and NGOs to further assess the need to adjust some of the recent controls. The Commission notes that the introduction of controls in the area, which to date has not been subject to export controls, will require efforts to raise operators’ awareness.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 172, "date": "2015-10-05.json", "name": "Inma RODRÍGUEZ-PIÑERO", "mepid": "125043", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group – Mr President, on 24 November 2014 I spoke in this House to request a revision of our legislation on exports of dual-use products.

Even worse, because last July the case of the European company Hacking Team, specialized in the commercialization of devices, technologies and surveillance software, was uncovered. Technologies that are being used to commit privacy violations in third countries and are used by some governments as tools to suppress and violate the human rights of journalists, political opponents, bloggers and human rights defenders. According to the leaked internal documents, this European company sold its surveillance and espionage products to governments and intelligence services in countries whose human rights practices have been repeatedly condemned by the Union. We cannot allow any European technology to be involved in human rights abuses in third countries. There is a growing commercialization of these technologies, but the truth is that the regulation to which this market is subjected is frankly scarce. That's why we demand more transparency and accountability regarding the sale of these dual-use devices that invade people's privacy and privacy. Internal due diligence policies and self-regulation efforts have shown that they have been absolutely inadequate. We continue to expect legislation that improves and tightens controls on these exports. Modern and effective legislation, capable of adapting to rapid technological and scientific changes.

By that I mean not only conventional arms exports, but also the risks of dual-use products, which are not always regulated today. I am also talking about the risks associated with exporting all this material to non-democratic states. Many times it is material that can lead to greater security, but which, if they fall into the wrong hands, can threaten both our security and human rights to the same extent as conventional weapons. It is particularly risky to export information technology and monitoring equipment to regimes that violate human rights. This has been demonstrated, among other things, by the Arab Spring, such as Nokia and Siemens, which helped the Iranian regime to persecute democracy activists. Swedish Ericsson chose to provide the Syrian regime with telecommunications equipment when the confrontations began, which meant that opposition figures could be easily tracked by the regime. German and British technology was used against demonstrators by the regimes of Bahrain, Egypt and Tunisia. Democratic organisations with official EU support have been spied on, they have been infiltrated, members have been tortured, killed or imprisoned. That is why it is very important that we take up the export of sensitive information and communication technology to these countries.

Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are approaching the first anniversary of this Commission and, in this first year of the year, we have heard the priorities that you have set out: support for SMEs, strengthening competitiveness, employment. We know and support the Commission's commitment to these priorities.  So, Commissioner, imagine that you have in your power the capacity to develop the competitiveness of several thousand companies, most of them SMEs, and that you can ease the financial burden on them and that they are forced to engage in fighting unfair competition - charges that sometimes account for up to 40% of their turnover. Imagine that you have in your power the opportunity to support the maintenance and development of employment in more than eight hundred production basins, by increasing job creation by 30%, as has been the case with food geographic indications. Imagine that you have a simple, very inexpensive way to offer visibility, export attractiveness to these companies, up to 25% of international demand.  That would be great, wouldn't it? You would definitely take a second of such a tool if it was available to you. Well I have good news: this tool exists and it is already in your hands. By immediately proposing a legislative instrument to recognise and support European artisanal production, you have at your fingertips a simple way to achieve the objectives I have just set out.  This is the striking conclusion of the in-depth work done by your services over the past several years. A very thorough study that you published in 2013 underpins the economic benefits I just mentioned. It is also the urgent demand of European SMEs and European consumers who have expressed themselves clearly in the responses to the consultation you carried out in 2014.  Finally, this is the message that I hope this Parliament will send to you tomorrow, asking you to include in the internal market strategy, which the Commission will make public in the coming weeks, the announcement of a legislative initiative for the extension of geographical indications to non-agricultural products from 2016.  Commissioner, for the time being, producers who wish to protect a non-agricultural geographical indication within the European Union must apply for it in every state, where possible, that is to say in barely half of them, or simply renounce such protection.  They risk, every day, the usurpation of their name by industrialists who jeopardize employment, economic vitality, the balance of territories that are sometimes fragile, simply because these industrialists use unduly a name that was until now a symbol of quality, history and know-how. Such unfair competition is not acceptable.  Extending geographical indications to non-agricultural products would be a strong political signal, a strong commitment by the European Union to make its local production shine. Because, more than products, these famous names - Murano, Bohème, Savile Row, Laguiole, Solingen - are the echo of a history, a culture. They represent European heritage, our heritage, which is why I invite all my colleagues to confirm tomorrow the broad vote in favour of the Committee on Legal Affairs on the report I am presenting here this evening.  Commissioner, the European Parliament is waiting for the European Commission on this subject but, through MEPs, much more importantly, it is the European consumers who are waiting for you, the European SMEs that rely on you, the European citizens who are watching you.  Show them that you are responding to their concerns, that you are providing them with solutions.

By getting geographical indication it has increased its marketing opportunities and become far more widely known. Now everybody who goes to Waterford wants, number one, to have a Waterford blaa. The same could apply to non-agricultural products. To take Waterford again as an example, there is the world-famous Waterford crystal. Its trophies are used in some of the big sports competitions in the world. It went through hard times recently, but I think that if it got geographical indication that would be a huge boost to it.

The Commission had decided to put this idea to the test through a Green Paper and a public consultation in summer 2014. The results of the consultation, published in June of this year, were supportive of such a system. Let me remind you what the situation is about. A geographical indication identifies goods as originating from a country, region or locality where a particular quality, reputation or other characteristic of the product is linked to its geographical origin: for example, Bordeaux wine, Murano glass or Irish whiskey. Agriculture products such as cheeses, wines, meats, fruits and vegetables from a specific geographical origin, possessing certain qualities or made according to traditional methods, may be afforded EU-wide geographical indication protection. However, non-agricultural products, such as ceramics, marble, cutlery, shoes, tapestries and musical instruments, do not, to date, enjoy unitary geographical indication protection at EU level beyond national laws. That is, for instance, the case of Carrara marble from Italy, Solingen knives from Germany, Koniaków lace from Poland or Haapsalu mud from Estonia.  Moving towards a system of non-agricultural geographical indications would be a major step, the costs and benefits of which would need to be assessed very carefully. What we do know is that direct and indirect employment in the sectors producing geographically-rooted non-agricultural products has been estimated at around four million jobs. On the positive side, I can see four benefits. First, safeguarding jobs and wealth in economically fragile areas: two-thirds of the regions from which non-agricultural geographical indication products originate have a poverty rate or an unemployment rate above 20%. Second, encouraging tourism: geographical indication products have always been innovating using traditional knowhow or cultural heritage. The underlying image of quality can have a significant impact on the attractiveness of regions at local and international level. Third, increasing the distinctiveness and attraction of the relevant products would help increase sales volumes and thus the competitiveness of European businesses – mostly small and medium enterprises – as was the case for agricultural products. Fourth, helping consumers make more informed choices while preventing fraudulent use of geographical indications. Beyond these issues and as your report also points out, there would be positive effects on trade relations with third countries too. Indeed, an EU-wide protection system could positively impact our bilateral negotiations with emerging and developing countries interested in securing better protection for their geographical indication products in the EU. At multilateral level in the World Trade Organisation, the EU’s negotiating efforts to improve the level of protection for geographical indications would also benefit from an extension of the protection to non-agricultural products.  However, there are also drawbacks. Such a system would imply quite far-reaching regulatory intervention, the proportionality of which will need to be assessed very carefully.  Your report brings an important input to the ongoing reflection on an EU-wide protection system for non-agricultural geographical indications. The Commission will consider your recommendations with attention and will continue to reflect, with all interested parties, on a possible way forward.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 227, "date": "2015-10-05.json", "name": "Ioan Mircea PAŞCU", "mepid": "33984", "text": "   The debate has been closed.
