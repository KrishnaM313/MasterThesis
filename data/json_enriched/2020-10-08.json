It considers that the draft Commission Regulation is in line with the implementing powers conferred on the Commission by Regulation (EC) No 1333/2008. The Standing Committee has given a favourable opinion on the draft act and the Council has already decided not to oppose it. The Commission regrets that the European Parliament has rejected this measure, which is based on the scientific assessment of the European Food Safety Authority. If adopted, the measure would have resulted in an improved level of safety regarding the use of this food additive and better control of the products present on the market, thus allowing a better enforcement by Member States of the legislation. Such decisions by the European Parliament undermine the EU’s well-established science-based approach to food safety.  – Madam President, Honourable Members, the Commission takes note of this resolution objecting to maximum levels of acrylamide, adopted by the European Parliament. It considers that the draft Commission Regulation is in line with the implementing powers conferred on the Commission by Regulation (EEC) No 315/93 aiming to protect public health. The Standing Committee has given a favourable opinion by unanimity on the draft act and the Council has not opposed it. The Commission regrets that the European Parliament has rejected this measure, which protects health and is based on the scientific assessment of the European Food Safety Authority. The levels of acrylamide raise concerns with respect to its carcinogenic effects, including for infants and young children. If adopted, the EU would have become the first region in the world to set legally-binding maximum levels of acrylamide and would have resulted in an improved level of food safety for infants and young children. There are every day foods on the market containing acrylamide above the proposed maximum levels, but in the absence of this Regulation, there will be no basis to remove them from the market. Consequently, children and infants will continue being exposed to levels of acrylamide, which are scientifically considered not safe. The Commission wants to emphasise that additional data are being collected and further consultations are being held with a view to extending the measure to other food categories. As such, this objection to this first step might undermine and delay the ongoing work on setting maximum levels for acrylamide in other relevant food categories. The Commission calls on the European Parliament to follow the European Union’s well-established science-based approach to food safety. Thank you President, thank you Honourable Members. President, Honourable Members. The Commission disagrees with the omission of Article 2(1) TFEU as legal basis of the decision empowering France to negotiate with the United Kingdom. While Article 91 TFEU empowers the Union to adopt acts of transport policy, the legislator is warranted powers to authorise Member States to act in the Union’s stead in an area of exclusive Union competence only under Article 2(1) TFEU. The decision can therefore be adopted only on the basis of both provisions.

Dirty money is highly mobile. Time and again, we see criminals move it around the world with relative ease. Each new money-laundering revelation sparks more public anger. It erodes trust in our banks and financial institutions, in our authorities and our governments.  The FinCEN case we are discussing today confirms the Commission’s own reports and risk assessments from July 2019 that money laundering is a global challenge that demands a global response. If we are to succeed in fighting global cross-border crime, then we must all pull together and work with global partners, such as the United States, on closing loopholes. EU countries must also join forces to make the system less open to abuse. Member States acting alone are simply not up to the task of addressing a global challenge of such magnitude. The FinCEN files illustrate the vast scale of the problem. The European Union has to act decisively and collectively, with the European approach to supervision, a European approach to financial intelligence coordination. Dirty money should have nowhere to hide. Before the summer break on 8 July, the Commission outlined in this House the action plan for a comprehensive Union policy on preventing money laundering and terrorist financing, which the Commission adopted on 7 May 2020. It is now critical that we deliver on our action plan.  The FinCEN files are yet another illustration of why it is essential that financial institutions and other private sector entities detect suspicious financial flows and report their suspicions to the relevant authorities. They also highlight how important it is that national financial intelligence units have adequate tools and the capacity to process and analyse this information. These are all issues addressed in our action plan with a number of concrete actions proposed.  The Commission is also looking much more closely at how Member States implement the anti-money laundering directives so that our rules are effective on the ground. Enforcement is not only about ensuring the complete or correct transposition of the 4th and 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directives: enforcement is also about ensuring that anti-money laundering directives are effectively implemented.  The Commission recently sent questionnaires to some Member States. We will actively follow up on our findings. We will investigate ongoing problems and we will not hesitate to take legal steps if needed. There must be no divergences nor systematic weaknesses that could attract criminals. The European Union Supervisory System is only as strong as its weakest link.  We know that national supervisors cannot do this alone, which is why our action plan proposed EU-level supervision. For European Union supervision to work efficiently and seamlessly, we need an integrated system where national supervisors and the European Union Supervisor work effectively together, including by carrying out joint examinations here, and European Union anti-money laundering authorities would need to be equipped with significant and direct supervisory powers regarding the most risky obliged entities.  While the financial sector should be our initial priority, the European Union would need to progressively and significantly increase supervision of the non-financial sector. The anti-money laundering authority should also check that all national supervisors have adequate resources and powers to carry out their task. This could include on-site checks and would be the best way to monitor and make sure that the rules are applied effectively and consistently across the European Union.  The FinCEN case made it also clear that the increased number of reports submitted to the financial intelligence units puts pressure on their resources. We intend to put a coordination and support mechanism in place to support financial intelligence units in the European Union as a first step. This is vital for improving the detection of suspicious cash flows, especially those with a cross-border dimension, and for developing better analytical tools. Concretely we plan to support financial intelligence units in carrying out joint analyses, developing standards for reporting suspicious transactions, and providing IT assistance and support for exchanging financial information. The momentum to act decisively is with us. Everyone – authorities, stakeholders and citizens alike – expects the Union to act and ensure the stability and integrity of the Union’s financial system. We are grateful to this Parliament for setting the tone with its resolution last July. The time to act is now. We must close the door on dirty money decisively.

The FinCEN files show something that we discussed with Mr Dombrovskis only a few months ago in this round – Mrs Euica, you have pointed this out. And what has changed since then? Nothing. I very much regret – and I say this right at the beginning of this debate – that the Council is once again not represented. After all, where do we have the core problems? In the Member States. In those Member States that are unable to transpose what they decide here at European level into applicable law at home. I am very grateful to the Commission, which is now also taking infringement proceedings against Member States. The deadline for implementing the 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive was 1 January 2020, in the good old days before Corona. So you could have done it all. So far, only 17 Member States have reported full transposition. I hope that the Commission will also examine whether the report is true. The rest has only partially implemented, that is nine, and one did not even consider it necessary to report what he has done, namely Cyprus. These are the problems we are facing here in Europe. Problem number two – and this is not news either, but we have debated this many times: financial supervisory authorities are not in a position to deal adequately with criminals. The suspension of the money laundering unit in the European Banking Authority was an emergency solution, is an emergency solution and must be replaced by a permanent solution with an authority that also has legal intervention.  Money laundering must not only be an administrative offence at European level, but must be a criminal offence. To achieve this, we must create the legal conditions. The European way must be that money laundering in Europe has no chance.

Suspicious activity reports which were recently leaked concern transactions worth USD 2 000 billion. Banks must fill in one of these reports if they are worried one of their clients might be up to no good. The report is sent to the authorities. Despite these alarms, banks still often execute these transactions. Again, it is thanks to the great work of investigation journalists that this scandal is revealed.  It demonstrates once again that the existing Anti—Money Laundering (AML) system simply does not work. It is a Swiss cheese, full of holes.  For a long time, my group has been calling for a uniform regulatory framework, an AML regulation. Regulatory clarity and certainty is needed for the public sector and for industry. We also need stricter rules around rules on consumer due diligence and beneficial ownership transparency.  Stronger EU supervision is urgently needed too. Whether we need a new EU agency or extending the powers of the European Banking Authority is in a way less important, as long as the job is done far much better than today. Therefore, the supervisor should get enough resources, staff and independence and, of course, more EU supervision will only work provided there is good cooperation with the national competent authorities, as they are on the ground. Supervising can only be done properly provided data around suspicious transactions flow easily cross—border. Therefore, we need a European Union Finance Intelligence Unit. Detecting and supervising suspicious cases is one thing, tackling and sanctioning is something else.  I realise this is a very sensitive field of crime enforcement, and Member States like to keep control. Nonetheless, if we want to be serious in tackling AML, we need more deterring sanctions. Imposing big fines is all well and good, but I have not the impression that it changes fundamentally a culture.

The leaks revealed suspicious transactions at Deutsche Bank. Russian criminals and money launderers working for terrorist groups allegedly laundered money through the Moscow branch. The name of Vladimir Putin’s cousin, Igor Putin, is also linked to such a transaction.  Another leak revealed a transaction of USD 31 million between two offshore companies. The first one, with an account at Piraeus Bank, is owned by a person involved in arms trafficking for the Islamic State, and the other, with an account in the state-controlled Bulgarian Development Bank, is owned by a notorious Bulgarian arms dealer.  All of this is happening under the eyes of the financial intelligence units, of the European banking authorities, of the European Central Bank (ECB), of the law—enforcement national authorities. Can I ask how is it possible that we see such impressive amounts of money transferred to safe places through the banking system? Basically, there is zero time to waste, and if we want to efficiently fight money laundering, we need full judicial cooperation in criminal matters; we need an anti-money laundering (AML) regulation, which we have been talking about for a long time; we need full transparency on beneficial ownership, which we have been talking about for a long time; cooperation with national authorities as well, but a truly functioning supervisory body.

We urgently need an authority like the American FinCEN in Europe. Well, they may not have paid proper attention to their data now, but that has certainly had a positive effect on the global debate on money laundering and on our debate here in Europe. The American FinCEN is an analysis agency that investigates money laundering throughout america and worldwide. The reason why some of the dirtiest banks in Europe – ABLV in Latvia – or even the situation in Cyprus have come under pressure is not because the European Commission or European and national authorities have mixed up the situation there, but because FinCEN has repeatedly put its finger on the wound with rigid investigations and has also threatened America with sanctions, as in the case of Latvia and Cyprus. During all this, the Commission has largely stood idly by. The American FinCEN analyses the suspicionreports for the whole of America. There are not 51 states, FIU, and 51 money laundering supervisors, but there is a common actor. We visited it together, with a cross-party delegation. We expect such an authority, Commissioner, in your proposal. An authority that can actually intervene, an authority that analyses together. Unfortunately, that is not what your action plan says. There is a common supervision of money laundering, but there is no common FIUs, but you only want to help the national authorities to cooperate better. However, for the large cross-border cases, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, we need a common financial intelligence unit so that, like America, we can really investigate large-scale money laundering cases.

Get down to earth: out there are millions of jobless Europeans, there are thousands of honest entrepreneurs and families suffering, and it is absolutely obscene that, instead of fighting open field against money laundering operations, drug trafficking and terrorism, we are allocating thousands of funds and demanding that taxes be raised and new European taxes created to finance the climate festival of large globalist multinationals.

Tax evasion, tax evasion, money laundering, it is a story that we know by heart, so it repeats itself, always with the same protagonists. This is the story of the Panama Papers, the Paradise Papers, the Swiss Leaks, the list is endless. What has been revealed by the tremendous work of investigative journalists is therefore not a mere drift. It is a perfectly oiled system, the culprits of which are precisely identified. The major international banks first, including HSBC, Deutsche Bank, Société Générale which organize questionable financial transfers with impunity. The tax havens then always the same, the Cayman Islands, Cyprus, Hong Kong, the Virgin Islands which welcome dirty money in complete opacity. And to deal with it, the european Union's finance ministers have found nothing better this week than to remove the Cayman Islands from the blacklist of tax havens. It is true that it is not as if the Cayman Islands have not been mentioned in all the financial scandals of recent years. And without any notorious tax havens, especially European ones like Ireland or Luxembourg, your pseudo-blacklist is above all a carte blanche to financial scheming. So how long will it take to endure the crocodile tears of the leaders who cry foul without ever giving themselves the means to put an end to it.

But let’s face it, this story has been told a thousand times. We in this room know it; ordinary people are still confused by the tools that are used. They don’t usually have trusts in Jersey, a Swiss bank account or a shell company in the Netherlands, and they don’t get it. But we must realise – certainly the people that are aware – that this is used mainly by the rich: terrorists, criminals, the rich. They own the hidden wealth in the world, at least half of the hidden wealth according to calculations by economists, and it’s not even the one percent that owns the hidden wealth in offshore jurisdictions. It’s the one percent of the one percent that owns half of the hidden wealth in the world. It is very clear from the FinCEN files that action needs to be taken and not enough action has been taken so far. Because now bankers blindly forward transactions to their financial investigations unit (FIU), only to find out later that they have facilitated fraudulent transactions. And these FIUs on the other hand are flooded with information but lack the means and resources to keep up.  If transactions are investigated and found to breach law, the money has long been gone. Take former President Yanukovych, who was able to transport billions out of Ukraine, or take former president’s daughter Isabel Dos Santos, by now the richest woman in Africa. She is also spending her days in luxury, not in Angola but in Russia and other places.  So what we need is to staff and strengthen FIUs, and of course, FIUs need to exchange information on close cooperation, but in addition we need to make banks act upon their role as gate-keepers. Forwarding alone is not enough. Banks need to know their customers and when they find suspicious activities, press pause.  The point is, of course, that making private actors fulfil public roles is hard. It cannot be done without clear rules, strict oversight and very tough penalties.

Your revelations have fuelled the work of this Parliament for years so that the mafia, the oligarchs, the despots, the terrorists, the drug lords, but also the crooked politicians stop plundering collective resources with the complicity of unscrupulous banks, such as the Deutsche Bank or ING which are pointed in the FinCEN files.

It is no different if we consider transactions in euros or other currencies in the EU. This highlights the need for better global cooperation.  The FinCEN case also demonstrates that reporting works, because reports are filed in the first place. However, what happens after these are reported is what truly matters. Do the authorities adequately check and if necessary investigate activities? In the EU, Europol reported, for instance, that there were one million STRs in 2014. Of these only ten percent were further investigated and only one percent of the money reported as suspicious was recovered. This was not a one—off. This is indeed a trend, repeating itself since the early 2000s. So clearly we are missing a link. We need better supervision and information sharing, not just between national, European and international authorities, but also between banks and, importantly, within banking groups. I believe that one of these missing links could be a more generalised use of regulatory and supervisory technologies based, for instance, on AI for processing transactions. This could significantly improve compliance with regulations, identify suspicious activities faster and more efficiently, and also signal them to the relevant authorities. So, yes, let’s strengthen our regulatory framework, but let’s also beef up the authorities so that they are able to have an efficient fight against money laundering in Europe.

In fact, banks do not even have to stop the transfers they themselves consider suspicious.

I think that the key to the answer is that Europe needs to be more confident in this fight. We have shown that we can be regulatory leaders. We have put the GDPR standard, and some people would have been afraid that, with this standard, Facebook or some others would not operate in Europe. The fact of the matter is that, whatever the threats, they cannot afford not to operate in Europe.  This is similar. If we say to world companies, to companies based abroad, you can’t operate here unless we know who is your owner, if we rule out beneficial ownership, it is not going to be the case that people are going to renounce a 400 million market. They are going to want to be here, they are going to want to serve European citizens. So if we are confident and we set out the regulatory standards for transparency, for disclosure, for this beneficial ownership, it is going to be the case that companies will have to comply.  What are the main things we need to change in the way this fight is going? I think we need three things. We need transparency, as I was saying, particularly no opaque companies – we need to know who is behind every account. We need a European financial intelligence unit – we need to know what is going on, and that requires police work. And we need a single supervisory authority that is able to centralise and doesn’t succumb to the economic nationalism that we are always seeing, with each authority protecting their own banks and their own transactions, and each authority happy to receive money from abroad.  So this is the moment to show that Europe is confident. I have heard all my colleagues speak and I have taken close note. I think that we all see things in a very similar way.

We certainly need a uniform system, we certainly need a European anti-money laundering agency, as the Commission also pointed out since the last parliamentary term, but above all, if money laundering is the essence of organised crime, we need a unified European strategy aimed at the disarticulation of transnational criminal organisations and their external accomplices, through full investigative and judicial cooperation.

We see revelations about the criminal activities of internationally operating banks that are involved in money laundering – with the mafia, with terrorist operatives, with drug bosses – and in the midst of this process are Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank. Criminals take advantage of the fact that state oversight – which was actually created per se to avert such scandals – does not work. Banks do not seem to have a problem with their behaviour even after the financial crisis, and policies are becoming meaningless because of the many loopholes. That is why we need a clear 'yes' from the EU Member States to a central European authority against money laundering – a clear 'yes' that must happen now and not last for many years.

What I heard today confirms the Commission’s resolve to act swiftly and address the shortcomings of the Union’s anti-money laundering legal framework. There were some questions which I would like to answer, especially from Mr Giegold and Mr Urtasun. You were asking about cases where we have sent formal letters to Member States, and these are publically known. The Commission has opened infringement procedures against Member States that failed to notify transposition of the 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive against Cyprus, Hungary, Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia and Spain.  In parallel, we are continuing to check those Member States that have fully and correctly transposed the 4th Anti-Money Laundering Directive. I cannot disclose here to which Member States we have sent informal letters. However, rest assured, that over the course of the next years, we will address all Member States. Let me stress again, the enforcement and effective implementation of the existing rules remain a top priority for the Commission. We are also stepping up practical work to help national authorities detect money laundering. For example, the interconnection of beneficial ownership – ownership registers – should be operational in 2021. A similar interconnection between bank account registers is also part of our action plan, as it will speed up cross—border access to bank account information. However, criminals are highly adaptive and their methods are constantly evolving. The FinCEN revelations clearly illustrate the ongoing challenges that the main actors face in their efforts to detect illegal financial flows and prevent criminals from using the financial system to launder dirty money. Our framework must therefore continuously evolve in order to keep pace with technological developments and the growing sophistication of financial crime.  We are up to the challenge. In the first quarter of 2021, we will propose an ambitious anti-money laundering package in order to further strengthen the capacity to fight money laundering and protect the integrity of the financial system. In a single market, we can no longer afford to work in silos. We need to build bridges between anti-money laundering supervisors and financial intelligence units. For this, we need not only a stronger regulatory framework but also strong European Union level structures to ensure its implementation. I wanted to be fair to those who mentioned the Cayman Islands. I wanted to clarify. There are two lists: one list is anti-money laundering and the other is fiscal cooperation tax. So some Members were mixing this up, but okay. Some Members were speaking about tax non-cooperative jurisdiction, but of course we have to deal with this too. Thank you for this debate. The Commission and my colleague Valdis Dombrovskis, who was not able to attend this meeting today, we look forward to continuing to work with you on these crucial issues in order to further strengthen the integrity of the financial system and to ensure that dirty money finds no place to hide in the European Union.

Talking about long—term care facilities means talking about both those giving and receiving care in a particularly vulnerable situation. Due to protective measures, persons in care could no longer receive family and visitors. Long—term care facilities could not immediately provide the type of care required in such exceptional circumstances.  At particular moments in life we also rely on the commitment and dedication of others. Never has this been more visible than during the current pandemic, when carers held the hands of their residents. The staff in long—term care facilities did their best to provide not just comfort and dignity at the end of a precious life, but also a sense of tenderness and care.  People working in long—term care facilities deserve more than our applause and gratitude. We can pay tribute to them, but we must also take action. We need to deliver for residents and carers in our policymaking.  COVID—19 brings unprecedented challenges health—wise, economically and socially. Some people are more at risk than others, especially the elderly, and people with a disability. When it comes to social services, there are users and service providers; we cannot help one if we do not help the other. We have seen how care workers and those receiving care are particularly exposed to the virus and its devastating consequences. This is of great concern to us. We need to improve the protection of the most vulnerable in our societies. Too many lives have already been lost. We know that social services have been under particular strain and the Commission is committed to help. Together with Commissioners Nicolas Schmit, who is responsible for jobs and social rights, and Stella Kyriakides, in charge of health, and Helena Dalli, responsible for equality, we have held discussions with organisations focusing on services to the elderly, people with disabilities, and others who are in need of long—term care. We are listening to the sector and are assessing different instruments and possible solutions to support both providers and users of these services.  Not all of today’s problems are new. The capacity of long—term care facilities to deal with any crisis was laid bare by COVID—19. Clearly, there are structural deficiencies – the lack of staff, difficult working conditions, low salaries and access to services.  Ongoing issues with affordability and the quality of long—term care services also come to mind, as well as the availability of such services in rural and remote regions. This explains why we are assessing whether our social protection systems are fit to deal with the needs of an aging population. Families of women provide a large part of informal long—term care. Informal carers deserve better support such as social protection, income replacement, training, counselling and day care.  The gender care gap must be addressed, including the equal sharing of informal care responsibilities. We can do this through the implementation of the Directive on Work-life Balance, which should be transposed by 2022. Long—term care systems need revamping to better prepare them for rising long—term care needs and future health crisis. Funding issues must be addressed at Member State level because this is where the competence lies. However, I cannot stand here as a Member of the Commission and say that our hands are tied. We have been very active. I will share some examples with you.  The React—EU programme will continue and extend to the crisis response and repair measures by reinforcing capacities in health and long—term care. In addition, the Commission is working with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control to protect vulnerable groups including older people in residential homes, but also in places like migrant centres and prisons.  The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control has published guidance on infection prevention, control and preparedness for COVID—19 in healthcare settings as well as guidance regarding surveillance of COVID—19 in long—term care facilities.  This guidance is a much needed tool for use right across the European Union. The joint report of the Commission and the Social Protection Committee on the preparedness of long—term care systems in the European Union will provide evidence and clear mapping of the challenges that need to be tackled. The Commission is committed to implementing the European pillar of social rights, including principles of access to quality health and long—term care. Preparations are ongoing for the upcoming action plan for the implementation of the European pillar of social rights to be adopted in 2021 under the guidance of my colleague Commissioner Schmit. The elderly must fully enjoy these rights, too. It is beyond doubt that COVID—19 has hit the elderly hardest. At the same time, our work in tackling demographic change shows that our Union is aging. Given the current and future context, we need to discuss this and factor it into all aspects of our policy action.  Let me be clear, dear Members of Parliament: aging concerns all generations, not just the elderly. In early 2021 we will present a Green Paper on aging with the aim of launching a wide debate to discuss the long—term impacts of aging, care and pensions, active aging and the capacity of social protection systems to deal with an aging population. We will look at inter—generational solidarity and fairness, impacts on the labour market, the economy, and health and care systems. A substantial part will deal with questions on long—term care. Based on the outcome of the consultations, the Commission could be in a better position to consider what further initiatives could be taken on long—term care. To conclude, dear ladies and gentlemen, to borrow a thought from Dostoevsky: you can best judge a society by how by how it treats its most vulnerable members, and those who take care of them. If we learn one lesson from the COVID—19 pandemic, let it be the importance of solidarity. Solidarity between generations must be one of the driving forces of Europe’s recovery, as set out in the Commission’s proposal for a major recovery plan to repair and prepare for the next generation. Only together can we successfully exit the crisis and build a future.  As I said at the beginning, we can pay tribute to the service providers, but we must also take action. We need to deliver for the service providers and users in our policymaking. In this I count on your support.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 1, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 1, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 4, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 48, "date": "2020-10-08.json", "name": "Cindy FRANSSEN", "mepid": "197455", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for your passionate speech. At the onset of corona pandemic, no one could have predicted the terrible tsunami that claimed so many lives. Our elders in particular were in the eye of the storm. The difficult choices in some hotly contested areas about who could be hospitalized and who could not, often resulted in an age-based decision. Choices that we as a society have not had to make since the Second World War. And let it be just that generation that has toiled to build our welfare state, just that generation we as a society have been physically and mentally deficient. However, the right to long-term care is contained in our social pillar.  Let's face it, at the first wave we were not prepared enough to deal with such a crisis. It is not the time to organise public tribunals on who bears ultimate responsibility. But above all, let's learn lessons.  We need to find a better balance between well-being and physical health, between the safety and mental well-being of our most vulnerable.  We must no longer surrender to visitation rights and the right to say goodbye with dignity.  And nest heat is the best medicine against the frailty and vulnerability of people with dementia.  The same conclusions can also be drawn for the disabled sector, for young people residing in a youth institution, and also for single elderly people receiving home care.  During our lack of action, the care staff have given the best of themselves. They have taken the human dramas on their already overloaded shoulders. A sector that has been sitting on its gums for years, undervalued and is not known to be the first to pass through the compensation box office.  That is precisely why, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the initiative of my colleagues Fitzgerald and Radtke for their 'EU Carers' Strategy', in which they advocate better working conditions and better framework so that we can offer more quality of care.

This has happened in several countries of the European Union: I am also thinking, of course, of my own region, Lombardy, where a real black page has been written, with the failure of the social and health system and a shocking load of deaths, precisely in residences for the elderly and also as a result of the unfortunate choices of those who manage welfare. It is essential that the European institutions shed full light on what has happened, not only in order to identify obvious distortions and political responsibilities, which it is right and sacrosanct to identify, but also to avoid seeing the same tragic script repeated in recent months.  That is also why we need a more social Europe. The Commission must believe even more: more attentive to the right to health and care. We need more investment, new choices to deal with this second emergency phase without making the enormous mistakes of the past and, finally, we need to think about how to redesign the services themselves in the future. We must do this by involving the best and most significant third sector players, trade unions and citizens' associations.

A large part of the Member States of the Union - we must admit - have been wrong, and I hope that we can have, at some point, an investigation showing us what really happened and why these centres have become and continue to be outbreaks of infection. We are talking about the most vulnerable of European citizens, people in need of permanent care, people with disabilities or elderly people who have actually been abandoned in the face of the pandemic. In the absence of any contingency plan, the care staff have made extraordinary efforts and I would like to thank, on this occasion, all those who have remained on duty in the face of danger. Unfortunately, however, the mortality rate was extremely high. The Commission must work with Member States to find solutions in two directions: well-paid and trained care staff and modern centres where vulnerable people can receive the care they need safely. Renew Europe, our political group, is campaigning for a rethink of care and care centres in the management of communities to ensure that we no longer have situations of abandonment of vulnerable people in institutionalised systems. In the coming period, we must invest substantially in creating access and opportunity so that any European citizen who needs to be able to receive care in a sustainable way through direct access or within the community to which he is a member, without being excluded socially.

This is no wonder, because we get up with COVID-19 and go to sleep with COVID-19. I fear that the measures we are taking to combat the pandemic will do much more damage than the pandemic itself. I am not referring to the devastating economic consequences of these measures. No, I am referring to the measures that have been taken that affect the most vulnerable in society – people in care facilities. In Germany, one in two people who died of COVID-19 died in a nursing home. What measures has the government taken? It has isolated these people. She has imposed a ban on contact with their relatives. This measure did not save any lives – quite the contrary. It was incredibly cruel, it was inhumane, and it cost lives. Especially in such a difficult phase, these people naturally need the love and affection and the closeness to their loved ones. This would, of course, have been possible without any problems, while respecting the measures. We know that today. This must not happen again. This measure was cruel and inhumane. What happened to the secret heroes of the pandemic, our nurses, who were really on the front line, who sacrificed themselves? What did they get? Applause. And, otherwise? Applause is beautiful, appreciation. But was that all? Our federal government has provided ridiculous one-off payments – really ridiculous. But has anything changed in the basic situation of the nurses? Even before that, the situation was a disaster. A qualified nurse in Germany earns 2,500 euros gross. 2 500 Euros! To do so, she has to work eight hours hard, physically and emotionally. After these eight hours, she can usually sit down for one or two hours for documentation.

Yet WHO sounded the alarm already in March about the dramatic situation in long-term care institutions in the EU, pointing out that half of the deaths related to COVID-19 had occurred in these institutions.

The death rate among the elderly reaches 15%, and in nursing homes it is much higher. This was the case in many European countries – France, Spain, Belgium, Italy, where mortality was much higher, between 30% and even 50%. These facilities have become outbreaks of infections, which have also decimated staff, causing severe, difficult-to-fill staff shortages. Patients may have felt discriminated against.  The most drastic example is Spain, where selection was introduced when selecting patients for treatment. People in long-term care often did not go through the \"sieve of life\".

I welcome today's debate, and I regret the fact that we are months late with it. This is confirmed by the WORLD Health Organisation data, as in the first wave of pandemics, more than half of the EU's deaths were elderly and other social institutions. This statistic is horrific and should never have happened. Unfortunately, there is no political will in the Member States or at EU level for a thorough investigation of the causes and correction of errors. The last few months have so entrenched the entrenched ness of old-fashioned or old-fashioned old-fashioned. As the EU population ages, ageing is a topic that has been avoided, approached by many prejudices and stereotypes, or equated with disease and ineading. This results in a huge number of socially excluded older people. We see them as a social burden, and we do not see home for the elderly as a warm home, but only as the last stop of life. However, human rights, including adequate medical care, belong to all people, at all ages and without any discrimination. It is intolerable that in the first wave of nursing homes and other institutions, many places across Europe have been left to their own devices and forced to become improvised hospitals, without adequate equipment and qualified medical staff. I therefore very much support the commitment of the President of the Commission to create a strong health union, but that is not enough. Together, we must also do more for solidarity between generations, the fight against age-based discrimination and full respect for the rights of the elderly. We urgently need a common European framework for long-term care based on human rights and social solidarity. I call on the Commission to establish a common framework of rules and standards for the quality of long-term care services, which will bind all members.

COVID-19 has only increased the fragility of these patients, who are often suffering from progressive cancer, unstabilized heart or respiratory diseases, and Alzheimer's disease. According to the European social network, COVID-19 has disproportionately affected the elderly and has had a significant impact on the provision of long-term care. According to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, between 30 and 60% of all deaths due to COVID-19 were verified in these facilities during the first months of the pandemic. Public authorities have faced many challenges in order to continue to provide long-term care, while addressing the lack of protective equipment available to health care workers. Social distancing and isolation have had a negative impact on the health and well-being of residents.

People with neurological conditions such as dementia or neuropathic disorders are particularly vulnerable. They show that they have absent symptoms until the patient's condition deteriorates rapidly, and it is often too late. This means that we must also start systematically monitoring this in social service facilities. The problem is the huge staffing under-pressure, which has already been said several times, and the lack of qualified staff in the labour market. They are not only lousyly paid people in some Member States, but also very vulnerable, they cannot maintain social distancing and often suffer from a lack of protective equipment.

In Italy, the PD/5Stelle government, which often makes up for concrete measures with rhetoric, has called them heroes, only to forget about them, demonstrating short-sightedness and inability to plan strategically. In fact, 10 000 doctors will be missing from the appeal in Italy over the next three years. Yet the University Ministry has just suspended the rankings of the competition for medical specialisation schools, thus lengthening the time taken to enter hospitals and penalising doctors and patients at the same time. I am sure that the European Union can make a difference in this respect.

That is a fact. I myself am a nursing service manager – I know what I am talking about. As a family party in Germany, we introduced the K21 concept back then, well before COVID-19, years earlier. And there is really only one thing: when I hear \"care centers\" – completely wrong. What we need is \"outpatient before inpatient\" for a self-determined life of people. \"Ambulant before inpatient\" is also a principle in Germany, but is not lived. We must live up to this principle. We wrote it down to the K21 concept years ago. There would have been far fewer deaths. In other words, let us finally stop this policy of failure in care! And one thing very briefly at the end: I always said to my nurse when they asked how they should look after them: \"Care for your people the way you want to be cared for.

More than half of the deaths in the EU, according to the WTO, were in nursing homes.

In my country, France, the elderly account for 95% of the deaths we deplore. But in France, what have we done for the elderly? Nothing. We have been cutting budgets, increasing costs, making retirees more vulnerable. The government is now playing a good game of creating a new \"dependency\" branch of social security, it is in communication and improvisation, as it has been since the beginning of this pandemic. First of all, with the hospital, where 3,400 beds were cut in 2019, we went from downsizing to funding cuts. Caregivers showed their anger in the street for two years, they were never listened to. I would like to point out here that the European Commission, between 2011 and 2018, asked Member States no less than 63 times to cut their health spending. You,50, too, are responsible. As for the Ehpads, during several months of confinement, the dead were not known or counted, abandoned, deprived of protective equipment because of a shortage for which the State is responsible. During the confinement, our elders, already abandoned in institutions lacking resources and staff, were deprived of the visit of their loved ones, sometimes missing them during their last moments. This deplorable picture will only get worse. Demographers predict that the number of dependent seniors will double by 2060. Europe's population in general is aging and shrinking. We need a youth, of course, not only to ensure the care of the elders but also to take over, without which a people cannot live. Far from the amateurism that characterized this crisis management, the situation of health care facilities imposes two conclusions on us.

Because of their protection, they are socially excluded, they are victims of social isolation, solitude and exclusion are particularly stressful for them. It's a generation, though, that doesn't live in the digital world. Worryingly, the World Health Organisation's report on the impact of Covid-19 shows that violence against the elderly has risen sharply since the pandemic began.

Up to 66% of covid-19 deaths in some countries have so far been wards of long-term care facilities. And it's terrible.

Differences in standards, in service availability, in how this service is provided.  Here we have heard many times from colleagues that the European Union has no competence, no possibility to act. That's partly true, but not to the end. Namely, there is a recovery fund that is financed, that is, that will finance the repair of the consequences of the pandemic. It has a European Social Fund that can help finance the training of the workforce in social welfare institutions. We have a European Regional Development Fund that can finance health infrastructure.   Thus, there are financial instruments by which the European Union can greatly contribute to reducing these differences in the quality of long-term care. And finally, there is the European Semester as a mechanism for controlling whether countries meet those standards for which they have undertaken the commitment themselves.

Those affected include the elderly, and I take this opportunity to welcome the work of the German Presidency on the rights of the elderly in digitalisation, which was mentioned by one or two Members. Member States are aware that active ageing also means being able to fully participate in society. Today we inhabit a more digitalised world. Digitalisation and technology help older people in their autonomy and ability to connect with others. It also raises issues on the right to privacy. This calls for action in increasing digital literacy for older people. Digital tools must be accessible and easy to use for all ages. Those who are unable to use them must be provided with alternative ways of accessing essential services. The fundamental rights and values of the European Union are indivisible, universal values of human dignity, freedom, equality and solidarity. These rights are valid throughout the whole life cycle, from birth to death. In my role as Vice—President for Democracy and Demography, the whole of the live cycle is the focus of my work, and I have to think about the most vulnerable in our policy-making, particularly when we consider long-term care facilities. I see that you share these views and would like to address some points raised here today. There were questions on Article 19 from Ms Metz on implementation and on funding. I would like to answer that the Commission is committed to the entire European Pillar of Social Rights. In order to deliver, we will present, next year, an action plan on the implementation of the European Pillar of Social Rights. Regarding funding, someone said that there is no reference in the Treaty on European Union responsibilities, but there is the Coronavirus Response Investment Initiative and, of course, the European Union Recovery and Resilience Facility. Then, as I mentioned in my introductory statement, there is REACT-EU, but also don’t forget that we are negotiating the Multiannual Financial Framework. Also, of course, there is the European Social Fund, and I am aligned with those who said that the European Semester can also be one of the tools. Mr Brglez mentioned the quality standards for long-term care. I mentioned the Green Paper consultation at the beginning, so let’s discuss which measures are required and at which level – at European level and at Member State level. We will need to take a close look at long-term care, and I’m totally in alignment with you. Regarding a stronger role for the European Union in health care and long—term care, you will remember the State of the Union address by our President, Ursula von der Leyen, which was held here two weeks ago. She mentioned health. So let’s use the Conference on the Future of Europe to discuss the role of health and the role of the European Union: what can we do and what can we improve? Because almost all of you were talking about this. So I think this Conference on the Future of Europe, which will be launched soon, may be one of the instruments through which we can debate this important issue. The COVID—19 pandemic exposed gaps in long-term care, showing a lack of coordination of services between healthcare and long—term care providers, and of course this resulted in difficulties for home residents to access health services, including patients with COVID—19 and patients with chronic conditions. The pandemic and containment measures also intensified loneliness. Many of you mentioned loneliness, solitude and isolation. We are completely aware that loneliness is a phenomenon, and we will definitely tackle this issue. There is psychological distress here too, not only among older people, but among all users of these facilities. The service providers themselves – the carers – have had to work under extremely difficult conditions, improvising on many levels in their efforts to go above and beyond the call of duty. Effective care management through the involvement and collaboration of clinicians, patients, users and caregivers is necessary. It can form the cornerstone in the transformation of health and long—term care systems in providing services that are adapted to the needs, values and preferences of the users, while supporting the providers. Once again, I cannot forget the images of isolation, loneliness and grief that emerged from our long-term care homes across the European Union. In some places it is still happening. We must strive to ensure that no one has to experience the loss of a loved one in such a traumatic way ever again. By pulling together, we can demonstrate the value of our solidarity by providing the long-term care sector with the support they need, which in turn helps build a better society for all of us. This requires efforts on all sides, as many of you said – at European level, at Member State level, among regional and local authorities, and, yes, at a societal and individual level. Thank you once again for this debate. I am looking forward to cooperation in the future.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 2, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 1, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 4, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 92, "date": "2020-10-08.json", "name": "Marcel KOLAJA", "mepid": "197546", "text": "  The debate is closed.

It is necessary to have well-trained and financially stimulated care staff, but also institutions that support vulnerable people and where they feel safe and have decent conditions of care. It is absolutely imperative that we provide equal access so that all European citizens can receive health care in a sustainable way.  In this context, I would like to thank with all my heart the care staff who have made and continue to work hard and who have done their exemplary duty in the face of a critical situation arising from the COFID-19 pandemic.

A significant proportion of residents of such institutions are elderly people, who, due to their age, are at high risk of acute illness and death. At the same time, the risk of transmission of the virus in care facilities is very high due to the close contact of residents with other people. A sharp increase in the number of cases in such centres can place too much strain on local hospitals, resulting in poorer healthcare for the most vulnerable group in society. It should be borne in mind that isolating the elderly in such facilities is not an option. The ban on visits and group activities adversely affects mental health, and isolation increases the risk of neglect and sometimes abuse of the elderly. It is not possible to bring about a situation in which the elderly are abandoned and left to themselves. Caring for the health and life of the elderly is a moral duty for all of us and an element of the solidarity we need today.

The draft foreign agents law in particular could be used to impose further restrictions on civil and political rights of individuals, civil society and on media outlets.

Since the beginning we have followed with utmost attention the tabling of the draft foreign agents law. On Tuesday our head of delegation in Managua, accompanied by all EU Member States present in the country, reached out to the Nicaraguan authorities in Managua at Minister of Foreign Affairs level to voice our concerns and find out more about the draft text, as well as to share our preoccupation on how the law would affect international human rights law and civil liberties in Nicaragua. The European Union has consistently voiced concerns against laws labelling NGOs as foreign agents all over the world.

Madam President, it is important that we talk about the appalling laws, because they are incredibly discriminatory, against women in Saudi Arabia. It is important that we talk about human rights defenders and political prisoners whose rights are being violated in this country. It is important that we condemn corporal punishment of another age and the application of the death penalty in this country. It is important that the European Parliament immediately address the overall human rights situation in Saudi Arabia. I will ask my colleagues, legal coordinators, to be one of our next topics on the agenda. Today, a resolution entitled \"The situation of Ethiopian migrants in detention centres in Saudi Arabia\" is on the agenda. I will therefore limit myself to this resolution and the migration problems associated with it. It will also be only on those points that my vote will be. Let me simply add that we should go far beyond the subject under consideration, there is no shortage of choices. Other detention centres around the world where migrants are being held in abominable conditions would have deserved our attention. Among the migrants in Saudi Arabia, Ethiopians are undoubtedly the ones with the most difficult living conditions. Often already victims of smugglers making them cross Yemen, once they arrive, they are exploited, underpaid and often at the mercy of their employer under the kafala system, a system that amounts to a situation of modern slavery. Now rejected because of the COVID-19 pandemic, thousands of Ethiopian migrants find themselves in even greater distress without resources or livelihoods.  Equally destitute are Ethiopians deported by the thousands from Yemen to Saudi Arabia. As Ethiopia is unable to repatriate its nationals, they find themselves on standby, detained and held by the hundreds in camps with inhumane living conditions, in enclosed places, often infected with the COVID virus or otherwise abused. And this for weeks, if not for months. Among them are particularly vulnerable people, such as children or pregnant women. All of this is simply unsustainable.  That is why we call on the Ethiopian authorities to repatriate their nationals as soon as possible and for Saudi Arabia to ensure that its detention centres comply with international standards and that migrants under their authority are not subjected to any ill-treatment, torture or sexual abuse.  We call on the European Union not only to warn about these inhumane conditions of detention, but also to use all diplomatic and political levers to try to stop them.

Is it not hypocritical to speak out against kafala today, when the 2022 World Cup was awarded in Qatar in 2010, the use of this form of quasi-slavery was widely known. The tragedy of Ethiopian migrants illustrates the double standards that govern the global migration crisis. On the one hand, a Europe called upon to open its doors to a human tide from Africa or the Middle East, on the other the assumed inhumanity and cynicism of the Gulf States, which reject their own co-religionists, notably the Syrians, and expel manu militari, at a rate of 10,000 per month for Ethiopian nationals.

In Ethiopia, at the end of 2018, there were 2.9 million internally displaced people, with no lasting solution.

Since March, over 30 000 people, including pregnant women and children, have been arbitrarily detained in unthinkable sanitary conditions. We are all aware of the importance of Saudi Arabia as a partner for the European Union and for the stability in the Middle East. However, this cannot be an excuse for the EU to ignore those violations. We all remember Jamal Khashoggi, Raif Badawi, Loujain al-Hathloul and the woman activists, and also Prince Salman bin Abdul Aziz and the Princess Basmah, arbitrarily detained for years. The EU cannot remain silent or use double standards. The sharing of our fundamental values and the respect of human rights must be an essential condition in our relations with third countries. For this reason, with this resolution we strongly urge President von der Leyen and Charles Michel to reconsider, or downgrade, the EU participation in the G20 summit in November. And finally, this would be an opportunity for the EU to show coherence with its values and not to legitimise impunity for the crimes committed in Saudi Arabia.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 143, "date": "2020-10-08.json", "name": "Dubravka ŠUICA", "mepid": "119434", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission. – Madam President, my colleagues High Representative Borrell and Commissioner Lenarčič are travelling to Addis Ababa with the last EU humanitarian air bridge flight.  This humanitarian air bridge flight is very specific in its nature as it aims at bringing support to the African Union and the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention to be further distributed in African countries. It will be the third and last shipment to Addis, the most significant one, and also the last humanitarian air bridge flight organised by the European Union jointly with Germany. Besides the COVID—19 component, the joint visit to Addis is extremely timely. Regarding the African Union, it will be an opportunity to keep the momentum of a strengthened European Union-African Union partnership despite the postponement of the summit. With Ethiopian partners, it will be an opportunity to express our concerns over the political situation in the run—up to the elections. We have seen the shocking reports about African migrants, mainly Ethiopians, reportedly held under dreadful conditions in detention centres in Saudi Arabia. We also understand that earlier this week, eight Ethiopians died and 12 went missing off the coast of Djibouti after failing to reach Yemen. We knew already that the conflict in Yemen has created the world’s gravest humanitarian crisis. However, what we are discussing today shows that it also makes the situation of many migrants in the region close to unbearable. Despite the conflict, migration continues. The conflict in Yemen provides a fertile breeding ground for trafficking and smuggling networks, which profit from desperate African citizens looking for a better life in the Gulf. We are taking this situation seriously, and are following up and helping where we can. The EU delegation in Riyadh has raised the conditions in detention centres with the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Labour rights and migration management are indeed issues we want to discuss more regularly with our Saudi interlocutors. There are indeed things to be said. Last week, High Representative Borrell received the Saudi Foreign Minister and reaffirmed the European Union’s interest in a structured human rights dialogue in which migration features prominently. We hope to launch this dialogue soon.  We are also reinforcing our engagement with the countries of origin in the Horn of Africa. Today, the High Representative and Commissioner Lenarčič are in Ethiopia. They will visit an International Organization for Migration transit centre where Ethiopian deportees, including from the Gulf, are quarantined upon arrival. We have recently provided EUR 60 million to the Horn of Africa Intergovernmental Authority (IGAD) to address the impact of COVID—19. This aid will also benefit migrants. We are eager to encourage a region—to—region dialogue on migration management between the Horn and the Gulf, as proposed by the Intergovernmental Authority on Development. We also hope that the soon—to—be—launched Red Sea Council can provide a platform for this. More broadly, in our external action we are committed to, and indeed an advocate for, the protection of the human rights of all migrants. The recently adopted EU Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy 2020—2024 calls for the protection of migrants, refugees and internally displaced persons. It also calls for support measures to improve integration and access to basic services. In our times of COVID—19 this is, of course, even more important. In third countries we strive to have migrants and forcibly displaced persons benefit from healthcare systems and include these groups in strategies related to COVID—19.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 1, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 144, "date": "2020-10-08.json", "name": "Klára DOBREV", "mepid": "197579", "text": "  The debate is over.
