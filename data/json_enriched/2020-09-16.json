Au cours de ces six derniers mois, les Européens ont fait preuve de toute cette force. Nous l’avons vu avec les soignants qui ont déménagé dans les maisons de retraite pour s’occuper des malades et des personnes âgées, avec les médecins et les infirmières qui sont devenus membres de famille pour les malades arrivés à leur dernier souffle, et avec tous les travailleurs de première ligne qui, jour et nuit, semaine après semaine, ont pris des risques pour nous tous. Leur empathie, leur courage et leur sens du devoir nous inspirent et je voudrais commencer ce discours en leur rendant hommage. (Applaudissements) Their stories also reveal a lot about the state of our world and the state of our Union. They show the power of humanity and the sense of mourning which will live long in our society. And they expose to us the fragility all around us. A virus a thousand times smaller than a grain of sand exposed how delicate life can be. It laid bare the strains on our health systems and the limits of a model that values wealth above wellbeing. It brought into sharper focus the planetary fragility that we see every day through melting glaciers, burning forests and now through global pandemics. It changed the way we behave and communicate – keeping our arms at length, and our faces behind masks. It showed us just how fragile our community of values really is, and how quickly it can be called into question around the world and even here in our Union. But people want to move out of this Corona world, out of this fragility, out of this uncertainty. They are ready for change and they are ready to move on. And this is the moment for Europe. The moment for Europe to lead the way from this fragility towards a new vitality, and that is what I want to talk about today. Honourable Members, I say this because in the last months we have rediscovered the value of what we hold in common. As individuals, we have all sacrificed a piece of our personal liberty for the safety of others. And as a Union, we all shared a part of our sovereignty for the common good. We turned fear and division between Member States into confidence in our Union. We showed that it is possible and what is possible when we trust each other and we trust the European institutions. And with all of that, we choose to not only repair and recover for the here and now, but to shape a better way of living for the world of tomorrow.  This is NextGenerationEU. This is our opportunity to make change happen by design, and not by disaster or by diktat from others in the world. To emerge stronger by creating opportunities for the world of tomorrow, and not just building contingencies for the world of yesterday. We have everything we need to make this happen. We have shaken off the old excuses and home comforts. We have the vision, we have a plan, we have the investment. It is now time to get to work. This morning, I sent a Letter of Intent to President Sassoli and Chancellor Merkel, on behalf of the German Presidency, outlining the Commission’s plans for the year ahead. I will not present every initiative today but I want to touch on what our Union must focus on in the next twelve months. Honourable Members, the people of Europe are still suffering. It is a period of profound anxiety for millions who are concerned about the health of their families, the future of their jobs, or simply getting through to the end of the month. The pandemic and the uncertainty that goes with it is not over. And the recovery is still in its early stage. So our first priority is to pull each other through this and to be there for those that need it. And thanks to our unique social market economy, Europe can do just that. It is above all a human economy that protects us against the great risks of life – illness, ill-fortune, unemployment and poverty. It offers stability and helps us better absorb shocks. It creates opportunities and prosperity by promoting innovation, growth and fair competition. Never before has that enduring promise of protection, stability and opportunity been more important than it is today. Allow me to explain why. First, Europe must continue to protect lives and livelihoods. This is all the more important in the middle of a pandemic that shows no sign of running out of steam or intensity. We know how quickly numbers can spiral out of control, so we must continue to handle this pandemic with extreme care, responsibility and unity. In the last six months, our health systems and workers have produced miracles. Every country has worked to do its best for its citizens. And Europe has done more together than ever before. When the Member States closed borders, we created green lanes for goods. When more than 600 000 European citizens were stranded all over the world, the EU brought them back home. When some countries introduced export bans for critical medical goods, we stopped that and ensured that critical medical goods should go where they were needed. We worked with European industry to increase the production of masks, of gloves, of tests, of ventilators. Our Civil Protection Mechanism ensured that doctors from Romania could treat patients in Italy, or that Latvia could send masks to its Baltic neighbours. And we achieved all that without having full competences. So for me, it is crystal clear: we need to build a stronger European Health Union. It is time to do that. (Applause) And to start making this a reality, we must now draw the first lessons from the health crisis. We need to make our new EU4Health programme future proof. This is why I had proposed to increase funding and I am grateful that this Parliament is ready to fight for more funding and remedy the cuts made by the European Council. And we need to strengthen our crisis preparedness and management of cross-border health issues. As a first step, we will propose to reinforce and empower the European Medicines Agency and ECDC, our centre for disease prevention and control. As a second step, we will build a European BARDA, an agency for biomedical advanced research and development. This new agency will support our capacity and readiness to respond to cross-border threats and emergencies, whether of natural or deliberate origin. We need strategic stockpiling to address supply chain dependencies, notably for pharmaceutical goods. And as a third step, it is clearer than ever that we must discuss the question of health competences. I think it is a noble and urgent task to do this for the Conference on the Future of Europe. (Applause) And finally – and because this was a global crisis – we need to learn global lessons. This is why, along with Prime Minister Conte and the Italian G20 Presidency next year, I will convene a Global Health Summit next year in Italy. This will show Europeans that our Union is there to protect them all, and this is exactly what we have done when it comes to workers. When I took office, I vowed to create an instrument to protect workers and businesses from external shocks. Because I knew from my experience as a Minister for Labour and Social Affairs that these schemes work. They keep people in jobs, they keep the skills in companies and of course they keep SMEs in business. These SMEs are the motor of our economy and they will be the engine of our recovery. This is why the Commission created the SURE programme, and I want to thank this House for working on it in record time. If Europe has so far avoided mass unemployment seen elsewhere, it is thanks in large part to the fact that around 40 million people applied for short-time work schemes. The speed and unity of purpose means that 16 countries will soon receive almost EUR 90 billion from SURE to support workers and companies. From Lithuania to Spain, it will give peace of mind to families who need that income to put food on the table or to pay the rent. And it will help protect millions of jobs, incomes and companies right across our Union. This is real European solidarity in action and it reflects the fact that in our Union the dignity of work must be sacred. But the truth is that for too many people, work no longer pays. Dumping wages destroys the dignity of work, penalises the entrepreneur who pays decent wages and distorts fair competition in the Single Market, and this has to stop. This is why the Commission will put forward a legal proposal to support Member States to set up a framework for minimum wages. Everyone must have access to minimum wages either through collective bargaining or through statutory minimum wages. I personally am a strong advocate of collective bargaining and the proposal will fully respect national competencies and traditions. We have seen in many Member States that introduced collectively-bargained minimum wages how a well-negotiated minimum wage secures jobs and creates fairness – both for the workers and for the companies really value them. Minimum wages work, and it is time that work paid. (Applause) The second promise of the social market economy is that of stability. By showing it was united and up to the task, Europe provided the stability that our economies needed. I will not forget when the crisis hit, the Commission immediately triggered the general escape clause for the very first time in our history. We flexibilised our European funds and State aid rules. Authorising more than EUR three trillion in support to companies and industry: from fishermen in Croatia to farmers in Greece, from SMEs in Italy to freelancers in Denmark. The European Central Bank took decisive action through the PEPP programme. The Commission proposed NextGenerationEU in record time, thus combining investment with much needed reforms. The Council endorsed it in record time. This House is working towards voting on it with maximum speed. Honourable Members, for the first time – and for exceptional times – Europe has put in place its own common tools to complement national fiscal stabilisers. This is a remarkable moment of unity in the European Union, and this is an achievement we should take collective pride in. We made that! (Applause) Now is the time to hold our course. We have all seen the forecasts. We can expect our economies to start moving again after a 12% drop in GDP in the second quarter. But as the virus lingers so does the uncertainty here in Europe and around the world. So this is definitely not the time to withdraw support. Our economies need continued policy support and a delicate balance will need to be struck between providing financial support and ensuring fiscal sustainability. In the longer-term there is no greater way to stability and competitiveness than through a stronger Economic and Monetary Union. Confidence in the euro has never been stronger. The historic agreement on NextGenerationEU shows the political backing that it has. And we must now use this opportunity to make structural reforms in our economies and complete the Capital Markets Union and the Banking Union. Deep and liquid capital markets are essential to give businesses access to the finance they need, and they need it to grow and invest in recovery and in the future, and they are also a pre-requisite to further strengthen the international role of the euro. So let’s get to work and finally complete this generational project. The third enduring promise is the promise of opportunity. The pandemic reminded us of many things we may have forgotten or we may have taken for granted. We were reminded how linked our economies are and how crucial a fully functioning Single Market is to our prosperity and to the way we do things. The Single Market is all about opportunity – opportunity for consumers to get value for money, opportunities for a company to sell everywhere in Europe and opportunities for industry to drive global competitiveness.  And for all of us, it is about the opportunity to make the most of the freedoms we cherish as Europeans. It gives our companies the scale they need to prosper and a safe haven for them in times of trouble. We rely on it every day to make our lives easier, and it is crucial for managing the crisis and recovering our strength. So let’s give it a boost. We must tear down the barriers of the Single Market. We must cut red tape. We must step up implementation and enforcement. And we must restore the four freedoms in full and as fast as possible. The linchpin of this is a fully functioning Schengen area of free movement. We will work with Parliament and Member States to bring this high up on our political agenda and we will propose a new strategy for the future of Schengen. Based on this strong internal market, the European industry has long powered our economy, providing a stable living for millions and creating the social hubs around which our communities are built. We presented a new industry strategy in March to ensure industry could lead the twin green and digital transition. The last six months have only accelerated that transformation at a time when the global competitive landscape is fundamentally changing. We too, we have to keep up and this is why we will update our industry strategy in the first half of next year and adapt our competition framework, which should also keep pace. Honourable Members, all of this will ensure Europe gets back on its feet. But as we pull through together, we must also propel ourselves forwards in the world of tomorrow. There is no more urgent need for acceleration than when it comes to the future of our fragile planet. While much of the world’s activity froze during lockdowns and shutdowns, the planet continued to get dangerously hotter. We see it all around us: from houses evacuated due to glacier collapse on the Mont Blanc, to fires burning through Oregon, to crops destroyed in Romania by the most severe drought in decades. But we also saw nature come back into our lives. We longed for green spaces and cleaner air, for our mental health and our physical wellbeing. We know change is needed, and we also know it is possible. The European Green Deal is our blueprint to make that transformation. At the heart of it is our mission to become the first climate-neutral continent in 2050. But we will not get there with the status quo: we need to go faster and we need to do things better. We looked in-depth at every sector to see how fast we could go and how to do it in a responsible, evidence-based way. We held a wide public consultation and conducted an extensive impact assessment. On this basis, the Commission is proposing to increase the 2030 target for emission reduction to at least 55%.  (Applause) I recognise that this increase from 40 to 55 is too much for some, and not enough for others. But our impact assessment clearly shows that our economy and industry can manage this, and they want it. Just yesterday, 170 business leaders and investors, from SME’s to some of the world’s biggest companies, wrote to me calling on Europe to set a target of at least 55%. Our impact assessment clearly shows that meeting this target would put the European Union firmly on track for climate neutrality by 2050 and for meeting our Paris Agreement obligations. And if others follow our lead, the world will be able to keep warming below 1.5 degrees Celsius. I am fully aware that many of our partners are far away from that – but we have to lead, and I will come back to the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism later. But for us, the 2030 target is ambitious, it’s achievable, and it is beneficial for Europe. We can do it, and we have already shown we can do it. While emissions dropped 25% since 1990, our economy grew more than 60%. The difference is we now have the technology, we have way more expertise and we have the investment, and we are already embarking towards a circular economy with carbon neutral production. We want to be leading in the world on that. We have more young people pushing for change. We have more proof that what is good for the climate is good for business and is good for us all. And we have a solemn promise to leave no one behind in this transformation. With our Just Transition Fund we will support the regions that have a bigger and more costly change to make. We have it all. Now it’s our responsibility to implement it, and to make it happen. And I want you at my side and I invite you in this endeavour because we can only do it together. This is our mission on the European level, honourable Members. Meeting this new target will reduce our energy import dependency, will create millions of extra jobs and more than halve air pollution. To get there, we have to start now. By next summer, we will revise all of our climate and energy legislation to make it ‘fit for 55’. We will enhance emission trading, boost renewable energy, improve energy efficiency, reform energy taxation. But the mission of the European Green Deal involves much more than cutting emissions. It is important, but it is about making systemic modernisation across our economy, society and industry. It is about building a stronger world to live in. Our current levels of consumption of raw materials, energy, water, food and land use are not sustainable. We need to change how we treat nature, how we produce and consume, how we live and work, eat and heat, travel and transport. So we will tackle everything from hazardous chemicals to deforestation, to pollution. This is a plan for a true recovery. It is an investment plan for Europe, and this is where NextGenerationEU will make a real difference. Firstly, 37% of NextGenerationEU will be spent directly on our European Green Deal objectives. I will ensure that it also takes green financing to the next level. We are world leaders in green finance and we are the largest issuer of green bonds worldwide. We are leading the way in developing a reliable EU Green Bond Standard. And I can today announce that we will set a target of 30% of NextGenerationEU’s EUR 750 billion to be raised through green bonds. (Applause) Secondly, NextGenerationEU should invest in lighthouse European projects with the biggest impact: hydrogen, renovation and one million electric charging points. Allow me to explain how this could work. Two weeks ago in Sweden, a unique fossil-free steel pilot began test operations. It will replace coal with hydrogen to produce clean steel. This shows the potential of hydrogen to support our industry with a new, clean, licence to operate. I want NextGenerationEU to create new European Hydrogen Valleys to modernise our industries, to power our vehicles and to bring new life to our rural areas. The second example are the buildings we live and work in. Our buildings generate more than 40% of our emissions. They need to become less wasteful, less expensive and more sustainable. And we know that the construction sector can even be turned from a carbon source into a carbon sink, if organic building materials like wood and smart technologies like AI are being used. I want NextGenerationEU to kickstart a European renovation wave and make our Union a leader in the circular economy. But this is not just an environmental or economic project: it needs to be a new cultural project for Europe. Every movement has its own look and feel. And we need to give our systemic change its own distinct aesthetics to match style with sustainability. This is why we will set up a new European Bauhaus – a co-creation space where architects, artists, students, engineers and designers work together to make that happen. This is NextGenerationEU. This is shaping the world we want to live in. A world served by an economy that cuts emissions, boosts competitiveness, reduces energy poverty, creates rewarding jobs and improves quality of life. A world where we use digital technologies to build a healthier, greener society, and this can only be achieved if we all do it together. And I will insist that recovery plans don’t just bring us out of the crisis, but also help us propel Europe forward into the world of tomorrow. Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren Abgeordnete! Stellen wir uns für einen Moment diese Pandemie vor ohne das Digitale. Quarantäne – vollständig isoliert von Familie und Gemeinschaft, abgeschnitten von der Arbeitswelt, gewaltige Versorgungsprobleme. So oder so ähnlich muss es wohl vor 100 Jahren bei der letzten Pandemie ausgesehen haben. Ein Jahrhundert später erlaubt uns moderne Technologie bei einer schlimmen Pandemie, dass junge Menschen aus der Ferne lernen, zu Hause, und Millionen von Menschen von zu Hause aus arbeiten. Sie ermöglicht Unternehmen, die Produktion am Laufen zu halten und ihre Produkte zu vertreiben, und sie ermöglicht öffentlichen Verwaltungen, wichtige Dienstleistungen für Bürgerinnen und Bürger zu erbringen. Wir haben in wenigen Wochen mehr digitale Innovation und Transformation erlebt, als sonst in Jahren. Aber wir stoßen an die Grenzen dessen, was wir auf analogem Wege noch tun können. Und diese digitale Beschleunigung hat gerade erst begonnen. Das kommende Jahrzehnt muss Europas Digital Decade sein. Und wir brauchen einen gemeinsamen Plan für das digitale Europa mit ganz klar definierten Zielen bis 2050. Wir brauchen Ziele bis 2030, unter anderem in den Feldern Konnektivität, digitale Kompetenzen, öffentliche Verwaltung und vieles anderes mehr. Und wir brauchen klare Prinzipien: das Recht auf Privatsphäre, das Recht auf Zugang, freie Meinungsäußerung, freier Datenfluss und Cybersicherheit. Um das zu erreichen, muss Europa jetzt führen. Oder es wird lange anderen folgen müssen, die dann für uns die Standards setzen. Deswegen müssen wir schnell handeln, und wir müssen entschlossen handeln. Es gibt drei Bereiche, auf die wir uns meiner Meinung nach konzentrieren müssen:  Zuerst die Daten. Bei den personalisierten Daten, Business-to-Consumer, war Europa zu langsam und ist nun auf andere angewiesen. Das darf uns bei den Industriedaten nicht passieren. Und hier ist die gute Nachricht: Hier ist Europa in Führung – wir haben die Technologie, und wir haben vor allem die Industrie, die wir dazu brauchen. Aber das Rennen ist damit noch nicht gewonnen. Die Menge der Industriedaten in der Welt wird sich in den nächsten fünf Jahren vervierfachen – und damit ebenso auch die verbundenen Chancen. Das heißt, wir müssen jetzt unseren Unternehmen, jetzt unseren Mittelständlern, den Start-ups, den Forscherinnen und Forschern die Möglichkeiten eröffnen, aus dem Vollen zu schöpfen. Industriedaten sind Gold wert, wenn es darum geht, neue Produkte und neue Dienstleistungen zu entwickeln. Die Realität sieht aber noch anders aus: 80 % der Industriedaten, die gesammelt werden, werden leider nie genutzt. Das ist eine riesige Verschwendung.  Eine echte Datenwirtschaft wäre hingegen ein kraftvoller Motor für Innovation und für neue Arbeitsplätze. Und deshalb müssen wir diese Daten für Europa sichern und breit zugänglich machen. Dafür brauchen wir gemeinsame Datenräume – zum Beispiel im Energie- und Gesundheitswesen. Diese werden Innovationscluster stärken, in denen Universitäten, Unternehmen und Forschungseinrichtungen sicher auf die Daten zugreifen können und zusammenarbeiten können. Deshalb werden wir im Rahmen von NextGenerationEU eine europäische Cloud aufbauen – auf der Grundlage von Gaia-X. Der zweite Bereich, auf den wir uns konzentrieren müssen, ist die Technologie – und hier insbesondere die künstliche Intelligenz. Ob es um den Präzisionsanbau in der Landwirtschaft geht oder um treffgenaue medizinische Frühdiagnosen oder ob es um sicheres autonomes Fahren geht – die künstliche Intelligenz eröffnet uns Welten, das ist fantastisch, aber diese Welten brauchen auch Regeln. Das heißt, Algorithmen dürfen keine Blackbox sein, und es muss klare Regeln geben, wenn etwas schiefgeht. Die Kommission wird im nächsten Jahr ein entsprechendes Gesetz vorlegen. Dazu gehört auch die Kontrolle über unsere persönlichen Daten, die wir heute viel zu selten haben. Jedes Mal, wenn eine Website uns auffordert, eine neue digitale Identität zu erstellen oder uns bequem über eine große Plattform anzumelden, haben wir in Wirklichkeit keine Ahnung, was eigentlich mit unseren Daten passiert. Und das muss aufhören. Aus diesem Grund wird die Kommission demnächst eine sichere europäische digitale Identität vorschlagen. Eine, der wir vertrauen und die Bürgerinnen und Bürger überall in Europa nutzen können, um alles zu tun, vom Steuernzahlen bis zum Fahrradmieten. Eine Technologie, bei der wir selbst kontrollieren können, welche Daten ausgetauscht und wie sie verwendet werden. Das ist unser Verständnis von einer menschenzentrierten Technologie, die wir beherrschen, die uns dient. Der dritte Punkt ist die Infrastruktur. Die Datenverbindungen müssen mit dem rasanten Tempo Schritt halten. Wenn wir uns ein Europa der gleichen Startchancen tatsächlich auf die Fahnen schreiben, dann kann es nicht sein, dass 40 % der Menschen in den ländlichen Räumen immer noch ohne Zugang zu schnellen Breitbandverbindungen sind. Breitbandverbindungen sind heute die Voraussetzung für Online-Learning, Homeoffice, Onlineshopping und viele, viele Dienstleistungen, die jeden Tag neu erstellt werden. Und ohne Breitbandverbindung lässt sich heute ein Unternehmen einfach nicht mehr führen, geschweige denn aufbauen.  Das heißt, diese schnellen Daten sind die Voraussetzung, aber sie sind auch eine Riesenchance für die Revitalisierung der ländlichen Räume. Nur dann können diese ländlichen Räume ihr Potenzial voll ausschöpfen und dann aber auch wieder Menschen und Investitionen anziehen. Der Investitionsschub durch NextGenerationEU ist eine einmalige Gelegenheit, den Ausbau bis ins letzte Dorf voranzutreiben. Deswegen wollen wir bei den Aufbauplänen einen Schwerpunkt auf sichere Konnektivität, auf den Ausbau von 5G, 6G und Glasfaser setzen. NextGenerationEU ist ebenso eine einmalige Gelegenheit, die wir nutzen sollten, einen gemeinsamen europäischen Ansatz für Konnektivität und für den Ausbau der digitalen Infrastruktur zu entwickeln. All dies ist kein Selbstzweck – es geht um Europas digitale Souveränität, im Kleinen wie im Großen. In diesem Sinne freue ich mich, Investitionen von 8 Milliarden Euro in die nächste Generation von Supercomputern ankündigen zu können. Das ist Spitzentechnologie made in Europe! (Beifall) Und wir wollen, dass die Europäische Industrie einen eigenen Mikroprozessor der nächsten Generation entwickelt, der uns erlaubt, die steigenden Datenmengen energieeffizient und sicher zu nutzen. All das und noch viel mehr gehört für mich zu Europas Digital Decade! Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren Abgeordnete, wenn Europa jetzt aufs Tempo drückt, müssen wir aber vor allem unsere Zögerlichkeit ablegen. Es geht vor allem darum, dass wir mehr Kontrolle über unsere Zukunft haben, Europa mehr Kontrolle über seine Zukunft geben. Wir haben alles, was es dazu braucht, um sie Wirklichkeit werden zu lassen. Der Privatsektor wartet dringend auf einen Plan – der ist jetzt da. Es gab noch nie einen besseren Zeitpunkt, um in europäische Technologieunternehmen zu investieren, überall von Sofia über Lissabon bis Kattowitz neue digitale Cluster aufzubauen.  Wir haben die Menschen, wir haben die Ideen, wir haben die Investitionskraft, um als Europäische Union erfolgreich zu sein. Deshalb werden wir 20 Prozent von NextGenerationEU in das Digitale investieren. Wir wollen damit den europäischen Weg ins Digitalzeitalter gehen – basierend auf unseren Werten, unserer Stärke und unseren Ambitionen. Honourable Members, Europe is determined to use this transition. To build the world we want to live in, and that of course extends well beyond our external borders. The pandemic has simultaneously shown both the fragility of the global system and the importance of cooperation to tackle collective change.  And in the face of the crisis some around the world choose to retreat into isolation. Others actively destabilise the system. Europe chose to reach out.  Our leadership is not about self-serving propaganda. It is not about Europe first. It is about being the first to seriously answer the call when it is needed.  In the pandemic, European planes delivering thousands of tons of protective equipment landed everywhere from Sudan to Afghanistan, Somalia to Venezuela.  We know none of us will ever be safe until all of us are safe and we know wherever we live, whatever we have, there has to be access, affordable and safe access, to vaccines, treatments and diagnostics.  At the beginning of the pandemic, there was no funding, there was no global framework for a COVID-19 vaccine, there was just the rush to be the first one to get one.  This was the moment when the European Union stepped up to lead the global response with civil society, with G20, with the WHO and others, we brought more than 40 countries together to raise EUR 16 billion to finance research on vaccines, on tests, on treatments for the whole world. And this is Europe’s unmatched convening power we can be so proud of. It is not enough to find a vaccine, we need to make sure that European citizens and those around the world have access to it.  And just this month the European Union joined the COVAX global facility and contributed EUR 400 million to help ensure that safe vaccines are available not only for those who can afford it but for everyone who needs it.  Because we know vaccine nationalism puts lives at risks, only vaccine cooperation saves lives.  (Applause) Honourable Members, we are firm believers in the strength and value of cooperating and international bodies. It is with a strong united nation that we can find long term solutions for crises like Libya and Syria. It is with a strong World Health Organisation, that we can better prepare and respond to global pandemics or local outbreaks, be it Corona or Ebola. And it is with a strong World Trade Organisation that we can ensure fair competition for all.  But the truth is also that the need to revitalise and to reform the multilateral system has never been so urgent. Our global system has grown into a creeping paralysis. Major powers are either pulling out or they are taking the institutions hostage for their own interests, and neither road will lead anywhere.  Yes, we need change, but we need change by design and not by destruction of our international system.  (Applause) And this is why I want the European Union to lead reforms on WHO and WTO so that they are fit for today’s world.  But we know that multilateral reforms take time, and in the meantime the world will not stop. Without any doubt there is a clear need for Europe to take clear positions and quick actions on global affairs.  Two days ago the latest EU-China leaders meeting took place. The relationship between the European Union and China is simultaneously one of the most strategically important and one of the most challenging we have.  And from the outset we have said China is a negotiating partner, an economic competitor and a systemic rival. We have interests in common on issues such as climate change, and China has shown it is willing to engage through a high-level dialogue but we expect also China to live up to its commitments in the Paris Agreement and to lead by example.  In the economic field there is still hard work to do on a fair market access for European companies - reciprocity and overcapacity. And we continue to have an unbalanced trade and investment partnership. And there is no doubt that we promote very different systems of governance and society.  We believe in the universal value of democracy and the rights of the individual. Europe is certainly not without issues, think for example of growing anti-Semitism. But criticism and opposition, we discuss them here publicly. Criticism and opposition are not only accepted, but they are legally protected, there is an open debate about all these issues. So we must call out human rights abuses whenever and wherever they occur, be it in Hong Kong or be it with Uyghurs. (Applause)  But what holds us back? Why are even simple statements on EU values delayed, watered down or held hostage for other motives? When Member States say Europe is too slow, I say be courageous and finally move to qualified majority voting, at least on human rights and sanctions implementation.  (Sustained applause) This House has called many times for a European Magnitsky Act and I can announce that we will now come forward with a proposal, we need to complete our toolbox.  (Applause) Honourable Members, be it in Hong Kong, Moscow or Minsk, Europe must take a clear and swift position. And I want to say it loud and clear. The European Union is on the side of the people of Belarus.  (Applause) We have all been moved by the immense courage of those peacefully gathering in the Independence Square or taking part in the fearless women’s march. The elections that brought them into the streets were neither free nor fair, and the brutal response by the government ever since has been shameful. The people of Belarus must be free to decide their own future for themselves, they are not pieces on someone else’s chess board. (Applause) And to those that advocate closer ties with Russia, I say that the poisoning of Alexei Navalny with an advanced chemical agent is not a one-off. We have seen the pattern in Georgia, and in Ukraine, in Syria and Salisbury, and in election meddling around the world, and this pattern is not changing and no pipeline will change that. (Applause) Turkey is and will always be an important neighbour. But while we are close together on the map, the distance between us appears to be growing.  Yes, Turkey is in a troubled neighbourhood and yes it is hosting millions of refugees for which we support them with considerable funding, but none of this is justification for attempts to intimidate their neighbours. Our Member States, Cyprus and Greece, can always count on Europe’s full solidarity on protecting their legitimate sovereignty rights.  (Applause) De-escalation in the eastern Mediterranean is in our mutual interest. The return of exploratory vessels to Turkish ports in the past few days is a positive step in this direction. This is necessary to create the much needed space for dialogue, refraining from unilateral actions and resuming talks in good faith, is the only path forward. The only path to stability and lasting solutions. Honourable Members, as well as responding more assertively to global events, Europe must deepen and refine its partnerships with its friends and allies and this starts with revitalising our most enduring partnerships.  We might not always agree with recent decisions of the White House but we will always cherish the transatlantic alliance, based on shared values and history and an unbreakable bond between our people.  So whatever may happen later this year, we are ready to build a new transatlantic agenda, to strengthen our bilateral partnership, be it on trade, on tech or taxation, and we are ready to work together on reforming the international system we built together, jointly with like-minded partners.  For our own interests and in the interest of the common good, we need new beginnings with old friends on both sides of the Atlantic and on both sides of the channel.  The scenes in this very room when we held hands and sang goodbye with Auld Lang Syne, spoke a thousand words, and they showed an affection for the British people that will never fade.  But with every day that passes the chances for a timely agreement do start to fade. Negotiations are always difficult and we are used to that and the Commission has the best and most experienced negotiator, Michel Barnier, to navigate us through that. But talks have not progressed as we would have wished and that leaves us very little time.  As ever, this House will be the first to know and it will be the one that has the last say, and I can assure you we will continue to update you thoroughly just as we did with the withdrawal agreement.  This withdrawal agreement took three years to negotiate and we worked relentlessly on it, line by line, word by word and together we succeeded and the result guarantees our citizens’ rights, financial interests, the integrity of the single market, and crucially, the Good Friday Agreement. And the European Union and the UK jointly agreed it was the best and only way for ensuring peace on the island of Ireland and we will never backtrack on that and this agreement has been ratified by this House and by the House of Commons. It cannot be unilaterally changed, disregarded or dis-applied. This is a matter of law and trust and good faith.  (Applause) And that is not just me saying it. I remind you of the words of Margaret Thatcher. I quote, ‘Britain does not break treaties. It would be bad for Britain, bad for relations with the rest of the world and bad for any future treaty on trade’, end of quote. This was true then and this is true today.  (Applause) Trust is the foundation of any strong partnership and Europe will always be ready to build strong partnerships with our closest neighbours. This starts with the Western Balkans. The decision six month ago to open accession negotiations with Albania and North Macedonia was truly historical. Indeed the future of the whole region lies in the European Union. We share the same history. We share the same destiny. The Western Balkans are part of Europe and they’re not just a stopover on the Silk Road.  We will soon present an economic recovery package for the Western Balkans focusing on a number of regional investment initiatives. And we will be there for the Eastern Partnership countries and our partners in the southern neighbourhood, to help create jobs and kick-start their economies. When I came into office, I chose for the very first trip outside the European Union to visit the African Union, and it was a natural choice. It was a natural choice and it was a very clear message because we are not just neighbours, but we are natural partners. Three months later I returned with my entire college to set out the priorities for new strategies with Africa. It is a partnership of equals where both sides share opportunities and responsibilities.  Africa will be a key partner in building the world we want to live in, whether it is on climate, digital or trade. Honourable Members, we will continue to believe in open and fair trade across the world, not as an end in itself but as a way to deliver prosperity at home and promote values and standards. More than 600 000 jobs in Europe are tied for example to trade with Japan, and our recent agreement with Vietnam alone helped secure historic labour rights for millions of workers in the country.  We will use our diplomatic strength and economic clout to broker agreements that make a difference, such as designating maritime protected areas in Antarctica. This would be one of the biggest acts of environmental protection in history.  We will form high ambition coalitions on issues such as the digital ethics of fighting deforestation and we will develop partnerships with all like-minded partners from Asian democracies to Australia, Africa, the Americas and anyone else who wants to join. We will work on just globalisation. We cannot take this for granted.  We must insist on fairness and a level playing field, and Europe will always move forward alone or with partners to do that. I want to come back to the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism. Carbon must have its price because nature cannot pay this price anymore. And this Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism should motivate foreign producers and EU importers to reduce their carbon emissions, while ensuring that we level the playing field in a WTO compatible way.  The same principle applies to digital taxation. We will spare no effort to reach agreement in the framework of OECD and G20. But let there be no doubt, should an agreement fall short of a fair tax system that provides long-term sustainable revenues, Europe will come forward with a proposal early next year. I want Europe to be a global advocate for that. (Applause)  Honourable Members, if Europe is to play a vital role in the world, it must also create new vitality inside, and to move forward we must now overcome the differences that held us back. The historic agreement on NextGenerationEU shows that it can be done and the speed with which we took decisions on fiscal rules, state aid or SURE, all these show it can be done. So let’s do it! Migration is an issue that has been discussed long enough. Migration has always been a fact for Europe and it will always be. Throughout centuries, it has defined our societies. It has enriched our cultures and it has shaped many of our lives and this will always be the case.  As we all know, the 2015 migration crisis caused many deep divisions between Member States, with some of those scars still healing today. A lot has been done since, but a lot is still missing. If we are all ready to make compromises, without compromising on our principles, we can find a solution.  Next week, the Commission will put forward its pact on migration. We will take a human and humane approach. And there are principles, saving lives at sea is not optional.  (Applause) And those countries who fulfil their legal and moral duties or are more exposed than others must be able to rely on the solidarity of our whole European Union. We will ensure a closer link between asylum and return. We have to make a clear distinction between those who have the right to stay and those who do not. We will take action to fight smugglers, strengthen external borders, deepen external partnerships and create legal pathways. And we will make sure that people who have the right to stay are integrated and made to feel welcome. They have a future to build and skills, energy and talent.  I think of Suaad, the teenage Syrian refugee who arrived in Europe dreaming of being a medical doctor. Within three years she was awarded a prestigious scholarship from the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland. I think of the Libyan and Somalian refugee doctors who offered their medical skills the moment the pandemic struck in France. And last year I told you the story of Muaz, whom I had the honour to meet. He is studying physics today in Europe.  Honourable Members, if we think about what they have overcome and what they have achieved, then we simply must be able to manage the question of migration together. The images of the Moria camp are a painful reminder of the need for Europe to come together.  (Applause) Everybody has to take a step up here and take responsibility, and the Commission will do just that. The Commission is now working on a plan for a joint pilot with the Greek authorities for new camp on Lesbos. We can assist with asylum and return processes and significantly improve the conditions for the refugees.  But I want to be clear. If we step up, then I expect all Member States to step up too. Migration is a European challenge, and the whole of Europe must do its part. (Applause)  We must rebuild the trust among us and move forward together and this trust is at the very heart of our Union and the way we do things together.  It is anchored in our founding values, our democracies and in our community of law, as Walter Hallstein used to say. This is not an abstract term.  The rule of law helps protect people from the rule of the powerful. It is the guarantor of our most basic, everyday rights and freedoms. It allows us to give our opinion and to be informed by a free press.  Before the end of the month the Commission will adopt the first annual rule of law report covering all Member States. It is a preventive tool for early detection of challenges and for finding solutions. I want this to be a starting point for Commission, Parliament and Member States to ensure there is no backsliding.  The Commission attaches the highest importance to the rule of law and this is why we will ensure that money from our budget and NextGenerationEU is protected against any kind of fraud, corruption or conflict of interest. This is non-negotiable.  (Applause) But the last months have also reminded us how fragile, it can be. We have a duty to always be vigilant, to care and nurture for the rule of law and breaches of the rule of law cannot be tolerated.  I will continue to defend it and the integrity of our European institutions, be it about the primacy of EU law, the freedom of the press, the independence of the judiciary, or the sale of golden passports, European values are not for sale. (Applause)  Honourable Members, these values are more important than ever. I say that because when I think of the State of the Union, I am reminded of the words of John Hume, one of the great Europeans who sadly passed away this year.  If so many people live in peace today on the island of Ireland, it is in large part because of his unwavering belief in humanity and conflict resolution.  He used to say that conflict was about difference and that peace was about respect for difference. And as he so rightly reminded this House in 1998 and I quote, ‘The European visionaries decided that difference is not a threat. Difference is natural. Difference is the essence of humanity’. End of quote.  And these words are just as important today as they ever have been because when I look around we ask ourselves, where is the essence of humanity when three children in Wisconsin watched their father shot by the police while they sat in the car? Where is the essence of humanity when anti-Semitic carnival costumes are openly paraded on our streets? Where is the essence of humanity when every single day Roma people are excluded from society and others held back simply because of the colour of their skin, or their religious belief? I am proud to live in Europe in this open society of values and diversity, but even here in this Union these stories are daily reality for so many people, and this reminds us that progress on fighting racism and hate is fragile. It is hard won but very easily lost. So now is the moment to make change, to build a truly anti-racist union that goes from condemnation to action, and the Commission is putting forward an action plan to start making that happen. As part of this we will propose to extend the list of EU crimes to all forms of hate crime and hate speech, whether because of race, religion, gender or sexuality, hate is hate and no one should have to put up with that. (Applause) We must strengthen our racial equality laws where there are gaps. We will use our budget to address discrimination in areas such as employment, housing or health care. We will get tougher on enforcement when implementation lags behind, because in this Union fighting racism will never be optional. We will improve education and knowledge on the historical, cultural causes of racism. We will tackle unconscious bias that exist in people, in institutions, well, yes, and even in algorithms, and we will appoint the Commission’s first ever anti-racism coordinator to keep this at the top of our agenda and to work directly with people, civil society and institutions.  Honourable Members, I will not rest when it comes to building a union of equality. A union where you can be who you are and love who you want without fear and recrimination.  (Applause) Because being yourself is not your ideology, it is your identity, and no one can ever take it away. So I want to be crystal clear. LGBTQI-free zones are humanity free zones and they have no place in our union.  (Applause) And to make sure that we support the whole community, the Commission will soon put forward a strategy to strengthen LGBTQI rights. As part of this I will also push for mutual recognition of family relations in the EU, because if you are a parent in one country you are of course a parent in every country.  (Applause) Mesdames et Messieurs les députés, voici le monde dans lequel nous voulons vivre, le monde où nous sommes unis, dans la diversité et l’adversité, où nous travaillons ensemble pour surmonter nos différences et où nous nous soutenons dans les moments difficiles. Le monde plus fort, le monde plus respectueux et plus sain de demain que nous construisons aujourd’hui, pour nos enfants. Mais pendant que nous essayons d’apprendre la vie à nos enfants, nos enfants nous apprennent ce qu’est la vie. Cette année nous a montré à quel point cela est vrai. Nous pouvons parler des millions de jeunes qui demandent un changement pour une planète plus saine, ou des centaines de milliers de magnifiques arcs-en-ciel de solidarité affichés dans les fenêtres de toute l’Europe par nos enfants. Il y a une image qui m’est restée en tête au cours de ces six derniers mois, une image qui saisit le monde à travers les yeux de nos enfants. C’est l’image de Carola et de Vittoria, les deux jeunes filles jouant au tennis sur les toits de la Ligurie, en Italie, pendant le confinement. Il n’y a pas que le talent et le courage des filles qui ressort de cette image, c’est surtout la leçon qui se cache derrière, une leçon de ne jamais se laisser bloquer par des obstacles sur notre chemin, une leçon de ne jamais se faire freiner par les conventions et de toujours saisir le moment. Voici ce que Carola, Vittoria et tous les jeunes d’Europe nous apprennent chaque jour sur la vie. Cela, c’est la prochaine génération d’Europe, NextGenerationEU. Et cette année, l’Europe a suivi leur exemple et a fait un bond en avant, ensemble. Quand il fallait trouver une voie pour notre avenir, nous n’avons pas laissé les vieilles conventions nous freiner. Quand nous avons senti la fragilité autour de nous, nous avons saisi le moment pour donner une nouvelle vitalité à notre Union. Et quand nous avons eu le choix de faire cavalier seul, comme par le passé, nous avons utilisé toute la force des 27 pour donner à tous les 27 une chance pour l’avenir. Nous avons montré que nous sommes ensemble dans cette histoire et que nous en sortirons ensemble. Mesdames et Messieurs les députés, l’avenir sera ce que nous en ferons et l’Europe sera ce que nous voulons. Cessons donc de la rabaisser et travaillons pour la construire, pour la faire forte et pour bâtir le monde dans lequel nous voulons vivre. Vive l’Europe! Long live Europe!

Your State of the Union speech today marks the end of the first year of your mandate and the mandate of all of us.  It was for sure a challenging year, but you managed it, and together with the whole Commission team, I want to thank you. I also want to thank the colleagues in the European Parliament, because in the last year we have shown unity and good cooperation in the house, despite all our political differences. We have shown Europeans that we speak with one voice when it matters most. The State of the Union speech is an important point in our agenda, and we as the EPP fully support the main line of your speech. It is about health, migration, the rule of law and a Europe without hate.  I want to focus my contribution on our main title – how can we address the fears of Europeans after the crisis, or during the crisis? How can we answer this? And our main message is that we have to now show credibility.  For the European People’s Party, the headline of the upcoming weeks is jobs, jobs and jobs. Take Italy, where 40% of young people are still unemployed. We can never accept another lost generation in today’s European Union. When we insist on a 5G network for Europe, and a project to fight against cancer, and the idea of a new battery technology, it’s not just about showing EU flags on billboards and how much money we spend, it’s about delivering on jobs.  You can spend recovery fund money only once, and our priority is the future of Europe’s young generation. Let us now use one-third of the recovery funds to finance a pact for European jobs. For us, credibility means immediately starting the digital catch-up. You spoke about this. But, I must ask, where are the initiatives from the Commission? We have had green papers, we have had white papers, but no real progress has been made. And that is what we need. We can probably even have a kind of Digital Act like we do the Climate Act, to prioritise things – investment in infrastructure and investment in technologies.  For us credibility means finalising an ambitious but realistic Green Deal to stimulate new and innovative jobs. For us credibility means screening all EU legislation to check if it stimulates jobs or not. Now is again the time to cut the bureaucratic burden and to reinforce the single market. And credibility means that the recovery fund must protect and support European interests and – let me be frank – not Chinese ones. That’s why we need clear rules. No money from European taxpayers in the pockets of State-owned companies from China. The second point I want to underline concerns the external dimension. Because credibility means that we have to speak with one voice in the world.  Belarus and Russia. 30 years ago, people in Budapest, Dresden and Warsaw went out and fought for democracy and freedom. 12 years ago Kiev and now Minsk. Lukashenko said in an interview a few days ago that if Belarus falls, Russia will fall. I say it in my words: the idea of free people is going to the east and no-one can stop it, neither Lukashenko nor Putin. We are credible, and the people out on the streets in Minsk see that Europe is on their side. After the Navalny case, all options of further sanctions must be on the table: as you yourself said, even stopping the Nord Stream 2 project.  And one word to our colleagues from Front National, Salvini and Syriza. We are here to serve European citizens. A true patriot is never Putin’s puppet. And Turkey is the second subject for External Affairs. While the Greek government is ready to accept the decision of the International Court of Justice on the gas dispute, Turkey is sending warships, is breaking international law in Syria, suppressing free media and stoking religious tensions with its decision on Hagia Sophia.  So I ask, are we credible when Turkey still wants to join the European Union? I say no, that is not credible, and when Erdoğan attacks our family, we – especially the German Presidency – cannot be a fair mediator. We have to be close to our friends in Cyprus and Greece. That is why we are a union of values. And finally, on Brexit, here too the need for credibility is really, really big. It makes no sense to negotiate a future agreement in the face of a British Prime Minister who is throwing out of the window the agreement that he himself signed. Great Britain, you are losing your credibility on the global level. What I can say is that the European Parliament can never vote for any trade agreement with Great Britain if we cannot trust each other.  So the upcoming months will be extremely challenging. They will shape Europe. Let’s show our citizens that Europe shows solidarity and first of all credibility.

We have to make an exact diagnosis so we can get the recipes right. The situation, let's put it plainly, is not good. And it's not, because the pandemic has shaken us unpredictably.  But COVID has also made more clear the need to address other problems that we have been dragging on for a long time. And I am referring, for example, to the common management of migration, which would have saved us the situation and the shameful episode of Moria. I am referring to incomplete instruments for managing the euro. I am referring to own resources which are now minuscule. But there's something we've certainly been right about. The answer to this crisis is not going to be the same as in 2008. Because this time we will give an answer focused on people and solidarity. Not in austerity, not macroconditionality.  This is your first speech, Mrs. Von der Leyen. And I thank you for your efforts to listen to this Parliament. A year ago neither you nor I would have imagined what was going to happen. The great challenge of ecological and digital transformation is now added to the need to address the health, social and economic effects of COVID, which are many, and also to do so in a context of total uncertainty. And if we don't manage it well, we run the risk of fueling anti-European and anti-system discourses.  The Conference on the Future of Europe will begin soon and we need to see what the results are, but we cannot wait for its conclusions. People are waiting for us. Wait for Europe. And the worst thing we can do is disappoint them. We have been talking for decades about own resources and European taxation, the tax on financial transactions, for example. Because it is totally unacceptable that the burden of tax collection in Europe falls on the income and pockets of workers, not on large financial movements and speculators.  There are other proposals we also need to talk about. But we have to decide, because only in this way can we invest in the ecological and digital transition, also taking into account the social dimension, without leaving anyone on the road. Now is the time to invest in that resilient Europe that has been presented to us by the strategic prospect. We are pleased that you have taken on the binding target of reducing at least 55% of greenhouse gases by 2030. My group has been fighting for that for a long time.  But let's not forget that caring for people is also part of sustainability. And now more than ever, we must insist on an anti-poverty strategy, including the Child Guarantee and a Framework Directive for the minimum wage. The German Presidency has taken on our proposal for the minimum income system that we hope will succeed. We must now reform economic governance. Suspending the tax pact until 2022 was a wise decision and we must now also open ourselves to a possible golden rule for sustainable investment. This crisis threatens our societies because it can open up insalvable gaps. Social cohesion is one of our hallmarks, of which we pride ourselves in Europe, and we must protect it.  Just as we must protect a highly punished sector of culture, which is another element of social cohesion as well as shared identity and integration. You referred, Mrs Von der Leyen, to the European Bauhaus and I propose today the creation of a European voucher or cultural card for young and unemployed, in coordination with the Member States. It will be an instrument to strengthen the European cultural fabric and stimulate mature and critical European citizenship. Ladies and gentlemen, there is a fundamental decision which we have pending, quite frankly, and it is that of our values. It is alarming to see the deterioration of the rule of law in some member countries. It's not just worth raising your voice, there have to be consequences. There is no democracy without judicial independence. And it is inadmissible that there are cities in the Union that are declared free of LGTBI. It is a very dangerous drift which must be tackled and we call on the Council to adopt a common position immediately in order to begin negotiating the mechanism of the rule of law.  I said, at the beginning of my speech, that the state of the Union is not good, but also, let me be honest, I do not see any other place in the world where I would like to live right now. Precisely because we have the capacity, values and institutions that can deal with this crisis in a solidarity and effective way, I refuse to resign myself. We refuse to resign ourselves. Citizenship has high hopes placed on us.

Undoubtedly, the recovery plan is a historic step forward and embodies the strength of the Union and our ability to overcome crises together. We have started to build a citizen Europe in the truest sense of the word. Has the voice of nationalists or anti-Europeans been heard in recent weeks? They started to get tangled up in their own arguments that denigrated the European project, and today they have little to say. They want to hide the fact that they need this recovery plan - like all other Europeans - because they also need Europe. Obviously, they will never recognise it, but today it is increasingly clear that the nationalist project remains, slowly, without object, because Europe is doing its job and it is concrete, and it is direct. It is therefore time to be clear when we talk about our values, not just when we want money from the European Union. There is no possible compromise between a Europe of investment or a Europe of values. Europe is not one or the other, it can only be both. The rule of law is not an alternative, it is a key principle including for you, Madam President, for the Commission, for Parliament and for the Council. Because what will happen to the trust of citizens gained these days if, in a year or two, we read articles in the press showing how money from the recovery plan or the future budget is flowing into the pockets of those who have found a vocation of autocratic sown in our Union? Weak justice in a single Member State undermines the credibility of the entire rule of law in Europe. The Council wanted more flexibility in the use of European funds, but the amounts involved are colossal and are debts made on behalf of European citizens. The Union's financial interests must therefore be protected against corruption and conflicts of interest. The rule of law is not abstract and it is your responsibility to stand with Parliament in this fight, as in the fight for own resources, for a new budget, because that is how we are starting to build Europe. Then each of our decisions must enable citizens to gain sustainable prosperity. An important step has just been taken for European climate law with an ambitious target of 55% for reducing carbon emissions. And you have responded here, Madam President, to an impact review request that Renew Europe has made, and I congratulate you, and i thank you for that. It is an exemplary and historic decision that when we make such a decision we also have an impact analysis. We are now waiting for a digital law that paves the way for independence in terms of processors, data encryption, cloud storage, as you said. These everyday technologies determine our future way of life. It would be irresponsible to rely on non-EU states for such strategic things, and I welcome your decision to reserve at least 20% of the budget for this type of investment. The construction of a green and digital Europe must provoke confidence, not fear, but for that, let us build without administrative constraints and without restrictions of freedoms. To create the prerequisites for a positive transition to a new relationship with natural resources through digital, social and economic innovations. Let's build a Europe that doesn't falter in the face of a British prime minister who's starting to lose his landmarks or a Turkish leader who has a visible nationalist fever and a Putin eager to sow discord. A Europe that does not leave behind rural territories with an agriculture in which digital and greening are not there to create red tape, but to generate income for farmers and welfare for the consumer. Madam President, Europe must be a benchmark of stability in the face of citizens' anxiety and provide solutions to uncertainties and fears. We've provided some good answers in the last few months, but the crisis hasn't passed. More than ever, people are waiting for a concrete, reactive and present Europe where needed. We will win if we know how to generate solidarity through what we decide and do.

The proverb applies to them: present, they are absent.\" This quote from Heraclitus, you'd think, Madame von der Leyen, made for you. You have just spoken about the state of the Union, but the state in which the European Union finds itself today is deplorable and, every day, its impotence seems more blatant. The European Union, let us be aware, is already generating sarcasm on the international stage. It not only arouses the distrust of our fellow citizens, but today, exasperation. The legitimate exasperation of the peoples in the face of the unpreparedness and lack of coordination on the health crisis, and also in the face of this complacency of the European institutions, which are always as self-confident. Your European recovery plan is a cyclical, ephemeral, largely inoperative and, above all, very costly, cyclical response. The question, moreover, is not how much we will receive, but how much we will pay and who will pay. Again and again, it is the same people who will pay, the net contributor countries, who, of course, will have to pay much more than they will receive. You mentioned own resources as the silver bullet, but you did not mention them in your long speech a few moments ago. You have incurred, on behalf of our nations, an exorbitant debt of 750 billion euros. But who can believe for a second that a GAFAM tax, a carbon tax or a plastic tax could be able to pay off that debt? You do not provide the timetable, method or guarantee for the refund. You talk about the economic transformations that would be necessary, you add burdens, standards, environmental constraints, especially for our companies, for our industries, for our farmers. They will therefore be less competitive in the face of global competition, all the more fierce as you see Europe as a market totally open to all winds. At a minimum, we should have implemented protections in our market. That is what you refuse to do: even during the health crisis, you continued negotiations towards free trade agreements. We should free up, i.e. facilitate production, creativity, wealth and inventiveness, and protect, including quotas, tariffs and quotas. You do the exact opposite, you constrain inside and you de regulate our borders. The Green Pact for Europe and Next Generation EU are just words. They will not ensure Europe's future, independence and economic prosperity; they will further weaken Europe on the world stage. Where is the European Union now facing the migration challenge? We are waiting, without much illusion, for your immigration pact next week. Again, the observation is damning: asylum has become a full-fledged channel of illegal immigration. Over the past six years, there have been 5.3 million asylum seekers, the vast majority of whom do not meet the asylum criteria. This is as much as the population of Denmark. They don't run away from war, they come for economic reasons and they know that, by your laxity, they will be able to stay. Laxity causes drama and amplifies human trafficking. Every humanitarian tragedy has now become the pretext for ever more laxity. Because you are announcing today that many migrants will be welcomed from Moria, there will be 100 Moria tomorrow. It is the firmness and control of the borders upstream and the systematic expulsion downstream that will protect our nations and above all that will prevent the tragedies and deaths in the Mediterranean. And then, where is the European Union facing China? The health crisis has revealed our dependence, our vulnerability to the Asian giant. Last Monday's summit gave birth to a mouse. Merkel has theorized the policy of the millimetre, but in the meantime, China is moving several kilometers. It conquers our markets and buys our ports and airports. The European Union, on the other hand, gets nothing: nothing on the investment agreement, nothing on human rights, nothing about the environment. You do morals; China, on the other hand, is in politics and it gives you a few crumbs with the agreement on geographical indications. Where is the European Union facing Turkey? Turkey illegally occupies Cyprus, drills illegally, multiplies military maneuvers in the eastern Mediterranean, transforms St. Sophia's Basilica into a mosque and organizes migratory submersion. Meanwhile, we have contributed 50 billion euros over 20 years, through the European Investment Bank, through the European Investment Bank, by the pre-accession, by the immigration control funds, not to mention the customs union, which allows Turkey to trade widely for the European market. In short, Erdogan insults us, despises us and overwhelms us, and you continue to pay. So, Mrs von der Leyen, you said earlier that you refuse Europe first, but then you will have Europe dead. Because the truth is that our competitors and our opponents on the world stage will benefit from this lack of ambition, this lack of will, this inability to shine. You give yourself a good conscience with draconian environmental standards, but you kill our companies. You are raising your conscience by wanting to welcome more and more migrants, but you are threatening the cohesion of our nations and the security of our peoples. You are giving yourself good conscience by giving lessons of the rule of law to The Member States, which have the courage to defend a civilization. You give yourself good conscience through human rights lessons to China to Turkey, and you let them despise us and ruin us. These chin strokes only lead to collective weakening, European impotence.

This is a very shameful state that we’re in. It was exactly the historic experience of people suffering from war, destruction and displacement that motivated Europeans in the first place to build the EU. What a sad moment in our common history that we stand idle in the face of so much suffering on our doorstep. This shameful situation is our collective responsibility as Europeans. Greece has failed for many years to produce conditions in refugee camps that would at least be acceptable. Countries like the Netherlands and Austria told Greece not to allow refugees on the mainland and actively wanted to see terrible conditions in order that it might deter people fleeing from war and terror, and countries like Hungary refused to accept anyone in need.  But it is also true that the EU itself has turned a blind eye, has not insisted and has given up hope. I urge you, Commission President, to take up the fight with the Member States, to make it a top priority to help people in need, and not to give in to this disastrous state we’re in. Let us demonstrate that we are courageous and that we’re wholeheartedly European, and we have demonstrated that we can be courageous and lead the way forward towards progress. Together, the European Union will mobilise the means and funds to counter the worst of the economic effects of the pandemic, proof that we can be a strong union indeed. The agreement of July has a lot of shortcomings, but the signal of sticking together and finding a solution was very important. Now is the time to bring the Recovery Fund, as well as the long—term budget, into reality. Right now we set the standards for how we will spend the money and what we will spend it on. EU funds have to foster EU values and uphold the fundamentals of EU treaties. There can be no discount on the rule of law, not for Hungary, not for Poland, not for any other country.  I want to thank you for your strong words on the rights of LGBTI people and I would like to ask you to follow up on those strong words with a measure that the Commission has in its hands, namely an infringement procedure, because zones free of the essence of humanity cannot be accepted.  (Applause) Public money should also not enhance the climate crisis. This sounds obvious, but unfortunately it is still the case that the EU budget subsidises fossil fuels. The common agricultural policy, as well as the trade policy, finally need to align with the Green Deal and the biodiversity strategy. For the next seven years, we need a European climate budget.  It is good to see, Commission President, that you have set out a new and higher emission reduction target of at least 55%. We welcome that and I’m sure there has been a lot of pressure to try to prevent you from doing so. These new targets are an important step forward, but any greenwashing with creative calculations would render them null and void. Even then, we know from a scientific point of view that at least -55% would not be enough. But luckily we have in this House in our Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI) a good climate law that has been prepared. I hope this will come to a conclusion soon as time is of the essence. The climate cannot be negotiated with so we’d better move fast.  Let me finish by saluting the incredible courage that we see by the people in Belarus, who have demonstrated on the streets of the country in these weeks, especially the women. We see you, we see your wish for freedom, for democracy and to define your own future, and your courage is inspirational. From the freedom fighters in Belarus to the environmental activists in the Amazon, to the democracy protesters in Bulgaria, they are all looking at the European Union to uphold fundamental rights, to defend pluralism and to enforce the highest climate and environmental standards both in Europe and beyond. These are high standards to live by and it is up to all of us to make sure that we fulfil them.

The EU today is in a worse shape than it was ten years ago. I therefore find it rather puzzling that every year over the last decade we have heard from every Commission President that a radiant future is awaiting us and that the days of EU glory are just around the corner, provided of course that the European Commission and the European institutions get more competences. You must be aware, Madam President, that fewer and fewer people across Europe take this message seriously. The European Health Agency, the European Cloud, the European Bauhaus – I wonder if the new European architecture will resemble this building. What a frightening perspective.  Madam President, the gist of your argument today was that the pandemic crisis is a good opportunity to launch ambitious radical programmes, including the Green Deal. I’m sorry to say it, but this is a bad argument. This is bad logic and bad logic generates bad policy. What you are proposing is a great leap forward in a situation in which the future is more precarious than ever. The Green Deal with 55% – why not 60? – is a costly extravaganza, animated solely by a spirit of environmentalist crusade, not by a sober social and economic calculation.  Now a few words on the so-called rule of law provisions. I say ‘so-called’ because it has nothing to do with rule or with law. The whole idea, as you remember, was an iniquitous trick of the previous Commission, in complete disregard of the treaties, with the intention of bullying the governments that dissented from the mainstream. It is not what those governments do, because they don’t do anything objectionable, but what they are. The previous Commission let a malignant genie out of the bottle, a genie of political foul play, and they are not interested in putting it back. This so—called conditionality is another step towards complete lawlessness, the prospect of which makes the majority of my colleagues almost ecstatic.  Madam President, do not be deluded by the sanctimonious rhetoric you hear in this Chamber. As usual, behind sanctimoniousness, there is ugly politics and there is hypocrisy. What this rule of politics amounts to is brutal majoritarianism. The mainstream majority wants to crush every form of dissent. Do not open the door for more instruments of the tyranny of the majority, as you promised you would do. That was the scariest part of your speech. This is already getting uglier and uglier, wider and more mendacious. The European institutions want to switch off the democratically constituted institutions of the nation states. They instigate internal conflicts by endorsing some parties rather than other parties. This is not your business. You shouldn’t do it. This is political arrogance at its worst.  Let me conclude. If we continue – if you and your Commission continue – on the current course, the course espoused by many of my fellow group leaders here this morning, Europe will be wrecked. I repeat, Europe will be wrecked, caught in an ideological pincer movement, orchestrated by green and federalist extremists. Mr Juncker will forever be remembered as the Commission President who lost Britain. You, Ms von der Leyen, must make sure that you are not the President who lost the peoples of Europe. I urge you to work with the Member States, not with the ideologically-driven campaigns masquerading as political groups in this House. Save the European Union from ideology and return it to reality.

Mr President, Madam President von der Leyen, ladies and gentlemen, in describing the state of the Union faithfully and giving it an appropriate political course, we must be clear-headed about the dramatic situation in which it finds itself. However, we must be lucid about the social crisis that is hitting, attacking the first of drudgery, which has become the first sacrificed companies like Sanofi or Auchan, who lay off after having enriched themselves thanks to the pandemic. However, we must be clear-headed about the growing inequality crisis, when the 25 richest billionaires in the world, including many Europeans, saw their fortunes increase by more than 200 billion between March and May. However, we must be clear-headed about the crisis of European solidarity, when a small number of tax havens are plundering their neighbours by organising tax evasion on an industrial scale. However, we must be clear-headed about the accelerating ecological crisis and the proliferation of worrying warning signs: numerous fires, the proliferation of wave heat waves that are becoming more frequent, as this week, and a biodiversity in free fall. However, we must be lucid in the face of the moral crisis that is intoxicating us: it is its own decay that the European Union looks coldly into the flames that are ravaging the Moria migrant camp. However, we must be clear-headed about the crisis of the rule of law that is dividing the European Union, while Poland and Hungary continue to sink into an abject authoritarianism where minorities are in danger. It is this lucidity that you miss terribly, Madame von der Leyen. These crises that you do not see, however, affect the lives of hundreds of millions of women and men who, if they have not elected you, have the right to expect concrete answers from you. In the face of them, uncertainty, Mrs von der Leyen, is the privilege of the leaders because it is a matter of concern that the daily lives of citizens are made. They don't expect empty slogans and can't take any more of your contradictions. Today, you are announcing with great fanfare a new target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030; but it is already well below the 65% scientifically needed to comply with the Paris Agreement. How dare you further weaken this objective by a sleight of hand, by deducting emissions absorbed by carbon sinks, such as forests? This choice is irresponsible, Mrs von der Leyen. To save humanity from global warming, we need to reduce our emissions, not hack the books. You promise industrial sovereignty, but you continue to negotiate free trade agreements with Mexico, China, Mercosur and so many others. You claim to be reviewing the budgetary control mechanism, but you are about to demand that the recipient states of the stimulus package implement yet another austere reforms that no one wants. You borrow the word resilience and talk about new indicators of progress, but your policy is still looking for growth at all costs.  No one is fooled, Madame von der Leyen. If your words change gradually, your recipes remain the same: free trade, austerity and competition, the same recipes that have brought us to the brink. To cope with the urgency of the moment, we must change everything: our only compass must be the ecological and social bifurcation. It must be based on public planning and the massive creation of sustainable jobs in transport, freight, building insulation and energy transition. It must be financed by the restoration of fiscal justice, the taxation of crisis profiteers, the taxation of the greatest fortunes and the end of European tax havens. Mrs von der Leyen, you spoke for more than an hour and twenty minutes during that speech. At no time did you mention tax justice, the taxation of the richest, tax havens in the European Union, which are now plagued by the social justice of this Union. Finally, this bifurcation cannot take place without a contribution from the European Central Bank, at a minimum by cancelling the public debts it holds. It must start now, as part of an ambitious recovery plan in which every euro of public money is conditional on social and ecological counterparties for jobs and climate. That's enough, the blank cheques given to large companies that pollute and lay off to satisfy their shareholders ever more greedy for profits. Once again, let's be clear.\" This bifurcation will not be done by magic, crossing your fingers so that the invisible hand of the market naturally repairs what it has destroyed.

We are convinced that each human being has a solemn dignity that can never be touched, independent of where this individual comes from. Obviously, the Extreme Right has a different view, that there are different types of human beings – 'them and us', and 'they' have to be confronted with hate. But hate has never given any good advice. So we will always insist on the fact that ... (In response to dissent from the floor) ... This makes him angry because we got him on the point where he sees that we have a different soul where that is concerned.  (Loud applause) And that's democracy. That is democracy. He has to bear it. He cannot bear the contradiction that they are preaching hate and we want solutions. We want a constructive approach towards migration because it will always be with us.  (Applause) Therefore this is the right moment for a fresh start on migration. Just two numbers: every year, about two million people come to Europe – two million – and 140,000 refugees. So we should be able to manage that. Two million people are coming to Europe. There's a good reason why. It's because Europe is a wonderful continent that offers a lot of opportunities. This is the normality, and on top of that 140,000 refugees last year. We should be able, we have to be able, to manage that. Therefore, we will put forward the legislation next week. There will be time to discuss it.  The rule of law. With the new report we will put forward before the end of the month, the Commission is taking the most systematic and the most comprehensive approach to the rule of law in our history. Because never before have we looked in such detail at these issues across every country. The report is not just on the judiciary, which is important, but also on anti-corruption, the media landscape, and institutional checks and balances. The report that will be published before the end of this month will show many challenges and then we will have a broad debate here, to really confront that. If it's necessary and we do need new instruments, new tools, well let's address it. This is what we're here for. That's why we do politics here. So that's a chance to move forward on that subject.  You mentioned the NextGenerationEU and the issue of jobs and that every euro can only be spent once – and that is right. And rightly so the demand to make more progress in the digital world. That's why NextGenerationEU will invest 20 percent in the digital – and that's right. We now have a plan, we have clear goals for 2030, we have clear tasks in infrastructure – in terms of data, in technology, we have laws that we want to get in place. This is the time when we need to proclaim the digital, the digital decade for Europe, and get it going! And it was rightly the idea that, in the huge investments we have with NextGenerationEU, we must live up to our responsibilities, that we make these investments precisely, forward-looking and efficient. And, ladies and gentlemen, I have also listened to you. I do not share the gloomy view of the world that you have, but rather I am one of those people who work with hope and who approach tasks with optimism. Ladies and gentlemen, these are, of course, difficult times. But what, in all difficult times, has mostly been the problem that has prevented us from moving forward? Firstly, the inertia of getting out of the current situation and, secondly, the lack of resources. That is different now! We do not want to stay in these Corona times, as we have them now! Nobody wants to stay at this stage. In other words, our own inertia is lifted, and we all know we have to move towards a world of Corona. And now the question is: How do we imagine the world after Corona? I have set out my vision of the world after Corona, and I believe that many in this House share it. And I believe that we have a responsibility – now with the deep conviction that people know that we need to move forward – to show European leadership, to develop European visions that will also show the world of tomorrow, and we have the investment. And to use these investments in a trustworthy, efficient, forward-looking way – that will be our common task. Many different opinions have become visible here – that is the beauty of democracy. Let's argue about it with each other! But I also felt a great broad majority in favour of a common conviction to bring this world forward into a greener world, a cleaner world, a healthier world with a powerful economy capable of to lead the way to the future with the modern technologies we need so that this planet can survive. We want to shape the future together.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Madam President of the Commission, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. In a crisis-ridden world, where nationalism and populism are showing their ugly face, where democracy is under pressure and authoritarianism is growing, it is about nothing more and nothing less than Europe's self-assertion. Today, Madam President of the Commission, you have given an optimistic view of confidence in Europe, and you have our support in this.  Madam President, you will certainly not have expected the Council to share each of your proposals in full. But it is important that, in these difficult times of crisis, we show a clear signal of cohesion and unity. And, of course, that includes the dispute, and we are prepared to do so. Every institution – the Commission, Parliament, the Council – bears its responsibilities, but in the end it must be clear that we are going in one direction, that we can agree on the essential principles.  Madam President, I assure you that, in the rapid conclusion of the largest financial package in the history of a united Europe, we will give you all the support you support in this regard. For we stand by the people who have suffered so massively from this crisis and are still suffering. Aid must arrive where it is most needed, and immediately.  However, Madam President, and here too you have our support, it is not just a question of investing in the old-fashioned. It is about further development, it is about rebuilding Europe, it is about a socio-ecological transformation of Europe. That's why you have our support in strengthening digitalization and climate protection. Climate protection in particular makes it clear that there are still great fears and concerns in our societies. That is why we need socially just climate protection. That is why you have our support here too, Madam President.  Social cohesion in a united Europe must be strengthened. The German Presidency will support you in making decisive progress on the EU-wide framework for poverty-proof minimum wages. For the phrase that nationalists and populists keep trying to convince us that climate protection is a job killer is not true. Climate protection secures future-oriented jobs. But it must be fair climate protection, and you have our support for this too. As you have said, Madam President, the European Union is not primarily an internal market. First and foremost, we are a community of values and a community of law. And this community of law and a community of values applies to everyone. And here we support you in building a stronger legal and value community. We support the introduction of the rule of law conditionality. We support you in establishing a rule of law mechanism, building on the report that we are already looking forward to and which we are eagerly awaiting at the end of September.  You have our support, Madam President, for us to speak with one voice in this crisis-ridden world. You have addressed the major global players – Russia, China, others. The most effective remedy against the poison of division is cohesion. The fact that we are always able to bring about a synthesis between different positions is difficult in the Council, which is difficult in all the institutions, but we are prepared to do so.  And, Madam President, you also have our support in building a migration and asylum policy that is committed to shared responsibility, solidarity and humanity, because migration and flight is not a national test alone, but a global and a European test. Europe is the place where we can all be different without fear. Religion does not count here, it does not count where you come from, who you believe in.

COVID-19 is far from over, the virus continues to determine our daily lives, our lives, our economy. Many of our citizens are unsettled and our economy is under enormous pressure. I think that in times of crisis such as these, it is important – as you mentioned – to build trust and, above all, to set the right priorities. Priority 1 for me is the health of our citizens, and I must compliment the European Commission on this: mobilising EUR 16 billion to develop the vaccine, Madam President, I think that is great, as is your efforts to ensure that the vaccine, if it is then developed, is also made available to our citizens in Europe. Priority 2 must, in my view, be our economy. We have to guide our businesses through the crisis, our businesses are the jobs, our social systems are attached to our farms, our prosperity hangs. The figures I take with me from my home region, which are reflected throughout Europe, are, in my view, alarming. Jobs are being cut without end. In my region MAN 10 000 jobs, Schaeffler, Continental, ... Airbus is cancelling, the airports are largely paralyzed, the exhibition halls are empty, creatives have no work. We're really in the middle of it, and everything's on the run, and I realize it's just the tip of the iceberg.  I believe that Europe has made a powerful contribution to the reconstruction plan, but for me it is now important that we hold back on further regulation and further burdens, especially for our businesses, especially for our small and medium-sized family farms.  I share ambitious climate protection targets, but the details of implementation are important, and I would like to encourage you, Madam President, and the whole Commission, to put in place the mechanisms in the implementation of the Green Deal, the climate protection programme, which will make us successful in Europe.  Rely on market-based instruments, on the expansion of emissions trading, on technology neutrality. Electrification alone cannot be the solution, and above all, take our small and medium-sized enterprises with you.

Madam President, you and your team started this mandate with high ambitions. But then the world was faced with perhaps the biggest health crisis in our history. As COVID—19 began to spread in Europe, everything came to a halt. Now that we have overcome the first shockwave of this pandemic, we have to pick up our momentum again. Not just to overcome this health crisis and protecting and creating jobs, but also by moving forward on other priorities. Take for example the awful scenes in Camp Moria last week, to which we have been referring. This is not the moment to look away, to kick the can that is called ‘migration policy’ down the road once more. This is the moment we have to decide. What is happening on Lesbos is unacceptable and we have a European responsibility to put in place a sustainable migration policy, so that we can avoid unnecessary suffering and so that we can regain control of migration. I am glad to see the Commission will present proposals next week. Last year you said in this House: our greatest achievements have always come when we are bold. And my question will be: will you be bold now? Secondly, the rule of law. How can we lecture other nations on respect for the rule of law, when the rule of law is no longer respected in part of our Union? ‘Rule of law can never be compromised.’ These are your words, and I share them. What will you do to ensure the EU remains a credible ambassador for rule of law in the world? Will you stand with us on having a rule of law conditionality in our new budget? We have an obligation to our voters, to our citizens of the EU, to deal with these and other challenges: the green transition; but also the digital transition – they are equal to me, they go hand in hand – and our foreign policy response that needs to be stronger and bolder in order for the EU to become the geopolitical actor you yourself spoke of last year. We have to show courage to focus on these priorities and set the wheels in motion. Madam President of the Commission, this year is going to be a real test case for you and your team.

Now is the time to start further strengthening the Union, further building the European Union, making it fitter for the future – a Union which is open, which is inclusive, which cares for those in need, and in which we can all strive; a Union in which we are all winning, in which people can strive, in which enterprises can innovate, can develop, in which countries are helping each other.

Without an ambitious budget all our commitments on greening, digital, helping young people, helping farmers, better protecting our borders, remain only empty words. What shall we do?

We must put in place own resources as early as the year 2021 to help pay back for the costs of the crisis and to help deliver to the people what we have promised.

Of course, border-building measures are measures that have also surprised us in the way this has happened. And then, Mrs von der Leyen, like this year, the Commission surprised and baffled us. Astonished, because I think that the pact you initiated with the Franco-German agreement is up to the task. I think the answers in your speech are also up to the task. But we must also see - and I will repeat the elements of lucidity - our fragilities, both institutional, organisational and in the way this crisis has unfolded. We have been elected for a year now and there are few pieces of legislation that have come out of the Commission today. So there was COVID-19, of course, but I do not know which national parliament would wait a year before a legislative programme came. There is therefore an urgent need today and I find in your speech a voluntarism for this future year, which I call for, to accelerate the reforms and accelerate the urgency that we have been carrying since the beginning of this mandate.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "Renew", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Liberals and centrists"}, {"id": 23, "date": "2020-09-16.json", "name": "Gerolf ANNEMANS", "mepid": "124973", "text": "   Mr President, I am angry.

This is the moment when we as Europe have to show that we are ready to help them, and that we’re on their side, step by step. How will we reassure people that there will be an affordable vaccine for all of us who need it? How will we convince people that we will coordinate Member States’ policies better during the next health crisis? The only way to show people we mean it is to maintain budgets that we set aside for EU for Health and Horizon Europe.

If we do not face this fundamental problem, the serious internal divisions, then all our plans will remain a wish.

It is shameful when eu institutions and politicians attack the Member State that successfully defends against the coronavirus epidemic and protects people's lives and health on the basis of junk lies. Secondly, the European Commission should make proposals to end institutional divisions within the Union. Take the initiative so that citizens of all EU Member States can work freely and have the same access to free employment in other countries. The Commission should immediately propose to remove the competitive disadvantages that lead to divisions in legislation that discriminates against small and medium-sized enterprises in Central and Eastern Europe, such as transport and transport. And a decision should be taken immediately on the accession of Bulgaria, Croatia and Romania to Schengen. Despite their decades of EU membership, citizens of these countries are still excluded from the Schengen system. This state is a sad symbol of the Divisions of the Union.

My proposal, Ms von der Leyen, is that you repeat these 75 minutes of your speech, that I liked a lot, in the Council. Because let’s be honest, half of the issues that you raised are in fact blocked in the Council.  When we talk about migration, the tragedy in the Moria camp. That’s the consequence of the impossibility to reform Dublin, to reform the Migration Policy. When we talk about Belarus, it’s 40 days after these elections were stolen by Lukashenko and we are not capable of putting sanctions on the table – 40 days later.  When we’re talking about Turkey drilling in the Eastern Mediterranean, in Greek waters, no sanction, no action at all. When we talk about Hong Kong, when we talk about the minority of the Uighurs, words yes, but sanctions no, action no.  And when we talk about the rule of law inside the European Union, let’s be honest, it’s 5...6 years that we are talking about that here in Europe and in the European Parliament. There are no sanctions against these authoritarian regimes.  So my plea to you, is to repeat this as fast as possible, or in 75 minutes in the Council and let’s make a pact, a deal between us, that that is the priority for 2021 next to the Recovery Fund, Mr Frans Timmermans, and to the Green Deal, naturally. That is the priority. To end unanimity, to have a Magnitsky or Navalny Act as Mr Borrell named it.

Madam President, don't get me wrong, I congratulate you on your entire speech but, in particular, your promise to adjust our competition framework, especially given the international situation which often lacks fairness and a level playing field. Because let's be honest, if we want European companies to produce our green and digital goods and services, they at least deserve a fair chance. For this a revision of our competition and public procurement rules is, according to the PPE Group, long overdue.  – A fair opportunity for companies will ensure the preservation of jobs, jobs that would certainly be lost in the case of a nexit, as Mr Eppink wants. Or didn't he want a nexit? Explain it to me again. In any case, solve the schizophrenia in your own party and in your own head before pointing to others.  And where Mr Eppink performs a ritual dance, I have, as my constituents expect me to, dived into the proposals, and there I see on page 244 of the impact assessment in the Climate Act that, if an average family is reduced by 55% CO2 by 2030, I will save EUR 70 in heating costs, but will lose three to four times that amount to sustainable appliances and the insulation of their homes.  Madam President, this is about the people you spoke about, who, at the end of the month, have 'month' but no money left over and who are worried about their jobs. You can't be green if you're red.

But if 2020 is the year of corona, 2021 must be the year of Europe, the year of optimism, and the year of real solidarity. This is particularly true in the area of migration. People are still dying on our shores. The same Member States are still responsible for a disproportionate number of people. We need to give humans at least the same importance that we in this House give to our fish, our seas and our crops.  The new migration pact must finally make us a Union of shared responsibility.

Is there a Member of the European Parliament here who believes that Turkey's accession perspective is alive? Turkey is in violation of international law. Turkey is violating the arms embargo on Libya. Turkey is violating the rule of law. Turkey is turning world heritage sites into mosques. Turkey threatens the sovereign rights of two Member States. It is time to lead Turkey, as the European Union, to comply with the rule of law. It is time to lead Turkey, as the European Union, to comply with international law. The second brave decision is real solidarity for the refugee. You will indeed bring the new package. But this new package must include mandatory sharing of responsibilities, as there are countries that bear the fruits of the European Union, are controlled for the application of the rule of law, and at the same time do not apply any of the rules of solidarity. As Europeans we need rules — solidarity rules — and we need to implement them. And the third decision concerns our strategic autonomy.

However, the European Union is at a turning point today.  In the first weeks of the pandemic, many asked whether the European Union would emerge from this crisis, changed or not even come out. In a short time, the coronavirus has jeopardised the European Union's heritage built over the past decades.  With your State of the Union address, you offered reasons for new European optimism as an upgrade of the agreement reached this summer and the high expectations of citizens who are very much feeling the effects of unprecedented economic woes in recent times.  Let's take advantage of the crisis, deliver on the green deal, continue the digitisation process, start the Health Union, invest more in science and research, relying on a strong cohesion policy.

It shows all the ideas, all the projects and all the demands. It also reveals a lot about this period of uncertainty and change we are in.  I listened carefully to your demands, to your fears, to your anxieties and questions, because your voices are the voices of the European people that you represent. So thank you very much for this enormously inspiring debate over many hours. I heard what you said on the urgent need to come forward with a European solution to Europe's challenge on migration, and I think I heard the message – like my message – that we need to step up. All of us. As I said, next Wednesday the Commission will come forward with a new pact on migration. At the heart of it is a commitment to a more European system. I can announce that we will abolish the Dublin Regulation and we will replace it with the new European migration governance system. It will have common structures on asylum and return and it will have a new strong solidarity mechanism.  I'm very looking forward to the debate. Let's discuss this. There will be points where we agree and there will be points where we disagree. I heard very interesting proposals that we should take into account. I know that I'm partly preaching in the wrong church when I say that, at the very end, the most important part is that we come to a result, but I know that the German Presidency, at our side, also wants a result on the topic migration. So I'm looking forward to the next days and weeks, when we're going to discuss that subject. On the subject of climate protection – I have heard the Chinese proverb very well, and I quote my colleague: 'Demand a lot from yourself, expect little from the others'.  When I take the first part, I can fully sign it: \"Demand a lot of yourself\". It is right that we must show that it is possible to operate successfully without over-exploitation of our planet.  I am counting on the strength of our engineers, our small and medium-sized enterprises, which have often been rightly mentioned today and who can show that innovation and climate protection can go hand in hand. Mr Pieper was right to ask that small and medium-sized enterprises be given their space in these discussions. We are fully aware that it is only possible for small and medium-sized enterprises. It will not be a matter of small and medium-sized enterprises, only small and medium-sized enterprises. But conversely, we also know that small and medium-sized enterprises are the backbone of our economy, and that small and medium-sized enterprises are characterised by this ability to innovate in the many, many fields, in niches, which will then lead us to be the world market leader in these niches. So use these innovations, use niches, move forward, that is the sign of our small and medium-sized enterprises, and that is what we are counting on here too in the progress we need.  We can show that the circular economy works. We can show that production without greenhouse gas emissions is possible. Today, the term 'hydrogen' has often been rightly used, the lighthouse projects that we will launch together. When it comes to the second part of the proverb 'Expect little from the others', I no longer agree with it. We have to expect a great deal from the others, which means that I do not deny that a maximum of 10% of greenhouse gas emissions are from us Europeans. But the other way around, it becomes a shoe. If we take the carbon border adjustment mechanism, the carbon border adjustment mechanism: I would prefer it not to be introduced, namely that other countries that export to us – that is, we import here – that other countries set up their ETS system, their emissions trading system so well that they would like to put the price on CO2, that other countries are keeping this money at home. , and we do not have to use a carbon border adjustment mechanism to put the barrier that we do not have a carbon leakage.  Other countries must also lead the way, but we currently have the technological leadership in Europe, and I am counting on that, because I firmly believe that humanity will do everything possible to stop this deadly climate change. We know what will happen if we don't stop it – it was rightly said, \"The planet doesn't mind in the end, but humanity on the planet?\" If we want to stop this climate change, it will be about these new technologies. Then I want Europe to be at the forefront, for Europe to export these technologies to the world, for Europe to be able to show that it works, and for us to be the exporter. China is now introducing an emissions trading system, they have and that's good – experience gained with it, that's the step in the right direction.  If we show that we can have a successful internal market, a successful European social market economy, with simultaneous climate protection, with the transformation through the European Green Deal and the digital, then we are on the right track. On the subject of NextGenerationEU, the comment came from Sweden: why should the Swedes actually do this, support NextGenerationEU? \"Why give money?\" was about the sentence. Well, I just want to answer that I met with CEOs from Sweden. One CEO from a very well—known car company explained to me that his car company is actually very important in Sweden. It's a car company that is giving its share to the prosperity of the country and is creating good and qualified jobs.  But he told me that his company cannot build a single truck in Sweden on its own because it needs spare parts from other EU Member States and it needs supply chains all over Europe. So it is in the common interest of Sweden and the European Union that we bounce back to prosperity and restore the supply chains. This is going to pay back Sweden a thousand fold, and is the right investment to make. So this should be the answer we give to the question that was raised. Throughout history, wars and pandemics have changed the course of the world. That is certainly true for our continent and it will certainly be true for this pandemic. In front of us is the opportunity of a lifetime to shape that change. The change will happen, but let's shape that change and not be shaped by it. But we can only do that if we do this together. What I heard today was – not in all cases but in the vast majority of cases – most encouraging. I invite all of you to embark on this historic journey together. You listened to me – for quite a while, I know – and I listened to you. I think we have a plan, we have the investment and I think this will now be the year of implementation, implementation, implementation. For me this is the most important part now. Many times have I heard: 'yes, the concept is right, yes, they are good ideas, yes, you have a roadmap, yes you have the investment, now implement, deliver, deliver, deliver'. Our duty is to design our destiny and I want to go on this journey together with you.

Implementing the rule of law criteria is an issue on which the Commission is not credible. I just want to remind you that the MFF proposal which was brokered by the Commission and the Council was rejected by this Chamber exactly on that ground and for that reason. We have so many times heard your words on no compromise on rule of law that we all know it by heart and we are somewhat bored of it. I’m also happy to hear that the Commission is going to compile a report on rule of law and I will be very happy to read it and I will be very glad to come back here and debate it. But I’m afraid that it will have absolutely nothing new to say to me on my country at least, Hungary, where my country stands on rule of law. The criteria that you have set out – judicial independence, press freedom, institutional checks and balances, corruption – I can tell you exactly where Hungary stands on this subject and on this issue and you can save your time and energy.  This week I was very happy to come here and listen to the Commission Vice-President Věra Jourová stand up for linking EU funds to rule of law, saying who doesn’t understand the talk about values will understand the language of money.

Mrs von der Leyen, you gave us a very pathetic State of the Union address here today. There is no doubt that this titulation of your speech is done with care. In the end, however, it is just another shameless label fraud by the Commission. The bond is clear: it is a transfer of the speeches to the State of the Union as we know it from the President of the United States, or the State of the Nation speeches, as European Leaders sometimes make. There is only one crucial catch to be taken by this choice of words: the United States of America is a state, Germany, France and Italy are states. But the European Union is not a state, and you, Mrs von der Leyen, are not A Head of State, and if you would like to be one. You can still make so many long state of the Union speeches.  And I assure you that we will fight your far too advanced request to develop the EU into a separate state, including its own exploitation rights of citizens, by granting taxation powers and, more recently, debt powers. Please remember, the EU is not a state, and we will work, with everything in our capabilities, to ensure that it never becomes one. If, in the usual hypocrisy of this House and the Commission, you therefore tell us that we are opponents of Europe or that we are even enemies of Europe, then I would like to say to you: we are not the real enemies of Europe here, no, you are! For the ideals on which our wonderful and diverse continent is historically and culturally based are the ideals of freedom and democracy. You trample both of these things underfoot here through your superstate fantasies with the appropriate power over the citizens of Europe.  You are currently using the Corona crisis, which is indeed a crisis, but by no means such an unprecedented disaster as you would like us to tell us, specifically to the presumption of ever more competences at EU level, where they are in no way justified. COVID-19 is really very convenient for you. You are talking about an unprecedented counter-attack in an unprecedented crisis. They find in it the welcome opportunity for ever more communitarization.  You are talking about a recovery fund – a recovery fund – as if we were at the end of a disastrous war with devastated cities and millions of deaths to be mourned, as was the case in 1945. That is nonsense! It is a deliberate, deliberate oversubscription of this crisis, which we actually have through COVID-19 and, by the way, also through completely excessive lockdowns of economic life. Your so-called counter-taxes through debt and taxation, Madam President of the Commission, will not help us out of the crisis. On the contrary, I say to you that it will exacerbate the crisis, because it leads us on a completely wrong, socialist path.

First of all, in order to give credibility to all this project and to all this amount of money committed on behalf of Europeans, I think we have to insist on two main things, and you mentioned this in your intervention today. First of all, to clearly connect money with values, resources with values. This is an important pillar for a real European Union and second to reinforce new own resources. This is the only way to build a real European project.  We expect very clear results in this direction. I hope that the Commission will be on behalf of Parliament in order to fight for that.

This Europe, ladies and gentlemen, we had it at the beginning of the health crisis: the Europe of everyone for themselves, of everyone at home, of withdrawal and minimal cooperation. I do not think the record has been very satisfactory. However, we must be clear-headed, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen: the failure of this Europe of withdrawal has not, as if by magic, restored confidence in the integrated Europe that you are proposing to us. But today, I join you, there is a historic opportunity for Europe to prove that it can be an ambition and a solution for the future, not a utopia of the past. You had a proactive speech, which I salute. You had a speech with many ambitions, many of which meet those of our group. Our role from now on will be to implement this very ambitious roadmap. Be careful, the task will not be simple. Our citizens expect concrete, visible, rapid action that addresses their concerns, not just good intentions. We will therefore have to ensure first of all budgets that will enable us to achieve these ambitions in terms of solidarity and strategic autonomy. Let me express some doubts about the current forecasts, which are very much dependent on the Member States. I am thinking in particular of defence, which unfortunately has not been much discussed today. I am also thinking of agriculture, which has not been much discussed other than by the Green Pact for Europe, but which is the basis of our food autonomy and this is something we must not sacrifice. Madam President, we will have to work today on the rapid implementation of this roadmap and we will have to make sure that the budgets follow and, I must conclude on this, that we will not make a policy out of touch with reality.

By giving up even more of national sovereignty, more spending, more climate policy and, of course, more migration. Corona made it clear that the EU needed a common health and social policy. The EU must also tighten up its climate protection policy and reduce its CO2 emissions by 55% by 2030 rather than by 40%. It is not mentioned that the EU contributes less than 10% to global CO2 emissions. The EU also wants to protect the rule of law. This means: measures of Poland and Hungary, as well as moralizing devaluation of the powers of China and Russia. And finally, a commitment to migration. Migration has always existed in Europe, it has defined us and shaped our culture. Migration enriches us. Not a word, however, about the cultural and financial costs.

The Swedish labour market model, which means that independent parties set wages through collective agreements, has over the years yielded good returns for both employees and employers in Sweden. In Sweden, we should not have political interference in wage formation. We Swedish Social Democrats want to actively contribute to work in the EU to strengthen the social partners and to build functioning collective agreements systems in more countries. We can also support recommendations to countries with minimum wage schemes.

We have a duty to give an unprecedented economic response. The financial incentive must reach European people and economies quickly. Only with concrete measures that promote sustainable recovery and growth will we be able to overcome this crisis. It is therefore absolutely necessary to protect the weakest by strengthening social support and a commitment to creating a minimum wage throughout the European Union. Ensure financial support for the digital transition and strengthen the commitment to decarbonisation of the European economy by 2050 at the latest. Finally, there is an urgent need to address the demographic challenge we face. We will continue to make efforts to emerge from this pandemic stronger and with a robust and more coordinated European strategy. The goal? This remains the same: building a more united, more supportive, stronger and more democratic Europe.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 1, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 103, "date": "2020-09-16.json", "name": "Eva MAYDELL", "mepid": "98341", "text": "  in writing. – During Commission President Ursula von der Leyen’s State of the European Union speech, I was pleased to see ambitious and concrete actions regarding digital and technology policy.

Both the Commission and the Parliament make bold proposals, then go into wait—and—see mode while Member States palaver about the issues.

On behalf of the European Parliament, during this critical period, there was prompt cooperation in adopting the first measures to support the Member States.

Health, which has been a third-rate area for the EU as a member state's competence. However, the coronavirus has shown that without health systems that can provide strong and quality care, there is no health, but there is no economy that can be operated predictably. This is a life-changing time when radical transformations are being made: the imbalance between member states' health systems cannot be maintained any longer.

For the future of Europe, we have four major challenges to solve this autumn. The key is to boost sustainable economic growth and competitiveness. After the acute coronavirus crisis, Europe faces a major economic challenge. Just as Ursula von der Leyen outlined, in order to boost growth, it is important to dismantle red tape for businesses and barriers to the internal market, to strengthen capital markets and to invest in the Green Deal and digitalisation. At the same time, the most important foundation of the European Union must be ensured: common values. Democracy, freedom and the rule of law must be ensured in all EU Member States. We must also be able to find a common line on immigration policy. We can't afford to fail again. The fourth essential theme is the common foreign and security policy. The Union is too slow and sluggish here, as seen in recent events in Russia and Belarus. In international crises, faster responsiveness is needed. Foreign policy decision-making must therefore be changed and made more effective by increasing qualified majority voting. This year was supposed to be a big year for the European Union in climate policy. Although the coronavirus crisis has taken up a lot of time and energy, the European Union must remain committed to being climate neutral in 2050.

Although the President of the Commission has had many words of praise for the EU, the problems of our Union cannot be denied, whether within it or at its external borders. While the clear commitments expressed in the speech to an anti-racist Union, equal rights for LGBTI people and a human rights-centred foreign policy have given hope, the half-hearted lip service to the much-needed asylum reform, and the equally urgent conditionality for disbursement of EU funds, have not been able to convince that these words will actually be followed by deeds with their hands. There were clear words in the pleas about strengthening borders, improving repatriations and combating smugglers, while I sorely missed them in terms of human rights protection for refugees or the rule of law. In the end, President von der Leyen's speech was like the state of the Union itself: full of light and shadow.

Yesterday, weather records were broken here in Belgium. 35° of heat is not normal and we know that 40% of emissions that cause this come from buildings. With the right investment, buildings can reduce emissions rather than raise them.  The report says we must fight energy poverty by working with neighbourhoods and communities to ensure healthy and safe living conditions and ensure affordability. We must raise national targets and revise the energy efficiency directives and the energy performance of buildings directives and binding minimum energy performance standards are required. We also require integrated renovation programmes, a holistic approach from rooftop solar and e-mobility, from heat pumps to district heating is required. So let’s use recovery funds for the renovation way.  I endorse the President’s call for a new Bauhaus. As an architect, I welcome this.

The text we will be voting on today and tomorrow reflects our common desire to provide concrete answers not only to patients, families, but also to health professionals who are affected by these drug shortages. This crisis has highlighted our growing dependence on third countries, mainly China and India, and the concentration of supply in the hands of a few suppliers. We discover, barely late, that public health has become a geostrategic weapon capable of bringing a continent and beyond to its knees. If health is the responsibility of each member state, it is up to the European Union to coordinate and complement these national actions. I welcome the announcements made this morning by President Ursula von der Leyen, who wants to build a true Europe of health. I call on the Commission and the Member States to accept our proposals in this direction. They are based on three pillars: more cooperation, coordination and harmonisation. In particular, we propose the creation of a European emergency pharmacy and a common basket of priority medicines and vaccines, the extension of the competences of the European Medicines Agency to make it the regulatory authority guaranteeing greater transparency in the distribution chain, but also at the level of The Member States' stocks, the repatriation to Europe, where possible, of all production lines , through tax and financial incentives, and finally the creation of one or more European non-profit pharmaceutical establishments, capable of producing medicines that are often essential, but which are neglected by manufacturers, for lack of profitability.  At the same time, of course, we must make Europe the drug continent of the future, investing heavily in research and innovation and diversifying our resources. In the European Parliament, we have taken on our responsibilities: we have worked together to provide answers. I now call on the Member States to do the same and to act collectively.
