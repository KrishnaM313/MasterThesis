Five weeks ago you as citizens used your right to vote and elected us as your representatives. You have given us the mandate to shape the future of this House, and also the future of the European Union, and I want to thank you for putting your trust in this institution. But you have also given us a very clear message, and the message is that the European project is very much alive. You, the voters, have answered the hateful and divisive rhetoric of the populist right with a clear pro-European message, and I thank you for that.  (Applause) Dear colleagues, the past elections have seen an increased voter turnout, and this is a very encouraging sign, but it also means responsibility to us as the European Parliament. Thanks to the voters, we now have a strong mandate to decide on the future of Europe and to hold the Commission and the Member States accountable. And as parliamentarians we have received a mandate to strengthen the European Parliament as an institution. And I say: let’s strengthen the Parliament today and let’s strengthen it together by electing a Parliament President that embodies the independence of our institution. We cannot accept that the Presidency of this House is being treated as a bargaining chip in old-school backroom Council negotiations. This is not the signal we need to send to the citizens.  There can be no doubt the European Union is more important than ever. In the wake of climate crisis, growing social inequalities and international confrontation, we need Europe more than ever. But as EU institutions we haven’t always been very successful in reaching out to the citizens and telling them, convincing them, that we are actually working for them, addressing the issues that are most important to them. And as President I want to renew the trust and I want to make sure that the European Parliament is the space where citizens are discussing. In the past few years we have been having debates on the future of Europe with heads of state and government, with presidents and so on, and this has been very interesting. But why not now change the direction and say “we’ll open the House and discuss the future of the European Union with the citizens, with civil society, with the people that shape our continent today”?  In Parliament we clearly defend human rights, democracy, the rule of law, and as Parliament President I want to be the ambassador for exactly those values and principles. And in order also to be credible as an institution we need to work, always and every day, to make sure we are fulfilling the principles that we ask others to fulfil, be it transparency, be it gender equality, be it inclusion, workers’ rights, and also reducing our ecological footprint. And, dear colleagues, the European Union is the biggest historic achievement of our continent. It has ensured peace, friendship and prosperity on a continent that used to be dominated by war and by hatred. As elected Members of the European Parliament we have a shared responsibility to honour and to defend this historic achievement that we have inherited. I was born in a country that was divided by the Iron Curtain. I have lived on the border between Poland and Germany. I have seen for myself what it means when Europe brings people together, when Europe overcomes borders in the mines and on the ground. And I see also for myself a personal responsibility to defend that European heritage.  In order to defend Europe we also need to show the courage to change it for the better and, as the only directly elected EU institution, the European Parliament has a key role in making this leap forward. This House has been for many years fighting to defend and increase our rights as Parliament, because that means increasing the rights and representation of the citizens, the citizens who elect us, who send us to this Chamber. And to continue this work on parliamentary rights, I am running today for the honour of chairing this Parliament and I would be grateful for your support.

We have presented this candidacy from the conviction that while some groups and governments in Europe have marketed with armchairs, life out there and the future of millions of people depend on the decisions we make in this Parliament. That is why it is imperative for us to talk about which side the person presiding over this House will be on in the coming years. Are you still going to be on the side of lobbies and multinationals? Will he be on europe's side of the walls? Will he continue to feed the monster of neophasicism? Or, as we want, will it be placed once and for all on the side of peoples, workers and human rights?  Of course, we are defending a Parliament that responds to the needs of our peoples, which sticks its mandate to popular sovereignty and, above all, that works to ensure that the European Union stops progressing at the expense of the exploitation of the planet's workers and natural resources.  We are aware that the EU's economic policies have left entire countries unwell. In Spain, greece or Portugal we have suffered especially. The neoliberal doctrine on which the European Union has been built creates suffering, generates unemployment, generates precariousness and creates inequality. These policies are taking us into a life without a future and a life without hope, and not just in economics.  These same policies and the productive and consumption model they entail are also co-responsible for the ecosocial crisis and the climate emergency that our planet is living in. To deny this is to cheat. The green varnish that the European Union applies to its policies is not going to solve a problem which we are already clearly going to suffer in each of our states. We believe that this should be one of the main issues addressed by this House and that is why we ask you to support our proposal to set up a special commission on climate emergency. It's a must now. But there's more. It is the neoliberal policies of this European Union that engender the monster of fascism. Here are sitting the far right and also those who assume their xenophobic, racist and sexist policies. We are not going to allow this Parliament to normalize hate speech or justify the violation of human rights by hiding in a cheating security speech. Carola Rackete was arrested a few days ago. A life-saving heroine in the Mediterranean, no less than Mr Salvini wants to criminalize her work. That is why we propose that, from now on, this Parliament should provide protection and legal cover to anyone who is persecuted for saving lives.  And I, who come from the south, from the country of 8 M, from the country that by the time we stop women, I know, we know, that feminism is the great antidote to stop fascism. We know he's coming to challenge everything. And it proposes an absolutely new society. We call on governments and the European Commission to stop misleading us. Women do not settle for quotas, we want feminist policies, we want to turn life and care into a political category, and that is why we will demand that feminism be present on the agenda of the institutions and this Parliament not as a label, but as a matrix on which to build our societies.  We want to make visible the stories of the invisible women who endured on their shoulders the construction of our countries. Even if history is about erasing ourselves, we are the ones who hold the foundations of our societies.  Today we show up here knowing which side we're on. Here and now we defend the rights of our people, of people who make a living from their work and their efforts. For this reason, we remember and make our own fraternal and anti-phasical Europe. That of the French resistance led by Spanish republicans in the liberation of Paris; That of Manolis Glezos ripping off the flag of Nazi barbarism from the Acropolis of Athens; the one on 25 April that broke free from the tyrant to the sound of Grandola, Vila Morena, that of the Italian partisans of Bella Ciao who turned Mussolini face down. That's the Europe we're calling for. But moreover, we vindicate the struggles of the present and recognize ourselves in them. The dignity of The Sea Watch and Open Arms activists who rescued people from the fortress Europe. We recognize ourselves in the mobilizations of young women who defend their right to the future on a living planet. The Europe of feminism that comes to change everything; that is why we are committed to this Parliament building a Europe of peace, a europe of solidarity, that no one is left behind. Upstairs the ones who fight!

We are faced with decisive challenges, which will put us to the test in the near future, also threatening the very idea of the European Union, challenges that we could only face if we remain united, if we manage, while respecting our differences, to make the most of our legislative function as a budget, control and political direction.  I want to be the representative, with you, of our differences and of our ability to decide, in order to affirm the centrality of Parliament, its autonomy and the value of the democracy it represents. We must all be, however we think so, committed to really building the house of European democracy, and this Parliament must be the home of European democracy. The elections were a success of participation! Let us face it: we, who were very committed to the elections, did not expect this either, because so many new voters went to the polls for the first time, a strong novelty that is also reflected in this House: the new Members represent 62% of the total, a very high percentage of new energy. The voters have given us a mandate, telling us that they believe in our institution, that they believe in democracy, in free elections. We cannot disappoint them, and this Parliament and this legislature must interpret and guide the possible and necessary change in order to make Europe stronger and more modern.  We must restore trust, mutual trust between citizens and institutions. And this is where all our ambition and courage will serve to meet the great challenges of climate change, social justice, the governance of migration policies, growth, work and conditions of equal opportunities and rights for all.  If you want to give me your confidence as President, we will fight together for a modern, more transparent, eco-sustainable and citizen-friendly Parliament. I will make every effort to ensure that Parliament is respected: yes, respected by states and institutions.  You, ladies and gentlemen, are here because you represent the hope – including anger – of our citizens, but certainly the emotions, the feelings of the peoples of Europe, and I will always be at your disposal: I will listen to you, I will cooperate with you very carefully, because that means listening at all times to the breath and will of the women, men and young people who have extraordinary opportunities in this Europe. Think, they can travel, they can fall in love without constraint. I will be the guarantor of an open, direct and plural debate, but always with full respect for the opinions of all of you and, of course, for the prerogatives of Parliament, because it is in this House – you are in this House and we often do not realise it – that our independence is protected.  \"Nothing is possible without men, nothing lasts without institutions.\" I believe that Jean Monnet's appeal is still very topical today.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 6, "date": "2019-07-03.json", "name": "Jan ZAHRADIL", "mepid": "23712", "text": "   – Mr President, for those fellow MEPs who don’t know me yet, I’ve been sitting in this Parliament since 2004 and I have lived through five Presidents of the European Parliament already. That gives me a certain experience, I hope, and a certain expertise to understand what this Parliament could do and should do, what could be improved, and maybe changed, and what Parliament’s President should or shouldn’t do.  I believe that this expertise and this experience also tell me what makes a good President of the European Parliament. I believe that a good President of the European Parliament should be non-partisan, neutral and impartial. He or she should treat all Groups and all individuals in this Parliament equally, fairly and with respect, and the person should always remember that he or she doesn’t represent just himself or herself but this Parliament in its entirety, and I stress ‘in its entirety’. I had a certain advantage in starting my campaign a little bit earlier so I have produced this leaflet with that very nice guy on the front page. It’s already been sent to you via email so I hope that at least some of you have had the chance to read it. I talk there about how to regain trust in this Parliament, how to have an open and fair Parliament, how to listen and to respond to the concerns of our citizens, how to have a more efficient and less wasteful Parliament, and also how to come with some strategic oversight for the future. First and foremost, I speak in that set of principles about restoring balance. I believe that we should – and we must – restore the balance between the European level and the national level which enables us to work together, and also restore or find a new balance amongst our institutions – the European Parliament, the European Council and the European Commission – which will stop institutional infighting and will start a new level of cooperation. Mentioning balance, I probably should not forget to mention one other aspect of that balance. Since 2004, over the last 15 years, 13 new member countries have joined the European Union, 11 of them from the central and eastern European region and, as far as I know, I am the only person from that part of Europe applying for any top job in the European Union. I think we also need that kind of balance.  One third of EU Member States are not part of the euro area and I am, as far as I know, the only candidate applying for a top EU job who comes from a non-euro area country and I believe that we also need that kind of balance. Last, but not least, there are big states, big nations, great nations, but also small or midsize nations. I believe – if I am not wrong – that apart from Belgium, I am the only representative of a small or midsize nation who is applying for a top job in the European Union. I believe that we also need that kind of balance. So, Ladies and Gentlemen, I can only kindly invite you to vote for me and, in return, I can promise you that I will deliver you a good European Parliament President. Thank you in advance for every vote.

Allow me to thank President Antonio Tajani for the work he has done, for his great commitment, and for his dedication to this institution. (Sustained applause) I would also like to welcome the confirmed Members and women, who represent 40 % of us all.  (Applause) At the moment, at the end of an intensive election campaign, a parliamentary term begins which events bear great responsibility, because no one can be content with preserving the existing one: the election result tells us this and the composition of this House also testifies to this. We are immersed in epochal transformations: youth unemployment, migration, climate change, the digital revolution, new world balances, just to mention some of the great issues that, in order to be all governed, need new ideas, the courage to be able to combine with great wisdom and the utmost audacity. We must recover the spirit of the founding fathers, the spirit of Ventotene, of those who were able to put aside the hostilities of war and put an end to the breakdowns of nationalism, giving us a project capable of combining peace, democracy, rights, development and equality. In these months too many have bet on the decline of this project, also fuelling divisions and conflicts that we thought were a sad reminder of our history. Instead, the citizens have shown that they still believe in this extraordinary project, the only one capable of giving answers to the global challenges, to the challenges we face. We must have the strength to relaunch our integration process, changing our Union in order to make it capable of responding more strongly to the needs of our citizens and to giving real answers to their concerns, to their growing sense of bewilderment. The defence and promotion of our founding values of freedom, dignity and solidarity must be pursued every day inside and outside the European Union.  Ladies and gentlemen, we think more often of the world that we have a duty to live and the freedoms we enjoy. So let us say it, because to others, to the east, to the west, to the south, to recognize that so many things make us different, not better but different, and that we Europeans are proud of our differences. Let us repeat it: so that it is clear to everyone that no government in Europe can kill – and this is not a platitude: the value of the person and his dignity are our way of measuring our policies; that no one in Europe can blind their opponents, that our governments and our institutions that represent them are the fruit of democracy of free choices, of free elections; that no one can be condemned for their religious, political, philosophical faith; that here girls and boys can travel, study, love without constraint; that no European can be humiliated or marginalised for their sexual orientation; that in the European Area, in different ways, social protection is part of our identity. Our model of a social market economy must be relaunched. Our economic rules must be able to combine growth, social protection and respect for the environment. We must equip ourselves with appropriate instruments to combat poverty, to give prospects to our young people, to relaunch sustainable investment, and to strengthen the process of convergence between our regions and territories. The digital revolution is profoundly changing our lifestyles, our way of producing and consuming: we need rules that combine technological progress, business development, protection of workers and people.  Climate change exposes us to enormous risks, which are now obvious: we need investment in clean technologies, to respond to the millions of young people who have taken to the streets and some have come here too, to remind us that there is no other planet. We must work towards ever greater gender equality and an increasing role for women at the top of politics, the economy and social dumping. Ladies and gentlemen, this is our calling card for a world that has no rules but that has to find rules and that we want to help to have Rules. But none of this happened by accident. The European Union is not an accident in history.  I am the son of a man who fought against other Europeans at the age of twenty. I am the son of a mother, who also left her home at the age of twenty and found refuge with other families. I know that this is also the story of many of your families. And I also know that if we shared our stories and told them to each other over a glass of beer, we would never say that we are children or grandchildren of a history incident, but we would say that our story is written about the pain, the blood of young Britons exterminated on the beaches of Normandy, the desire for freedom, Sofia and Hans Schöll. , on the anxiety for justice of the heroes of the Warsaw Ghetto, on the spring being repressed with tanks in our eastern countries, on the desire for fraternity that we find whenever moral conscience dictates not to give up one's humanity and obedience cannot be considered a virtue. We are not an accident of history, but the children and grandchildren of those who have managed to find the antidote to that nationalist degeneration that has poisoned our history: if we are Europeans it is also because we are all in love with our countries. But nationalism that becomes ideology and idolatry produces viruses, which can produce destructive conflicts. Ladies and gentlemen, we need vision, and that is why we need politics. We need european parties that are increasingly capable of being the lintel of our democracy. But we must also give them new instruments: the ones we have are insufficient. This parliamentary term must strengthen the procedures for making the European Parliament the protagonist of a complete European democracy. But let's not start from scratch. We're not born out of nowhere. Europe is founded on its institutions which, although imperfect and to be reformed, have guaranteed us our freedoms, our independence. With our institutions we will also be able to respond to all those who are committed to dividing us. So let us say it today in this House, at the beginning of this parliamentary term, that the European Parliament will guarantee the independence of European citizens and that only they are empowered to write their own destiny. No one for them, no one for us.  In this House, together with many colleagues with a great deal of experience, there are also many Members in the first parliamentary term. I offer them a cordial welcome greeting. I have read many of their biographies and convinced myself that this is a very positive presence. 63 % of this Parliament is made up of members of parliament from the first parliamentary term. Many of them are engaged in social activities, they have great skills, great professionalism. Many are also committed to protecting people. This is an area on which Europe must improve because we have a duty to govern new phenomena. On immigration, for example, there is too much blame between governments, and every time something happens we are unprepared and we start all over again.  Ladies and gentlemen of the European Council, this Parliament believes that the time has come to discuss the reform of the Dublin Regulation, which this House proposed by an overwhelming majority in the last parliamentary term.  (Applause) By an overwhelming majority.  (Applause) You owe it to the citizens of Europe who are calling for more solidarity between the Member States. But you also owe it to poor people, for that sense of humanity that we do not want to lose and that has made us great in the eyes of the world. Much, gentlemen of the Council, is in your hands and with responsibility you cannot continue to postpone decisions, fuelling mistrust in our communities, with citizens continuing to ask, with every emergency: 'where is Europe? What Does Europe Do.\" This will be a test to overcome and defeat so many laziness and too much selfishness. And again. Parliament, the Council and the Commission must feel the duty to respond more courageously to the questions of our young people when they loudly ask that we should wake up, open our eyes and save the planet. I say to them: consider this Parliament, which is starting its work today, as your point of reference. Help us too to be bolder, to face the challenges of change.  I want to assure the Council and the rotating presidencies of our utmost cooperation, and I would like to send the same message to the Commission and its President: the European institutions need to think again and not to be seen as an obstacle to the construction of a more united Europe. Through the President of the European Council, I would also like to greet the Heads of State or Government on behalf of this House: 28 countries that make the European Union great. And these are 28 states, from the largest to the smallest, that hold unique treasures in the world. Everyone's from afar. They have culture, language, art, landscape and poetry that are inimitable and unmistakable. They are our great heritage, a heritage that deserves everyone's respect.  That is why when I visit them on your behalf I will never be distracted and in front of their flags and their inns I will be on the watchful hand, even on behalf of those in this House who do not show the same respect. (Applause) Finally, let me greet the British Parliamentarians, however they think about Brexit: for us to imagine Paris, Madrid, Berlin, Rome far from London is painful. Yes, please know, with all due respect to the choices of the British people. For us Europeans, this is a political step that must be carried out with reasonableness, in dialogue and with friendship, but always with respect for the rules and their respective prerogatives.  I would also like to welcome the representatives of the states that have applied to join the European Union: their path is initiated by their free choice. Everyone understands how convenient it is to be part of the European Union. The accession procedures are continuing and Parliament has said on several occasions that it is satisfied with the results achieved.  Finally, a good luck to the whole administration and to the workers of this Parliament. We set ourselves an objective in the last parliamentary term: to make the European Parliament the home of European democracy. That is why we need reform, transparency and innovation. Many results have been achieved, especially on the budget, but this parliamentary term will have to give greater impetus. In order to do this, we need a greater dialogue between Parliamentarians and the administration which I will develop. Ladies and gentlemen, Europe still has a great deal to say about whether we and you will be able to say it together, whether we can put the reasons for the political struggle at the service of our citizens, whether Parliament will listen to their wishes, their fears, even their anger, but above all their needs. I am sure that all of you will be able to make the greatest possible contribution to a better Europe, which can be born with us, with you, if we can put our hearts and, above all, ambition into it.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 13, "date": "2019-07-03.json", "name": "Manfred WEBER", "mepid": "28229", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Mr President, I would like to thank the On behalf of the European People's Party, the Christian Democrats, I congratulate you on the election.

We are the ones who represent European citizens and we must assume this renewal and this change.  That's why in the Renew Europe Group you will have a partner. We propose to you from the very beginning - and we propose to our pro-European partners - the project of a Conference for the Future of Europe, in which we can think about how we can bring Europe closer to the citizens, in which we can ensure that it is not the behind-the-scenes negotiations that determine the prominent figures who must lead Europe, but the citizens can express themselves from this point of view (laughter).

We are looking forward to working with you. I think ‘rights of the Parliament’ are exactly the right words, this is exactly what we need to discuss, because so far as Parliament we have always been working on increasing, advancing, the rights of Parliament because that also means increasing the rights of the citizens. Right now our position on that is being challenged, as we all know, so we have to make sure that were not giving up on that, that we’re working on further improving and increasing European democracy. That is our task and we cannot give up on that. We also need to continue to work to support the idea that someone for Commission president should have been, and should be, a lead candidate.  We need to work on transnationalists, but we also need to do our work inside the European Parliament because it needs to have us to push for all these democratic rights, and there we also need to do some work when it comes to transparency inside the European Parliament.  So I’ve mentioned that, but I would also like to ask you something else, Mr President. You remember the resolutions that we had in the last legislature about how to prevent and what to do about sexual harassment, which is also a problem inside the European Parliament, unfortunately. I ask you and urge you to take those resolutions seriously, because people might be patient but people who are victims certainly should not be.  And then there’s one more issue. We are here today as the Greens/EFA Group and we are missing one of our Members who is not able to come here because his Member State has not put forward his name, even though he has been elected as a Member of the European Parliament.

I appreciated the words that you used both in your presentation and in your inaugural speech, and I fully agree with some of the concepts. He spoke of trying to make this House the home of European democracy, he talked about minority rights, he talked about respect for different ideas. These are all shared objectives on which the Identity and Democracy Group will cooperate. However, these statements run counter to what you said a few days ago about the need for a cordon sanitary cord to prevent certain parliamentary parties and groups from having access to the posts or representation to which, by reason of the democratic principle of representativeness, they would be entitled in this Parliament.

The Bureau has proposed that a secret ballot should be held by paper and then with the ballot papers deposited at the ballot box, but the Rules of Procedure do not establish this and, of course, the House is always sovereign. That is why the proposal we put to the vote, which was approved by a majority of the House, is the procedure by which we will deal with this vote and all this with regard to the mandate of our Rules of Procedure which, under Rule 191, lays down the procedures for voting by secret ballot.  The third ballot will therefore take place electronically.  I call on all my fellow Members to put on the ballot paper and give it a try because it is good to test the system, since we are at the first sitting of the European Parliament. We proceed to a rehearsal with five singers: I invite the system to get into operation. You will see the names of the five singers appear on screen and you with the cursor can make your choice. Then select the candidate by pressing the blue keys at the bottom right of the screen, or by using touch keys on the right. The blue light lights up and an asterisk appears in front of the name. The number of seats to be filled decreases by one. And to respect the secrecy of the ballot, you move the cursor eliminating the display of the asterisk.  If you're ready, we can give it a try, with the five singers proposed. I declare the vote open.  Did they all vote? The vote is closed.  Let's see which singer finished first on the charts. Well, we see that the system is working. We shall therefore proceed to the actual vote. The three candidates will appear on your screen. You can place the cursor on your screen. The vote is open.  Did they all vote? The vote is closed.  I would like to say that 411 Members voted. Here are the results: null votes: 61 votes cast: 350 Mr Castaldo is elected by 248 votes. Mr President, I would like to make a very important Mr Krasnodębski received 85 votes. Bizzotto 17 votes. Congratulations to Mr Beazley on his excellent report.
