Madam President, Madam Secretary of State, ladies and gentlemen, good morning to each and every one of you. I thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak on behalf of the European Commission and apologise to President Jean-Claude Juncker, who is currently attending the G20 summit.  Madam President, we are at an important and serious moment, seventeen months after the start of the negotiations, that I have had the honour and that I have the honour of leading under the authority and with the confidence of President Jean-Claude Juncker and with the support of the whole European Commission.  On Sunday, as you pointed out, Madam Secretary of State, the European Council approved our draft withdrawal agreement. He also endorsed the political declaration that sets the framework for our future relationship. At this stage, I would like to thank the European Council, its President, Donald Tusk, all its teams, but also the successive presidents with whom I have worked and worked well, the Austrian Presidency today, but also Bulgaria, Estonia and Malta. Then we will continue with Romania in the coming months. Ladies and gentlemen, the time for negotiations on the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration is over. Now is the time for ratification by the British Parliament, by your Parliament and by the Council.  Given the difficult circumstances of this negotiation and the extreme complexity of all the subjects of this British withdrawal, the agreement that is on the table - the draft orderly withdrawal and the political declaration - is the only one and the best possible.  We have succeeded in this first major step together and, on the European side, thanks to the very strong unity of the 27 Member States and all the institutions between them.  In particular, Madam President, the withdrawal agreement and this political declaration owe much to your four resolutions and the careful vigilance you have shown since the beginning of this negotiation, of course, to preserve the rights of the citizens you represent - it was your priority, it was my priority - to preserve the interests of the European Union, the integrity of the single market and the indivisibility of the four freedoms , and the Union's decision-making autonomy. We co-constructed these two documents together throughout the process. Madam President, through you, I also want to thank President Tajani and allow me to say a more personal word to Guy Verhofstadt, coordinator of your Brexit assembly, and to each and every member of the Brexit steering group, Danuta Hunner, Elmar Brok, Roberto Gualtieri, Gabriele Zimmer and Philippe Lamberts who followed with all their teams , which I thank, the day-to-day negotiations within this steering group. I would also like to thank the group chairs, the committee chairs and Cecilia Wikstrom, knowing that we are not at the end of a long road that will remain difficult. The agreement reached on Sunday is also the result of a method that we have decided together and with you. We put things in order, starting - as it made sense - with negotiating the withdrawal agreement, an orderly withdrawal, before discussing the framework of our future relationship with the United Kingdom. We have insisted on addressing upstream some of the issues that were and are still a priority for your Parliament, namely the rights of citizens, peace and stability in Ireland, and the financial settlement. Ladies and gentlemen, from the outset, we have worked with transparency, that is, with confidence, and we will continue.  This method allowed us to explain the issues of each subject, to show what was possible and what was not, given the fundamental principles of our Union.  From the beginning, we have explained how we can and should respect our principles and, at the same time, take into account the red lines officially indicated by the United Kingdom. Finally, we found common ground. In a nutshell, the framework we have set has given stability and predictability to this negotiation. No one can be objectively surprised by the content of our agreement.  Ladies and gentlemen, it may be worth pointing out at this stage that the European Union did not want Brexit. To date, no one else has been able to show me the added value of Brexit, but we respect the democratic and sovereign vote of the British citizens and so, as the British Government has requested, have implemented this process for an orderly exit. Simply, the two documents approved on Sunday help to limit the negative consequences of Brexit on both sides but also, in particular, 27 EU Member States.  The withdrawal agreement provides legal certainty to all people, businesses and regions concerned about the consequences of the British decision to leave the European Union: of course, European citizens, 4 and a half million people living in the UK and British citizens living in one of the EU countries; the inhabitants and businesses of Ireland and Northern Ireland, Madam President, who participate in all the human, social and economic dimensions of North-South cooperation. The last resort solution on which we have agreed to avoid the return of a physical border in Ireland while protecting the single market is an integral part of the withdrawal agreement. Without this solution for Ireland, there is no withdrawal agreement. Communities then, universities and companies that carry out so many projects funded by European policies and budgets, including with UK partners, universities, extremely dynamic laboratories in the UK. Farmers who benefit from the common agricultural policy and who legitimately wanted to protect their intellectual property rights, and much more than that, through geographical indications. And then, all those whose personal data were exchanged with uk-based organizations or companies. These are the people and sectors for which we had a duty to restore security where Brexit has created insecurity. That is the purpose of this very dense withdrawal agreement, I agree, because it is a legal treaty, precise and comprehensive.  As for the political declaration, it sets the framework in which we will, as soon as possible, negotiate our future relationship.  Ladies and gentlemen, in this negotiation the European Union will continue to defend its interests and apply exactly the same principles.  In this negotiation which is about to begin, the Union will adopt, as will your negotiator, the same attitude. There will never be and there has never been aggression. There will never be and there has never been a spirit of revenge. There will never be and there has never been any kind of punishment on my part. We will continue to work with the United Kingdom, not against it, to build this future partnership and we will continue to work with the respect due to a great country that will remain our friend, partner and ally.  The truth about this future relationship is that, given the British decision to leave the European Union and the single market, this cannot be the status quo in the future. This cannot be \"business as usual\" and our duty is to say so, especially to companies, which must prepare. But our mutual interest is to build an ambitious partnership on goods, services, digital, mobility, transport, public procurement, energy, internal security - of course - for the stability of our continent, foreign policy with this country that will remain active in the UN Security Council, defence and many other areas.  The more ambitious this partnership is, the more attentive and demanding we will be on the framework of the conditions of competition between us. In total, if we make this political statement in all these dimensions, let me tell you - and I say if we are making this political statement in all these dimensions - the partnership with the United Kingdom will be unprecedented in the scope and number of topics of cooperation.  As President Juncker has wanted and as the Member States and your Parliament have wished, we will prepare and be ready to launch this negotiation on the future relationship, once the United Kingdom becomes a third country.  But before that, Madam President, there is obviously a decisive step, that of ratifying our withdrawal agreement. Now is the time for everyone to take responsibility. In the coming weeks, British parliamentarians will have to vote on this withdrawal agreement and the text of the political declaration and this vote commits the future of their country. We must respect - and I will respect - this debate and this time of parliamentary and democratic debate in the United Kingdom. For our part, we must leave this time of ratification to the European Parliament, which has been and will remain closely associated with each stage of this negotiation, and which will have the final say.

I think that we can say easily today that both have been built around the principles of the European Union – that means the integrity of the Single Market, that means the four freedoms which underpin that Single Market and that means the ability, the capacity of the European Union to decide in an autonomous way. But I have to tell you, and I think it’s important in these debates, that also two other elements have been taken into account. The first are naturally the positions – maybe I have to say the red lines – of the UK Government following the decision to end the membership of the European Union. Then, a second important point that underpins this agreement or these agreements, and that is something often underplayed and not fully understood, is the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, though the European Union is in fact not a direct party in this. The 1998 Agreement was only possible among EU Member States, between EU Member States, and it shows, in my opinion, that the European Union is about that, about reconciliation, about the end of violence, about peace. The result of all this is the withdrawal agreement, and I think the only and best agreement possible, considering these three elements that I have just described. In achieving this, I would like to thank, naturally, and congratulate – it’s not the first time that I’m doing this – Michel Barnier personally. He has done a tremendous job in close cooperation with the European Parliament and with the Brexit Steering Group, and this also gives me the possibility to congratulate all the members of the Brexit Steering Group for the good cooperation beyond the lines of the political parties. I think that it worked very well. Now, the result, Michel, is an agreement that, in my opinion, does three things. The first is to minimise the disruption for both sides, in particular for the economy, and to allow for an orderly withdrawal and allow for a timeframe between two and four years to conclude the negotiations on the future relationship. The second result is to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland, to safeguard the Good Friday Agreement and to secure peace. Then the third thing – and I think this was the first priority of the European Parliament – is to safeguard the rights of all citizens. Here the European Parliament has, with the help and with the support of our negotiators, significantly improved the agreement and the text. Moreover, we are also committed – and I want to tell you this today – to ensuring that, before we start the consent procedure in the European Parliament, we receive from our British counterparts the necessary guarantees that all these citizens’ rights will be fully implemented. I believe that this framework – withdrawal agreement and political declaration – provides for the possibility to establish in the future a really close relationship between the European Union and the United Kingdom and the basis, therefore, as you have seen in the agreement, in the political declaration, is an association agreement, as the European Parliament has proposed from day one. Why an association agreement, on which also the British Government has agreed? Well, it will be applicable, once concluded, in a provisional way after approval at the European level. Secondly, it will be ratified in one round of ratification by the Member States, so as to avoid – if I may say so – the complexity of, for example, our relationship with Switzerland, which is based not on one association agreement, but on a patchwork of agreements. The Brexit Steering Group, along with the whole European Parliament, will further scrutinise the deal, the withdrawal agreement and the political declaration on the future relationship, as part of the consent procedure.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Liberals and centrists"}, {"id": 7, "date": "2018-11-29.json", "name": "Mairead McGUINNESS", "mepid": "28115", "text": "  (Exclamations by certain members of Parliament) Colleagues, I am in the Chair, so I will call time, with due respect.

That is why Sunday was a sad day, as Guy Verhofstadt – whom I thank for the cooperation – correctly analysed. But the negotiating skills of Michel Barnier and his team, his patience and information policy within the European Union have succeeded in getting the best deal possible.  I have to say that in Britain the government is divided, the ruling party is divided, the opposition is divided, the country is divided. This European Union, which is supposed to be at the end, was in agreement with 27 countries, with the Council, the Commission and Parliament, and Parliament also agreed. This European Union has a great chance for the future; it has proved this in these Brexit negotiations. We must see that we minimise this damage to the United Kingdom, as was made clear once again yesterday by the Bank of England's statement: there will be greater losses in growth in the UK as a result of Brexit than the financial damage of 2008. That is the Bank of England's statement yesterday. Mr Farage, who is Mr Trump's speechwriter, can explain what he wants to continue lying to his country. That will not change the facts. We must realise, however, that this means – and I believe that the European Parliament supports this – that there is no further negotiations. It's this deal and no other. It is not possible again, not according to the method \"reject again, then we negotiate again, and then there is a new deal\". This is an agreement that stands, it has to be taken, it has been negotiated for a long time. For this reason, it must be clear that the Withdrawal Treaty is a condition for a transitional arrangement. I have the impression that this is not clear to some people in the United Kingdom. If the Withdrawal Treaty does not come, there is no transitional arrangement. The break will be thunderous – for both sides. We must realise that this Treaty must also make it clear that it is a difficult and risky matter for Remainers to now think that they will reject this Treaty and perhaps get something else, including a referendum, before 29 March. I think this is a very dangerous undertaking. This deal should be taken for security reasons to minimize the damage. That is why I am appealing to both sides in the UK in this game. We have noted that this treaty will ensure the transitional arrangements of this Treaty, that the rights of citizens who have relied on the existence of the European Union from both sides in their personal life planning, that there will be no hard border with catastrophic human and economic consequences between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, and that we have agreed on a backstop in doing so. , which, while the transitional period is in progress, does not enter into force at all, and that we then negotiate the future treaty without it coming into force. The aim of the backstop is not to put it into effect. This must be clear, and that is why it must not be abused, even in the discussions in the United Kingdom.  I believe that, in order to minimise the damage, we must conduct future relations in the common interest with great constructive awareness of a solution. Britain does not want a customs union because they want to make their own trade deals. They do not want to be members of the internal market because they do not want to fulfil the four freedoms. But everything that is possible after that should be made possible. That is why we should be making a free trade agreement that is very broad. Theresa May was right when she said in the spring that the more we are similar in our standards, the more level playing field we have, the more market access there is. This should be seen in this context in order to minimise the damage in the way possible. However, we should make it clear that this partnership agreement, which was initiated by the European Parliament and which is now included in the agreement – we have also mentioned it – should include this trade agreement to a large extent, but also issues of internal and external security. It is in the interests of both parties that we make agreements in the fight against terrorism, that we have a British involvement in a certain possible sense, including in the common security and defence policy. Both sides want to do so. To this end, this Withdrawal Treaty sets the appropriate framework conditions for negotiating this in another treaty in order to ensure the security of our peoples. This also applies to other areas, such as research, when I see the situation of English universities and how much they want to be in the research programme. Let me make one final comment: Mr Farage writes Mr Trump's speeches, and Mr Trump said the day before yesterday that he would not even do this withdrawal agreement because he does not want to negotiate with Britain in this way.

On behalf of the S&amp;D Group, I would like to thank Michel Barnier for the outstanding work he and his team have done in dealing with this historic challenge. At the same time, I cannot hide my profound sadness about the UK’s choice to leave the Union. Our Group respects this decision, but we deeply regret it. We consider it an historic mistake. In our eyes, it will always be a lose—lose situation. Despite the disappointment and the frustration, the EU – and all of us – have acted, since the very beginning of the process, with responsibility and respect. We have worked tirelessly for more than two years to protect those most affected by the decision and to alleviate its worst possible consequences. This was achieved thanks to the guidance of our lead negotiators and thanks to the unity within, and between, the EU institutions. I would also like to thank Guy Verhofstadt and all the members of the Brexit Steering Group. We have been – and we shall be – always united. The EU has been responsible towards the UK by providing the basis to deliver an orderly withdrawal without any feelings of revenge or resentment. We have also been responsible towards ourselves and our citizens not to endanger the European project and the integrity of our Union. This sense of responsibility shall continue to guide us going forward.  One thing must be clear, though. There is no alternative deal to the one agreed on Sunday. Considering the United Kingdom’s red lines, this is the best, and the only possible, agreement. It is a deal that protects citizens’ rights, safeguards the integrity of the single market and the customs union and, crucially, prevents a hard border on the island of Ireland, respecting the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts. We know that on citizens’ rights, which have been our priority from the start, our work is far from being finished and we will remain vigilant with respect to the implementation of this part of the agreement. We will never allow EU citizens to fall victim to the same disgraceful hostile—environment policies that saw members of the Windrush generation wrongly deported. The political declaration accompanying the withdrawal agreement establishes the framework and basis for an ambitious, broad and deep partnership. This unprecedented partnership, which should take the form of an association agreement, shall fully respect the integrity of the single market and the autonomy of our legal order. We also welcome all the interpretative declarations adopted by the Council and consider them legally binding, including with regard to Gibraltar. On the future relationship, the UK has made its red lines clear throughout the process – just as we have – and we respect this. In the negotiations we have shown a high degree of flexibility and we have stretched the deal as much as we could in order to take into account the position and the constraints of the United Kingdom. We have always said – and we repeat it now – that if the UK changes its mind our arms are, and will remain, open. But insofar as you want to leave the single market and no longer apply the principle of free movement of persons, this is the only possible way to leave the European Union in an orderly manner, avoiding the severe disruption of a no—deal scenario. There is no other deal that could respect such limits without compromising or endangering our European project. This Parliament is the very symbol of our common project and of the links between countries and people. This is why we will continue to play a responsible and proactive role in safeguarding the integrity of the Union and ensuring a positive future relationship with the United Kingdom.

Look, Brexit was always about much more than the economy. In a way, because the European Union strayed so far into many other areas, into our national lives, it is why the British people voted for Brexit. They were increasingly unhappy with this tendency. You say you didn’t want Brexit, but you did nothing to avoid it. But of course the economic aspects are central. A bad deal for Britain or no deal will have repercussions in many European countries as well as Britain. Much time seems to be spent here on predicting events in London and the consequences of Brexit for Britain. Perhaps we should look at the impact of a bad deal or a sour relationship on the European Union. Certainly, the British government entered into negotiations in a spirit of goodwill, aiming for a positive future partnership. There’s been astonishment in Britain over the legalistic inflexibility that has been shown quite often. But we all know that the EU will bend or break any of its own rules when it suits it, and instead of defending the long-term interests of EU countries, it seems to have chosen to pursue a narrow ideological course defending a particular view of the EU project, which is increasingly repudiated by citizens across Europe; it may appeal to the leaders of a couple of the larger countries in the European Union. Instead of listening to citizens, your answer to everything is just more Europe. And by the way, I think a lot of people have been very cross in Britain about the discourteous way in which our Prime Minister seems often to have been treated. Because of your insistence on a bizarre sequencing arrangement, you’ve wasted two years when you could already have made progress on a free trade agreement. All other issues would then have fallen into place – it wasn’t necessary to do it in the way you did. This makes it all the more important to move quickly into negotiating our future relationship and reaching rapid but correct conclusions, but we need some reassurance and flexibility – indeed, guarantees – from the EU over concerns that have been expressed. We need an atmosphere of trust and goodwill from your side if we are to have that future positive, stable relationship that is surely the least that all our citizens demand.

Actually rather than sadness, I felt gratitude first to Michel Barnier and his outstanding team. Not only did they negotiate the agreement, keeping in mind the common interests of the EU without ever losing their nerve, they did so – and that is one of Michel’s defining qualities – involving the Council and Parliament on an equal footing, keeping the EU team together in more than one way. Of course, this agreement is not perfect; as far as we Greens/EFA are concerned, we would have liked to see something more than non-regression clauses on social and environmental matters as a condition for the UK staying in the customs union, and the political declaration should, again, have been more explicit about conditioning our future relationship on the UK not becoming a tax haven or a money laundering country. The countdown has to be tough on these issues as we move forward. I also felt relieved: relieved that, after 18 months of very hard work, an agreement could be found. Had that not been the case, the worst-case scenario of the UK crashing out of the European Union would have become the likeliest, causing major damage not just to business but above all to people. Relief that the EU could reach this agreement with the UK without compromising on its integrity. Relief that the British government had finally come to terms with reality. The ball is now clearly in the UK’s court. The Prime Minister has come to terms with reality, but it remains to be seen whether she will find a majority supporting the deal in the House of Commons. To the dissatisfied Brexiteers I will say this: if a negotiated Brexit is what you want and unless you would also consider keeping the country inside the single market, no other deal is available. Whoever negotiates on behalf of the UK will face the same legal constraints as Theresa May did, and I hope no one of you is seriously considering leaving without an agreement. Because if the UK did that, it would be in breach of the Good Friday Agreement, because at once a border would be re-erected in Ireland. It would also be in breach of its financial commitments taken under the EU Treaties during its membership period, because leaving a club, my friends, does not free you from paying your outstanding debt. In other terms, crash Brexit would make the UK a rogue state, a country whose signature with any other partner would amount to just nothing. The real choice, therefore, is only between Brexit under the terms negotiated, and no Brexit at all. That choice will have such an impact on the future of the country that as a Democrat I would find it normal that we would ask the people, especially as the major parties seem to be very divided on the issue. (Applause) I will agree with remainers that your country finds itself in a less enviable position now than it was as a Member State, because indeed, European Union is a boost to sovereignty. In this world, if we want to have impact, we need to act together. And I think many British citizens realise that. Are they a majority? We don’t know. Can we find a way to ask them? If there is one, it is very narrow. (Applause) But I’m certain, though, that if the UK wants to renounce its intention to leave, we should embrace it back with pleasure. Equally – and that is my final word, Madam President – I think it would be a utterly, utterly irresponsible to end up with the UK crashing out of the European Union, either voluntarily or inadvertently.

Madam President, I would like to thank the president for her At its meeting last weekend, the Council approved the divorce agreement negotiated between the EU and the UK. And yet, at this moment, no one can say whether it makes a regulated Brexit more likely. It is therefore right for the EU and the Member States to prepare for the worst case scenario: a no-deal situation. Our participation as a group in the Brexit Steering Group and also our participation in Parliament's very first resolution last year – April 2017 – was not taken for granted from the outset. The decision that we support this platform, that we as a left-wing group should join the work of the Brexit Steering Group, was the right one. In this context, I would also like to say that cooperation with Michel Barnier has set standards for future cooperation between the institutions in the European Union. Even now, however, it must be made clear that the divorce agreement does not make us cheer. We are concerned that, particularly with regard to citizens' rights and northern Ireland, a number of our demands are not so entrenched that they could actually provide sufficient legal certainty for those affected by Brexit. What is not watertight in the Withdrawal Agreement cannot be remedied by declarations of intent. We breathe a sigh of relief because the Withdrawal Agreement, the Withdrawal Agreement, the Divorce Agreement, the Backstop, the Emergency Solution, were agreed to avoid a horror scenario in Ireland. However, the backstop does not do what was promised in the Joined Report of December last year: the border that divides Ireland will become harder, the cross-border economy will be affected, rights enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement will be minimised.  We are also concerned about how Theresa May is seeking the votes of doubters, critics from her camp for the Withdrawal Agreement, the divorce agreement. It now assures them that it will stop migrants from EU member states coming to Britain. It seems that the British Government – and with it not only the government, but also some of the colleagues who are sitting over here – has not yet understood what the essence of European citizenship is. They forget that they also deprive their own citizens of rights, and they raise the well-founded suspicion that EU citizens who want to live, work, study in the UK after Brexit, be discriminated against and discriminated against against people from other countries in the world.  At the weekend, the Heads of Government assured – and this has also been mentioned here several times here today – that the UK and the EU want to pursue the closest possible partnership after the separation. We support that. But if these are not just empty words, there is still a lot of work to be done on both sides. As the European Parliament, therefore – and here I fully agree with Guy Verhofstadt – we should continue to be committed, above all, to the interests of the citizens of Great Britain, but also within the European Union. We are also committed to the interests of UK citizens within the EU. I would also like to make that very clear once again.

It’s a good deal because it involves large transfers of money. It’s a good deal because it maintains free movement of people. It’s a good deal because it keeps Britain in the customs union and stuck with the EU’s rulebook. And crucially, the key point, as Mr Barnier said this morning: there is the backstop, which means of course the United Kingdom can be held effectively as a hostage for many years to come. It’s a good deal for the European Union; for the UK, I think it’s probably the worst deal in history. Something, Mr Brok, that President Trump has noticed – and, by the way, he is a great respecter of the great nation states of Europe, and certainly no enemy of any single one of them. No, Mr Barnier, I have to say I wish you were on our side really, because it’s game, set and match to you. You probably can’t even believe your luck that you came up against a British Prime Minister who met every single demand of yours whilst at the same time trying to deceive the British public, and you took it to the big summit on Sunday, and in 38 minutes it was all agreed, done and dusted, and off to lunch. Well, I have to say, we will be leaving on 29 March next year, but any illusion at home that we’re going to be an independent country, I’m afraid, has been shattered. And before the ink was even dry last Sunday, President Macron of France stood up and decided to start to threaten us. Now, I understand the French do catch 90% of the haddock in the west of the English Channel and we get 10; I understand their interests. But I fear that we’re very much now open and at your mercy over the course of the next few years, and the truth of it is, in the political declaration, you haven’t got to give us anything. You don’t need to give us a thing, and that is why this is going to fail in Parliament, and probably fail by a very big margin. Now, Mr Barnier, you say this is the only possible deal. But this deal isn’t going to be accepted. So perhaps we all need to grow up and recognise that there is a strong chance now of the UK leaving on 29 March with a WTO no deal. We need a negotiated deal, to deal with sensible border issues. I wonder, Mr Barnier, are you prepared for that? Because you seemed this morning to assume that the British Parliament is going to ratify this. It isn’t.

It is shocking in this regard that a request to challenge Brexit has been lodged in the Court of Justice of the Union, which will rule on 4 December. In my view, no court has jurisdiction to question the effects of a referendum. In France, the Constitutional Council has understood this and refuses to control the referendums. I very much hope that the Court of Justice of the Union will take the same position. If it were to interpret Article 50 of the Treaty on the European Union in a way that was unfavourable to Brexit, it would have to resist.

Madam President, thank you to those who have spoken, in particular Guy Verhofstadt, Elmar Brok, Roberto Gualtieri, Philippe Lamberts and Gabriele Zimmer for expressing their appreciation on behalf of their group for the work we have done. I'm sensitive to that. It's a really collective effort. It has not been a solitary or personal work, it is a collective work. I was happy to participate because I know this House - I was elected there at one time - I also know the European Council and of course the Commission, and it seemed very important to me to work as a worker - I hope qualified - to this unity between the 27 and between the institutions. The assessment relates to the work of my team, Task Force 50, and I will obviously pass it on to my assistant, Sabine Weyand, to Stephanie Riso and to the whole team that has earned this appreciation and who will receive it as an encouragement. However, we are in a serious and sad moment, as you have said. Also, I say to Mr Farage and others that I do not want to make controversies. I have never done one and I am not going to start today. We listen to everyone, we respond to everyone, we talk to everyone and we will continue. It remains, as Gabriele Zimmer said, the time for ratification and, in the coming months, we must prepare for the future negotiation that we need, on other legal bases, for the partnership with the United Kingdom. We must be vigilant, as Guy Verhofstadt has pointed out, also on the implementation of what is in this Treaty, in particular on the rights of citizens and the guarantees that must be confirmed and implemented in order for the procedures for European citizens in the United Kingdom to be inexpensive and as simple as possible. Therefore, vigilance and determination are required.  This vote, which is expected on both sides, commits the future of the Union. It commits the future of the United Kingdom. I say this with the respect mentioned earlier for the time of the democratic debate in the United Kingdom, which we respect. The United Kingdom, by its culture, by its history, by its solidarity, especially in the great tragic moments that Europe went through in the 20th century, its total solidarity, by its economy, by the quality of its diplomacy, is a very great country. I have respect for this country and that is why I hope that as soon as possible we can work towards a true partnership unprecedented by the scope of the subjects of cooperation to consolidate our alliance beyond what we are already doing for many countries in the Atlantic Alliance obviously or bilaterally to strengthen our partnership in another framework and to consolidate our friendship as well. Mr Farage, in this negotiation I have sometimes been asked whether the Union will make concessions. No, there was never any question in my mind that there was a winner or a loser. Brexit is \"lose-lose.\" There is no added value. Therefore, it is a matter of taking into account your sovereign decision - I say sovereign, Mr Lebreton. We respect this sovereign decision of a majority of British citizens and implement it according to the indications, demands and red lines expressed by the Government of London. I have worked with Theresa May's government throughout this year and a half and on the terms of what she said she accepted or did not accept. How else do you want me to do it? We negotiated with the government of London, which expressed a desire to leave the European Union following the referendum, and then to leave the single market, because you no longer want to respect the regulatory framework, because you no longer want to respect the freedom of movement of people, because you no longer want to recognise the role of the Court of Justice and you no longer want to pay. In addition, you are leaving the customs union because you no longer want to be in a common trade policy. These are the red lines that are yours and we respect them. But you must respect our determination to preserve the foundations of the European Union, and in particular this single market. I had the honour of being its commissioner for five years. This single market, it owes a lot to the United Kingdom. You have had a very great degree of influence in its construction and evolution, but you are leaving it because you no longer want to respect these four freedoms that are indivisible. I mean with great respect to Geoffrey van Orden: It's not inflexibility, it's not inflexibility; it is just responsibility. We have a duty, a responsibility, to work for an orderly withdrawal, to create security and stability where Brexit creates insecurity. It's only an orderly withdrawal that creates a basis of trust for the deep and ambitious partnership we all want.  That's what I meant. This negotiation is a negotiation because you are leaving the European Union. You have decided to leave the European Union and we regret that. It is obviously a negative negotiation, with no added value. That is why we have this feeling of seriousness, which does not forbid the lucidity on our side as well to learn the lessons of this Brexit. There are, as Guy Verhofstadt and Elmar Brok have said, lessons to be learned for ourselves, namely to understand the reasons for this vote and, if necessary, to change a number of things that should be done to better respond to the concerns, demands and sometimes anxieties of citizens.  That is, we have been working on this unity that European leaders have wanted in the very serious geopolitical context in which we are. To the west, to the east, to the south, we can see that we are being challenged from all sides and we have been working with this unity between the 27 Member States and between the institutions.  What I can simply express as a wish at this stage of this process which is not finished, because the road is long and is still very steep - we are waiting for the vote of 11 December and the ratification process on the British side on this agreement which is the only and the best possible - I simply and humbly hope that this unity that we have forged together in this negative negotiation , the European leaders of which you are a part decide to put it at the service of a positive agenda.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 18, "date": "2018-11-29.json", "name": "Mairead McGUINNESS", "mepid": "28115", "text": "  Thank you, Mr Barnier, and could I thank you on behalf of the Parliament and President Tajani for your work with Parliament on this issue, your transparency and, above all else, your patience.

Since the first draft of the Global Compact was put on the table, Member States engaged in intensive discussions on this document in the Council, both during the Bulgarian and the Austrian Presidency. They also actively engaged in the discussions in New York. Indeed, since the adoption of the New York declaration for refugees and migrants in September 2016, the EU has actively engaged in providing input at the various stages of preparation of the first draft of the Global Compact. As you are aware the Council does not have a common position on this text. Member States have decided or are in the process of deciding their national position on the Global Compact. The political endorsement of the Global Compact in the intergovernmental conference in Marrakech followed by the adoption of this document by the UN General Assembly will open the way for the implementation phase. To conclude, I would recall that cooperation with third countries and regions remains a crucial element of the EU’s migration policy. The dialogues and the support we provide to our partners through a variety of instruments, including through the EU Trust Fund for Africa, are testimony to our commitment to a policy that recognises the specific responsibilities, needs and concerns of countries of origin, transit and destination.

Madam President, I believe there are two mistakes we must not make when discussing the Global Compact, and one additional that I will mention later. The first one is to pretend that there is a clash between our national interests and the idea of a Global Compact. The opposite is true. If our national interest is to govern migration, and I believe it is – of all of us – to make it orderly, humane and sustainable, then the Global Compact is the most powerful tool we have to serve our national interests. The second mistake would be to tackle migration as a fight between the north and the south of the world: the developed and the developing countries. Again, the opposite is true. Let me mention just the fact that most of the countries are, at the same time – for instance, in Africa – countries of origin, of transit and of destination. Again, as I said, the opposite is true. It’s not north against south or south against north; we all share an interest in managing migration. We all have an interest in investing in sustainable development in the regions that need it the most, and we all have an interest in creating regular pathways for human mobility. The earlier we realise that it’s partnership and cooperation that we need, the better for us all, because we are all in this together. No country can address it on its own, neither in Europe nor elsewhere in the world, and all countries have an interest in addressing this effectively. We all support it. The UN Secretary—General Ban Ki-moon’s initiative to hold a high—level meeting on migration – that was back at the UN General Assembly in 2016. Then, we all, collectively and unanimously, adopted the New York Declaration that launched the work on the two Global Combats on refugees and on migration. And that was an important achievement for us Europeans, because in the middle of the migration crisis in Europe – I add ‘in Europe’ because we have to remind ourselves there are migration crises every single day in every single part of the world – but at that specific moment, after the summer of 2016, in the middle of the European migration crisis, Europe – us – we called for the international community to engage, to build partnerships, and we received a positive response. And there the Global Compact process started. The European Union took an early lead in the discussions on the Global Migration Compact. We also participated from the beginning, actively, in the work leading to the clear common positions that are now in front of us, and this has allowed us to bring forward a Global Compact that largely reflects European objectives and that respects all our key concerns. I know that Commission Stylianides said it very clearly in the European Parliament in the plenary session in Strasbourg a couple of weeks ago. We regret the decision by some European Union Member States not to join or to support the Global Compact on Migration. We do believe that all Member States’ interests are best served in supporting the proposed framework that will establish a basis for international cooperation and dialogue – that basis that was missing up to now and that we asked for: dialogue and cooperation that lie already at the basis of the first results that would need to be consolidated, that we have achieved as Europeans, in the past years: reducing irregular arrivals, offering alternatives to migrants, bringing smugglers to justice and also tackling difficult topics, including return and readmission. Results that were achieved by way of cooperation, partnership and mutual respect and understanding, with a strong role of the United Nations – all elements that are the basis of the Global Compact. There are some misconceptions in the debate on the Global Compact, as I said already. I would like to underline one that is self—evident to me, but maybe we need to repeat it in view of the national debates that are going on. It is not a legally-binding framework. I think national parliaments in particular, but also the European Parliament, have to acknowledge that from the very beginning: it is not legally binding. It will not create any legal obligation for the states. It is a menu of policy actions; it is a menu of best practices from which states may draw to implement their national migration policies in a cooperative way and in any international manner. It provides a framework. The Compacts are built on this basis and are grounded on the respect of the principle of national and sovereign rights of states to determine their national migration policies. But they do provide that framework that is missing today, and that is definitely needed, as we Europeans asked for it. We will continue to work to improve migration management worldwide, which is already done today on the European side, on the basis of the work strands that are developed under the Global Compact. We will, notably, continue our engagement with the International Organisation for Migration, who will lead the implementation and follow—up of the Compact, which will entail sharing experiences, helping countries to overcome shortcomings, and searching for solutions to an issue that is global, by definition. We will also continue to support partnerships at bilateral, regional and global level in the area of migration. With our partners in the world, the Migration Compact will be an important basis for cooperation along what has been agreed as the common European Union approach to migration. And that, as I said, is largely reflected in the Compact. So here, our common work and your contribution as the European Parliament will be essential. Mr Avramopoulos will be leading the Commission delegation to Marrakech on 10 and 11 December, and I’m very happy to see that Members of the European Parliament will join the European Union delegation to the Intergovernmental Conference at Marrakech. I believe the role of Parliament is going to be crucial. I very much appreciate the European Parliament’s strong interest and engagement and confirm our full commitment to work very closely with you in this joint endeavour.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 27, "date": "2018-11-29.json", "name": "Željana ZOVKO", "mepid": "185341", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Club. – Dear Chairman, Respected Distinguished Commissioner, as a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Development Committee, I have visited crisis hotspots in the world meeting many refugees and have seen that they all have one common goal - to find a safe haven for themselves and their family.

Croatia, which has the longest land border to the Western Balkans, knows this very well. Italy and Spain with sea borders to Africa were most exposed to refugee waves and could not lift walls.

It is a political declaration based on cooperation, the sovereignty of states, the division of responsibility, based on a global, European and national legal order that does not equalify migrants with refugees and does not bring about new legal obligations.  Global challenges can only be solved together. I just got back from Niger State. There is a struggle for a decent life part of everyday life, as rich Western countries abuse natural resources and people.  As long as that is the case, Europe will be an attractive continent. That is why the global agreement is of great importance so that migration can be safe, controlled and regulated, and that this will be a global concern for all of us, which europeans expect of us.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sl", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 29, "date": "2018-11-29.json", "name": "Anders Primdahl VISTISEN", "mepid": "124875", "text": "  for the ECR Group.

It’s for the Austrian Presidency to express the position of the Council. The Commission has a very clear position on the Global Compact. As I explained, this is the result of a process that we Europeans have initiated in the UN Framework, asking for partnership and asking to have a political global framework for managing together, on the basis of what we had already started to do with our African friends, with our Asian friends, and with friends from Latin America and everywhere. We initiated this process in the UN Framework, asking for a global approach – political, not legally binding – to establish partnerships because we Europeans found out – in my view quite late, in 2015-2016, but still we did – that we needed to build strong partnerships with the countries of origin, of transit and of destination, supporting a common system and a common approach to manage migration, fight traffickers, offer opportunities and also to tackle, as some of you have said, difficult issues like returns, in an effective manner. It’s a difficult process, but it’s a process that is now reflected in a Compact that, starting from a European approach, has moved to a global level. As I said, the Compact largely reflects the positions of the European Union and the work that we are currently doing, together with our partners, on migration, starting from the work we’re doing with the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNNHCR). I can tell you this: the Commission will not only be represented in Marrakesh with a delegation, as I said, led by Commissioner Avramopoulos, but will continue to actively engage with the UN and with the UN system on its implementation. Technically, as you might know – but maybe not – after the Conference in Marrakech, there will be a vote in the General Assembly, where Member States of the UN will take a vote, but the Commission will continue to work with the UN system, with the UN agencies and with our partners globally to implement this agenda because we have seen that, in the first couple of years of work that we have done, along the lines that are reflected in the Global Compact, these have started to bring results.

Today, with this debate, we are going to make them more visible. We're going to be his speaker. Today we are going to create an image that really favors that they can exercise their rights. They are, above all, human beings.  They are citizens who cannot be defined by their disability and, in fact, do not want to be. They face the same problems every day as other women: they are mothers, daughters, friends, workers; they have a multitude of talents and a multitude of skills and enrich our society by making it more diverse. The contribution they can make is crucial, and that is why it must be promoted and ensured that the plans these women have will be heard.  Today, with this debate, we are going to create a positive awareness of diversity and we will make the culture of difference impose, because it is the one that generates the most social advantages.  These women face the challenge of making them invisible every day. Women who do not see, who do not hear, who live otherwise, who have no mobility; in short, women with disabilities are women that society excludes. These are often mental barriers: invisibiliza, and this results in a great deal of discrimination in all sectors in all countries.  We will talk about education—inclusive education—which means that we all participate freely in society and all contribute and contribute to it. When discriminated against in education, the student diverse from this exclusion is found guilty; that can't happen. Inclusive and accessible work and education are the tools to be able to link ourselves to a society and to be able to participate in all sectors; only 18.8% of women with disabilities are employed in the European Union, a smaller percentage than their male counterparts or who undoubtedly have no disability.  We also need to talk about digital literacy, because an important group of these women are over sixty years old and that is why we will have to develop a strategy for older and disabled women.  We will also talk about the need for full participation in all the issues of women with disabilities; they can't be left out of anything; and, of course, ensure the active and passive suffrage of these women. A legislative amendment has recently been made in Spain in this regard. We will talk about equal treatment: the need for all of us to be equal — one of the values of the European Union. This will have to create active and public policies in order to break down all barriers to such equality and, above all, to give truthful, simple and effective information to these women so that they can develop their rights.  Accessibility is the prerequisite for participation and equality. It is true that on 8 November we have been informed that the Council and the Commission have already agreed to this European Accessibility Act, which is more than we had and less than we asked for, but that it is a step forward to work in a Europe without barriers. Accessibility means that everything is done in all languages, in all forms, in all formats. Think that, for example, in gynecological checkups, women with disabilities have accessibility issues going for a mammogram or gynecological checkup. There is difficulty in accessibility to many health services, many services against gender-based violence, support services, maternity services, protection, communication. We have to break those barriers. The social pillar is an opportunity to be able to include women with disabilities and also make them protagonists.  And we'll talk about dignity, too. We must get out of the silence of harassment suffered by these women: one in three women with disabilities has been or will be mistreated and a victim of gender-based violence. That's why we need a strategy of support and respect in this regard. And we will also talk about another way of discriminating, such as forced sterilization, coercive abortion or excluding them from the right to adoption or motherhood. It is also a full-rule discrimination and involves inhumane treatment. And we will also talk about the need to have indicators to know what the situation is for these women; gender indicators; indicators of disability in the European Disability Strategy itself and in all departments. And I end by telling you that Goal 5 of the Sustainable Development Goals was talking about empowering women. Empowering women with disabilities is empowering humanity. Today we have an opportunity to learn, to feel, to live and to create. \"Being a woman,\" says a disabled, good friend, \" Love it; I have a disability and I have many capacities like anyone else, but first and foremosm I am a human being, with all the rights that correspond to me; I hope I never have to justify why again.\"", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 54, "date": "2018-11-29.json", "name": "Marianne THYSSEN", "mepid": "1832", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, honourable Members of Parliament, fundamental rights, inclusive growth and social fairness are at the core of this Commission’s agenda. We are working hard to make sure that no one is left behind, and I would like to think Madam Estaràs Ferragut and the FEMM Committee for putting forward this question on the situation of women with disabilities. The Commission has undertaken important legislative initiatives for fostering the participation of persons with disabilities in society and for promoting gender equality. Just to give you two examples: the European Accessibility Act, on which there has recently been a provisional agreement among co-legislators, will break down barriers to key products and services. The Accessibility Act will, in particular, be a key tool to bridge the digital divide. Secondly, the Commission has proposed a work-life balance package in order to enable carers – mainly women – to better balance work and caring responsibilities. This is a key initiative to contribute to bridging the existing employment gap, pay gap and pension gap between men and women, and I hope the ongoing trilogues will produce results soon. Let me now respond to the three questions you’ve put forward. Together with all of our Member States, the European Union has committed to implement the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The European Disability Strategy is the main instrument to support the Union’s implementation of the Convention until 2020. It is part of the wider efforts under the Europe 2020 strategy to succeed in creating smart, sustainable and inclusive growth. Indeed, full economic and social participation of people with disabilities is essential to fulfil the objectives of the European 2020 strategy. The Commission is currently preparing an evaluation of the implementation of the current European Disability Strategy. The evaluation will cover all aspects of this ability. This includes, in particular, the situation of women and girls with disabilities and the challenges stemming from inter-sectional discrimination. And of course, as part of our preparations, we will consult as many stakeholders as possible. We will take into account the European Parliament’s views, such as last year’s resolution on the concluding observations of the UN Committee. Now on the gender-disaggregated data. Reliable and accurate data are essential for policy development. The Commission already disaggregates by gender the disability-related data it collects, including within the European semester. These data provide us with an objective basis for identifying intersectional discrimination. Our data show, for instance, that in the areas of poverty risk and employment, women with disabilities are disadvantaged compared to men with disabilities. In the area of education, however, we observe a higher percentage of early school-leaving with boys with disabilities than with girls. Attention to gender equality is also paid in the Union’s external action activities. We notably provide support to partner countries to improve data collection disaggregated by sex and disability. There is also the obligation to complete a gender analysis for each development cooperation project or programme. As a last point, I want to address the question on what the Commission is doing to enable participation of women with disabilities in the European elections. My colleague, Commissioner Jourová, has delivered a statement on the participation of people with disabilities in the European elections at the European Parliament’s plenary session on 5 July this year, and she pointed out the Commission’s recommendation of February 2018, which addresses the exchange of best practices with a view to promote the exercise of electoral rights of under-represented groups, including persons with disabilities. In April this year we followed up with a dedicated session on this topic, involving our network of Member States experts in electoral matters, and this week, on 26 and 27 November, we dedicated the annual colloquium on fundamental rights to democracy and the European Union, including the promotion of broad participation as a condition for inclusive democratic societies. And finally, I want to mention that the directive on the accessibility of public sector bodies’ websites, which came into effect last September, will contribute to assuring the accessibility of information issued by public bodies across the Union about political participation and elections.

Disabled people are mainly cared for by women. 80% of them do so informally and free of charge. It's a closed circle of inequality, endless effort and injustice.  Why do so few disabled women enter the labour market? What or lack of rules prevent the economic independence of women with disabilities? It's not just a matter of money, untapped talent and competence. It is also a question of human dignity linked to being an independent person and fully involved in social and economic life.

We are increasingly talking about the European Pillar of Social Rights, about the European strategy for disability, but unfortunately we are not able to reduce discrimination against people with disabilities, especially women with disabilities, and we are in no way able to guarantee the simplest things that seem to these people, namely work, income, inclusion in civic and political life.  The unemployment rate of people with disabilities remains unacceptable and is therefore at a significantly higher risk of poverty and social exclusion. In addition, women with disabilities face greater barriers to access to the labour market, which makes it more difficult for them to live a normal and independent life, as work is not only a source of income, but also a means of social inclusion, helping to reach out to wider society. Women with disabilities are often underpaid, and what to say about their old-age pensions at old age. Another problem is that data on the nature of the work of women with disabilities and the employment situation are generally limited.

The European Social Fund should be used as an effective tool for greater involvement of women with disabilities in all important areas of life, such as free access to the labour market, training and (general) education. Women's inactivity rates are higher, they do less skilled work, they work with less responsibility and lower pay, they live in greater social isolation, they are more financially dependent on family and carers.

If we want our efforts in promoting democracy to be successful, we need to ensure that the population of the countries we engage with is able to make an informed political choice. The more freedom we give to academia, the more democratic a society we achieve. A democratic society is always a more peaceful and balanced society.

If a country restricts free academic research we must take it as the first symptom of illiberalism and encourage our partners to refrain from political manipulation of universities and schools.
