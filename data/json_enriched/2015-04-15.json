More than 400 refugees are still missing after a refugee boat capsized off the Libyan coast on Sunday. Among the missing are a large number of young men and probably a number of minors. It is to be feared that most of them have drowned. It would be one of the worst refugee disasters since October 2013. We are all safe at this difficult moment in our thoughts with the families of the victims. I would like to take this opportunity, above all, to thank the emergency services who work there in extremely difficult circumstances for their tireless efforts. Ladies and gentlemen, this tragedy is a matter of mewilderment and also shows us how unstable the situation is, particularly in Syria, but also in Libya and other countries bordering the Mediterranean from which the refugees come. We urgently need political solutions for these countries. Ladies and gentlemen, in the last week alone, Italian rescue workers have rescued more than 6000 people from distress at sea. Europe's mediterranean border is the deadliest border in the world. More than 3,000 people have died trying to cross the Mediterranean last year. We will certainly observe a minute's silence for the victims. However, ladies and gentlemen, I cannot read these words here without reminding you of the following. I stood here on 7 October 2013 and asked for a minute's silence for the victims of Lampedusa. I asked you on 15 September 2014 to observe a minute's silence for 200 drowned migrants. I asked for a minute's silence on 12 February 2015 for 300 drowned migrants. I'm back here today and I'm doing the same thing. I would like to say to you that I do not consider this worthy. The pity for the victims goes deep. But we cannot go on to observe minute's silence for hundreds of deaths, but the problem itself is not changing. (Applause) That is why I am appealing not only to us and to the other institutions of the European Union. I appeal in particular to the Member States of the European Union. The migration policy that is their responsibility must lead us to have better protection of refugees. However, it must also lead to a more effective approach to the causes of flight. Disintegrated states on Europe's borders are the cause of these flight movements. We must do everything in our power to help people in need. However, it is also our duty, ladies and gentlemen, to do everything we can to tackle the causes of flight intensively. I include in the sad news the terrible attack by the criminal organisation Al-Shabaab on the university in the northern Kenyan town of Garissa, which on 2 April claimed the lives of 148 innocent people, young men and women, students from the university there. This is not the first time this terrorist group has shown its inhumane attitude with a brutal attack on innocent people. What particularly shakes me is that there has been a systematic hunt for people of Christian faith. Our thoughts are also with the people of Garissa, with the friends and relatives of the victims. We wish the injured, some of them severely mutilated, a speedy recovery. Here, too, we should do everything in our power to help. The fight against inhumane terrorism is not just a fight against a criminal organisation. It is a struggle to defend our fundamental values. If we give up this struggle, ladies and gentlemen, we will give up the civilisational basis of our society. I would therefore ask you to stand up for all the victims in this sense. (The House rose and observed a minute's silence) Ladies and gentlemen, following our minute's remembrance, I have been asked to point out that in Syria, in the Yarmouk refugee camp near Damascus, 18 000 civilians, including 3,500 children, have been encircled and besieged for more than two years. The humanitarian situation in the camp is catastrophic. Most of the people are cut off from the outside world, and the people there lack everything, water, food, medical care. Here, too, we are seeing women and children being held hostage by the so-called Islamic State and other militias and not for the first time being abused as human shields. Therefore, although I know that this is not an essential contribution to solving the problem, I still call in the name — as I do. I hope that all of you, all those involved, in particular the military, will spare civilians, especially women and children, give them safe escort, give United Nations agencies access to the camp and ensure basic supplies of missing things. The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Middle East is the organisation that is most intensively involved, and which we, from the European Union, are also providing massive financial support. I believe that you all share my view that UNRWA needs our full support and that we must act. I do not want to have to make a minute of mourning for thousands of dead in the Yarmouk refugee camp here in one of the next sittings. (Applause) I would therefore ask all of you, and in particular those colleagues who have a direct influence on international organisations, to help with this.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are now facing a revision, albeit a technical one, which follows the very significant delay in the implementation of operational programmes. In fact, all funds in shared management from 2014 to 2020 are affected. As of 31 December 2014, more than three hundred operational programmes had not yet been adopted and could not benefit from the credit deferral procedure offered by Article 13 of the Financial Regulation. All Member States are affected. Indeed, more than 21 billion euros would have been lost without this revision. For some states, it is even the bulk of the commitment appropriations for these programs that are affected. Some examples: for the Czech Republic, 99.6% of the funds would be lost, for Romania 80%, for Spain, more than 60%, and for the United Kingdom, more than 50%.  Fortunately, Article 19 of the Multi-Year Financial Framework allows for the introduction of an amendment by May 1 of this year to transfer allocations from 2014 to 2015 in the event of non-adaptation of these programs. For all these reasons, you will understand the opinion in favour of this revision that we are proposing to the vote. However, given the territorial impact on all countries and the equally large amounts at stake, this predictable revision adds to the worrying dysfunctions of our budgets. First, this situation again raises the question of the sincerity of our budgetary decisions, since at the time they were made, we were late and we knew it. Secondly, in the context of a chronic investment deficit in Europe, such a delay in the arrival of the Structural Funds, linked to the validation of operational programmes, is difficult to accept and thus delays investment in the territory. Thirdly, this delay in implementation will also have an impact on payment appropriations, because by shifting commitments by one year, it is the entire payments that could be staggered by the same amount, which would add additional pressure on the Union's payment credits at the end of the period of the multi-year financial framework. We know this snowball effect, this accumulation of unpaid bills which undermine the credibility of the Union by leaving thousands of project holders in front of this budgetary cavalry.  Let me be clear, this revision will not aggravate the payments crisis, as we know it now, but nevertheless it risks amplifying the one that awaits us at the end of the period and I welcome all the more the Commission's statements, by which it pledges to use all the flexibilities offered by the multi-year financial framework to limit the consequences of this revision.  However, Commissioner, I am afraid that this flexibility is not enough. Parliament had already expressed its fears at the time of the MFF agreement in 2013. This financial framework - for the first time in the history of European construction - was and remains inadequate and inadequate.  Thus there are a number of budgetary adjustments which, when combined, constitute what I will call the \"must-haves\" of a revision this time not technical, as is the case today, but political, of the multi-year financial framework.  Unpaid debt crisis, European fund for strategic investments and reserve of flexibility: this is a first non-exhaustive list on spending. But we are all aware here of the Council's budgetlessness and the dismal negotiations of the annual budget. And all this makes us think about the very structure of the European Union's budget. This revision — not the technical review, but the political review that awaits us — offers us all a historic opportunity.  We owe this opportunity or duty to three elements. Firstly, the elections resonated as a wake-up call from European citizens, some of whom expressed their doubts, and others expressed their rejection of the Union. Secondly, the economic crisis requires us to have a countercyclical intervention in which the European budget must take its place, as can be seen through the EFSI debate.  Finally, of course, there is the democratic question, the question of political responsibility that challenges us as a legislator. Have we ever seen a Parliament vote on budgetary expenditure without questioning revenue? It's a bit of a backwards world: we spend without being in the least responsible for revenue and without raising taxes.  At present, Member States' contributions make up 75% of the EU budget, a situation that feeds into the logic of the so-called, improperly moreover, the just return, which breaks community ambitions. A budgetary structure that fuels the payments crisis by transforming the Union's budget into a variable for adjusting national budgets, but above all destroying solidarity between the citizens and peoples of Europe, the indispensable driving force behind our common project. Commissioner, we must announce the great return of own resources, allowing us to tackle the major issues of the common market and to support the European society project.  Commissioner, my plea for a real post-election review of the multi-year financial framework comes mainly from the fact that I share the Commission's sentiment. We are at a turning point in European integration and in the face of the rise of nationalist populists, we cannot afford the luxury of failure for lack of ambition. This technical revision calls for a political revision of the budget as early as 2016.

Mr President, I would like to greet the Commissioner, and I would like to greet all my colleagues and all my colleagues. Indeed, we are dealing with an imminently technical proposal. The proof is that it has had unanimity in committees and, in particular, unanimity in the Committee on Budgets, but it is a proposal on which we can also make political considerations and draw lessons for the future.  The delay in the multiannual financial framework has led to the delay of operational programmes and, in particular, of the operational programmes of cohesion policy. No wonder it is the European Fund for Strategic Investments, where cohesion policy is, but where the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development are also the most affected and in this cohesion policy is the one with the greatest expression. It is important, it is urgent that regional operational programmes, in particular the regional operational cohesion policy programmes, where the ERDF, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund are located, all enter at great speed at cruising speed. I would remind you that in the European Union we have 272 regions, but one in four of these regions is below 75% of GDP per capita, with 100 being the Eu average, i.e. one in four regions is designated as a least developed region. And these cohesion policy funds are essential to combat asymmetries but they are also important, and today they have a new way of acting and have a new framework, so that there are synergies with the funds that are in what is called the Common Strategic Framework. They too contribute to employment, they also contribute to growth. In particular, they contribute to the priority of smart growth. Today, cohesion policy is also research. Today, cohesion policy is also innovation in a number of Member States and hence the importance of not being able to lose resources that have added value for the whole European Union. We're talking about a transfer that's not payments at all. We are talking here about a transfer that is an authorisation appropriation: EUR 21.1 billion that has not been used and will be mainly used in 2015, but also in 2016 and 2017.  It is essential that these programmes which we are talking about, but also the programme and the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund, and the Internal Security Fund, which are also housed here, are properly set in motion. This transfer, this modification, this revision of the multiannual financial framework will allow 300 programmes not to be affected by the delays I have already mentioned.  It is also important to stress that the multiannual financial framework needs flexibility, needs a review that takes into account the need for growth, the need for employment, and also needs flexibility for new programmes, for programmes, such as the Juncker Plan, which may take a look at the multiannual financial framework in the revision of the multiannual financial framework, in particular for possible lines that will be used to finance this Juncker Plan. What I ask is that this multiannual financial framework, this revision of the multiannual financial framework, should have the same vote as it had in committees, namely that there is unanimity that also existed in these committees.

They have presented very clearly the importance of this proposed amendment for the European economy, as well as the urgent need for a decision to be taken. We in the Commission, together with Member States, made every effort possible to adopt as many programmes as possible in 2013 and to do so with a higher standard for quality of spending. We launched informal dialogues with Member States in advance of the formal adoption of the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) and I can say here that, as a result of concerted efforts, the time that was taken to adopt programmes during this round of the MFF was four months shorter than in the previous MFF. But despite these efforts, because of the late adoption of the Council regulation laying down the MFF for 2014-2020 and also owing to delays involving the legislative acts, we unfortunately had the negative impact of having 300 programmes, or 47% of the programmes, that we could have adopted in 2014. As already mentioned, this is an amount of EUR 21.1 billion. So, with six months lost because of the delay, all we are proposing in this technical adjustment is to use flexibility to extend this period by allowing us, as framed in Article 19 of the MFF Regulation, for a revision of the MFF before 1 May 2015. I would like to share with you three very quick points. First, staff at the Commission are working very hard to accelerate adoption so we can have around EUR 16 billion for 2015 and the remainder, as proposed, adopted in 2016. Second, we have very much appreciated the fact that Parliament’s Committee on Budgets has taken this issue very seriously and has worked on getting a fast proposal here in this Chamber. I certainly join the rapporteurs in hoping for a positive vote. Third, both Ms Thomas and Mr Fernandes talked about the need to use the flexibility that Parliament has been fighting for to adjust the MFF in future years. I just want to recall that we have committed to a mid-term review and revision of the MFF, and we in the Commission will be working on a very serious proposal when the time comes. We are very mindful of the significance of all we do and the speed at which we do it for the health of the European economy, improving our competitiveness, creating more jobs, and improving the lives of the European people.

The mid-term evaluation will give the opportunity to review the timing of the adoption of operational programmes. The outstanding payments in Section 1B of the Union budget must be part of the package of revision proposals in the interim evaluation. This year, the Commission foresees the transfer of EUR 21 billion from unused commitments in 2014. I draw attention, however, to the fact that we are thus obliging Member States to absorb a much larger amount of funds by supplementing unused allocations, and there is a risk of disengagement of allocated funds. We must ensure that each Member State's commitment and payment appropriations are complied with. On the other hand, the high level of accumulation of outstanding payments and unpaid invoices by the end of 2014 for programmes financed by the Structural and Investment Funds will increase the volume of payments in 2017. In order to avoid possible agglomerations, the Commission should consider that the remaining allocations will be staggered between 2015 and 2017. We are at an important point in the process of starting the current programming period, so we believe that any delays can have serious consequences for the implementation of investments at the level of the regions and on European citizens. National authorities must show cooperation in order to adopt the remaining operational programmes in a timely manner and to start funding under those programmes.", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 26, "date": "2015-04-15.json", "name": "Eider GARDIAZABAL RUBIAL", "mepid": "96991", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group – Mr President, as has been said here, we are discussing an amendment to the financial framework, which is essential to be able to take advantage of these EUR 21 billion, which, for different reasons, could not be programmed in 2014 and we moved them to 2015. I don't think anyone opposes this, and we all agree that it needs to be approved quickly and that the important thing is for these programmes to move forward.

But unfortunately, we are delaying payments from the principle of the financial framework towards the end. Fundamentally, for two reasons: because of this change in the financial framework — and because of the delay in the implementation of the programmes, we will have more payments at the end of the period — but also because we had to use payments in 2014 that were scheduled for the end of the term of office, due to lower payment scheduling in 2014.

The delays caused by this concern more than 300 operational programmes in all Member States and it is therefore necessary to reprogram the current financial perspective for the coming years.

Programmes under shared management present a series of difficulties. They are often highly prone to errors as Member States put more emphasis on spending a maximum amount of EU money than on the quality of the projects supported. These errors have resulted in the non-certification of EU spending for years. The Commission is hesitant to control Member States too much for political reasons and is relying on Member States’ control systems, which are often inadequate. Therefore, it is often Parliament which has to defend the principles of good management and quality spending when it comes to programmes under shared management. In this context, the delays we are witnessing today in the implementation of a new generation of shared management programmes are not necessarily entirely negative if they result in the setting-up of quality control systems which would guarantee that finally most of the funds, if not all the funds, are well spent. From a budgetary point of view, I am just worried that the postponement of a significant sum of commitments – we are talking about EUR 21 billion – will increase even more the pressure on the already very tight level of payments, and that the Council will ignore the increased need for payments in later years once more.

We now need to act to avoid fund losses, and we are rightly doing so, but of course in the future we will need to do more.

As we know, the last agreement on the multiannual financial framework 2014-2020 delayed the adoption of the legal acts of the European Structural Investment Funds for this period. These delays negatively affect the economies of the Member States and are associated with significant losses. The Structural Funds are the Union's most important investment policy and therefore their effective preparation and use of European resources will generate growth and jobs. All European countries must have equal access to finance and support from the Union institutions.

Let me just make four points in response to comments and also to the questions addressed directly to the Commission. First, the impact on payments.  Our view is that it will be manageable, based on past payment profiles, but most importantly on the fact that, in dealing with the payment crisis we have had, together with Member States we have done a very good job on obtaining better projections for payment schedules so we can structure payments in a more prudent and predictable manner.  There was a question on whether there is a risk that countries will not be able to use the money. The n+3 rule applies and that means that once commitments are made there is time to execute the programmes that are approved. In fact the time is basically three years more than we have in the MFF, so this should be possible with programmes being approved this year. For some, approval will come early next year. All the funds committed are to be used.  I want to stress again that we have drawn very important lessons from the payment crunch in terms of how we can better manage the relationship between commitments and payments in our budget. Let us remember that we are no longer in the days of plenty. We have to learn to live with tighter budgets; focusing on the quality of spending and not just on the spending itself form part of this learning. My second point is on simplification. I heard loud and clear those of you who said that we need to have simpler rules so that programmes can be implemented and the level of errors can be reduced. I could not agree more with this. In the Commission this is a very high priority for us. We call also on Parliament to work with us, please, and not to add new control rules when they may not be necessary, when they do not add much value. But this applies also to Member States. Member States sometimes gold-plate rules and, even if we come with something that is simpler, bells and whistles are added and it is no longer simpler. So we all have to work systematically on implementation. My third point concerns the value for money. Is this something that should be supported? There were voices saying let us just give the money back to Member States. I want to speak using the language of facts. Cohesion money is there to benefit the countries that are on the receiving end but also the European Union economy as a whole. Analysis of the use of Cohesion Funds from the previous period demonstrates a very tangible impact on growth rates in cohesion countries: for Latvia, 2.1 % higher growth, for Lithuania 1.8 %, and for Poland 1.7 %. These figures represent additional jobs but also purchasing power for goods and services from other countries. One more fact: there is a very interesting report on the European Union, called Golden Growth, which says that we have invented the most powerful convergence machine in the world, one that has allowed European Union countries to accelerate their transition from middle-income to high-income status in the most impressive way that has ever happened. Over recent decades some two dozen countries have made this most difficult jump from middle to high income. Half of them are members of the European Union and the other half countries that have discovered oil or have used very aggressive competitive practices, sometimes without too much democracy attached. So we are the place where we are able to grow without compromising on democracy, human rights or social inclusion, and without discovering oil. That may be something we would have liked but, frankly, in terms of climate change, it is better not. My last point is on the mid-term revision. I have heard the points you made, which are very valid ones. We will certainly analyse very closely whether the MFF still adequately reflects priorities and we will propose adjustments if necessary. If these priorities require revision, we will of course come up with a proposal for revision. I want to stress that we would make full use of the new flexibility instrument for new priorities and the global margin for commitments. We would, of course, work broadly with Parliament – I see Committee Chair Mr Arthuis here with the Committee on Budgets – in order to make best use of our taxpayers’ money for the betterment of our economy and our people.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 60, "date": "2015-04-15.json", "name": "Isabelle THOMAS", "mepid": "114279", "text": "   rapporteur - Mr President, very quickly I would like to thank my colleagues for supporting the favourable opinion we have issued with the co-reporter, Mr Olbrycht, who was unable to be present today.

We mourn for the lives lost and for the suffering endured by those men, women, and children. The Council is well aware of the recent resolution of the European Parliament of 12 March on the Annual Report on Human Rights and Democracy in 2013 that, among other issues, called on all the Member States to acknowledge these atrocities as genocide and encouraged them and the EU institutions to contribute further to its recognition. We also take note of the Euronest resolution of 18 March this year, which touched on the same subject and contained the view that ‘preparing the ground for future reconciliation between peoples is of the utmost importance’. Armenia regards these events as genocide. Some EU Member States have also formally recognised this in their national legislation. However, I shall note that there is no common agreement as to the definition of the tragic events that took place 100 years ago. There are different reasons for this. Unfortunately, these tragic events still strongly affect the relations between Armenia and Turkey. Without any doubt, it is important to have a common interpretation of the history. However, I should not be the one telling you that this may be a very difficult goal to achieve. But, looking forward, what is of immediate importance is to do all we can to promote the development of constructive relations between both sides. The Council is committed to continue supporting the normalisation of Armenian-Turkish relations and encourages both sides to remain committed to the process of normalisation without preconditions. I would like to use this opportunity to invite both Armenia and Turkey to use every window of opportunity towards achieving this aim. The ratification by both sides of the Protocol on the establishment of diplomatic relations between the Republic of Armenia and the Republic of Turkey and the Protocol on development of relations between the Republic of Armenia and the Republic of Turkey signed in Zurich in 2009 should contribute to the normalisation of relations between the two countries, including the establishment of diplomatic relations. Normalisation of relations between Armenia and Turkey goes beyond mere bilateral interest. It has significant impact on both countries’ relations with their mutual neighbours, thus positively affecting security, stability and cooperation in the region. I would like to mention that the EU supports concrete activities targeting both countries, aiming at promoting confidence and people-to-people contacts. The Commission may have more details on this, but I wish to recall that the EUR 2 million project financed under the Instrument for Stability was launched in 2014. This project supports civil society efforts towards the normalisation of relations between Armenia and Turkey. The EU is committed to further engage with Armenia and Turkey. It is also high on Latvia’s Presidency agenda. We remain committed to provide necessary assistance to promote constructive relations between states.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "PPE-DE", "partyIdeology": "PPE-DE"}, {"id": 79, "date": "2015-04-15.json", "name": "Antonio TAJANI", "mepid": "2187", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission. – Mr President, the Commission fully acknowledges the significance of the upcoming events commemorating the Armenian centennial, as well as the divergence of views on this particular tragedy. It has had far-reaching consequences for Europe, with many of our current Member States integrating the Armenian diaspora and therefore also keeping the memory of these events alive. What happened a hundred years ago continues to be felt in this century and to negatively affect Armenian-Turkish relations. The upcoming centennial commemorations in April this year will most probably create additional sensitivity but will also be another test case for the future of bilateral relations between Armenia and Turkey and a chance for advancing reconciliation. Reconciliation is a core foundation of the European project and values. The Commission continues to support the normalisation of Armenian-Turkish relations and to encourage both sides to remain committed to the process of normalisation, without preconditions, through the implementation of the protocols they signed in 2009. It is essential that in this period of reconciliation partner countries are able to face their past through open and sincere debate. The Commission is glad to note that a debate has been taking place in Turkey over the past ten years. It is important that such an opening is acknowledged, encouraged and protected, including through well-calibrated messages from the European Union. Last year’s statement by the then Prime Minister, Mr Erdogan, was a welcome step and the Commission encourages further meaningful steps paving the way towards full reconciliation. As mentioned by the Council, the Commission supports concrete activities aiming to promote confidence in people-to-people contacts. We have committed EUR 2 million to a project supporting reconciliation and to greater civil society cross-communication. We also clearly expressed these messages of support during Commissioner Hahn’s recent meetings held in mid-March in Yerevan with the Armenian President, Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs and also with Armenian civil society. The EUʼs support was highly appreciated, and there was a similarity of views on the positive impact that improved Armenian-Turkish relations could have on the whole region and on the multilateral track of the Eastern Partnership.  In April we shall join the Armenians in solemn commemoration and mourning for the lives lost, recalling the horror of what happened in the final days of the Ottoman Empire. Regardless of the words we use to describe those awful events, there can be no denial of their historical reality. They represent a dreadful atrocity afflicting the people of Armenia which must never be forgotten.

The 20th century is marked by mass murders — mass murders on ethnic, ideological, religious grounds, through and on the run and in many other things. In particular, my own country has participated in this with the mass murders of Jews, Sinti and Roma and others, and we rightly call this genocide. We feel a moral responsibility for this, and I am still grateful today that the Israeli Prime Minister, Mr Ben-Gurion, gave us the signal and met with the German Chancellor, Mr Adenauer, in New York 14 years after these millions of murders. But the Bolshevik regimes have also killed many people. This is not to be put into perspective. Every act is cruel and irresponsible in itself. One cannot put into perspective by enumerating deeds. But the Stalinist, Bolshevik dictatorships also committed their crimes. Such genocide was also the act of Armenians, the hundreds of thousands of people who were killed under the Ottoman Empire in connection with the First World War. Nor do I want to forget the Pontos Greeks and the Aramaeans. I believe that, at the centenary of this day' return, we must realise that this must never be accepted again and that it is part of people's identity that the murders of their predecessors can also be called genocide. President Erdogan's statement, among other things, that he has apologised for such acts should be the way for Turkey to commit itself to this genocide in its history, namely under the Ottoman Empire. I believe that, for this reason, the 1948 United Nations Convention is intended to send out a clear signal that we are not only condemning in retrospect, but that we are taking responsibility for the fact that it never happens again. In Rwanda and other countries, the international community has failed in such cases. That is why this is an appropriate moment to ensure that we always take responsibility when genocide threatens.

Since closing its border with Armenia in 1993, Turkey has pursued a relentlessly hostile policy towards Armenia. This centenary offers an opportunity for Turkey to reach out, to recognise the genocide and to seek dialogue with regard to reopening the international border as a gesture of goodwill. Turkey claims justification for the closure of the border by citing its solidarity with its Turkic brothers in Azerbaijan, but we have seen this for the smokescreen that it really is by witnessing Turkey’s inaction over the persecution of Turkic Tatars in Crimea. Armenia and its diaspora do not seek restitution or compensation, they only seek recognition. Erdogan’s Minister for Europe has claimed that accession to the EU remains Turkey’s number one priority.

Mr President, I do not think we will have a complete picture unless I inform you of what Mr Davutoğlu and Mr Erdogan have just said on the subject. Mr. Davutoğlu said that the Pope's statements are in line with the axis of evil. Mr Erdogan said that this debate in the European Parliament would come in one ear and come out of the other. I think it is useful for Parliament to know this during our debate. I was in favour of voting in favour of an amendment that said that we welcome recent statements by Mr Erdogan, who regretted the tragic, as he simply calls them, \"events\" of 2015. I have to say that I am now troubled by the above-mentioned statement. Nevertheless, I believe that Turkey must be in line with its past and must recognise the facts and call them genocide. I understand that a century of teaching in Turkey's schools about non-genocide is not helping. However, the real political leaders at times like this seem. This leadership must push things forward because it cannot ignore the international community which is calling on it to recognise genocide. Turkey's proposal for a joint study of the archives by Armenians and Turks will not, in my view, lead to any result other than the squandering of another century of debate on this issue, without going anywhere. The image presented by Turkey, namely that the European Parliament is fighting it, is wrong.

It is quite right that we honour all who died and seek to learn the lessons of history in order to help us all live a better future. But there are Turkish friends who believe the motivation behind these and similar expressions of sentiment are about using history in order to prevent a better future. To these Turkish friends I say as follows. In the past my country, Great Britain, has been responsible for events which caused suffering and which cause us pain. The British set up concentration camps in the Boer War which were used to kill one in 10 of the Boer population. In Malaysia, the British deported half a million ethnic Chinese. Irish colleagues in this Chamber know how British rulers refused to feed the starving during that country’s famine. In an attempt to resist calls for independence in Kenya, Britain interned up to a million innocent civilians and forced them to work as slave labour. I am a proud Briton, but I do not seek to deny these events from my country’s past. I do not feel the need to equate these events with past sufferings of my fellow countrymen and women. Indeed, I am proud that leading figures of my own party took part in movements for liberation, towards reconciliation, to establish modern and equal relationships within our Commonwealth. So British Labour MEPs will support this resolution. We will welcome the recognition and condolences which have indeed been offered by Turkey itself. We will encourage reconciliation.

Nazi Germany murdered hundreds of thousands of its own Jewish fellow citizens, millions of citizens of other countries, almost 3 million citizens of Polish, my country. Until 75 years ago, quite recently – there are older Members in this Parliament – it was inconceivaable for someone to walk the streets of Frankfurt dressed in skull poke. Yesterday at Frankfurt airport I saw Jews not only in skullcaps, but also in huts, and in hats, with pejsami. They weren't afraid. The German service referred to them in the same way as to everyone else.  When we talk about Armenians, it's different. One hundred years ago, the now de-existent Turkish state launched a pogrom of Armenians. More than one and a half million Armenians were killed. There is no doubt about that, there are only differences of interpretation. Armenian people talk about genocide, our Turkish friends talk about events. The result is that the border between Armenia , the country of our Eastern Partnership, and Turkey, the newly formed Republic of Turkey, which is almost a hundred years old today and a candidate country for the European Union, is closed. Is the Republic of Turkey cutting itself off from the Ottoman Empire to such an extent that even the alphabet has changed, in this case it felt like an Ottoman heritage?

It followed, as we all know, other holocausts with very clear, identical purposes.

History haunts us and if we do not have the courage to face and admit the mistakes of our ancestors, we will never be able to close a blackboard, chapter of our common history and promote much-needed reconciliation.

As a Bulgarian, I would like to recall one of our most prominent poets, Peyo Yavorov, who wrote one of the best known poems under the title Armenians. Let me quote from it in Bulgarian. \"Изгнаници клети, отломка нищожна от винаги храбър народ мъченик, дечица на майка робиня тревожна, и жертви на подвиг чутовно велик\" I do not know anybody in the Balkans who is not deeply touched by the fate of the Armenian people. Let me turn to the questions you put. First, the Commission acknowledges and respects the majority view in this House. This view has already been spelt out in Parliament’s resolution on the Annual Report on Human Rights and Democracy in the World in 2013 where you stated that you called, ahead of the 100th anniversary of the Armenian genocide, on all the Member States legally to acknowledge it and encouraged the Member States and the European institutions to contribute further to its recognition. We also recognise, as has been stated by the Council and acknowledged by many of you, that there are still differences in views among our Member States on this issue. We focus on ways in which we can support and advance reconciliation, and support and advance unity among our Member States. As an institution we have an obligation to bring views into unity. This is our obligation. Engaging with the Turkish authorities on issues that are so critical to Turkeyʼs ability to advance towards European Union membership is, of course, a matter of very significant concern for the Commission. I can tell you that this is a very serious topic for the Commission, for Commissioner Hahn and for all of us. What we would like to see, ultimately, is peace and harmony in Europe and also for Europe to export peace and harmony in the world. Unfortunately thousands, and hundreds of thousands, and millions of children, women and men die because they are different: in religion, in ethnicity or in the way they consider their social life and their freedoms. We are determined that, for the European Union to be successful, we have to be trusted to be able to carry forward these messages of democracy, freedom, respect for human dignity, and respect for human rights. I can assure you that I will convey back to the Commission the intensity and the spirit of this debate and, obviously, the call that you have already made on us.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "S", "partyIdeology": "S"}, {"id": 152, "date": "2015-04-15.json", "name": "Emmanouil GLEZOS", "mepid": "1654", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Mr President, I thank you sincerely for the discussion on this very important and sensitive matter.

Remembering these innocent victims is necessary, indeed necessary, because hiding or denying these kinds of events is tantamount to perpetuating them. I therefore welcome the European Parliament resolution, which commemorates the victims in a spirit of solidarity and justice, firmly condemning genocide as well as all crimes against humanity and prejudice against minorities.

This year also marks the 75th anniversary of the nkvd genocide committed by the NKVD on Polish officers, about which the truth has been similarly hidden and denied for many years. More and more national parliaments are adopting resolutions declaring the crime committed in armenians by the Ottoman Empire to be genocide, but there is still no full agreement on what happened in Armenia a century ago. This is demonstrated by the reaction of the Turkish authorities to Pope Francis' speech, in which the Holy Father unequivocally called this murder a genocide.  Reconciliation and the building of the future together must be based on truth and dialogue. The statement by Turkish President Erdogan and Prime Minister Davutoglu expressing their condolences for the atrocities committed in the Armenians is undoubtedly a step in the right direction. The 100th anniversary of this horrific murder is a good opportunity for the Turkish authorities to continue their efforts at reconciliation by opening their archives and recognising the crimes in armenians as genocide.

For the Commission, the whole question of having a diverse staff, of being inclusive, has a very high priority, and I can confirm that in my first meetings with Mr Juncker that was a topic he brought up, specifically in regard to people with disabilities. We are very keen to address this at three levels: at the level of recruitment, at the level of inclusion in the staff of the institutions, and also in terms of the support that is being provided, as needs might change.  We have a general principle of non-discrimination on various grounds in our Staff Regulations, amongst them disabilities, and our commitment to everybody, to each and every one of our staff, is that of fair treatment and equal opportunities. So let me stress, as we are having this discussion, that it comes at a very opportune moment for us because we are working on a new diversity strategy for the period 2015-2019, and in this sense input from the Members of this Parliament would be very useful.  Let me first start with the recruitment phase. We take very seriously our ability to provide conditions for each and every person in Europe who wants to apply for a job in the European Union institutions to be able to do so. We have in our team dealing with recruitment, in EPSO, two experts specifically for the issue of disabilities. In their work they are able to inform candidates and then respond to requests for special accommodation for testing; for example, tests in braille, on paper, with extra time. To be assessed in special facilities we have three rooms that are specifically for people with physical disabilities and, where this is appropriate, an individual person would be assigned to assist the candidate in the application.  Each file is then processed individually to ensure the best possible match between the needs of the candidate and the principles of both proportionality and equal treatment.  Secondly, in terms of being able to accommodate people with disabilities in Commission buildings, we have accessibility in all our buildings and they comply with the recommendations on accessibility by people with physical disabilities that are applicable in the region of Brussels. I would also say that we are looking at whether we can strive towards adopting best practices from elsewhere, at what is being done in other places.  Thirdly, in human resources there is a platform to provide advice and support – for example, for the need to have ergonomically better conditions for work.  We are not able to provide a full file on people with disabilities because of respect for confidentiality in medical records, but that does not mean that we are not making every effort possible to be aware of whom they are and where they are. I can tell you that we use the staff survey. We used it this year and last year to give people a chance to identify themselves through the staff survey, and on that basis we know that 5.7 % this year, 2014, have identified themselves as people with disabilities. This is one percentage more than in last year’s survey. This does not mean a one-to-one match, but it gives us an indication that our efforts to recruit more people with disabilities seem to be bearing fruit.  Parliament asks whether it would not be more appropriate to apply quotas. Our current Staff Regulations do not allow for quotas, but they do encourage us to use other ways to enhance diversity and I can say on my own behalf, and on behalf of my team, that we are looking for ways in which we can do more so that those of us in the Commission, in Parliament, in the Council, those who work in the institutions can be a mirror image of what Europe is, who we Europeans are. We are not there yet, so we have work to do, and I look forward to the debate this evening to give us input in that direction.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "Verts/ALE", "partyIdeology": "Greens and regionalists"}, {"id": 172, "date": "2015-04-15.json", "name": "Ádám KÓSA", "mepid": "96829", "text": "  (PPE). – Madam President, back in December last year, I asked the Commission in writing how many persons with disabilities are employed by the institutions of the European Union. However, the Commission was not able to provide any precise data on the number of staff with disabilities or the type of disability they have. The number we just heard was based on voluntary disclosure, so it cannot be taken as official data. I welcome the Commission's statement and I am pleased to hear that you want to address this issue. However, I believe that there is a need for quotas and standards for the employment of people with disabilities both in the Member States and in the institutions of the European Union, as long as the employment of these people is not natural within society. That's not the case today. I therefore call on the Commission to examine good practices in the Member States as soon as possible and to have this transferred as soon as possible to the eu institutions' own standards and, of course, to show these patterns to the other Member States.  In conclusion, I would like to note that the European Union has also signed the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which has clear rules on how we can help and, more precisely, facilitate the employment of persons with disabilities. This is also an obligation for the institutions of the Union. In conclusion, I would like to say that there are many good examples in the Member States of the Union, such as Hungary. The number of employees with disabilities has doubled thanks to quota requirements in recent years and other financial support and tax incentives.

As a signatory to the Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities and its institutions, the European Union should clearly set an example to the Member States, and making order, so to speak, on its own doorstep is an excellent idea. I understand that quotas can be an attractive solution, but I think it is much more important to create conditions that meet the needs of people with disabilities.

Unlike most EU states, we do not adopt any disability quota system for Eurobureaucrats. The Eu ropean Union recruitment agency, EPSO, is organising very tough competitions to recruit new European officials, so if we do not want to apply a quota system, it would be interesting to know what kind of assistance is given to competitors with disabilities, as well as the obvious provision of materials, which can be used, for example, for the blind, as has been said, and above all that real personalised assistance can be given and not limited to simple access to the examination site.

It is therefore good that these people can be treated equally with other candidates for certain jobs. However, if a quota is raised, it will be binding and may work the other way around without having the desired effect. More practical would be to provide people with disabilities for jobs in which their disability will not be an obstacle and will not be a reason to be treated differently from other workers. It is very important in their workplace that they feel equal partners and not that they simply exist there because of our pity that gave them a job. People with disabilities have proven that they have skills and that they can offer much more than those of us who are considered healthy. We should not forget the economic benefit to society.

Polish example, this confirms this. In Poland a few years ago we have already introduced quotas with severe sanctions. Any company with at least 25 employees must employ at least 6% of people with disabilities and financial sanctions are very high. We have checked all central offices, as well as local authorities in this regard, how they cope with the implementation of this amount, and it turns out that almost no public or non-public institution is able to achieve this amount – despite sincere desires. As far as central offices are concerned, it is extremely rare for persons with disabilities to apply for competitions. So it is clear that quotas – which are a much-needed tool for the impact of this equality policy – are insufficient in this area and we need a comprehensive policy, a good diagnosis of the causes, barriers that are emerging on the market, in order to cover these amounts with the right policies so that we are effective in integrating people with disabilities into the labour market.  I hope that the European Commission will monitor both itself and the other institutions in this regard, because we need such pressures and motivations in order to implement policy effectively in this area.

Mr President, people with disabilities, in different Member States, face modern social racism. But the worst discrimination against them is not so much due to the stereotypes and social origins of their fellow human beings as to the powers themselves. It is a power of European elites that impose austerity policies and violent fiscal adjustments, which restrict social benefits even to people with disabilities. In Greece, the Troika even reduced disability pensions, which now range between 250 and 525 euros per month.  It is therefore important to reverse social pressure and discrimination against people with disabilities by formulating a disability policy within the framework of the European Union's future 2020 strategy.

Quotas are a concrete way of demonstrating a country’s willingness to integrate and provide equal opportunities for people with disabilities. Since the guarantee of equal treatment for people with disabilities can lead to the establishment of foundational standards, with which the Member States are expected to comply, I believe the European Union institutions must be in the forefront in the adoption of quotas through the introduction of the obligation to have a certain proportion of persons with disabilities among the staff of the European Union institutions.

Rather, to create a programme to support sheltered workshops, production cooperatives, rather to support and facilitate employers for such projects and to control more the functioning of those projects so that the money is not misused. I know from Slovakia that they were abused like this. Plus, let's create public awareness and learning support to integrate them and facilitate the use of their employment, talents and abilities. You know, I had a disabled son, and he had a good preparation in the so-called family school, so I say that it is necessary to encourage the European institutions to create quality, special fields of study for their personal growth, to find a good job, to start youth, to raise them, and in a few years they will be well employed. Those who can handle it well will also be professionally proficient. So, Mrs Kozłowska said that we need quota pressure to set an example of what we are doing. Is that serious?

This is certainly an issue that is not just about people with disabilities but about the Europe we want to live in. I want to start with something that flashed through my mind while thinking back to when my own country became a member of the European Union in 2007. For me one of the joys of this membership was that my niece, who was born with dwarfism, would live in a Union where people with disabilities enjoy equal opportunities. I want to believe that this is exactly the Europe we want, a Europe where that happens for her and for everybody else. But we cannot possibly dream of a good life for our children if we do not integrate everybody. We are an ageing region. We need everybody to contribute to our economy and to the well-being of the European people. So for me this is not just a matter of looking at one topic, rather it is the coherence of the values we live by. That takes me on to how we intend to approach the integration of people with disabilities. Firstly, I strongly believe that we have to make recruitment a door through which everybody who wants to enter the institutions can enter. As I mentioned at the beginning, we have done a lot in this area. If you go to the ‘Guide to Open Competitions’ you will find specific information for candidates with disabilities. In every application form there is an access requirements form that can be filled in so if you have disabilities and you need any type of assistance you can get it. Dyslexia is also taken into account in EPSO competitions. As I mentioned, there exists all the elements to make sure that people can compete. What we have to do more of – and I recognise this – is to reach out to people with disabilities and encourage more of them to apply. On the topic of how many apply and what percentage are successful, we have quite accurate data. Out of about 30 000 applicants in the last competition, around 300 made it. Among them were seven people with disabilities. Obviously, if we want more to apply we have to be more open in terms of how we reach out to people with disabilities to make sure they understand that a career in the European institutions is a good career for them.  What worried me a lot in the staff survey when we got the results was that the staff engagement index for people who defined themselves as staff with disabilities was lower than the overall average for staff. In other words, people with disabilities do not feel that they are equally encouraged to engage in the institutions. That tells me that the institutions have to do more to engage with them.  I very much agree with all those who spoke about making sure that we remove barriers for people with disabilities when making an application, but also then to ensure that they can get promoted and to encourage them to progress in terms of applying their skills. That will be an area that we will look into very carefully in the new strategy.  I mentioned in the beginning that we do not have accurate data because of restrictions arising from the confidentiality of medical records. I am determined that we have to find a way to remove this restriction because we cannot rely only on self—identification if we want to be proactive and create conditions that allow people to work to their fullest ability and to grow within the Commission. But this is a question for which I do not have an answer today; a question that we intend to answer as we put forward the new strategy.  As regards the issue of the Staff Regulations, I heard loud and clear those who said that it is a very lousy excuse to state that the Staff Regulations do not allow you to have quotas. So I want to elaborate. I think there is a reason why the Staff Regulations do not allow us to have quotas; it can become a slippery slope. If we get quotas for people with disabilities, then there is pressure to have quotas on nationality and quotas on this and that. While each of these issues on their own may be very legitimate, once we go in the direction of creating a quota system on one criterion in an organisation where there is a very strong tendency to think of national quotas, I think we would see the merits, which has been a very strong factor in our decision-making, being undermined. Now I am not saying that we should not think of maybe applying quotas to only one segment, but I do not want to go into that before I am convinced that we are not going to resolve one problem and create another. But what should our level of ambition be? Well, many of you said what I believe should be our level of ambition. We have to be an example for the European Union. The European institutions have a responsibility to lead by example. In some of our Member States the quota system aims at between five and ten percent; I think the highest is in Germany. So we need to look at what would be the appropriate level of ambition to target as regards people with disabilities.  On self-identification, we are not in a very bad place because in the survey 5.7 % tell us that they have disabilities. Therefore, we have reached a certain order of magnitude. But is this real? We count on people telling us that they have disabilities; but we do not know. So we have to improve the data collection and we have to be able to say where we are and where we are headed. Where we are headed clearly has to be a good message to Europe. It is not just about people with disabilities. If you walk around the institutions, we have a way to go in terms of the presence of minorities and in terms of women in management positions. There is scope for us to make ourselves more diverse than we currently are. How far are we going to go? Obviously I do not want to promise a very rapid change with immediate effect, because a big organisation is a bit like the Queen Mary; you make a policy change and it takes time for this change to be reflected in the composition of our staff.  We are determined and I would obviously support you. You will see me coming here again on this topic. I am sure you will bring me here again. It is an area where I very much value your encouragement for us to do something. We owe it not just to disabled people, but we owe it to Europe to be the place of values that we have been embracing over the decades.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 216, "date": "2015-04-15.json", "name": "Ryszard CZARNECKI", "mepid": "28372", "text": "  Thank you very much Commissioner.

As the employment rate for people with disabilities ranges around 50% and higher employment for people with disabilities is needed in the EU, the European Commission should establish a legislative framework that would encourage a positive change to a greater extent.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 238, "date": "2015-04-15.json", "name": "Andrej PLENKOVIĆ", "mepid": "112755", "text": "  Written. - The integration of persons with disabilities is one of the biggest challenges of social and labour policy and should be one of the priorities in European labour legislation in order to reinforce the generally accepted principles of respecting diversity, providing equal opportunities and fostering the personal development of each individual.

I wish firstly to state that the Commission has always been committed to finding a legally sound European solution to the issue of transmitting PNR data for flights between the European Union and Mexico. Mexico has had legislation in force since November 2012 requiring all air carriers operating flights to and from Mexico to transmit PNR data. The competent authority in Mexico was therefore under the obligation from that date onwards to impose fines on those air carriers that do not transmit PNR data. Mexico tells us that EU carriers are the only ones not providing PNR data to the Mexican authorities. However, the Mexican legislation has not yet been enforced with regard to EU traffic, because the Commission has asked the competent authority in Mexico to postpone the imposition of fines on several occasions. But the competent authority in Mexico made it clear earlier this year that the final deadline for transferring PNR data was 1 April 2015. At this point it is important to mention Parliament’s decision in November last year to seek the opinion of the Court of Justice on whether the draft PNR agreement with Canada is compatible with the EU treaties. This opinion is not expected before the end of the year. The Commission therefore sought a further postponement of the 1 April 2015 deadline until such time as the Court of Justice issues its opinion. The competent authority in Mexico finally agreed to postpone the deadline until July 2015, provided that the European Union commits to start formal negotiations with a view to an agreement. I therefore, as soon as possible, intend to suggest to the College of Commissioners that the Commission request a mandate from the Council to formally open negotiations for a PNR agreement between the European Union and Mexico. It is clear that we will need to take into account the criteria and standards set out in the Court of Justice ruling on data retention of April 2014. This approach has been welcomed by Mexico and has enabled the Commission to secure the postponement of the sanctions from 1 April to 1 July of this year. The Commission should have a Council mandate to start negotiating before 1 July 2015. I have made it clear that negotiations on a PNR agreement with Mexico cannot be finalised before the Court of Justice has issued its opinion on the draft PNR agreement with Canada.

I would ask the Commissioner whether there is any reaction from the Council. It would be interesting to know that, because it is not a proposal that has only been in place since yesterday, but one that we have known a little longer. So the Council should now also come to a decision to give the Commission a negotiating mandate, so that we can then come to an end as soon as possible in the area of a PNR agreement with Mexico, in line with the opinion that the ECJ will give. Personally, I regret for the PPE-DE that we have some delay, because we ultimately have this problem. I thought we could decide for ourselves politically. However, it is essential for me that, on 1 July, we do not see our airlines in a situation where they have to pay USD 30,000 per flight, because this makes the de facto competitiveness of European airlines flying towards Mexico completely impossible.

Mr President, I would like to thank the We have just heard that the legislation in Mexico on the receipt of PNR data is not new. However, I do not remember that, since 2002, we have been pushing for an agreement to be reached, and I would say for good reasons. European data protection law is clear: without a legal basis, the transfer of European data to third countries is illegal. On the one hand, I welcome the fact that Mexico is not currently demanding fines from European airlines that comply with this right. On the other hand, in the face of such demands, the question arises as to what is really at stake: better prosecution or simply economic interests? However, when the Commission is given a mandate by the Council to negotiate with Mexico, it must of course be borne in mind – as has been mentioned – that the European Court of Justice is currently subjecting the draft PNR agreement between the EU and Canada to a review of fundamental rights. This was necessary because, in its judgment on data retention, the European Court of Justice established a new and particularly rigorous fundamental rights check for bulk data storage. This House has doubts as to whether the agreement can meet these new requirements and has therefore referred the draft text to Luxembourg. Thus, no PNR agreement may be negotiated before the ECJ has delivered its opinion on the EU-Canada agreement. By the way, the negotiations with Canada have dragged on for more than five years. And – as Mr Avramopoulos has already mentioned – I too am sure that the ECJ will finish its opinion much more quickly. We also need clear principles for PNR agreements with third countries. After the negotiations on an agreement with Australia, some had believed that this could serve as a model for others. However, even the agreement with the United States contained less good conditions and received less support here in the European Parliament. A number of other countries, such as Russia, the United Arab Emirates and South Korea, are already knocking on the door, and it is precisely when third countries with weak data protection regimes want data that uniform and high minimum standards are indispensable. Finally, the Treaty of Lisbon gives the European Parliament the final say on international agreements.

I also welcome the massive presence of the Council, who are clearly very interested in the matter. I have a lot of questions, Commissioner, and I have a lot of confidence in your contacts with the Mexicans. However, you know that legislation has been in place in Mexico since November 2012. Some of the colleagues here said that we have failed to raise the issue. Well, I would like to give you a little selection here of the actions that I have taken. On 31 May 2013, I tabled written questions to the Commission on Russia’s demand for Passenger Name Record (PNR) data, asking the Commission also which other third countries intended to collect PNR data. We got a reply that by then Qatar, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Oman, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Japan and South Korea also showed an interest in PNR systems. Somewhat later we learned of the deadline set by Mexico, which was for 1 January 2014. So, on 5 December 2013 – a month before the deadline – I put parliamentary questions to the Commission regarding the deadline and did not get any satisfactory reply. However, the deadline was postponed until 30 September 2014. On 9 April 2014, I wrote a letter both to the Commission and the Council on the urgency of third countries asking for PNR, including Mexico and the other countries. On 18 September 2014, I wrote a letter to the Commission specifically on Mexico PNR because confusion had arisen concerning the date of the Mexico PNR deadline. I got a reply from the Commission in mid-October stating that the new deadline was set for 1 January 2015, etc., etc. The rest is history. On 9 March 2015, I raised it in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs. So yes, colleagues, we have raised the matter and I completely fail to understand why the Commission and the current Commissioner’s predecessors have been sitting on their hands ever since. Two further questions: it is clear that even if the postponement of the deadline to 1 July 2015 is very welcome, we are not going to have an agreement by then. What will the Commission do in order to ensure the legal protection of citizens on the one hand and avoiding heavy fines for carriers on the other? Incidentally, I know that not only have I been asking questions but the countries concerned and the carriers have almost been imploring the European Commission to act, and the Commission has not. We have also asked questions about Mexico passing on PNR data to the United States. We have not got an answer to that. Finally, I would like to know from the Commission: how are you going to fill the gap? How are you going to ensure protection for citizens and carriers? What action is the Commission going to take regarding the other countries that I mentioned, such as Russia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and other friendly nations? Then I would like to get a full report on the situation regarding those other countries.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 254, "date": "2015-04-15.json", "name": "Cornelia ERNST", "mepid": "96852", "text": "  Mr President, I would like to like to sanendour sto -- on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

Mr President, I think it is very clear, and the Commissioner underlined this, that there is no way that in this Parliament we will get an agreement before we have the opinion of the European Court of Justice on the Canada agreement, because this is a matter of principle that we have to discuss not only in the context of this agreement, but also of several other agreements which are in place or remain to be negotiated, and with regard to our own laws on the retention and analysis of Passenger Name Records (PNR). Here we come to the principle: in our constitutional framework, in our Treaty and in the Charter of Fundamental Rights it is written that there is a fundamental right to data protection and a constitutional principle which states that every intrusion into this fundamental right needs to be justified. In a democratic society, it has to be necessary. That means that we have to discuss how far the collection and analysis of Passenger Name Records, like any other personal data, is justified. We need to discuss whether it is really justified to collect and analyse automatically all data for all passengers, or if instead we should focus on threat, risk and suspicion and demand that those principles be respected by our partners who demand from us that our citizens send data. This is because everything we agree on, and every agreement with third countries, always needs to be based on our Treaty, on our Charter of Fundamental Rights and our constitutional principles.

At the same time, however, in view of this refusal, we have seen that they risk exposing themselves to heavy financial penalties which the Mexican authorities are threatening to impose. We believe that the use of the threat of onerous fines is not only to be strongly condemned, because it actually forces the decision-making and negotiating power of the European institutions, but that it may also set a dangerous precedent, given that already many other third countries, such as South Korea and the United Arab Emirates, Russia are praying for the conclusion of PNR agreements with the European Union. The European Union has now concluded pnr data transfer agreements with the United States, Canada and Australia. We know that before giving its assent to the ratification of the agreement, the European Parliament recently referred the agreement itself to the Court of Justice for an opinion on its compatibility with European data protection legislation. Of course, this issue is extremely sensitive: even in recent days, with regard to the debate on the European PNR, a number of critical issues and concerns have emerged in relation to the protection of fundamental rights, in particular the protection of personal data and freedom of movement. There are many points which deserve further study and which have led to the Commission's request for a ruling on the substance of the matter on compatibility with the judgment of the European Court of Justice, which declared the directive on retention of data to be unlawful for breach of the principle of proportionality in the balance between the right to data protection and public security requirements. It is first necessary to identify what is meant by PNR data, that is, what kind of data are intended to be included and therefore transferred; that there are criteria for differentiating the duration of data retention; that there are substantial and procedural preconditions for access to data; and finally, which authorities are responsible for accessing and processing the data. It is therefore clear that the examination of these criteria requires time and caution. The caution of public security, in the name of which the transfer of PNR data is strongly requested, cannot put the protection of fundamental rights in the alternative. We therefore ask the Commission what measures it intends to take to ensure that the transfer of PNR data to Mexico is in line with European data protection rules; whether it intends to take steps to ensure that air carriers do not risk high fines or the withdrawal of landing rights when Mexican legislation comes into force. And finally, if you are aware of a sharing agreement between Mexico, the United States and Canada and, if so, what consequences this agreement will have with regard to the personal data transferred by air carriers to the Mexican authorities, and above all what possible legal remedies European citizens will have in the event of a violation of their rights relating to the processing of personal data.

The threat of terrorism, say governments, threatens us all and therefore different measures are needed. One of the most important of these measures is that governments, or at least many governments, are able to exchange data and registration data on passengers involved in air traffic. I think that this is an important initiative, but at the same time I also think that this important initiative must not lead to the surrender of the fundamental rights on which the European Union, the European Community, is built. We must respect privacy, the protection of personal data and ensure effective remedies. And at least since I saw on television John Oliver's \"Last Week Tonight\" show interviewing Edward Snowden, who talked about how this data is being moved between Ireland and the United States, I have been at least skeptical about whether these results, these passenger name records, actually respect fundamental human rights.  Nevertheless, I think it is very important that Mexico wants to join this agreement, I think it is important that we take this seriously, that we start negotiations as soon as possible, that we achieve results as soon as possible. At the same time, we must not conclude or sign conventions that do not comply with European law, European law and European standards. I therefore think that it is very important to wait for the legal procedure for the Agreement between the European Union and Canada to be completed, so that there is a reliable result, a legally clear, clear, unambiguous resolution, and then we will be able to conclude the agreement with other countries outside Europe.

In all these discussions, the term PNR keeps popping up in a variety of contexts. We have dealt with this intensively in the resolution on the fight against terrorism. Of course, PNR is an interference with fundamental rights. Violations of fundamental rights must be accepted under certain conditions in the fight against terrorism, but they must be in line with the case law, they must be case-by-case and proportionate. I have the impression that sometimes, even under a certain amount of pressure, agreements are concluded very lightly and quickly and that they do not focus so much on the quality of these agreements. As a result, these various pieces of legislation will then be viewed critically and repealed, as we have seen with data retention. That is why, in November 2014, we decided in this House that we wanted to submit the passenger data agreement with Canada to the ECJ, because we had serious concerns, particularly in the area of data protection. I agree with my colleague, Mrs Sippel, that it actually makes sense to wait and not to take another quick shot straight away. If we consider that this discussion is now also taking place from the point of view that we are actually being pressured from outside, then we have a kind of foreign-determinedness in our own discussions on issues that we have to decide ourselves. I am bothered by the time pressure. What is the difference between July and December? I am bothered by the nature of this blackmail. Not even the United States has threatened us. This is the first time that anyone has threatened us.

Speaking in English again, I would first of all once again like to express my thanks for this exchange of views. For me it was very useful and I am grateful to all those who took the floor. Given the remarks you made and the questions you asked, I would like once again to make it clear that the concerns and the role of Parliament are respected. The negotiations on a PNR agreement with Mexico cannot be finalised before the Court of Justice has issued its opinion on the draft PNR agreement with Canada.  I would like also to comment on what Ms in tʼVeld said. As I explained, provided that we formally start negotiations with Mexico, they will suspend the fines. It was very clear on their side. My intention is to launch them myself at the end of June. There is goodwill from the Mexican authorities and mutual commitment to reach a legally sound agreement. Since I was the one who negotiated with the Mexican authorities, I can tell you – and I can assure you – that I did not feel that I was being blackmailed. On the contrary, I found interlocutors of good faith. Ms Hohlmeier also made a point which I would like to make reference to. As you know, I discussed my strategy with the Ministers of the Interior in the Justice and Home Affairs Council and the Ministers who spoke welcomed this approach. I am receiving positive signals from Member States in all my contacts.  As I said at the beginning, this is a firm choice to work towards a European solution, a European approach which guarantees more efficiently both the security and the protection of the fundamental rights of citizens. We are already working towards a consistent approach, Ms in tʼ Veld, for all future PNR requests. We will discuss this in the framework of the EU agenda on security.  Finally, it is important to engage with our partners on security issues, and Mexico is one of them. I listened to your comments about Mexico. Let me tell you that, as I said at the beginning, the Mexican authorities are determined to work very closely with us and they have given the necessary assurances on the protection of all this data. Anyway, we shall come back very soon and I look forward to an official discussion on the matter. Mr Weidenholzer also made a remark which I would like to comment on. It is true that I come to the European Parliament very often – not just because of the nature of my dossier, and the fact that I really need to discuss matters with you, but also because deep down inside me I have never stopped feeling a parliamentarian myself.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 278, "date": "2015-04-15.json", "name": "Ryszard CZARNECKI", "mepid": "28372", "text": "   Thank you very much, Commissioner, for this important statement on an extremely important issue that appalls many of us, and we are pleased that the Lord has come to us again.

It is important that the French Government, in submitting its application for financial assistance from the EGF, for EUR 6 052 200 or 60% of the total costs, has clearly interpreted the additional nature of the support requested. In fact, actions are planned to benefit from the other complementary EU legislative and budgetary instruments, inserted in order to ensure an efficient and integrated use of resources.

This regulation allows the trucks of these foreign companies to take advantage of an international transport in France to carry out in addition three operations of loading and unloading goods, before returning to their country. However, Companies in Eastern Europe give their drivers much lower wages than French drivers, not to mention payroll taxes. This is why more and more customers prefer to use their services.

It also recalled the competence of the Member States to organise and finance social security and supported the following four general objectives of the Commission's global objective of modernising social protection systems: firstly, to ensure that work is paid and guaranteed. secondly, to seek guarantee pensions and the establishment of sustainable pension systems; thirdly, promoting social inclusion, and fourthly, ensuring high-quality sustainable and accessible health care for all.

In the proposal for the change of the mandate, the extension is linked to the cycle of the European Semester, including also country-specific recommendations. The European Semester is a fundamentally undemocratic pact. Its focus is supposedly to avoid economic boom and bust cycles, and is aimed at restoring economic growth to the EU. However, there is no mention of equitable growth and poverty reduction. It shows a clear disconnect between European bureaucrats and the reality that is facing millions of struggling working families in Ireland and right across the EU.

But today, 100 years later, the Turkish government is still aggressively denying the genocide. Prime Minister Davutoglu openly accused the Holy Father, Pope Francis, who spoke clearly of racism and xenophobia.

My people in the last century experienced genocide by German Nazism, Soviet communism and Ukrainian nationalism. The destruction of intelligence, the shooting of prisoners, mass executions, pacification of villages and, finally, the construction of a system of German concentration camps were aimed at realizing plans to destroy the Polish people. Katyn, Kharkiv, Twer, Kiev and Minsk in 1940 became the places of the polish officers killed by the Soviets for being the Polish elite. More than 250,000 Poles from Volynia, Podola, Polesia and Malopolska East three years later became victims of the brutal genocide perished by Ukrainian nationalists.

This contingent has suffered, throughout history, a strong discrimination, culminating in one of the most significant systematic persecutions ever carried out in Europe, the persecution that occurred during World War II by the weight of Nazi racial ideology, leading hundreds of thousands of Roma to concentration camps, exposing this minority to aggressive forms of violence, exploitation, genocide (500,000 dead) and general stigmatisation of them , something that endures to this day.
