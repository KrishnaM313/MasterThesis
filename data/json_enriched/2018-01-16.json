In the words of the Irish poet Seamus Heaney, I wished that hope and history would rhyme again for Europe. I did not simply a read out the motto of our Presidency, ‘unity through balance’. I was confident that everyone working for the Presidency would do their best to find consensus in working parties, at the Council meetings or at trilogues with you. I was truly moved to see just how devoted the Member States, the Commission and Parliament were to the same code. There were hundreds of sometimes difficult debates, but all parties were also always determined to reach an agreement. There was a desire to find solutions that would support and develop the freedoms that European citizens enjoy today. I would like to express my gratitude to you all for showing this solidarity, because strength is in unity. It is often noted that EU Member States are very different in size, culture and climate. Some of us have a few hours of daylight in winter and others have more sun than snow. Still, the region we share for a better future is the same. Although the European Union is growing stronger and more united, let us not forget that after the Brexit referendum and before key elections in Europe, the year was full of confusion and pessimism. The political course set in Bratislava, Malta, Rome and also in Tallinn during the Digital Summit last September has allowed us to overcome this rough patch. The European Union has turned a new page. I sincerely wish to thank all the EU Member States and citizens for that. There is much to be satisfied with. We have finally reached a point where all of Europe is feeling the benefits of economic recovery. Now it is my wish that every European has the freedom to live their lives to the fullest in a safe, strong and competitive Europe. This begins with an open and innovation—led economy that supports competitiveness, jobs and businesses. European enterprises will continue to be stimulated by the extension of the mandate of the European Fund for Strategic Investments or, more simply, by the Juncker fund, as it has become known. From 2019, paying value-added tax on sales of goods across borders will become easier for entrepreneurs. We also decided that international tax rules had to be updated in a way that would ensure fair taxation and digital economy enterprises. I am proud that, in the past six months, free trade negotiations with Japan have been concluded, new negotiations have been launched with Chile, and we are very close to starting talks with New Zealand and Australia. The positive effect of trade on Europe’s growth and jobs cannot be overestimated. Since the signing of the Treaty of Rome, the free movement of goods, services, capital and people has been the cornerstone of the European Union. But if we want to ensure that every European is free to enjoy what Europe has to offer in the digital age, Europe must keep up with technological progress and make it work in our favour. With good reason, the Estonian Presidency has been called a digital presidency. Promoting the digital dimension in all EU policy areas was our main priority. In addition to telecommunications, infrastructure, markets and cyber security, the idea that our future will be digital also underpinned legal cooperation, energy, internal security, defence, agriculture, space and many other areas. I hope that this approach will also appear in the European Union’s next budget and in other activities over the next few years. Digital Europe is now a goal for all of Europe. We reached a common understanding on this issue with European Union leaders during the Tallinn Digital Summit. I would like to thank President Tajani and President Juncker for their participation and valuable contribution at the summit. Europe has to seize the momentum and make use of new technology to regain our place in the world as a leading digital society. I am also particularly pleased that the EU is already developing new rules to allow non-personal data to move easily across borders and thus boost the EU data economy. At the very end of the Estonian Presidency we agreed on a mandate to launch negotiations with the European Parliament on this important proposal. I would like to urge you to make this a priority issue and complete the work on all digital single market files this year. I would very much like to highlight one of our joint forward-looking projects, namely the first ever electronic signing of a European Union legal act. I would like to thank President Tajani and Secretary—General Klaus Welle for their commitment. I am confident that electronic signing of documents will soon become common in the European Union. During the Estonian Presidency, landmark decisions were made in defence cooperation, climate policy and the social dimension. They all have significant structural and long-term effects. Twenty—five Member States have decided to join the permanent structured cooperation in the field of defence. They are committed to increasing their defence expenditure and carrying out several joint projects such as simplifying and speeding up military transport in Europe. The European Union has demonstrated its determination to implement the Paris Agreement. Climate change is slow but it will influence the freedoms and quality of life of future generations. Today, after the One Planet Summit organised on the initiative of President Macron and after depositing our Doha amendment ratification instruments at the end of the year, we have every reason to be proud of our global leadership. I would also like to personally thank the rapporteurs for all their work: Ms Julie Girling, who worked on the Emission Trading System, Mr Gerben-Jan Gerbrandy, who was the rapporteur for the Effort Sharing Regulation, and Mr Norbert Lins, who worked on the Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry Regulation. Together we demonstrated that the European Union will continue to play a leading role. We care about our grandchildren and about the only planet we all share. The discussions about a social Europe during the Social Summit in Gothenburg, the signing of the European Pillar of Social Rights and the agreement of new rules for posted workers expressed the shared values and unity of the European Union. We will continue to strengthen our relations with our neighbours. They are essential for maintaining the peace and freedom that we know today. As Mr Tunne Kelam stressed in July, we set the Eastern Partnership as a horizontal priority to increase our cooperation across sectors. I am proud that the Eastern Partnership and the EU—African Union summits were successful, as evidenced by their joint declarations, which, among other things, set practical common goals. I want to thank President Tusk and President Juncker for their hard work and commitment before, during and after the summits. Specific projects in the field of economy, connectivity and education, as well as digital affairs, will improve the lives of millions of people and help to stabilise our neighbourhood. I have hopes that the Bulgarian Presidency will continue this work, especially in the Western Balkans region, where we can hopefully give a new impetus to our enlargement policy. At the beginning of the Estonian Presidency we set the goal of reducing immigration pressure on the external borders of the European Union, improving border management and handling the aftermath of the migration crisis. Thus we have moved from crisis management to migration management. We are no longer putting out fires, but are instead focusing on long-term solutions. Good examples of this are the EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa and the foreign investment plan, which aims to reduce the causes of migration. During our presidency we concentrated on closing the central Mediterranean route and developed a practical implementation plan for this purpose. In this respect I would particularly like to praise the work of the Italian Government. We continue to work on the reform of the common European asylum system. It is a real challenge, but with a joint effort we have made progress and I am convinced that we will find a solution under the Bulgarian Presidency. In Europe, we do not need to present our passport when crossing internal borders. To be able to enjoy a Europe without internal borders and to reduce the threat of terrorists we are focused on cooperation in protecting our external borders. Thanks to our common efforts, the European Union entry-exit system and, with some additional work, the European travel information and authorisation system will become operational in 2020. The interoperability of information systems and the improved quality of data exchanges, in accordance with the European Union data protection rules, are some of the efficient tools at our disposal for preventing and fighting various types of crime. I would also appreciate it if I could say some words in Estonian. Head sõbrad! Peatselt saja aastaseks saava Eesti Vabariigi põhiseaduse preambul sätestab, et Eesti riik on rajatud vabadusele, õiglusele ja õigusele. Need on kolm üdini euroopalikku mõistet,  just selliselt seatuna moodustavad nad meie ühiste väärtuste alusmüüri. Väikeriikide olemasolu Euroopas on nende põhimõtete parim kinnitus. Eesistumine oli meie kord, meie võimalus täita oma kohust Euroopa ees täie pühendumusega ja heas koostöös. Seetõttu ma tänan kõikide institutsioonide juhte, eriti teid, Antonio, Jean-Claude, ja ülemkogu eesistujat Donald Tuski selle pühendumise eest. Samuti kõiki teid siin saalis oluliste arutelude ja tulemuste eest. Suur tänu, austatud Euroopa Parlamendi saadikud! Südamest tunnustan ka kõiki töökaid ning meie ühise Euroopa tulevikust siiralt hoolivaid Eesti ametnikke ja poliitikuid, kes Tallinnas, Brüsselis ja kõikjal Euroopas meie eesistumise edusse panustasid. Samuti loomulikult Eesti eriesindajat härra Matti Maasikat. Ma usun, et mu hea kolleegi Bojko Borisovi juhtimisel ja Bulgaaria eesistumise egiidi „Ühtsus teeb meid tugevaks“ all jõuame lõpetada ka selle töö, mis jäi meil ühiselt pooleli.

All the Estonian civil servants were excellent, with a very successful and very European presence. It was one of the best-prepared and most professionally-run presidencies I can remember. Once again, my long-held belief that smaller countries really do make for the best presidencies has been confirmed. They are more natural bridge builders, and more likely to look for consensus. Estonia proved me right. You were able, Mr Prime Minister, to reach agreement on a number of priority files, and to make progress in other areas where we needed it. Most importantly, this set the tone for 2018, because 2018 must become a year of delivery for a better future. Thanks to this House, and in large part thanks to the tireless work of Prime Minister Ratas and others, we signed last month a new joint declaration on the EU’s legislative priorities for 2018-2019. This gives all of us the platform to show that Europe can deliver for its citizens when and where it matters, to build a stronger, more united and more democratic Union. This is the approach that the Estonian Presidency took throughout the last six months. Mr President, Mr Prime Minister! As the Estonian Presidency, you have proven yourself to be a true future presidency, also by placing an issue on the agenda that deserves not only all of our attention, but also all of our actions. The better we position ourselves digitally today, the greater our successes will be tomorrow. The capital Tallinn was just the right place for a digital summit. There we agreed that we need to advance the digital single market, as it has enormous potential. Every year it could contribute 415 billion euros to the European economy. For the Commission this was - the digital one Internal market - a priority since the beginning of our mandate. The Commission presented a total of 24 initiatives in this area, 11 of which have since been passed into legislative agreements. In order to keep up with global competition - and the Estonian Presidency has created the right atmosphere for this step - we will also invest one billion euros in world-class supercomputers and thus ensure European independence in this area. Your digital presidency, Prime Minister, has finally given the still reluctant Member States digital momentum. Thanks to your efforts, we have made great progress, including making it easier to shop and trade across borders in the future. All actors have agreed on rules that enable more transparent and affordable prices for cross-border parcel delivery and end geoblocking. At the same time, the Estonian Presidency advanced the discussion for more security on the Internet and for a better infrastructure. As much as we see digital innovations, opportunities and successes ahead of us, it is just as important to the Commission that we also pay attention to the responsibility that comes with it. The protection of our data is a basic requirement for Europe's digital self-assertion. But responsibility also means justice. It is a matter of fairness that all companies - including digital giants - pay their share of the tax in the country in which they generate their profits. So far this has not been the case. While the effective tax burden for traditional companies is 23%, it is only 10% for digital companies. That has to change and that will change. With the European Investment Plan, we are doing just that, and with success. We have approved more than 357 projects in all 28 Member States. Already now we are mobilizing an estimated 256 billion euros in investments in the future. We want to continue this success and I am therefore glad that this House gave the green light in December not only to extend the EFSI until the end of 2020, but also to increase the targeted investment volume from 315 billion to 500 billion. Monsieur le Président, Monsieur le Premier ministre, Mesdames, Messieurs, nous avons également pu réaliser, pendant la présidence estoniane, des avancées remarquables dans le domaine de l’Europe sociale. Le sommet social de Göteborg fut un moment, je ne dirais pas “historique”, mais un moment d’unité et de détermination collective, non pas renouvelées, mais retrouvées. La responsabilité de la mise en œuvre du socle est naturellement partagée entre les États membres et l’Union européenne. Le socle ne doit pas rester un poème, mais doit être traduit en réalité, et je fais référence ici à la directive sur l'équilibre entre vie professionnelle et vie privée, à la directive sur les conditions de travail et à d'autres textes que nous venons de présenter, y compris - ce sera fait bientôt - le nouveau tableau de bord social qui accompagnera la mise en œuvre du socle des droits sociaux. Je voudrais nous féliciter du fait que les points de vue entre le Parlement et la Commission, pour ce qui est de la révision de la directive “détachement”, ont fait des progrès considérables; seuls quelques millimètres nous séparent d’une approche commune et je voudrais que le Conseil se rallie rapidement à l’accord qui se dessine entre le Parlement et la Commission, ce qui nous permettra de poursuivre la mise en application du socle. The première initiative que nous allons prendre sous peu est la mise en place d’une autorité européenne du travail. Voilà Jüri, do as fait un bon travail. The commission essayait de ne pas perdre le souffle, puisque vous êtes allés rapidement. C’est très bien, c’était très très bien.

Not only for what they have achieved, but also for what they have proved that Estonia is, and what the European Union is. They have given proof of the fact that in the European Union small nations can be just as big as big nations through efficiency and decisiveness. But let me also make a personal reflection. I once had the opportunity to mobilise popular support in Sweden for the independence of the Baltic States. I first visited Tallinn in Estonia quite a long time ago, when you had to pass a KGB border control and you had to use the rouble. And today, under this presidency, Tallinn has been one of the capitals of Europe. That is a fantastic thing, but for me this also demonstrates the absolute best of the European Union: what we can achieve by remaining together and letting the ideas of freedom and democracy show their immense value. For this we shall all be grateful to you. But also for all the things you have achieved regarding the digital agenda, reforms and initiatives for cyber-security and streamlining and opening up in preparation for the digital economy. This goes beyond what can be expected of a single presidency. This is a long-term task and a long-term challenge for us all, but Estonia has taken the lead because it are one of the most digital nations and one of the most modernising countries in this respect. Estonia has also laid the groundwork for progress towards greater defence and military cooperation, by signing the decision on permanent structured cooperation on security and defence, for example. The presidency’s priorities also include an open innovative European economy, a safe and secure Europe, a digital Europe and an inclusive and sustainable Europe. These are not only its priorities, they shall be our priorities for a long time in the future because we need to be successful. So once again, thank you very much.

Presidencies come and go every six months - a routine process. However, it is important for the Union who holds the presidency and how it is exercised. There are presidencies that constantly make themselves known, talk about themselves, and there are presidencies that don't push themselves to the fore. The latter are mostly the efficient and successful ones. The Estonian Presidency has silently guided, forward-looking and inclusive European affairs in line with the motto under which it has placed its presidency: Unity through balance. With this performance, Estonia has given itself the most important gift for the centenary of its independence. During the Estonian Presidency, important decisions were made: Brexit was put on the rails. At least now we know what we're talking about. The idea that Europe will find a common defense doctrine has also taken shape. Much is still open and unclear. Above all, Estonia has made a decisive contribution to driving the digital agenda. The digital summit in Tallinn was the highlight of your presidency and we have come a very, very big step closer to the goal of a digital single market. In this sense, Europe has become Estonian. Of course, Prime Minister, we are not yet as far as you wanted when you took office in June, for the free movement of data to become the fifth fundamental freedom. Something else is needed, but others put the brakes on, it wasn't you. And it also slowed others down on other problems that we would also have liked to have solved.

I want to say that in the name of all colleagues since you have not done it yourself. It is scandalous. First of all, Prime Minister, congratulations. I think what you did is an impressive achievement – the Paris Agreement implementation, the launch of the European Defence Union, agreements on the European Public Prosecutor, steps forward on the trade agenda, and then the digital summit. People are always asking me how is it possible that Estonia is capable of doing all that, and I always say that it is because for 30 years in a row now – yes, Jean-Claude – they have had liberal leadership, and I think it has something to do with that. The advantage in Estonia is that liberals are in government and are also leading the opposition. In fact I think it is an ideal situation for progress. But yes, there is a real opposition, and Mr Ratas can certainly testify to that.  What is important now is that we take this digital agenda further. Take, for example, the practices of Apple now, closing down models. I think Commissioner Ansip has to investigate this, and go against this. Secondly, we also need to go further in this digital agenda on the issue of the single regulator. We will never have a single digital market if we do not have a single regulator in Europe.

Mr Ratas, you come from a small country. I don’t know what you have in common with me politically, but you have the future of your three children to think of, as do I. As someone who comes from a small country, you appreciate the fact that you are independent. In 1991 with great celebrations, and rightfully so, you celebrated your freedom from the Soviet Union, and you have done very well since. As many speakers have said here and pointed towards, small nations can do very well. It is in that light and on that topic that I have to say that there is one part I am a little bit disappointed about, in fact very disappointed, because something massive happened during your Presidency and a nation did attempt to get free. Catalonia attempted to get free. They had a referendum, but you made a very glib statement on it. Spain is a democratic state based on the rule of law. Where was the rule of law when people were being beaten up at polling stations? Where was the rule of law when people were bloodied, when people were denied their democratic right? Is it the case that having celebrated your own freedom, and rightfully so, and got free and done well out of it, that now you have pulled up the drawbridge and you have forgotten about others?

I am impressed both by the European commitment and by the professionalism that you and your teams have shown over the past six months, and you have once again demonstrated that these are the qualities, rather than the size of the country, which are the best guarantee of the success of a presidency. I find myself dreaming that the three Baltic countries and the three Benelux countries are joining their efforts and their vision to jointly offer solutions for the European Union.

For the first time, digital signing of EU legislation was carried out, a successful digital summit was held in Tallinn and both geoblocking and free movement of data were agreed. These regulations remove location-based restrictions on e-commerce as well as unjustified location-based restrictions on data. Hopefully, the Estonian Presidency was able to generate interest and will for the gradual development of digital issues in the EU and the Member States. Estonia was also successful on environmental and energy issues, agreeing on an emissions trading scheme, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and all four clean energy legislation included in the clean energy package. In agriculture, Estonia can be proud of the mid-term review of agricultural policy, ie the omnibus regulation, which set out new crisis management measures. The elements of simplification and greater flexibility for the Member States are very important here, because it is young farmers who will always need more in rural areas. An agreement was also reached on an organic regulation, which will introduce common standards and thus create better controls on imports and improve the availability of organic seed and plant propagating material that meets the needs of organic farming.

Before reporting on the main outcomes of the European Council, I want to highlight that during the December Summit, 25 Member States launched permanent structured cooperation in defence. The European Union must be both visionary and pragmatic if it is to be effective. More than half a century ago, an ambitious vision of the European Defence Community was created, but what was missing was the unity and courage to put it into practice. Now, the dream is becoming a reality. Permanent Structured Cooperation on security and defence (PESCO) is the practical expression of our common will to build a European defence system. It shows that the Union moves forward when we combine ambition and pragmatism. Last September, I proposed a new working method to leaders, with the intention of speeding up decision-making in the Council and tackling quite deliberately the tough issues in the areas where we are deadlocked. December was the first real test of this. We made a good start, with frank, open and constructive discussions on migration and the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). In addition, we took concrete decisions on Brexit, defence and a further extension of sanctions against Russia. I am proud to know that Europeans have stood united together with the Ukrainian people against Russian aggression for three-and-a-half years, and we will stay the course. On migration, Member States responded well and generously to our request to refinance the North of Africa window of the EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa, and I would like to thank those governments who made it possible. However, irregular migration will remain a challenge for decades, not years, and therefore we need a structural solution in the form of a stable and predictable EU funding instrument. I propose to the leaders that we establish a permanent financing mechanism within the next Multiannual Financial Framework to stem the flows of illegal migration. Today I can report to this House that there was univocal agreement on the need to establish such a mechanism. We will discuss it in more detail at our summit in February. The internal dimension of the migration debate was, as expected, less consensual, although it confirmed the hierarchy of our aims: protecting our territory and keeping our promise never again to allow a return to the crisis of 2015 come first. Additionally, while everyone accepts the need for solidarity, there is currently no consensus on what it should mean in practice. The challenge now is how to express the principle of solidarity so that all Member States contribute in concrete terms and in a fair manner. All the leaders agreed to work hard to find a compromise by June. We will assess progress in March. On the EMU, the Euro Summit discussed ways and means to reform our economic and monetary union, with a view to taking a first set of decisions in June. Leaders agreed with my proposal to focus efforts on what is realistic while continuing discussions on the long-term ideas. In this regard, in the next six months, the work by Finance Ministers in the Eurogroup and in the Ecofin Council will concentrate on areas where the discussion is more advanced, namely on the completion of the banking union, and further developing the European Social Fund (ESF). If we achieve these two objectives, we will significantly strengthen the resilience of the EMU, which is my major goal. Discussions, including among the euro-area leaders, will also continue on those ideas that are less developed and have a longer-term perspective. For that reason, I have called the Euro Summit for March. Finally, on Brexit, leaders decided unanimously that sufficient progress had been achieved on the first phase, with citizens’ rights, Ireland and the financial settlement as priorities. Accordingly, the EU27 adopted the first set of guidelines for the next phase of the talks. This would not have been possible without the unity of the EU27, the hard work of Michel Barnier, and the constructive efforts of Prime Minister May. As regards our future relations, what we need today is more clarity on the UK’s vision. Once we have that, the leaders will meet and decide on the way that they see the EU’s future relationship with the UK as a third country. It also means a new set of guidelines. The hardest work is still ahead of us and time is limited. We must maintain the unity of the EU27 in every scenario and, personally, I have no doubt that we will. If the UK Government sticks to its decision to leave, Brexit will become a reality, with all its negative consequences, in March next year, unless there is a change of heart among our British friends. (Applause) Was it not David Davis himself who said, ‘if a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy’? We, here on the continent, have not had a change of heart.

C’est la raison pour laquelle j’appelle ce Parlement à arrêter au plus vite sa position sur notre proposition de programme européen de développement industriel dans le domaine de la défense. Il est essentiel que les négociations avec le Conseil s’ouvrent rapidement afin que les premiers projets des capacités de défense puissent être financés en 2019. Je voudrais aussi souligner que le volet recherche du fonds européen de la défense est déjà bien avancé. Le 22 décembre dernier, la Commission a accordé une première subvention à un projet de recherche collaborative visant à identifier, pour le secteur de la défense, les principales tendances à venir dans le domaine des technologies innovantes, domaine qui, vous le savez, évolue très rapidement. D’autres projets suivront bientôt. Mr President, the December European Council was an opportunity for the leaders to have an honest debate on migration. It was a time to show the progress made over the last three years, because there has been progress. Europe has shown that it can act quickly and decisively when it matters, saving lives at sea, setting up a European border and coastguard, reducing arrivals and being a continent of solidarity. The point is not to say that there is no work to do in this area. It is to show that a comprehensive European approach is the solution to our common challenges. This was not a European Council to talk about the past or dig up old arguments. It was about how we strengthen this European approach in the future. We spoke of the need for all Member States to show solidarity and responsibility, and I welcome the solidarity shown by Member States, notably the four Visegrád countries, in providing additional funding for the Africa trust. There were also other forms of solidarity that matter. Contrary to what the Cassandras told us, relocation is working. More than 95% of those registered in Greece and Italy have been relocated. Over 11 000 foreign people have been welcomed come from Italy by other Member States and over 21 000 from Greece. I expect the remaining eligible candidates to be relocated soon. In particular, we must urgently help unaccompanied minors; 392 of them are still waiting in Greece and Italy. But what we have seen is that a few Member States have shouldered most of the responsibility. I would like that to change, and I would like some people to stop arguing against the efficiency of a system which they themselves are making inefficient or are undermining. As we look to the future, leaders must look at all elements of our comprehensive reform of asylum rules. We need to equip ourselves with a modern asylum system that manages migration. That means returning economic migrants not in need of protection and offering the same standard of conditions for genuine asylum seekers across the Union. This is the year when a global deal must be agreed. I count on this House and on all Member States to show the courage and determination to bring this reform to a successful conclusion. Herr Präsident, 2018 ist auch das Jahr, in dem wir unsere Europäische Wirtschafts- und Währungsunion zukunftsfest machen müssen. Deshalb war es auch mehr als nur eine Geste, dass im Dezember der allererste Euro-Gipfel stattgefunden hat, an dem alle 27 Mitgliedstaaten und nicht nur die 19 Euro-Staaten teilgenommen haben. Der Euro ist das Symbol unserer Einheit, er ist die Währung unserer Union, und mit Ausnahme Großbritanniens und Dänemarks sind alle Mitgliedstaaten verpflichtet und berechtigt, dem Euroraum beizutreten, sobald sie alle Bedingungen erfüllt haben. Ich habe nie dafür plädiert – aber ich lese das immer noch, vor allem in der überregionalen deutschen Presse –, dass jetzt sofort, morgen früh um elf Uhr, die Nicht-Euro-Staaten dem Euro beizutreten hätten. Aber ich wollte daran erinnern, was Vertragssache ist: Im Vertrag steht, dass jeder das Recht hat, falls die Bedingungen erfüllt sind, dem Euroraum beizutreten. Und das wird auch passieren, aber nicht morgen früh um elf Uhr. Wir haben unsere Währung bereits gegen mögliche künftige Stürme – und die wird es geben – besser gewappnet, unter anderem dank der Bankenunion. So sind unsere Banken seit 2014 mit 234 Mrd. EUR mehr Kapital unterfüttert, und der Anteil notleidender Kredite ist seit 2014 um ein Drittel zurückgegangen. Doch darauf können wir uns nicht ausruhen, sondern wir müssen die aktuelle wirtschaftliche Schönwetterlage nutzen, um die Währungsunion stärker, effizienter und handlungsfähiger zu machen, und deshalb müssen wir die Banken- und Kapitalmarktunion weiter vertiefen. Präsident Tusk hat schon darauf hingewiesen, was auf dem Arbeitsprogramm der nächsten sechs Monate steht: Europäischer Währungsfonds und andere Bemühungen in dem Sinne. Deshalb brauche ich das hier nicht noch einmal im Detail zu erläutern. Wir als Kommission möchten den Fiskalpakt in EU-Recht überführen. Das hatte der Rat 2012 so entschieden. Und ich hätte gerne, dass dem jetzt auch Folge geleistet wird. Wir werden in diesem Sinne in den nächsten Monaten Hand in Hand mit dem Parlament und mit den Mitgliedstaaten arbeiten. Präsident Tusk hat einige Worte in Sachen Brexit gesagt. Er hat gesagt, dass unsere Tür nach wie vor offen steht. Ich hätte nicht gerne, dass dies in London überhört wird.

Die Politiker starten zunächst mit den Problemen. Deswegen möchte ich heute zum Jahresauftakt zunächst mit einer Gratulation starten: Ich glaube, was im Verteidigungsbereich beim Dezemberrat gelungen ist, ist ein historischer Schritt für die Europäische Union – wir kommen in einem wichtigen Themenfeld voran, und 2018 müssen wir diesen Schwung auch halten.  Schwieriger wird es beim zweiten Thema, nämlich bei der Migration. Dort spricht Donald Tusk von constructive discussions und Jean-Claude Juncker hat von einer solid discussion gesprochen. Ich würde sagen, wenn die Bürger sich die Diskussion vergegenwärtigen, dann würden sie eher von Chaos sprechen, wenn man den Europäischen Rat sieht. Uneinigkeit, kein Wille, zusammenzukommen, kein Wille, einen Konsens zu erzielen, und es entsteht großer politischer Schaden: Den Populisten wird es einfach gemacht. Wenn die politische Klasse nicht liefert, haben Populisten ein einfaches Spiel, und deswegen sollte sich vielleicht der Europäische Rat zwischendurch mal ein Beispiel am Europäischen Parlament nehmen. Wir haben hier klare Fortschritte bei der Frage der Dublin-Reform, wo wir Solidarität, Humanität und Sicherheit zusammenbringen.  The third point I want to mention is about Brexit. It is good that we are now starting the second phase preparing for March 2019, but I have to express already now a clear warning: do not take the conclusions of a transitional period for granted. If the conditions are not good enough the European People’s Party will not give its consent, and the cliff edge is far from being avoided. There is a lot to do in 2018 when we have Brexit in mind. We saw over the Christmas break a lot of complaints from our British friends: David Davis complained that we are preparing for all scenarios (what a surprise!), and Chancellor Hammond complained about access of the City of London to the single market (what a surprise that we have changes there!). My message to London is: please do not complain anymore; please deliver. Give us an outlook on what you want to achieve for the future relationship.  The most drastic example of the lack of leadership is probably the debate about the colours of the passports in Great Britain. Just before Christmas, Prime Minister May announced that, after Brexit, Britain would return to the blue passport. This would be an ‘expression of the UK’s independence and sovereignty’. The first problem in this respect is about honesty: the whole story is a scam. EU law does not say anything about passport colours. Croatia has had a navy blue passport for years already. You did not have to leave the Union for that, so why don’t you tell the people the truth? The second problem is a much graver problem: it is about priorities. Nigel Farage immediately celebrated the new blue passport, and I quote: ‘that is the first real tangible victory for the people who voted for Brexit’. Unwittingly, Nigel Farage was right. Not about the victory, but it is true that the blue passport is the first and only real thing the British Government has achieved in more than one-and-a-half years of negotiations, so if I were a British citizen I would be deeply worried about the priorities of my government. That is why I now ask the British Government to come to the point on what is on the table to prepare the future perspective for the Brits. We are ready to negotiate. Europe is united.

This kind of consistency will be needed whatever happens and – we agree with President Tusk – we should keep an open heart to possible developments and choices in the future. But let me also focus on two other issues where this Council has made commitments; and the commitments must be delivered. This is about putting in motion the road map we have defined since Bratislava and since the Rome Declaration. The first one is the commitment to equip the European Union with updated social standards with the European Pillar of Social Rights. This is important for all groups of the population, but young people above all, particularly in this new digital era. If we consider that many, many people today have jobs but without a labour contract or without social protection, we can conclude that something basic is wrong. We need to correct this and make sure that everybody in employment, whatever the kind of job they do, has a decent labour contract and full access to social protection. And then we need to make sure that people, particularly young people, have access to proper skills and new kinds of job, which means large-scale investment in the future. We have the European Fund for Strategic Investment. This is good but not enough, because we need efforts on a much larger scale. If we want to tackle this problem we need to reform the eurozone because we still have many divergences in the way Member States can invest in the future, inside the eurozone and also involving those who are planning to join. Something is wrong here, and that is why we welcome this commitment to reform the eurozone. A window of opportunity is there because we have the Commission proposal, we have a committed Eurogroup President, we have a euro summit committing the prime ministers, and let’s see what comes from the German side. This combination of factors can open a window of opportunity. Let me underline that we want a genuine reform, with the Economic and Monetary Fund in the EU framework, a banking union but also with a fiscal capacity. These are the basic conditions for the eurozone to come back to life in a meaningful manner.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 23, "date": "2018-01-16.json", "name": "Syed KAMALL", "mepid": "33569", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Group. – Mr President, Happy New Year! As we begin 2018, I am sure most of us were pleased to see that we ended 2017 on a positive note by agreeing to move forward with negotiations on the new EU-UK relationship. But as other speakers have said before me, the next stage won’t necessarily be any easier than the first.  These are tough negotiations in tough times, and there will probably be moments when it feels as though the two sides are far apart, incapable of understanding each other. But the reason that these negotiations are tough is because first of all, negotiation by their very nature ought to be tough, and secondly, because both sides care about the outcome, on opposite sides of the table, but united by one simple goal: the desire to get the best possible result for citizens.  The UK and the EU will remain friends and allies, but we believe that the future is best secured through different approaches. The journey we are on is uncharted, but the ECR Group hopes and believes that we can achieve a deal to the benefit of all sides. And while the UK asks for a bespoke deal, EU negotiators ask: which template? But we all know that while one specific trade deal may act as a template for others, no two trade deals are exactly alike. After all, the Canada-EU agreements were bespoke in themselves. So whether you call for proposals for the EU-UK deal to be bespoke, or Canada+++ or some other variation, it is clear that the UK wants to be good neighbours. However, the UK needs to understand that whilst EU leaders on the whole want as beneficial a deal as possible, they do not want to make it so attractive that other countries are tempted to follow the UK out of the door. But voters, citizens and workers don’t care about legal protocols or legal technicalities, they don’t sit at home hoping that the UK is made an example of. They simply want both sides to sort it out. They don’t want more uncertainty, more grandstanding or more treading over old ground from either side. They want to keep making a living, keep selling their products, keep their jobs, keep travelling and keep safe. So quite simply, the EU needs to decide: is this a deal for the European peoples, or is it a deal for the European project?  The ECR Group believes that this question is not limited to just Brexit, but a very fundamental question about the very future of the EU. Is the EU serving the needs of its peoples? Is the EU offering workable solutions to the core challenges its Member States face, such as migration and others? Could the EU do less, but do it better? And while there will be those who call for evermore European integration and evermore harmonisation once the UK departs, the European Conservative and Reformist Group will continue to be a voice for those who want to see an EU that respects its Member States, an EU that provides value for money, and an EU that is outward looking, signing trade agreements not only with the UK, but with countries across the world.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "ECR", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 24, "date": "2018-01-16.json", "name": "Guy VERHOFSTADT", "mepid": "97058", "text": "  on behalf of the ALDE Group. – Mr President, it is a pity that Michel Barnier is not here and Nigel Farage is not here because I should have asked them what happened in their meeting. I have to tell you that since Nigel Farage went into this meeting with Michel Barnier he has apparently been completely disorientated. I don’t know what he put in Mr Farage’s coffee or tea because he came out of the meeting and backed a second referendum! I wonder what substance was put in that tea or coffee, because five minutes later he is against this second referendum once more. And this confusion is not only in UKIP, it seems to be rather widespread in Britain at the moment. Michael Gove, for example, has forgotten that the ban on plastic bags comes from an EU regulation. The Prime Minister, Ms May, apparently doesn’t know that the abolition of the charges on credit cards is a consequence of an EU directive. And then, as Manfred Weber has already mentioned, there is the whole hilarious thing about passports. I am a liberal, so I like blue more than red. So if we can have 27 passports in blue with 12 stars on them, for me that would be okay. But that was certainly not a reason to hold a referendum, as Manfred Weber said. More on a serious note now. I saw to Mr Tusk that we are now coming to the most difficult part of this negotiation. In our view as the European Parliament, there are three things to do. The first is to formalise the withdrawal agreement now, as fast as possible, and ensure there are serious guarantees on citizens’ rights, because that is still a problem. For us, citizens’ rights are not a request that has to be made by EU citizens, there has to be a declaration by the citizens. The burden of proof has to be on the side of the UK authorities, on the side of the Home Office, not on the side of the citizens. The second request we have concerns transition: we need a transition that is a real transition. Our resolution calls for a transition of not more than three years, and there cannot be cherry-picking in the transition. You cannot request a transition of two or three years on one issue and not on another. I am very pleased with the latest version of the negotiating directives by the Council because they make very clear that the whole acquis must be accepted. If you stay in the Union in this transition period, all the policies of the EU and all the legislation of the EU will be applicable for the whole two or three years. The only thing that will change is that Britain will not be represented in the institutions any more, not in the Council, not in the Commission and not in Parliament. It is also very important that in this negotiation directive – and we have to stick to that Mr President – that the new system for EU citizens living in Britain will only come into force after the transition. So there is no question of starting to make it difficult for EU citizens to obtain their permits to reside in Britain during the transition period. That can only be applicable after transition. Third, on the on the new relationship, we have do not need to reinvent the wheel, as we say. There is the Treaty. Mr Kamall, Article 217 Treaty makes it very clear that we can enter into an association agreement with countries of our neighbourhood, which concerns trade, security, internal security and external security. But there are two conditions that must in any case be fulfilled before we give our green light as the European Parliament. First, that there can be no cherry-picking inside the system. You cannot say, for example, ‘in this sector we want this and in another sector we don’t want Europe’, or ‘we need a good deal for financial services, but we do not accept the freedom of movement of people’. That will not be accepted by the European side. The second thing, Mr President, is that we as Parliament will never allow a country to have a better position, a better status, outside the European Union than inside the Union. Inside the Union, membership of the Union will always be the best solution for every European country and European state.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Liberals and centrists"}, {"id": 25, "date": "2018-01-16.json", "name": "Takis HADJIGEORGIOU", "mepid": "96907", "text": "on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group. - Mr President, the European Union, as we all know, has very serious problems.

The summit did not convince me that much, because the Council and the Member States have not really made any progress on all the big questions that are to be asked. To be honest, I am also tired of this quarrel between the Member States, and I am also tired of the fact that right-wing populists and eurosceptics are constantly trying to piss us off the European Union. We can really achieve something here. The European Union is a great achievement that we have achieved. But that doesn't just happen by itself, we have to do something ourselves to ensure that things move forward in the European Union, and under “we” I also include the member states, each and every one of the governments that have to come to Potte from time to time - also with the big questions and not only with the little trimmings. Or, for example, on the asylum question: They say, okay, isolation, we can agree on that, but unfortunately not when we are admitted, and then we just say: Well, then maybe next time. It can't go on like this forever. The euro must finally be made crisis-proof and socially acceptable, and the economic union must also be made more solidary and, above all, more democratic. In the fight against climate change, too, we must finally move ahead. We have an opportunity to do this in the House this week, which I hope we will not miss, on the issue of the energy package, but the Member States must also take the lead.

I would like to start by thanking Michel Barnier and his team for the excellent cooperation, and I hope that we will stick to this honest and constructive spirit in the months to come. However, we – as the European Parliament – also expect much closer cooperation with the Council and the Member States today, as the scope of negotiations is moving.  Indeed we are awaiting the legal text of the Withdrawal Agreement, but many separation-related issues, which also belong to the Withdrawal Agreement still need to be negotiated. On a number of them, we do not yet know the UK’s position. So we insist that our British partners make those issues a priority in ongoing negotiations. This is my first point.  Secondly, we understand that Michel Barnier’s objective is to conclude in a timely manner the Withdrawal Agreement to which a political declaration on the future will be attached. But, even for this chapter of the process, there is a risk regarding a timely conclusion. We hear from the British side that, in London, the ratification by Parliament can happen only at the last minute. There could also be a crisis in the negotiations. While this is in nobody’s interest, those risks could materialise and that is why we must prepare for the worst possible scenario, which is no deal on 30 March next year. There is a clear need to create legal certainty for this no deal situation. We know that there is work ongoing in the Commission, and we – as the European Parliament – hope for constructive cooperation with the Commission and the Council regarding preparedness, in particular on legislative amendments.  Thirdly, the UK has already been very clear on what it does not want. Much less clear is what it wants. There are ideas leaked here and there, some of them unacceptable and some of them in contradiction with the treaties, so we hope to have the best and widest possible cooperation with the UK in the future, but the internal market must not be torn into pieces to single out the parts that taste good.

To achieve this, we first of all urgently need to write and publish an agreed and rigorous history of Europe, which should contain successes and failures in European history.

I believe that by officially advancing the Defense Union, the European Council has taken an important step here. Here, it should be made clear to some - like the previous speakers - that Europe will regain its sovereignty, and that is a very crucial point. I hope that with all the reform measures in Germany we can manage to create a government that can act quickly and that not so many rush into irresponsibility. I also think it is important that the question of the proposals for the development of economic and monetary union be brought forward on the basis of the Commission's proposals. And, Mr President of the Commission, I think it is extremely important to say that the euro is the currency of the entire European Union, that there is an obligation of all countries - with the exception of the special regime for Denmark - to follow this, and that it is right to help these countries achieve this goal. Let me make a few comments on Brexit. We must now quickly have negotiating lines both for our definition of the transitional arrangement and for the negotiating objective. And I believe that we are on the right track in the cooperation between the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament. It must remain clear: the sentence that was set in the guidelines for the first round, according to which a country that leaves the EU cannot have the same advantages as a country that remains in the EU and bears the conditions and burdens must in my opinion be the assessment rate. I believe we can achieve something on this basis. We can already negotiate the future commercial agreement in this second phase. But there won't be enough time, for that we need the transitional regulation - a transitional regulation in which the full acquis of the European Union must apply, including the European Court of Justice.It must also be clear that cherry picking is not possible.When I hear here that the City of London is making suggestions that special regulations should be created here and that they want Canada plus plus plus: The condition here also applies that one cannot have special advantages and that for this reason clearlyis that something like clearing houses and similar issues belong in the European Union.London cannot perform tasks that are the task of the European Union.(The speaker agreed to answer a question on the blue card procedure under Rule 162 (8) of the Rules of Procedure.)", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 42, "date": "2018-01-16.json", "name": "David COBURN", "mepid": "124967", "text": "  blue-card question. – Mr Brok, from what you have just said, it sounds very much to me as though you have no interest whatsoever, and nor does Mr Barnier.

You said one more thing, which shows that you do not understand very well even the policy that the Commission has implemented. You said that member countries agree that relocation is not the solution to illegal immigration. Of course not, Mr Tusk, because relocation is designed for refugees. So let's see if we can approach the migration debate as a whole with a little more consistency and with a little more solidarity and political intelligence. Here we have demanded a comprehensive approach to migration, we have demanded that ad hoc solutions be overcome and we have demanded that international legality be complied with, which says that refugees have the right to be protected in European countries. So I suggest, first, that you listen to us a little more and, second, that this new message that you have launched be the message that will remain in the coming months. Because, you see, we are losing prestige, prestige as an institution - the European Union as a whole - precisely because of statements like these and because of unsupportive policies like the ones you are defending, against what the European Commission is trying to do. And one last thought, Mr. President: you see, Mr. Donald Trump just dropped a humanitarian political and security bomb, claiming that he is going to stop funding the Palestinian refugee agency.

I would like to point out once again the issue of migration. More jokingly, more seriously, if we make an analogy between the European Union and global warming, then the phenomena of mass migration are analogous to extreme weather phenomena. And, if a cause of global warming is the concentration and intensification of industrial activities, then, analogously, the centralization and polarization of the Union are clear causes of migratory phenomena.

I want to highlight in particular the renewed Common Security and Defense Policy. It may be the missing common denominator that we lack in the European Union today. It also responds to the perceived security deficit of the citizens of the Member States. And it also has the potential to connect Member States and connect citizens. Hence, it is to be welcomed and noted that the permanent deepened defense cooperation has two new members. These are Portugal and Ireland. Thus, already 25 Member States are involved in this cooperation. We expect PESCO to be both broad and ambitious. However, how far these ambitions will reach, we will learn from the national implementation plans and commitment to the implementation of the first adopted joint projects. I would also like to emphasize that this is also a way to strengthen this European pillar of NATO through coordination and also the use of the effect of such financial leverage in joint financing, in particular, defense expenditure. Here, I would like to emphasize that a balance is also necessary here, so as to balance it both geographically and to include small and medium-sized industries. Finally, I would also like to say about the Brexit issue. It seems to us that it is extremely important that we have significant progress in financial matters, securing citizens' rights, but in fact, we are waiting for these decisions, perhaps not so much the final ones, concluding this divorce from Great Britain, but rather a change of this decision.

Let’s go back a couple of years. We faced an incredible refugee crisis in 2015. We found the right measures to tackle that crisis at the time. Now we need to find the measures to be able to sustainably handle a migration over a long period of time. This is a different challenge and will need different measures, but we are up to it. I think that in close cooperation between our three institutions – the Council, the Parliament and the Commission – we can come up with answers and I would just caution against making the issue of relocation the biggest issue there is. It is a small issue compared to the overall challenge of migration. It is the last resort measure in the case of an extreme crisis pertaining to refugees.  The bigger challenge we face is migration – people who want to come to Europe to seek a better future – and we have to make sure that we develop all the instruments at a European level to tackle that issue: better border controls, better agreements with countries of origin and countries of transit and also a better system of legal migration so that we get to Europe the people that we need in Europe. I think we are up to this challenge and I think we can face this challenge in the coming year, but we need to do it now. We need to do it within the mandate of this Parliament and this Commission. Likewise, I would say on Brexit that it was a good decision in the European Council, and now we need to get to work. What we need is more clarity from London. Let me just say once again, as President Tusk has also said, that it is not the EU that decided to leave the United Kingdom, it is the United Kingdom that decided to leave the European Union. If at some point the United Kingdom had second thoughts or were to take another decision, obviously the European Union would leave the door open. I want to stress this once again. Finally, let me say this – and I think this is important for our future cooperation – the three institutions need each other and the basis of our cooperation is rooted in the Treaty and in EU law. For this to work, we need full respect for the rule of law in all our Member States. It is not an option you choose. It is not an option you choose on the basis of national sovereignty. It is a fundamental issue for the functioning of the European Union, and I say this against the background of increased support for the European Union amongst the European population in every Member State of the European Union. Even in those Member States who have governments who dispute some of the fundamental values of the European Union, the population still increasingly supports the European Union as the instrument to provide solutions for the challenges that the world throws at us. Let’s be very clear. We are at the beginning of the fourth industrial revolution, a huge challenge. We need to find solutions to the migration challenge, a huge challenge. We need to have an answer to the aggressive and cynical attitude of President Putin of Russia. That is a huge challenge. But we can face this challenge. There is no need for paralysing pessimism in the European Union. We can be more optimistic than before. There are more jobs. Economic growth is up. Support for Europe is up. Let’s use this opportunity to solve some of the problems we need to solve urgently.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 77, "date": "2018-01-16.json", "name": "Frans TIMMERMANS", "mepid": "129141", "text": "   President of the European Council. – Mr President, I have nothing to add to what Frans Timmermans has said.

It is why the Cold War did not go the other way, and it is certainly true in the field of fisheries.  The European Union has an extremely top—down, controlled approach to fisheries. Stocks are treated as a common resource, and defined as such in the Treaty, to which all Member States have equal access. This is very different from the policies of Iceland or New Zealand or the Falkland Islands where skippers are incentivised to take ownership of quota and where effectively the system is privatised.

We want to build it on solid and long-lasting foundations.’ These are the words of the Secretary-General of the United Nations, António Guterres, who just visited Colombia. He arrived in the country at a very delicate moment for peace and reconciliation, a moment when the enemies of peace are trying to roll back the progress that was so hard to achieve. Some groups have exploited the transition in former conflict areas to kill human rights defenders and campesinos leaders. Last week, the ELN restarted their attacks and kidnapped an oil worker. And yet, we should not lose sight of the bigger picture. Firstly, after half a century of war, FARC has disarmed and turned into a political party. Secondly, the Truth Commission has begun its work, and thirdly, the number of murders is still too high, but it is the lowest in 50 years. Colombia has an unprecedented opportunity for reconciliation, growth and human development. In a fragile but hopeful context, the friends of Colombia have a duty to engage even more closely, and this is what we, as the European Union, are doing. Part of our work is political and diplomatic. For instance, we first suspended and then removed the FARC from our list of terrorist organisations. It was an essential decision, showing to the ex-fighters that indeed a new beginning was possible if they laid down their weapons and chose, of course, democratic politics instead. Today, we are also following closely the suspension of talks between the Colombian Government and the ELN, and we are constantly in touch with the group of accompanying countries. The ELN’s decision to restart their attacks is unacceptable. We call on them to stop their attacks immediately, and we encourage the parties to resume talks on the extension of the ceasefire, which expired on 9 January. Peace can only come from a return to dialogue towards a permanent bilateral ceasefire. During these years and months, High Representative Federica Mogherini and Special Envoy for the peace process in Colombia, Mr Eamon Gilmore, have maintained close contacts with the Colombian Government and with FARC, as well as with opposition leaders, civil society and with our partners at the UN. In parallel to our diplomatic action, we are also engaged very practically in the reconciliation process on the ground. We have a particular responsibility to accompany the peace process in three areas: rural reform, the reincorporation of ex-FARC guerrillas into civilian life, and the establishment of a Special Investigation Unit in the Prosecutor-General’s office to combat crime and protect activists. At the same time, our EU Trust Fund for Colombia was established precisely to support these tasks. The Fund today has a budget of EUR 95 million, thanks also to the contributions of 19 Member States. Projects worth over 60% of the Fund have already been approved. Let me give you just one example of our support. The reincorporation of former fighters is one of the most delicate issues for reconciliation in Colombia. Some of them are moving into politics. Many others are going back to school and are looking for a job. Some others have a hard time in dealing with the memory of the war. In all these cases, our financial support can make a huge difference, so we have decided to start acting immediately, even before the National Reincorporation Plan is ready. In addition to the Trust Fund, we are supporting the urgent needs of the peace process through our Instrument Contributing to Stability and Peace, with an extra EUR 40 million so far. For instance, we are providing financial support to the transitional justice system because, as you know, reconciliation and justice must always go hand in hand. Furthermore, the Instrument Contributing to Stability and Peace could also be used to support the new Special Investigation Unit to fight organised crime and protect human rights defenders. Let me conclude on the work we are already doing to protect defenders. Since so many of them began have started to be murdered, we have not just made our voice heard. Eamon Gilmore visited many of the areas where the killings occurred. He met with their families, with local authorities, with police and the army. We also organised field visits for the Human Rights Group and the Group of Ambassadors with Defenders. Thanks to our programme ‘Protect Defenders’, several land activists and representatives of victims have received funding not only to cover attorneys’ fees and physical protection measures, but also, in the most serious cases, temporary relocation to other parts of the country. In parallel, we have continued providing humanitarian aid to people affected by violence, people who have been displaced, or to communities being confined and deprived of access to basic services, such as shelter, protection, safe water, clean water, food, healthcare, psychosocial support and education. Your support, dear colleagues, will be essential to carry on this work and all our work in support of peace, reconciliation and human rights in Colombia. We have decided to propose to Parliament an extension of the current bilateral cooperation with Colombia until 2020, and the addition of further resources. After half a century of war, it would be naïve to imagine that reconciliation could happen overnight. This last stretch of the road towards peace may be the hardest part. But it is just as important as the peace agreement itself. The people of Colombia – and peacemakers such as President Santos – need all our support from the European Union side. They can be sure that the European Union, together with the United Nations, will continue to be the strongest supporter of peace and human rights in Colombia, and a point of reference for all those who dream of a country finally reconciled.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 128, "date": "2018-01-16.json", "name": "Luis de GRANDES PASCUAL", "mepid": "28393", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr. president; Commissioner, thank you very much for her words, which have replaced the absence, which we regret, of Mrs Mogherini with great ability.

Both from the political point of view and from the economic point of view, through financing with cooperation instruments and through the Trust Fund that surely, Commissioner, will be necessary to expand because new needs arise. The end of the conflict has led to an increase in the presence and action of the public force to guarantee the safety of the populations. A unique opportunity to structurally overcome the problem of illicit crops, which is also making farmers' dream of having their own land come true, among many other achievements. Finally, I want to remind you from here that the consolidation of peace has been the axis of the cooperation policy of the European Union with Colombia since 2002. For this reason, the Colombian Government and the National Liberation Army (ELN) must find through dialogue some kind of solution. From the European Parliament we ask that the talks on the extension of the peace agreement be speeded up to guarantee the agreements reached and the building of confidence in the last three months. The various attacks perpetrated by the ELN in different parts of Colombia are unacceptable from every point of view and are incompatible with an action for peace. Armed action is incompatible with dialogue. The desire for the suspension of military action to continue has been unanimous throughout Colombia. A sustained improvement in the humanitarian situation of communities affected by the conflict can only be achieved with a permanent ceasefire. This opportunity for peace cannot and must not be wasted, Commissioner. And I know that is the intention of the Commission. Lastly, and not least, it is necessary that, together with the support of the peace process, we be very respectful of the popular will. And this is compatible with the support that we naturally made in the referendum, perhaps even exceeding our own capabilities and neutrality. Unfortunately, on the occasion of the next elections, the different legitimate political options will confront each other on how to obtain and achieve peace. The European Union, Commissioner, must unequivocally respect that debate, because otherwise it would be interference that is not naturally up to Colombia to accept and that we must respect.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 129, "date": "2018-01-16.json", "name": "Ramón JÁUREGUI ATONDO", "mepid": "97078", "text": "on behalf of the S & amp; D Group. - Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, what is happening in Colombia is truly extraordinary. After more than fifty years of internal warfare, after thousands of deaths, after millions of victims, they have found the way to peace. And this has allowed the whole country to have learned that wonderful lesson that Gandhi gave us in his day saying \"There is no way to peace, peace is the way.\" This is really the greatness of this agreement that is allowing Colombia to regain peace. And the equation, the agreement, substantially, arises on two bases. The first is the renunciation of violence. You have to stop killing, because there is no cause that justifies killing. None. But the second part of the agreement is to accept that those who renounce violence enter politics and can do politics legitimately. This is the basis of the agreement. And this is the greatness of what is happening in Colombia. But peace does not come alone. This does not fall from the sky. Building these processes is extraordinarily complex. There are lots of obstacles. And that is why we have established what I would call a political message that, unfortunately, this House will not be able to deliver today. Because the will of the Socialist Group was for this debate to be held and a Resolution approved, but we do not know why neither the European People's Party nor ALDE have wanted a Resolution so that, as two years ago, today we say how we support peace In colombia. And that is not interfering. Because we have the right to say that the electoral process does not interrupt the elections, does not interrupt the peace. And unfortunately, there is a certain political game in that direction. For this reason, ladies and gentlemen, we believe that a statement in favor of continuing the process, in favor of the Government accentuating its measures, that the agreements are implemented, a resolution by Parliament would have been adequate for the European Parliament and Europe remain agents main protagonists of this great agreement.Like we have Mr. Gilmore there, like we have the Trust Fund;but to continue saying that we want to implement the agreements, that we want the dialogue with the ELN to continue, demanding that the ELN stop killing and, at the same time, that the government continue negotiating.All of this is what we want to do with a pronouncement that it would have been good for this Parliament to have established.Because that is, in my opinion, the most important political position that we could adopt today: to demand an end to violence, definitively and forever in Colombia, from those who still maintain it, and that the agreements are implemented and that no one in the processelectoral interrupt this hope of peace forever in Colombia.(He agreed to answer a question asked under the 'blue card' procedure (Rule 162 (8) of the Rules of Procedure))", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 130, "date": "2018-01-16.json", "name": "Izaskun BILBAO BARANDICA", "mepid": "96922", "text": "\"blue card\" question.- I believe that politics sometimes lose us these little things and, if precisely in the debate on Colombia today there was some ingredient that was not needed, it was the questioning of the groups.Mr. Jáuregui knows that this parliamentary group has supported, without any doubt and in a strong and forceful way, the peace process in Colombia even in the first moments, in the initial ones.I don't know what steps you have taken, Mr. Jáuregui, with the institutions and those responsible for Colombia, but I can assure you that I personally asked if they thought it appropriate for this Parliament to approve a resolution in writing, and I can tell you that the answer was notit has been positive.Have the Colombian authorities told you that they needed and believed that a written resolution from this institution was urgent, after what we stated in November?", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Liberals and centrists"}, {"id": 131, "date": "2018-01-16.json", "name": "Ramón JÁUREGUI ATONDO", "mepid": "97078", "text": "\"blue card\" response.- I do not question, Your Honor, that you support peace in Colombia, because you signed a Resolution with us.What I'm asking is why not do it today.And I have asked the European Commission -

Implementation was never going to be easy, particularly given the splits in public opinion in Colombia, as was clearly indicated by the very close result in the referendum on the initial deal. With such domestic ambivalence it is therefore all the more important that the EU shows a unified and strong voice, as one of Colombia’s biggest economic partners with an FTA in place, and has a strong commitment to the peace process. The launch of the EU trust fund is a positive step, with some EUR 95 million already committed, but it is clear that more investment will be needed if change is to be seen quickly enough to maintain the public’s confidence in the peace process. Elections later this year will see at least ten members of the FARC handed seats in the Congress, as anticipated by the peace deal. By all accounts, the group has stuck to its commitments of peace, but the transformation from armed terrorist group to legitimate political party will be very tough to reconcile in the short term for many. Focusing on the main tenets of rural development and cocoa crop substitution will be key policy areas to see real progress happening on the ground. Resolving the issue of transitional justice, impunity for crimes committed during the armed conflict and restitution of property will also be very challenging to President Santos’s government. Finally, we cannot ignore that the National Liberation Army (ELN) is clearly benefiting from the deal. It is now moving back into areas previously controlled by the FARC, who have disarmed. Now, sadly, the ceasefire has expired and they have now resorted to unacceptable armed conflict in their attacks in recent weeks.

The work of the special envoy of the high representative to the country is essential, promoting the Development Cooperation Instrument, and maintaining and increasing donors to the Trust Fund. The process is not easy, but it is moving forward and it should continue to be that way in this electoral year. According to the information we collect from the Colombian authorities and humanitarian and non-governmental organizations that work in the areas most affected by the conflict, we must continue to support the Guarantee Commission, because there are still too many victims among social leaders and human rights activists. But it should also be noted that 103 people have been arrested for crimes against these human rights defenders and more than 50% of those responsible have been identified. Is not sufficient. It is essential to continue negotiating with the ELN, which must declare a ceasefire, and this organization must be integrated into the process. It is equally urgent to continue supporting the land reversion process and the implementation of the comprehensive rural reform, which in 2007 has met its objectives. This support should ensure that land reversals, already in the final phase, and illegal crop substitution programs produce a much fairer situation in Colombian agriculture in 2018. Without that expectation, the more than one hundred thousand credit operations for new agricultural enterprises signed by small producers would not have been formalized. The implementation of this point of the peace agreement is key so that its beneficial effects reach the population most affected by five decades of violence. The current year is expected to be one of special justice for peace and the work of reparation and recognition of the victims. The European Union can contribute a lot in a historic year, also because the former guerrilla, the FARC, definitely embraces peace and the word in Parliament, after successfully demobilizing more than 13,000 combatants.Maintaining our commitment to this process is to honor the values that define us and contribute to a process that promotes not only peace and security, but also economic and social development and a better distribution of wealth and prosperity.Because social justice is a key element to stabilize and strengthen peace.Mr. President, there is always talk of the price of peace, but we all know that the price of any war cannot be paid.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Liberals and centrists"}, {"id": 135, "date": "2018-01-16.json", "name": "Tania GONZÁLEZ PEÑAS", "mepid": "127330", "text": "on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group. - Mr. President, first of all, I would like to acknowledge and congratulate the efforts in Colombia to implement the peace process agreements, both in terms of legislative development, new forms of political participation, and the commitment of the FARC by abandoning definitely weapons, as the United Nations has certified. There are no half measures in this process. All our efforts must make the agreements prevail. The European Union must support again and again, and as often as necessary, the implementation of the peace agreements. Peace is signed one day but it is built during a process, and we have to be in that process at all times. And I think that unanimous pronouncement would be positive today. Positive and necessary.

The European Union Trust Fund must follow certain criteria and should serve to support point one of the agreements, comprehensive rural reform, promoting a fair policy of land tenure and a progressive substitution of crops. But above all, it must be transparent. We have to report. We have to tell what is being done with the money from the European Union. Secondly, I would like to talk about the extremely worrying process of reparamilitarization that is taking place in the territories previously occupied by the FARC.

We have started down a path that was very difficult and it is a historical fact, one of the few good news from the international community in recent years. It is very difficult to find historical conflicts that have been resolved in recent years and we have the historical possibility that this conflict will be resolved in a peace that is being made with a very important collective effort of Colombian society, some of them to lay down their arms, others for accepting that those who fought with arms can enter into politics. All of this has been a huge collective effort and also an effort by the European Union, of which I have to say that it has played a very good role in this matter. But we cannot be conformist. Peace is not already made, and we also know that there are huge risks ahead: issues of the peace agreement that are not being resolved, special justice for peace, labor reform - which has been mentioned by many of your honorable Members -, the issue of the reappearance of armed groups —which worries us—, the defenselessness of human rights defenders, things that concern us.

The European Union has been practicing this policy in Colombia and also in other latitudes. It is worth recalling in this debate the dramatic appeal that President Barco made to the international community in 1989, after the assassination of senator and presidential candidate Galán. The European Union responded to that appeal with the most favorable treatment within our generalized system of preferences. This unilateral concession was followed by an ambitious bilateral agreement, the Multiparty Agreement, currently in force, and a visa waiver regime. The Commissioner recalled the importance of the inclusion of these organizations in the list of terrorist organizations of the European Union. And it was not by chance, it was after a meeting of a delegation of the European Parliament at the headquarters of Los Pozos, in the demilitarized zone created during the mandate of President Pastrana, that he asked the Council of Ministers of the European Union and this I accept it. Terrorism is a scourge that negatively affects our societies. It is a phenomenon that affects us all equally and to which we all have to respond equally. And, in the same way that we ask for the victims of terrorism in the European Union memory, dignity and justice, I believe that we must leave it to each society to settle the score with its past. On this basis, what corresponds to the European Union and the rest of the international community - I was referring to you, Commissioner, to the visit of the Secretary-General of the United Nations - is to continue making its contribution on the basis of the will of the Colombian people —and there will be legislative elections in March and presidential elections in May.

The electoral process can stop the peace process, and that is what in no way should we accompany from here. We are not going to fool ourselves. The process is very complicated and has been reversed in some of the legislative processes that should accompany it. We know that, in addition, the differences between members of the FARC are growing. That drug traffickers are out of control over the territories they dominated and new ones that have been freed from military or guerrilla control. Peasant and social leaders are being assassinated; fifty of them, according to official sources. The Colombian Congress has not been able to fully comply with the calendar for the legislation derived from the agreements, among other things because the Colombian right, a part of the Colombian right, has not stopped putting the wheels in the wheels of the process. That we also have to talk about that. Only 50% of the agreements have been fulfilled.

The challenge, and the next step, is to reach the most remote areas of the country and change the conditions that have led to the spread of violence. Although globally Colombia has the lowest homicide rate in 42 years - as the Secretary General of the United Nations said after his last visit to Colombia - it is absolutely necessary to accelerate the active presence of the State throughout the entire national territory. This period of transition towards peace is an opportunity to confront and resolve problems such as the cases of murders of human rights defenders. As a first step, the Colombian government made the decision to dispatch 60,000 soldiers and police to the most critical areas. It is not enough, but it is a first step. Other aspects are also very important: rural reform, including access to land, long-term development plans, investments ...

Indeed, the implementation of the peace process on all sides is of the utmost importance and we should be helpful in this. We have to see that this can only be done with a great deal of reconciliation. I am extremely grateful to President Santos for having had the courage to undertake this peace process. That is a great achievement when you see the conditions and also the political context in his country. However, I also understand those who have had victims in their families - deaths caused by the FARC, for example. Anyone who does not take this into account and does not know how difficult it is, when there is personal concern, to set such a reconciliation process in motion, is easy to talk to. I believe that such bridges have to be built and that that means longer social dialogue in such a country as well. It also means that one should not pretend - where I had the impression at one or the other speech here - that the poor FARC people are the victims. They also did a lot of evil, killing and kidnapping people. That should not be forgotten in this context. But now that agreement is there and should be handled sensibly. That is why it is necessary that paramilitary forces also integrate themselves into this peace process and that new unrest does not arise, especially against farmers. I think the situation in this country, as in many other Latin American countries, has to do with the fact that there is a high level of social injustice. Only if social injustice and class differences are overcome in such countries can there be a lasting process of reconciliation. That is why this is an important prerequisite for us as the European Union to invest in Infrastructure, help and support with education in order to bring together the rural area with the poor people and the other parts of society in order to bring about a real measure of equal opportunities in the country. We also have to spend a lot of money, and that is also a question for the Americans. Only the repressive fight against drugs is not enough to combat drugs. We should also have an interest in Colombia being built up properly, social injustice being eliminated, because that is the most important prerequisite for the drug cultivation to end. And that is why, in my opinion, it is much cheaper for Americans and Europeans to invest a lot of money in support of Colombia and to overcome drug cultivation, instead of just repressively combating drug use and drug trafficking.

It proves that the most fearless are, in some circumstances, those who seek reconciliation and not confrontation. It also proves that intransigence can prolong conflicts beyond anything that is humanly tolerable. That is exactly what President Juan Manuel Santos understood, the same as in his inauguration as Minister of Defense in 2006, he had declared that he would be the minister of war to achieve peace. From minister of war, Juan Manuel Santos became president of peace and this vision, without which the conflict that lasted for more than half a century would still be maintained today, was duly recognized with the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in 2016. In one country where the historical pattern has been, unfortunately, that of violence, with a historical trajectory so marked by the civil war, the initiative of President Santos configured an absolutely extraordinary gesture. It is precisely for this reason that this peace process has been and will be subject to several complex risks and challenges. In this scenario, the support of the international community is absolutely vital and cannot be subject to any political calculations or electoral logics.

The violence in Colombia began in 1948, with the conflict between the Liberal Party and the Conservative Party. Later, he continued with Movement 19 and the murder of Carlos Toledo Plata. All the peace processes in Colombia have always meant victims and deaths. Because there are groups that do not want to reintegrate into civil life, among other reasons, because it is the reason for their own business. The Colombia peace agreement is an imperfect agreement, it is an agreement full of frustrations, but it is the only agreement, because it is a possible agreement. Among the frustrations, strategic frustrations, is, for example, that the FARC have kept absolutely secret what their treasure is, the treasure obtained by drug trafficking. As they have also kept something fundamental secret, which makes one doubt what their purposes are, such as what links, what channels they had to market their product, drug trafficking. And this remains outside and outside the peace process itself. But, I repeat, with all these frustrations, it is the only possible process, because peace is the process and the process is peace. Consequently, it is clear that victims are going to continue to occur.

In areas previously controlled by the FARC, paramilitary groups have entered or increased their activity, establishing military and social control that allows them to appropriate the proceeds of legal and illegal economic activities. These groups represent an enormous threat to the effectiveness of the peace process: from the very fact that some structures did not participate in the demobilization it follows that the paramilitary phenomenon and its military, economic and political structures, historically invasive in the Colombian fabric, are still present and strong. So what is the point of celebrating the dismantling of the FARC if a year later we find multiplied or strengthened other actors who have taken their place and taken advantage of their absence, such as the Gulf clan? Do we want to consider a solution to have eliminated the name FARC by letting the model of paramilitarism survive? The high rate of violence that persists, particularly in rural areas, to the detriment of social leaders and human rights defenders is also very worrying, with an increase in murders of 47%. In Colombia, a massive and resolute intervention by the government is urgently needed to develop a clear and integral strategy for the dismantling of paramilitarism, which attacks the multidimensional character of the phenomenon. This is why I believe it is desirable and necessary for the European Union to immediately strengthen the special unit of the Colombian Public Prosecutor's Office, created ad hoc for the eradication of the successor groups to paramilitarism, a unit which must provide results. concrete in the protection and protection of victims of conflict, human rights defenders and social leaders.Today the significant delay in the regulatory implementation of the agreement is still discouraging, which in one year only advanced by 18.3%.This slowness and disruption of the bureaucratic fabric of the de facto agreement risk making the agreement largely sterile and ineffective.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "EFDD", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Eurosceptic conservatives"}, {"id": 152, "date": "2018-01-16.json", "name": "Agustín DÍAZ DE MERA GARCÍA CONSUEGRA", "mepid": "28397", "text": "- Mr. President, the origin of the process is Law 1448, it is the starting point. Once again I want to congratulate President Santos for his courage and for all the efforts that he is carrying out in the implementation of peace. I was a witness to the referendum and many preambles. Today we can say that Colombia is on the way to ending the longest internal armed conflict in the subcontinent. I also quote Guterres, but literally: «a peacebuilding process is not easy, there are imperfections, there are delays, but what was very clear to me is the total commitment of the Government and the FARC to peacebuilding ». The agreement is progressing, the implementation is being fast. Demobilization and disarmament are advancing: more than one weapon per combatant, 52,000 hectares of illicit cultivation eradicated and replaced, 180 of the 673 mined municipalities have been declared mine-free. There are regulatory advances in decisive matters, such as reintegration, guarantees of security, victims, justice and reparation, rural and social development. And this by following the route that the Government has defined. It has defined three pillars for the construction of a stable and lasting peace: more security, new opportunities and reconciliation and coexistence. I want to highlight \"more security\", because it is the essential pillar to prevent the emergence of other new armed groups. Important progress has also been the creation of the Horus plan, the 65 Locate base units, and the \"blue tents.\" Unfortunately, today we must regret the violent actions of the ELN and I subscribe to the words of Mrs. Mogherini calling for the talks to resume quickly, in order to ensure progress in the area of ​​peace and confidence-building in Colombia. From the beginning I have supported this process and I am aware that there is a long way to go. For this, it is essential that the assistance that the European Union can provide through the Fund support fiduciary - estimated as is known at 95 million euros - increases.Stable and lasting peace will give Colombia what it so much deserves, the harmony it so badly needs and the internal and external confidence to position itself definitively as one of the most important countries in the economic and social sphere of the American subcontinent.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 153, "date": "2018-01-16.json", "name": "Soraya POST", "mepid": "124997", "text": "- Mr President!

In November, the Colombian Constitutional Court voted through a mechanism tasked with investigating the human rights violations committed during the conflict. JEP is a cornerstone of the peace agreement and it is important that the EU supports a process that strengthens the rule of law. The EU should continuously monitor the work of the mechanism. All political forces in Colombia do not welcome the JEP and we in the EU must therefore be clear that we are behind the investigation of crimes committed by all parties to the conflict. Truth Commission. According to the peace agreement, a truth commission will produce a report on what happened during this conflict. The Truth Commission aims to create an emotional restoration and is a fundamental step in moving forward as a society. The members of the Truth Commission have already been appointed, but we must be vigilant that there are interests that want to hide the truth about the abuses that have been committed, not least those that the army has committed. The EU must, of course, support the Truth Commission and continuously monitor its work. The EU must also show its clear support for women, indigenous peoples and LGBTQ organizations in their efforts to follow up on both the JEP and the Truth Commission.

If you as a farmer have no land, you cannot work, you have no income and you end up in poverty. Then you will of course revolt again. For me, this is therefore at the heart of this peace process. Returning the land to farmers must be Europe's priority. A second point - as you have also mentioned - is, of course, the ceasefire. As long as there is violence, people naturally do not feel peace. We must also focus on that. A third point that I think has been little discussed here today is the following. This year is an election year. By just looking at different countries you know that in an election year there is always the threat of more violence, of bloodshed. We as Europe must make our voices heard on this.

This also includes shared responsibility for the decisive and irreversible implementation of the roadmap for the human rights, social and environmental obligations of the Colombian government within the framework of the EU-Peru-Colombia free trade agreement, which has now been in existence for five years. Because the social, political and economic reality is very concrete for every person in Colombia. Let me put it this way: EU trade policy must not jeopardize the peace process.

Agricultural goods from Europe and the USA forced thousands of smallholders to give up their businesses again, and rural exodus is bringing new social explosions to cities. The question of land is undoubtedly - and this has already been underlined here - a crucial one. What happens to land and raw materials in the areas previously controlled by the FARC?

When, in 2016, one of the most ambitious peace agreements in recent history between the Colombian authorities and the FARC was signed, the EU reconfirmed its support to peace-building through a financial support package and a trust fund for Columbia, with a special focus on economic development and agricultural productivity. Nevertheless, recent events show that the peace process in Colombia remains challenged and the EU support is of crucial importance. The ceasefire agreement between the Colombian Government and the ELN expired on 9 January without any extension, and the rebels launched a new offensive last week killing members of the security forces, and attacking an important crude oil pipeline. Therefore I call on all involved parties to resume the talks on the extension of the ceasefire as soon as possible in order to secure the progress made in peace and confidence-building over the past months. The various attacks by the ELN in different parts of Colombia are unacceptable. What is needed is a serious and constructive dialogue and the commitment of both parties, the Government and the ELN, to reach a solution of the conflict through political means. Recently we can see that the desire for the continued suspension of military action has been unanimous throughout Colombia. The communities have a strong belief in a prosperous future for their country and want to achieve not only peace but also prosperity and good living conditions for all inhabitants. I hope that the Colombian Government will play a key role in providing the necessary security, administration, healthcare system and infrastructure they need and in helping the local farmers to get better access to the market, and the families of the victims should be high on the political agenda.

The appointment at the time of a special envoy or the creation of the Trust Fund for the post-conflict, promoted by the Member States, including Spain, are good proof of this. The conclusion of the negotiation with the FARC was a historic event that ended more than half a century of conflict and laid the foundations for a more prosperous Colombia as well, since a country at peace can unleash its full potential and this results in the well-being of its citizens, and also at the international level and in its international projection.

Well, the European Union must continue to accompany the process, as it has gone doing, together with the United Nations, for example in the framework of the verification and implementation of the agreement with the FARC.Now the main obstacle to definitive peace is found in the so-called ELN.The known attacks, carried out by the \"elenos\" a few hours after the end of the ceasefire, are totally unacceptable.It is imperative that these terrorist acts stop soon.It is necessary to have a ceasefire as soon as possible and the resumption of the work of the negotiation table in Quito, so that a definitive agreement can be facilitated soon.Mr. President, the award of the Nobel Peace Prize to President Santos in 2016 was a gesture of recognition from the international community to Colombia, which has suffered so much from violence for so many decades.It was a source of pride for them, for Colombia, but also for all of us who are friends of the country.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 160, "date": "2018-01-16.json", "name": "Isabella DE MONTE", "mepid": "124803", "text": "- (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the situation in Colombia deserves our full attention.The conflict between the government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia lasted for 52 years and resulted in numerous casualties among the population.The Union welcomed the peace agreement between the two parties, reached in October 2016, as an opportunity to strengthen institutions in the country and improve human rights and sustainable development.Despite the generous humanitarian aid, however, many points remain unresolved, such as the social inequalities of marginalized communities and the scarce economic opportunities that induce many young people to enter the illegal drug and arms trade.It is therefore important that the European institutions continue to listen to the voices of those who denounce the violations and corruption present in Colombia and undertake to pursue collaborative policies in the political and economic sector.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 161, "date": "2018-01-16.json", "name": "Alojz PETERLE", "mepid": "23693", "text": "- In 2016, we welcomed with enthusiasm and relief the historic peace agreement and the new era of peace and coexistence in Colombia.

My second point is about our funding through the trust fund. It is completely in accordance with our rules, and fits into in the framework of accountability and transparency.

Two years ago precisely, on 16 January 2016, the International Atomic Energy Agency verified that Iran had implemented its nuclear—related commitments. As a consequence, the United Nations, the European Union and the United States lifted their nuclear-related economic and financial sanctions. This was an important milestone to guarantee that Iran’s nuclear programme can only have a peaceful nature. The European Union has a clear and consolidated position on the joint comprehensive plan of action, which was reiterated by all 28 Foreign Ministers on 16 October last year. We are – and stay – committed to the continued full and effective implementation of all parts of the JCPOA. Over the past two years, the IAEA has confirmed in nine reports that Iran is implementing all its nuclear—related commitments under a comprehensive and strict monitoring system. Members will have seen that last Friday the United States extended the sanction waivers, and we are now, together with the E3 and the other EU Member States, carefully assessing the statement and its implications. Just a few days ago, High Representative Mogherini chaired a meeting in Brussels with the Iran Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and with the Foreign Ministers of the E3, the three European countries that participated in the negotiations of the deal. They all agreed that the deal is working and must be preserved as it is crucial for the security of Europe, the Middle East and the world. Last week’s meeting was also an opportunity to discuss other issues which we are concerned about but are not related to the nuclear deal. These issues include detentions in the Middle East, Iran’s ballistic missile programme as well as the protests that took place in Iran in recent weeks. Let us be clear, all these issues must be addressed and must be addressed outside the scope of the nuclear deal. None of them would be easier to address if the JCPOA was not in place – quite the contrary.  So turning to the main topic of this debate. Since the end of 2017 we have focused our attention on the demonstrations in Iran. The High Representative intervened clearly with a declaration on 2 January after consulting all 28 Member States and speaking on their behalf. The declaration spelled out that the loss of human lives in Iran was unacceptable and that freedom of expression had to be guaranteed. We also raised these concerns directly with the Iranian authorities, including at the ITER level. According to our information more than 20 people including security personnel died during the events and there are reports of deaths in prisons. Iran should investigate all human rights violations and hold the perpetrators responsible. The rights of those arrested in the context of the protests should also be respected in accordance with international standards. It is positive that President Rouhani stressed that there must be room for peaceful expression of criticism, both in the streets and online. It is key that these declarations be followed by consistent decisions and action. Most observers believe that the economic situation has been the main driver behind the protests, and the economic engagement between the European Union, its Member States and Iran, that was consequent to the entry into force and continued full implementation of the nuclear agreement is also aimed at improving the economic situation of all Iranian citizens. But we shouldn’t forget that the restrictions on civil and social freedoms in Iran have also been one of the top concerns of the Iranian people and of course for us. We, the European Union, have never refrained from raising human rights issues in our contacts with the Iranian authorities. For instance human rights were the first item on the agenda at the last high-level dialogue last November and we will continue to discuss these issues in the framework of our bilateral relations. Our engagement with Iran, as I mentioned, has also focused on improving the economic situation of Iranian citizens following the lifting of all nuclear-related sanctions. We have encouraged trade and economic engagement with the constant goal of benefiting the people of Iran. For that reason we have established technical cooperation with Iran and stand ready to help with the necessary reforms. There is no shortage of experience within our Member States which can be shared. The lifting of sanctions was an essential starting point for the improvement of the Iranian economy, but it is not sufficient; some challenges are also structural and need reforms. These include addressing barriers to investment and weaknesses in the areas of transparency, the rule of law and banking, but also a stronger fight against money laundering in line with the standards of the Financial Action Task Force. This would lead to a more balanced distribution of wealth within Iranian society, which was one of the basic demands coming from the streets in recent weeks.  The people of Iran aspire to a more open, free and fair country and we Europeans have always been on their side. We have not only called constantly for the respect of human rights in public statements and in private conversations, but we have also chosen to engage with Iran to accompany and encourage reforms in that country.

I start with a quote: “People have a legitimate right to ask us to see and hear them and to follow up on their demands.” This sentence comes from Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, and like most of the people in this room I could Sign the statement. Nevertheless, despite these statements, developments in the country remain worrying. Violence against people demonstrating peacefully, as Commissioner Hahn has just described, with dead, injured and thousands of detained regime critics, is the sad result of the last few weeks. The people of Iran, from all walks of life, are dissatisfied with the corruption, with the nepotism, with the restrictions on their freedom rights and also with the fact that their taxpayers' money amounting to billions of euros annually for highly problematic activities in Syria, Iraq , Yemen or Hezbollah in Lebanon. It is now in the hands of the politically and religiously responsible in Tehran to improve the situation of their dissatisfied citizens in their own country through political change. Commissioner Hahn has already correctly pointed out the foreign policy difficulties; I don't want to make any further additions to this. But what I would like to add is the very clear wish that we as the European Parliament make it clear that, firstly, those responsible in Tehran should respect the rights of the demonstrators and respect the freedom of expression and assembly. Second: We support the appeals to the Iranian leadership not to put down the protests by force, and call on those responsible to turn words into deeds. This includes the right to peaceful demonstrations and the release of those politically imprisoned. These points should and these points will be addressed by the Foreign Affairs Committee a delegation trip from February 12 to 16, including to Iran.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 184, "date": "2018-01-16.json", "name": "Knut FLECKENSTEIN", "mepid": "96840", "text": "on behalf of the S&D Group. - Madam President, ladies and gentlemen! The images from the Iranian cities make us concerned. We are deeply convinced that human rights and civil liberties are due to everyone - in Brussels and Hamburg, but also in Tehran. This also includes freedom of expression and freedom of demonstration, and we are concerned about the harsh and sometimes violent reaction of the Iranian authorities. The dead demonstrators and the many people imprisoned are unacceptable to us. They are also not a sign of strength, on the contrary. However, we are also convinced that demonstrations themselves must be peaceful and non-violent if they do not want to lose their legitimacy. We have problems with Iran on other issues too: the missile program or anyone who questions Israel's right to exist must expect our bitter resistance. Nevertheless, or precisely because of this, it is important to speak. With a clear stance, but also with mutual respect, for example in the high-level discussions on human rights that you mentioned, Commissioner. There is also some initial progress, for example in the use of the death penalty. The Iranian government has taken the first steps in the right direction, and more should follow.

Judging by reports on the ground, and seeing the release in the last two days of large numbers of those detained, it does now seem as though the situation may be calming. Clearly there have been horrendous breaches of human rights, with as many as 25 protesters reported dead, abuses which we must all condemn in the strongest terms, but which are tragically characteristic of that brutal theocratic regime. It is clear that the protests emanated from a mixture of economic, social and political concerns from the population at large, an analysis which even President Rouhani himself has conceded. On the nuclear deal, I am conscious that for many Western politicians who oppose it these protests are seen as a further justification of their position. It is, however, vital that the nuclear deal is seen as being totally separate from our general relations with Iran and stand alone. The P5+1 JCPOA in Geneva in 2015 was not aimed at improving the governance situation in Iran, but at preventing the state from acquiring nuclear weapons.

Yes, we should stick to our word on the nuclear deal and keep Iran to its commitments, but this should not prevent us from engaging the Islamic Republic’s leaders on human rights and foreign policy.  In Syria, Yemen, Iraq and Lebanon, Iran plays a toxic role. Just because we are both against ISIS or Daesh, it does not mean we share objectives or interests otherwise. Of course the Iranian people are well aware that the billions worth of support for Hezbollah and Assad’s murder machine are not spent on healthcare, infrastructure or education in Iran itself.  When the nuclear deal was negotiated, we were constantly reminded that the talks did not cover human rights or Iran’s role in the region, so along the same vein we should not allow for the question marks that President Trump puts to the nuclear deal now to blur our sight. Precisely because human rights and Iran’s foreign policy are not part of the nuclear deal, we can confidently address these topics any time, and we are free to adopt more individual EU sanctions, and should not shy away from that.

The EU and its member states are united and united in their support for the existing nuclear deal. The nuclear deal decided in 2015 has also raised hopes for domestic political reforms in Iran, which have so far hardly been fulfilled. This is also shown by the demonstrations last week. Initially, the protests focused on socio-economic issues, especially price increases and high unemployment. Political demands soon followed, including the overthrow of the government. The demonstrations resulted in mass arrests and at least 25 people were killed. These deaths need to be investigated and the prisoners of conscience released. President Rouhani has spoken conciliatory and self-critical tones towards the demonstrators. A rethinking process within the entire Iranian leadership is urgently required.

And seeing their excessive force, the killings, the arrests and, I am afraid, the executions that will follow, well this is something we cannot compromise on. I do condemn the excessive violence and the behaviour of the Iranian regime, and I show solidarity to the Iranian people. I also have expectations that we will send a strong message that we want respect for fundamental rights and that this excessive behaviour will be investigated and we will be firm on our values and principles. I am afraid that seeing what the Vice-President and her office have said and tweeted, so far, we have failed.

The days of unrest in Iran can be seen as a necessary signal to the Iranian government that reforms must be implemented. According to the magazine “Der Spiegel”, Iranian President Rouhani is calling for the release of imprisoned citizens and is now also reaffirming the right to demonstrate. This reaction by the president clearly shows that there are forces in Iran who have a will to reform, even without the tutelage of the West. I would like to see such forces in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain etc. But right now, at this point in time, the American President Trump is taking notice and threatening to let the nuclear deal fall through, and makes a compromise, makes demands such as that Iran should give up the development of conventional weapons - a provocation, because which one sovereign state would accept that? Perhaps - ironically speaking - Mr Trump is dreaming that Iran will in future, like the Saudis, buy American weapons systems with open arms, and then the money freeze for Iran would certainly be lifted. Now Europe should absolutely stand by this nuclear agreement, acknowledge it, not only because one should keep its word, but also because the termination would be a fatal signal with regard to North Korea. Why should Pyongyang seek a diplomatic solution with the West when the whole world can see live how the beacon of democracy, how America - or rather, the Trump administration - deals with existing agreements, even though the International Atomic Energy Agency testifies that Iran actually complies with all the requirements stipulated in the agreement. Well, Trump doesn't even want to discuss and negotiate, and he is now trying to instrumentalize the Union. It is to be feared that Trump's policies will have a destabilizing effect on the entire Middle East. It only strengthens Russia and China's influence. Europe would have to be meet their own demands, and therefore the most recent activities and commitments by Ms. Mogherini to the nuclear deal are to be supported.What does Europe need?Europe needs an independent, energetic policy, on the one hand to secure Israel's right to exist, but on the other hand also to bring Iran and Saudi Arabia to the same table.If Europe does not succeed in that, Europe will be relegated to the spectator rank and will ultimately have to leave the field to Russia and China.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "ENF", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Far-right nationalists"}, {"id": 200, "date": "2018-01-16.json", "name": "Georgios EPITIDEIOS", "mepid": "125071", "text": "- Madam President, in recent weeks, of course, Iran has been at the center of international interest.

But the hegemonic role he wants to play in the Middle East brings it into conflict with the interests of the United States, which has imposed sanctions on it. These sanctions have consequences for the country's economy, which, if it worsens, risks a recurrence of the unrest. The European Union is therefore given a first-class opportunity to support Iran politically, to help it carry out the planned and required democratic reforms, and to become a factor of stability in the region. Tehran's decision to sign control of its nuclear program is not only a sign of goodwill but also contributes to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.

The Commissioner has explained to us the events that have been taking place, among others the contact with the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Iran, and some aspects to which some of the honorable Members have referred, such as the certification for a period of 120 days , the latest certification from the president of the United States, which has put on the table an ultimatum to the European Union, if Iran does not meet certain conditions in relation to ballistic missiles, in terms of increased control of inspections and of course to try to restrict the influence it has in the region as a whole - Iraq, Syria, Lebanon or Yemen. All these aspects would, of course, give time to hold another debate, but I believe that the issue that unites us here today is precisely trying to maintain a critical dialogue, as the high representative said, and have a new appearance on the situation that it is taking place in the region. Obviously, the events that have occurred in Mashhad, and that have spread to the rest of the country, clearly reveal a concern that has its origin in economic problems, in the high prices, in the absence of prospects in the country and also in the situation of human rights. We have already expressed our concern in these debates about the situation of minorities, about the imposition of capital punishment and especially about the situation of the opposition. Commissioner, in your speech you referred to some first figures and we would like to ask that these figures were contrasted, because some information that reaches us tells us that, instead of that number of deaths, the figures are double. Has been many people tortured. Some bodies have been returned to relatives saying that they had committed suicide in prison. And we would really like to verify these disturbing and worrying figures and state that, indeed, the nuclear package and the nuclear agreement run through a channel, but respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms constitutes an essential element of the action of the European Union and we should not refrain from concern ourselves with these concerns. We are going to have a dialogue with some Iranian parliamentarians who are going to come to the Foreign Affairs Committee.

The first certainly relates to the fact that the European Union cannot remain indifferent to the alarming signal of the Iranian population's discontent with government policies and to the growing ambiguity shown by Tehran in addressing reports of abuse and torture by security forces, just as we cannot close our eyes to the violation of human rights and, indeed, we must have a firm and uncompromising attitude. Then there is a second aspect, which concerns the political role of Iran in the region and the future of the nuclear deal. There is no doubt that for the European Union the presence of Iran in the Middle East region, like it or not, can represent an important element of balance and the same nuclear deal has also been useful to put Tehran back into a possible correct political game in the Middle East region. . And precisely for this reason I consider that the reaction of the US administration after the events is wrong and can produce negative drifts, unlike the just and balanced position shown by the High Representative Federica Mogherini. However, here is the point: recognizing the role of Iran and defending the nuclear deal does not mean for us to bend the question of human rights to \"realpolitik\", quite the contrary.

However, let us be careful about the meaning to be given to these demonstrations. Let's try to take some height. I would like us to think about how to organize a real multipolar world. What could be the place of a great historic nation like Iran in a peaceful Middle East? The Middle East was set on fire and blood when, from 1991 and the fall of the Soviet Union, the West made it a theater of conquest and experimentation. The United States and the Europeans tested in this region the theory of state building, that is, to rebuild a state after having destroyed it. It was a bloody failure in Iraq. Even today, there are only three hours of electricity in Baghdad. We also tested the theory of regime change, with the help of an Arab Spring that we strongly encouraged, if not sparked. It was a disaster in Egypt; the Islamists supported by the West thus aggravated the underdevelopment of the country and maintain, in spite of the efforts of Marshal al-Sisi, a chronic insecurity. Finally, we tried the good old method of the coup d'état in Syria. Four years and 300,000 dead later, it is still a bitter failure and a humanitarian disaster, part of which we have paid for in the form of immigration and terrorism. Today we have the opportunity to ease the centuries-old tensions that we have helped to stir up. The pressure Donald Trump has exerted on Saudi Arabia seems to half open the hope of real reform that could be fatal to Islamist terrorism. Vladimir Putin's action, backed by China and Iran, has helped maintain Bashar al-Assad's pole of stability, despite everything. We must pool these efforts to allow the Middle East to be rebuilt, for minorities to be protected and a real development process to take place.The European Union must promote this dialogue, be an interlocutor, even if it has participated in too many destabilizations.The Sochi meeting and the Astana process show the return to the region of historical processes stifled by the Cold War and unilateralism.It is high time for the European Union to participate in the concert of this multilateral world of balance and peace.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "ENF", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Far-right nationalists"}, {"id": 209, "date": "2018-01-16.json", "name": "Janusz KORWIN-MIKKE", "mepid": "124879", "text": "   – Madam President, I cannot understand why the European Union, whose mouth is full of ‘diversity’, tries to make every state a copy itself.

They are bound to end sooner or later. But I think the latest surprise demonstrations, which included more than 140 cities in Iran, reminded us of this possibility. Because what is interesting is the scope and message of the demonstrators. Protests against the high cost of living developed within two days into political demands, into the slogans ‘down with dictatorship’ and ‘we want Iran back’. What is significant is that Iranians made no difference between so—called conservatives and moderates. They targeted the regime as such. I think the lesson for the EU is that counting on reformed dictators with a human face is betting on a dead horse. The nuclear deal should, of course, be kept intact despite all the problems. I am firmly for this. But, at the same time, the deal cannot be seen as the only centre for our relations with Iran. When a regime continues to use some breathing space from sanctions not to address the burning problems of their citizens – half of them need state support and 10 million out of a population of 80 million are jobless – but instead to speed up the export of terrorism, conflicts and ballistic missiles, then as my colleague, Mrs Schaake put it, they are playing a toxic role. I am also worried about the sharp contrast between the US and EU reaction. I think this is very important. Whereas the US administration and Congress, on a bipartisan level, sided immediately with the Iranian people, the EU message has been weak and vague. It has been said that in a spirit of respect we expect all concerned to refrain from violence. The regime has never refrained from violence during the last 39 years. So our attitude must be very firm and clear. It must be based on conditionality: release all prisoners, allow free demonstrations, and stop spreading ballistic missiles.

At least 7 people have died from torture in prison, but the total number of victims is undoubtedly higher. Amnesty International has called for an investigation, but of course this is not happening. The regime disconnected and censored the Internet and social media to prevent the spread of the uprising. Government intelligence agents identify protesters throughout the day, but arrest them only at night to avoid public outrage. As I have already said, there are deaths of those arrested who are actually murdered by the government regime. The difference between the Iranian uprising in 2009 and these recent protests is as follows. Previous protests were the result of a dispute at the governmental level, but this time the people are really against the whole regime and the government regime is aware of it. People are calling for this regime to change to democracy and freedom. Personally, I have had a long-standing relationship with the main Iranian opposition PMOI, which the Iranian regime has accused of protesting. I even met the leader of the opposition, Mrs Marjam Rajavi. She has many followers among the young generation within Iran, who these days published their portraits and their 10-point plan for Iran on bridges and in public places: the separation of religion from the state, women's rights, rights for minorities, freedom of opinion, end of punishment death and Iran without nuclear weapons. This is a plan that deserves our support. The people of Iran expect the EU to show solidarity with them.

Let me express my deep respect for the thousands who have been arrested, and the many dozens who have been murdered at the recent legitimate uprising of the Iranian population. This uprising is one of the most important developments in the Middle East and I think we should get the message that brave – and mostly young – Iranians wanted to express that the people of Iran have had enough of their Islamic regime. They wanted, right from the second day of the uprising, Khamenei and Rouhani to step down. We must understand what is going on there. By their slogans they clearly said that they are not interested in any of the ruling factions of this regime and they reject it. We can easily see a rather weak and fragile regime, despite its adventures in the region by meddling in Iraq, Syria and other countries in the region. This meddling in other countries is to cover its internal problems. I think the EU and our European External Action Services under Mrs Mogherini should really revise the current policies towards Iran. In reality there are no moderates in this regime. Under Rouhani’s government, around 3 500 people have been hanged, which makes Iran the number one state executioner in the world, per capita.  So it is absolutely a very bad policy for our long-term interests and not just morally problematic to be on the side of this religious dictatorship. We expect our High Representative to tell the regime that we will not accept any of executions, and especially those of people arrested in these protests. I was quite pleased by the position adopted in the United States, and especially by prominent leaders of the Democratic Party who expressed their support for the uprising, and by the agreement with that position, including from Nancy Pelosi, Jack Schumer and even Bernie Sanders. Without any doubt, the position of my Republican friends is consequently against the regime. Colleagues, you may know that the supreme leader of Iran, Ali Khamenei, was silent for 13 days, and when he finally spoke, he blamed this uprising on the opposition under the leadership of Ms Rajavi. Even the top leader of the regime has admitted this, so maybe the people should take this seriously and support this opposition, just as we support a free Iran.

I think it is clear that the reasons for the protests are not political, they are not against, say, the Islamic Republic of Iran, as some Islamic Republic officials claim, but they are mainly due to the poor living conditions that Iranians have. Whether it is an economic situation in a country that is not improving, rampant corruption or Iran's expansionary foreign policy, which exhausts a large part of Iranian taxes that could otherwise be used for the benefit of citizens, social systems, health care, etc. I am therefore convinced that we should not turn a blind eye to the situation in Iran just because we have a nuclear agreement with Iran. Iran is a country where democracy simply does not work, where human rights are being suppressed, where the death penalty is being abused. Iran is one of the 3 countries in the world where the death penalty is most used - and I say abused - and the EU has always been a leader, a critic of the death penalty. It needs to be constantly reminded. After all, even in connection with these demonstrations, more than 1,000 demonstrators were imprisoned, some figures say 1,000 to 2,000 demonstrators, and some members of the regime are already talking about severe punishments. There is even speculation about the possible death penalty, and here I think, Commissioner, that we must play a key role on the international stage and simply do everything we can to stand up for the demonstrators so that those imprisoned are released so that the Iranian people can demonstrate freely in general, to express our political views, but for those who have been imprisoned to be released, and above all we must prevent reprisals or, in the worst case, even executions against these prisoners. That, I think, would be a very bad business card for what Mrs Mogherini was talking about here a few weeks ago, how they are improving our relations with Iran, as trade is growing, as cooperation is improving on the basis of that nuclear agreement.I am skeptical of the agreement, I am afraid that the Iranian regime, if it suits it, will break it, but I respect Mrs Mogherini's being more optimistic about this.In any case, because of this agreement, we should not turn a blind eye to the situation in this country and side with the United States, Israel and clearly help the demonstrating citizens of the state.", "language": "en", "original_language": "cs", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 230, "date": "2018-01-16.json", "name": "Cécile Kashetu KYENGE", "mepid": "124801", "text": "- Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the nuclear agreement with Iran, strongly supported by the High Representative Federica Mogherini, is working and is crucial for security and peace in the world.

Kenya is an essential player in East Africa, an economic powerhouse and an important pivot for regional stability. We all know how fragile the Horn of Africa is, with conflicts in Somalia, Burundi, Sudan and South Sudan. And we all know how important this region is for Europe as a connection between the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean, between Europe, Africa and Asia. We Europeans are strongly committed to that region, with our development cooperation, with our investment, with our military and civilian missions, but also a growing diplomatic engagement. Let me recall the meeting, convened by High Representative Mogherini and ministers of the member countries of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development in late September in Brussels, and we intend to repeat that meeting this year. This makes Kenya a natural and vital interlocutor for us. Kenya’s positive role in regional dynamics is impossible to underestimate, and relative prosperity, democracy and stability are essential to the whole of East Africa. Kenyan troops are contributing to peace and security around Africa, starting with Somalia, and the country has given shelter to about half a million refugees fleeing from war in other African countries. Kenya’s strength matters for all of us, but also for its own citizens and for the rest of Africa and the European Union. Kenya’s strength and resilience very much depend on democracy and rule of law in that country, and that is why Kenya’s rising middle-class demands that its business environment is improved and that more investment is attracted. All Kenyans aspire to free and fair elections with credible and accountable institutions. We have always supported Kenya in its path towards stronger democracy, including by sending election observers to every Kenyan presidential election since 2002. This is also an example of Kenya’s commitment to transparency and its relationship with the European Union. Our observation missions are never meant to declare a winner, that’s not our job. They are there to observe, to report and to make recommendations on how to strengthen the electoral process. The electoral observation mission to Kenya last year has reported substantial progress compared to previous elections, and yet the 2017 electoral process was still marked by some irregularities, political polarisation and acts of violence. As you know, the mission’s final report was published last week. The chief observer, Marietje Schaake, and her team covered both the August general election and the unforeseen but historic decision by the Kenyan Supreme Court to order a re-run of the presidential election last October. The mission’s recommendation for the re-run election has already played a constructive role. In particular, they helped the Kenyan Electoral Commission to make systematic changes which largely eliminated irregularities in the transmission and tallying of results, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank Marietje Schaake and her team for the fantastic job that they did there. The mission’s conduct has been balanced, constructive and highly professional, in line with the terms of the agreement with the Kenyan authority. Throughout the electoral process, Ms Schaake and her colleagues have reported on both the irregularities and the progress they witnessed, in the best interests of Kenya’s democracy and of Kenyan citizens. Despite this overall positive environment, the mission has received criticism from supporters on both political sides. This wasn’t just unpleasant, it was totally unjustified. The mission’s final report provides a good basis to discuss how to further improve Kenya’s electoral system, and we are ready to support this work, and High Representative Mogherini has sent senior officials to Nairobi on Saturday to pass this message on to the Kenyan authorities, even if no government is yet fully formed. There is room to build on the progress already achieved, and there is a duty to do so for the people of Kenya. Kenya can move towards a more inclusive governance and more inclusive development. All communities and ethnic groups should feel that they have a role in the country’s present and future. Kenyans have already decided on the devolution of powers, using the existing constitutional tool to achieve this goal. Kenya has huge potential for economic and human development, it can be a force for stability and growth in the whole region. But the only way to unleash its potential is by making democracy stronger and more credible. The people of Kenya can count on the European Union to help them achieve their potential, and I know that the people of Kenya can count on the European Parliament. So again, thank you for the work that you have been doing. It is difficult, it can be exhausting, but it is truly contributing to peace, security in democracy in our common region.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Liberals and centrists"}, {"id": 251, "date": "2018-01-16.json", "name": "Bogdan Brunon WENTA", "mepid": "124903", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - Madam President! As the Commissioner mentioned, the transparency of procedures and the verification of results were raised during the repeated presidential elections in Kenya last October. And despite the flaws and some mistakes that the election commission noticed, the victory of Uhuru Kenyatta was declared legally valid by the Kenyan Supreme Court. At the same time, however, a serious cause for concern is the growing political conflict resulting from the consequences of late legal changes in the electoral law, as well as personal changes in the composition of the electoral commission. The reform of the electoral process should be carried out well before the elections and be based on a broad consensus among all stakeholders. I believe it is important that a dialogue is established between the supporters of the president's camp and the opposition in order to avoid further social polarization, which is starting to take the dimension of an ethnic conflict, with the risk of indiscriminate violence. It is important that, in accordance with the recommendations of the European Union's observation mission, the ruling party is open to cooperation with opposition groups to guarantee the impartiality of electoral bodies. Strengthening the position of the Kenyan Independent Electoral Commission is essential to prevent future election results from being undermined. The cases of the use of force and repression by the security services against the opposition, especially the use of firearms against demonstrators, which resulted in the death of over 60 people, are also worth condemning, both on our part and internationally. But also opposition leader Raila Odinga should refrain from actions that undermine the country's constitutional order, such as the planned unilateral announcement of the so-called president of the people. Therefore, it is essential that the Odinga group takes on the role of a constructive opposition building its political position through legal and peaceful means. All of them political forces in Kenya must work together to prevent an open conflict like the wave of violence in 2007–2008, which, as we know, killed over 1.5 thousand people.citizens of that country.The recommendations in the report of the European Union observer mission provide good guidance to improve the electoral process and establish a legal framework, effective practices and strong institutions that together form the basis of democracy.Despite the existing problems, the focus should be on the future of one of the most stable and democratic countries in Africa.Especially in this context, the European Union and Kenya should strive for better cooperation in the coming years.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 252, "date": "2018-01-16.json", "name": "Julie WARD", "mepid": "124963", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group. – Madam President, after a troubled electoral year the situation in Kenya is still very tense. I visited the country three times in the 12 months from December 2016 and also received members of Kenyan civil society in my office. I have developed relationships with a wide range of stakeholders, therefore, and I want to reiterate my support to the Kenyan people who were so keen to engage in democratic life. When I visited Kenya in my role as a European Parliament election observer last August, I was struck by the enthusiasm of the citizens who turned out in huge numbers, waiting patiently in line in the cold and in the dark, including many women with babies on their backs, waiting for hours for the polling stations to open so that they could cast their votes. We do not often see such enthusiasm in Europe, so the Kenyans have much to teach our citizens about the importance of freedom and democracy. As we know, the presidential election was subsequently cancelled by the Kenyan Supreme Court, a brave and unparalleled decision which gave hope to many who believed the election process to be seriously flawed. This should have paved the way for better democracy and increased trust. However, the continuing intransigence of political forces has dashed the hopes of many. I know that colleagues from different political groups share my concerns about Kenya’s future, especially in light of reports about the use of excessive force by the police and the serious situation of human rights defenders on the ground, including indigenous people such as the Sengwer recently violently evicted from their forest homes, with two reportedly shot this very morning by the Kenyan authorities. My Group and I encourage all political forces in Kenya to genuinely engage in constructive dialogue in order to find solutions to the deep crisis in which the country still finds itself. They owe it to the citizens and especially to those who contributed to the writing of the Kenyan Constitution adopted in 2010 following earlier election violence. The European Union must continue to support Kenyan institutions in order to increase transparency and credibility, and improve governance. The institutions, including the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC), must regain the trust of the Kenyan people. Political forces in the country, including the government, must also respect the institutions, especially the judiciary, and the election observation mission (EOM) report very clearly states that the judiciary institutions have shown their independence during these difficult times, but have also come under increasing pressure from political forces. This is unacceptable and must stop. As a frequent electoral observer, I can also say that my experience has taught me that we should improve the way we observe elections, in particular with regard to recent technological innovations made to processes worldwide. Electoral voting changes the way that votes are counted and transmitted, and fraud cannot be observed in the same way if votes are cast on paper or on a machine, and counted by hand or number crunched on a computer. The interference in democratic processes in the UK, the USA and in Kenya by big data companies such as Cambridge Analytica, as reported by Carole Cadwalladr, amounts to a hijacking of democracy, and we must be alert to these dangers. In accordance with our Socialist values my group and I support civil society organisations as an essential component of peaceful elections, and I was pleased to be invited to a recent event facilitated by the Quaker Movement on preventing deadlocked and violent elections in Kenya and elsewhere. It is very important to ensure that women and young people are included in political processes at all levels in order to prevent conflict around elections, and this can only be efficient if done through civil society organisations working at a grassroots level.

As democrats in this House, we all feel a profound sense of sadness when we observe elections that are flawed, and reading the reports from Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and our own EU Election Observation Mission, this seems to have been the case for both elections in Kenya last year. It was hoped that the historic ruling of the Supreme Court last September calling for fresh presidential elections would have made way for a new and fairer poll. However, evidence shows that, on the contrary, independent institutions were attacked by political leaders, the police again used disproportionate force and the independence of the judiciary and the Electoral Commission were still put into question. It is particularly worrying that the Supreme Court was unable to hear a case seeking postponement of polling the day before the fresh election was due to take place, due to the lack of a quorum of judges. Was pressure applied on the judges not to turn up on the day? It is also deeply regrettable that opposition candidate Raila Odinga felt he had no choice but to withdraw as a candidate. Where does Kenya go from here? The weight of responsibility now clearly lies on the shoulders of the Jubilee Party and President Kenyatta. The world will be watching closely. It is a testament to the courage and resilience of the Kenyan people that their country has not descended into civil war, frankly.

The resounding answer is no. It is unacceptable to hold Kenya, or any country for that matter, to a lower standard. Instead, the EU assesses the extent to which elections meet Kenya’s own legal standards and commitments under human rights and international law. Unfortunately, during the 2017 elections, people’s rights were not always upheld and trust was eroded. Our final report, which is available for everyone to read, looks at the gap between law and practice and gives 29 recommendations. The elections laid bare existing tensions and created new ones that all Kenyans suffer from. No, the standoff has not resulted in as many casualties as in the past, but every death – and every death by a police bullet – is one too many. Some Kenyans complained that the world only has attention for the country when tensions escalate into violence. I believe the EU should be smarter and engage Kenya on core topics that benefit all Kenyans: strengthening the rule of law and good governance, supporting civil society and respect for human rights, fighting corruption and overcoming ethnic tensions. These are just a few areas that I do not think we hear enough about, while we hear lots about countering terrorism and trade and other such issues. Anyone who has followed the discussions on Kenya knows that over the past week strong words have been used against me. These statements have been revealing, but I hope mudslinging will not distract from the substantial discussion on our recommendations on electoral reform and on the joint way forward for Kenyans. I would like to thank the Commissioner, the External Action Service and colleagues for their words of support for the work of my team and the recommendations that we make. I am glad that the EU speaks with one voice. I call on Kenya’s political leaders from both sides to show constructive leadership and rebuild trust. Integrity should be baked into the electoral system, regardless of who is in charge and the independence of institutions such as the judiciary should clearly be respected by all. Over the past days, when people read the more critical remarks in our report, they said: ‘But Kenya is the most successful country in East Africa’. Yet, just because things could be worse, it does not mean that they are good or good enough. I remain convinced that we should never hold Kenya to a lower standard, including on the respect for human rights.

It takes time to build a functioning democracy and this is something that we who have had democracy for a very long time often forget. We take it for granted, and it is very dangerous because we then stop fighting to maintain it when it is actually threatened. We also have some young democracies among the EU Member States, and there we can see that what we mean by democratic rules is sometimes put out of play. We see the same or similar problems in many countries. The basis for a functioning democracy is, of course, that elections can be held in an orderly manner, that the organization of elections must be so secure that electoral fraud cannot occur, that parties can participate on equal terms and that winners and losers can handle any change of power peacefully. . Today, when we talk about Kenya, we know that those conditions have not been fully met during the recent elections and the result has, as we have heard, been violence between different groups and a large number of dead. The last choice is no exception. Before today's debate, I contacted my green colleagues in Kenya to get their picture of what Kenya needs today to move forward on its path to a better democracy. First on their list are far-reaching reforms of the electoral system in order to guarantee credible elections, at every election and during the conduct of elections. Respect for institutions and the rule of law as a cornerstone of democracy needs to be strengthened. There is therefore also a need for constitutional reforms that strengthen institutions and increase respect for laws and regulations. There is a need for an independent investigation into the violence after the last election and the perpetrators must be brought to justice. Citizens also need democracy education, where political mobilization is organized around specific issues and ideologies instead of around opposing ethnic alliances and personal interests over the common ones. But not only education is needed. Grassroots democracy and the active participation of citizens participation needs to be strengthened, not only during the elections themselves but in policy issues and decision-making both within and outside the government.Also on the list is to create equal conditions for women, minorities and the disabled to be able to participate in politics, for example to be elected by the people.Last but not least, my green friends draw attention to the importance of protecting whistleblowers.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sv", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 257, "date": "2018-01-16.json", "name": "Raymond FINCH", "mepid": "124941", "text": "  on behalf of the EFDD Group. – Madam President, the present reaction to the situation in Kenya is worrying.

The democracy of Kenya is crucial, not only for Kenya, but for the whole of Africa and for Africa’s relationships with the wider world. A strong and free Kenya brings security to the Horn of Africa and can be an important strategic ally for us all. The European Union must not destabilise Kenya by simply picking one side. This helps nobody except those who wish ill to democracy. One must ask why, alone amongst international observers, the European Union refuses to acknowledge that the election was comparatively free of issues. There needs to be international help for Kenya to enable trust, rather than trying to kick away the foundations. In this matter, the EU is running the risk of being perceived as acting in a high-handed and a neo-colonialist manner.

Well, I am not sure that Kenyan observers would find very democratic the way in which the European Union goes about muzzling the opposition in different countries of Europe. However, an electoral process took place in Kenya and, due to irregularities, was held twice. Is the re-election of Mr. Kenyatta fraudulent? Today, I think that no one can say it, since even Mrs Schaake, who intervened earlier and who is at the head of the procession of Union observers, changed her mind between August and October 2017. What we must see, however, are the qualities of Kenya: first, a political life more peaceful than among many of its neighbors, an engine of regional growth and, finally, a pole of stability in East Africa. Given the dire situation in neighboring countries, particularly South Sudan and Somalia, it is one of the most effective bulwarks against Islamist terrorism. You are not without seeing, moreover, the resurgence of the Islamic militia Al-Shebab and the courageous fight which Kenya is waging to contain it. Kenya may not correspond to the democratic, human rights and virtuous vision of the European Union, but it is a sovereign state and, what is more, engaged in a common fight with us against the 'Islamism. It is therefore risky, I think, to destabilize it without having the elements to decide whether or not an election by direct universal suffrage is justified.

The presence of an election observation mission has always been seen as an important instrument to support Kenya in navigating a potentially difficult election and consolidating the country’s democratic path under its new constitution. So naturally for the 2017 elections an election observation mission was also deployed. I was in Nairobi for the elections on 8 August, heading a seven-Member EP delegation which was integrated in the long-term EU mission headed by our chief observer, Marietje Schaake. It is important to stress that our EU election observation mission made a very balanced evaluation of the electoral results. All the Members who were there, including myself, observed the process in Nairobi, Kajiado and Naivasha and reach conclusions which were fully in line with the mission’s findings. I would also like to point out that right after the elections when the opposition issued a press statement that the election IT systems had been hacked and the election results fundamentally compromised, it was the international observers, and especially the EU election observation mission, who unanimously called on political leaders to act responsibly, to pursue any complaints through legal dispute mechanisms, and to ensure their supporters remained calm. This was a crucial moment in this difficult electoral process. We should support the EU election observation mission and our chief observer Marietje Schaake, the analysis and conclusions they made and the ensuing 29 recommendations which were presented last week in Brussels. As in the past in Kenya, the entire electoral process has been extremely difficult and created a lot of tension in the country. Now it is time for the government and the opposition to engage in a constructive dialogue in a spirit of reconciliation. It is time for the Kenyan politicians to bring the people together and work towards an inclusive and socially cohesive society for all Kenyans. Political parties have an important responsibility in this process, including by becoming more programme- and more policy-focused, and overcoming their reliance on ethnic divisions. Finally, the challenges and questions around the Kenyan elections have triggered a reflection, including consideration of the growing role of technology. We as the European Parliament, together with the European External Action Service, should reflect on how to better face the new electoral challenges in this respect.

Except from that point on, the electoral process took a very bad turn with defections to the electoral commission, which was already suffering from the suspicious death of its director, on the eve of the elections. Unfortunately, the October election generated less enthusiasm. What we regret most is that the Kenyan elections again resulted in loss of life and that the country emerged divided from the polls.

That is why the elections in Kenya on August 8th last year were eagerly awaited. Not only the president was elected, but also the members of parliament, the members of the Senate and those responsible at the regional and local level. After previous elections had always led to violent clashes in which many dead were to be mourned, and the pre-election process was also accompanied by violent clashes, the question arose whether the elections on August 8 would be peaceful, especially since there was a new electronic voting process was tried and shortly before the elections the member of the central electoral commission responsible for the electoral process was found tortured and murdered. All the greater was my positive surprise as an election observer that election day was peaceful and that the Kenyans went to the ballot box with commitment and accepted the time-consuming election process with great discipline. The events after the elections are all the more lamentable. The apparent loser Odinga did not want to see his third defeat in a row. The Supreme Court canceled the presidential elections - but only those, not the other five ballots, which were conducted using the same method as the presidential elections - and challenger Odinga withdrew his candidacy shortly before the re-election date. One hears that he now wants to be sworn in as president by his followers.

It is deeply disappointing that political leaders and security forces traded this for dispute and division, intimidating citizens, polling staff, civil society and the judiciary ahead of the October rerun. The result is a country bitterly divided along political and ethnic lines, at a time when the EU is looking at Kenya to be the engine of growth for East Africa and a partner in managing migration. We are one of the most generous providers of aid. Half a billion in the current financing period for projects under the Africa Trust Fund. Our priority should be to use this as leverage to support democracy and civil society in a meaningful way, not as a tick-box exercise. We really have to ensure that recommendations made by electoral observation missions are fully implemented and are in sync with the project we are supporting there.  Commissioner, numerous priorities need to be addressed, but I will highlight one in particular which other colleagues have already spoken about: the horrifying and wide- spread use of sexual violence against women and girls by police and security forces. In the 2007 and 2008 electoral violence, thousands of women were raped. This was met with impunity and indifference by the Kenyan Government. Ten years on, we are really seeing a repeat of the same atrocious crimes documented in a chilling report by Human Rights Watch. So, my question to you Commissioner is: will we make accountability for sexual violence and inclusiveness of women a priority for our relations with Kenya? Secondly, how do we move from this tick-box approach towards democracy-building and engaging civil society in Kenya in a meaningful way? Finally, how will we ensure a proper long-term follow-up of vital recommendations on these and other issues where there is significant room for improvement as far as our EOMs are concerned?

The re-elected Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta has taken office, taken an oath and has another 5-year term. Although the opposition claims that he was not elected legally, he convenes demonstrations, but the local organization that supervised the elections and their outcome claims that the result was OK. However, the police are dispersing tear gas with protesters, and this is undoubtedly no longer in order, and in this context it is necessary to fundamentally disagree with the fact that more than 70 victims have died in major protests in the past. Thus, although the opposition calls these elections rigged, it is necessary to accept the establishment of the president and his term of office. After all, the United Kingdom and the head of EU diplomacy, Mrs Mogherini, and other diplomats congratulated him on his victory. What should the EU do in this situation? I think it is important to strongly support the efforts of the group of prominent African figures led by Kofi Annan and to provide any necessary EU assistance to this group. The Council also mentioned the need for the international community to give its united support to the dialogue under Kofi Annan. It is also important, in my opinion, to support the UN's activities in response to the events in Kenya, which it is carrying out not only at the political level but also with concrete support for the civilian population affected. It is therefore, in my view, very important for the EU not only to engage in political dialogue, but also to be present in the country with concrete action to help the situation of the affected civilian population. Until a legitimate political solution is agreed, the EU and its Member States cannot, in my view, maintain normal relations with Kenya. It will be important to continue to monitor the situation in Kenya closely. All efforts to end the violence should be supported, which is, of course, a priority, but also ensuring democracy, stability and respect for human rights.

On the one hand, a people with an enormous desire to participate in a democratic electoral act. Five million young people with a strong desire to participate in this democratic election.

Of course, there are many issues that have been discussed here today, protests, people who unfortunately died in protests, on the other hand, it must be said that fortunately the situation in Kenya is not as in some other African states where civil wars are taking place, where various Islamic terrorist organizations are fighting. Nevertheless, there is room for improvement, and I am glad that today the debate is leading the EU and the EP voice to be fundamentally united in the spirit of calling on the various political forces in Kenya to work together, calling on the defeated candidate in the presidential election or who, in principle, did not even run during the October elections to respect the winners of the elections, because what other solution is it for Kenya today? It is necessary to create peace for political national reconciliation, space for reform, space for the functioning of the state and permanent questioning of election results in the presidential election simply will go nowhere, especially when those election results were recognized by the international community, as my colleague Dr. Polčák said. , The United Kingdom acknowledged these results, etc. The position of the United Kingdom, of course, in relation to Kenya is absolutely crucial. Nevertheless, I welcome interesting and important positive moments in this process, such as the fact that the Supreme Judge was not afraid to cancel the first presidential elections, which took place in August. The moment he found that the elections did not take place in full compliance with local regulations, he simply acted, he reacted. I thus perceive that the Supreme Court of Kenya operates essentially independently. This is certainly a positive moment, but in the future, precisely because of the inaccuracies needed throughout the electoral process, it would be good for the international community and the EU to call on Kenyan politicians to eliminate these problems in the future by amending the law and electoral reform.

In 2011, human rights activist Abdul Ghani Al Khanjar was sentenced to 15 years in prison in Bahrain; before that he was tortured for days. The reason for his arrest: peaceful participation in anti-government protests during the Arab Spring. The police showed him printouts of all of his phone numbers as evidence. This data could only be hacked by surveillance technology imported from Europe. There are thousands of examples like this. And with the current demonstrations in Iran and Tunisia, precisely this targeted spying is also happening in our day. The European Union is not allowed to assist in human rights violations. That is what this is about, and it is not negotiable. We fight for a trade policy that promotes security and stability in the world and prevents the spread of weapons of mass destruction and espionage. Man is above profit. I am very proud that we and my colleagues from all political groups here in the House were able to agree on important value-based principles for the dual-use regulation. I can see that there are no amendments and I hope that tomorrow you will all vote with me in favor of this report so that Parliament can enter the trialogue negotiations united and strong. I would also like to thank the Commission in particular for its excellent draft, which already contains many elements that are very close to my heart. I would like to express my sincere thanks to Commissioner Cecilia Malmström and the editor Stéphane Chardon for their work. With our design we are modernizing the export control of dual-use goods and closing dangerous loopholes. It's about time. Through revelations and investigative journalists, we see that dictatorial regimes use European spy software to spy on, imprison, torture and kill their people. Happens today, and we fight against it. As with the Ordinance on Torture Goods and the Ordinance on Conflict Minerals, we are continuing value-based trading. We are calling for clear definitions, uniform penalties for violations across Europe, uniform conditions of competition so that the economy continues to know exactly where it needs permits. The catch-all clause for highly dangerous surveillance technology is restricted enough not to interfere with legitimate exports and open enough to close known loopholes. If an export violates human rights, it cannot be granted a permit. The technical development of surveillance technology is extremely fast, which is why the limited catch-all clause and the associated European list are to be constantly expanded. The normal legislative process is too slow for that. It must therefore be sufficient for one state to recognize the problems and for this to become law if the overwhelming majority of the other states agree. We also call for more transparency, the publication of all relevant data on licenses and the participation of non-governmental organizations in the legislative bodies, because industry is involved anyway. We demand that encryption technology be taken out of export controls as an important defense against spying. And particularly positive for the economy: we are encouraging the Commission to convert most export licenses into a general clause that will cut red tape.

The subject we are discussing today is a true example of value—based trade.  I welcome this report for many reasons. First of all, because it is timely. One year after the proposal from the Commission the adoption of this report by an overwhelming majority sends a very strong political signal. No amendments – that is a signal that the rapporteur has managed to gather almost a whole plenary behind his report. It is illustrating that the process is moving forward thanks to Members’ determination. I understand that the Council is also actively proceeding with its examination, and I hope that the mandate for trilogues will be ready by the end of the Bulgarian Presidency.  I would also like to welcome this interim report because it shows the strong convergence of views between the European Parliament and the Commission. In particular, the introduction of a human security dimension that explicitly incorporate human rights into export controls reflects our commitment to a true value-based trade policy. The human security dimension subjects the trade in cyber—surveillance technologies to effective control. Cyber—threats increasingly threaten countries, businesses and citizens in the EU and across the world, and we must take action – and when and where necessary autonomous EU action – to ensure that this trade does not fuel conflict and human right violations.  We have heard your message on encryption and we share the concerns that trade in advanced IT products that contain encryption should not be unduly restricted at a time when we are racing towards the Internet of things. The proposed general export authorisation is an important step in that direction, but I agree that we should identify efforts to find the right balance between security and trade in encryption products. A few issues that require further attention. Firstly, the parameters of human security controls must be carefully calibrated so that they do not hinder the development of the EU cybersecurity industry, nor the trade in cyber—surveillance technologies that are essential to protect us against criminals and terrorists. Here the report by the Committee on International Trade (INTA) proposes interesting avenues for ensuring that this control will not stand in the way of IT—security research. However, we have to be aware of the unintended consequences of suggestions to identify countries that would be systematically subject to control. Indeed, a defining feature of export control is it is based on case-by-case assessments, and that is why we believe that controls must be targeted and take into account the precise circumstances of a particular export. The INTA report cautions against so—called extra—territorial controls and in this respect we must not forget that the overarching objective of the proposal is to adjust EU policy to rapidly changing technology, economic and security conditions. Technology is global, economy and trade are global, security is global, and proliferators do not care about borders or our regulations, so we must take into account that reality while maintaining control firmly within EU jurisdiction where we can act to strengthen them.  I would also like to point out that there are obvious links between different facets of the threat environment. It is no coincidence that the Wannacry cyber—attacks of 2007 were attributed to North Korea – the same malicious actor that puts international peace and stability and security at risk by developing nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles in contradiction of United Nations Security resolutions, and commits terrorist attacks in foreign countries using chemical nerve agents. This illustrates the convergence of security threats from the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction to cyber—proliferation and terrorism. So we must respond to the risk of sensitive items falling into the hands of non-state actors, and in particular terrorists, and ensure that controls contribute to preventing terrorism.  Last but not least, it is our joint responsibility to wield trade tools to effectively protect security and human rights, and the starting point for this is to make the correct analysis of the threat landscape. The broadening of the threat landscape today does not only concern cybersecurity. Autonomous weapon systems, artificial intelligence and additive manufacturing will shape our world in years to come not only in the civilian area, but also in the military sphere. That is why we consider that EU control should not be limited in principle to cyber—surveillance technology, but should be ready to address other emerging technologies of concern. Failure to do that would make our controls obsolete by the time the proposal enters into force.  So that is why we need to have a proposal that is capable of continuously adjusting to a constantly changing security, technological and economic environment, and we need – as you so rightly say in your report – to make the system future proof.  Again, thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Buchner, and to the shadow rapporteurs for the very constructive report.

While many politicians claim to be concerned with cyber security, anyone who can afford it can buy systems that collect massive amounts of data, can break into people’s devices without the consent of the user, and information can be removed unnoticed. This is unacceptable and regulation lags behind. The digital surveillance market should worry us in Europe, but the consequences of exports to dictatorships where the rule of law is absent is even more grave and unacceptable. The Arab uprisings seven years ago were often associated with the use of technology to advance human rights, but it has become crystal clear how repressive regimes have mastered technologies for their own goals and control, and this is not limited to the Middle East. Human rights defenders, journalists, critical citizens, dissidents and representatives of civil society are targets worldwide. It has taken a long time for there to be EU action but I’m very glad that we found broad consensus to update the dual-use regulation that will tackle this toxic trade with targeted measures on the basis of human security. Surveillance systems will require a licence before export, human rights will become a clear criterion to assess before a licence is granted, and definitions will be clear, so the private sector will not suffer or be hindered unnecessarily, and we in turn count on their cooperation. Similarly, we seek a predictable level playing field in Europe. We need to end the notion of so-called ‘licence shopping’ where a company maybe rejected a licence in, for example, the Netherlands, but can be granted one in, for example, Italy. At the same time – and I am glad the Commissioner mentioned it – security researchers should be able to do their job, which sometimes requires coordinated attacks on systems precisely to make them more resilient and robust.

Tomorrow, we will therefore be voting on control of exports, transfers, intermediation and transit, as well as technical assistance for dual-use items. Just the name is very complicated and these rules are very complicated. My goal in my work as responsible in my party group and - I dare say - my most important contribution in this work has been to make them a little less complicated than what many of my colleagues seemed to want. This is important, because these rules are important and if the rules are to work, they can not be complicated away to unusability. Because it is with these rules that we ensure that we do not export things that can contribute to weapons of mass destruction and to chemical weapons - something that the attacks in Syria have shown us with all the desired clarity is a reality in our immediate area as well. Now, with the update we are making, we can also help these tools, this legislation, prevent dictatorships from using European products to spy on their own citizens. New technology provides fantastic opportunities for people who live in dictatorships and suffer from oppression to break free and become free, but it also provides incredible opportunities for dictatorships and those who oppress to spy on, monitor and crack down on democracy fighters. This is also important for our economy. We talk about this too seldom, but treat this issue quite stepmotherly. For the products that are exported, and which are then also regulated under this legislation, in Europe - our export of them - corresponds to over SEK 4,000 billion every year. It is about millions of jobs in Europe in high-tech companies that sell these products, it is about qualified jobs, mainly in the IT sector. This is the new thing here: that it is the IT sector that will also be affected. International trade in IT products really creates benefits. We have noticed this, not least because we have abolished it all tariffs on IT products for 20 years and there seen how IT has revolutionized the world.In a few years, over 7 billion people, over 50 billion devices, will be connected to the internet.And we in Europe are, and must remain, world leaders in spreading this technology.It is important for jobs and growth here, but it is above all important for the freedom it can create and the prosperity it can create in the rest of the world.Therefore, this legislation must be useful and not nearly as bureaucratic as its name has become.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sv", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 286, "date": "2018-01-16.json", "name": "Bernd LANGE", "mepid": "1909", "text": "on behalf of the S&D Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen! If we as journalists were working outside the European Union and suddenly found that there is a Trojan on our PC, our communication system is monitored and we learn that third parties know exactly what we have been talking about, how would we feel then ? I think not very comfortably, and if we then found out that the technology was coming from Europe, then I think it would be clear that we would have to have a different regime of export control for such technologies. Technologies that can be used for monitoring and suppression, but also for billing telephone calls. It is therefore important to develop a clear line here so that such technologies cannot be used to violate human rights. That is why we have tightened the legislation on five points. On the one hand transparency: nowadays hardly anyone knows which applications are made, which exports are approved and which are banned. Sometimes you can find out with parliamentary questions - sometimes there are leaks. We want this information to be made available to the public every quarter. That already has an impact on practice. Second: We also want to have responsibility for companies so that they not only stubbornly look what is on the list, but also see for themselves whether our products, for example, restrict freedom of expression. And as the Commissioner just said, this should also be clarified with a manual - guidelines - so that companies' due diligence is going in the right direction. In addition to the list-based approach, according to which long-term products that are subject to special observation are recorded on lists, we also want a catch-all, because especially in the area of information and communication technologies the development is much faster than what we can do with the lists - so here too an improvement.We also want to ensure greater harmonization of practice within the European Union so that it does not matter where you apply.Fifth: It cannot be that letterbox companies, in Dubai for example, circumvent export controls.That is why the legislation also applies to branches and letterbox companies outside the European Union.And indeed, I am also glad that we negotiated for a long time with the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs and sometimes postponed the vote in order to develop a common clear signal from this plenary, which I think is good.Because it is absolutely clear: human rights have priority over economic interests.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 287, "date": "2018-01-16.json", "name": "Sander LOONES", "mepid": "128717", "text": "on behalf of the ECR Group. - There are goods and products that you can use in ordinary civilian industry, but at the same time you can also use them for military purposes.

It is important that we monitor them strictly. That we put strict permits on the table to tackle abuse. That is important for our international security, for peace, for the protection of human rights. At the same time, there is also our focus on free trade.

It is a modernization of legislation, which will enable us to better tackle new threats and at the same time be able to deal more quickly with new technological developments.

So a good thing. It is at the same time a compromise. In a compromise there are always points that you don't like. I especially have some questions about a number of points and their practical feasibility. 1. In this proposal for a European regulation, we also provide for an application outside the European Union, the so-called extraterritorial effect. There are doubts as to whether this is practically fully feasible. Also because the European member states do not really have the tools to punish those entities, which means that there seems to be some leeway and rules may be circumvented. The question can be asked whether the previous logic did not also have arguments, logic whereby you give the license to the exporter who lives in the European Union remains.2. As far as practical feasibility is concerned: there will be a new avoidance clause, but on this point too there are questions about sanctions, whereby sanctions will partly remain a national matter.That being said, this is a giant step forward.Again, special congratulations to the rapporteur.", "language": "en", "original_language": "nl", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 288, "date": "2018-01-16.json", "name": "Anne-Marie MINEUR", "mepid": "125037", "text": "on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group. - I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Buchner, who has worked hard to gain broad support for this report.

There are several European companies that sell technology to countries with a bad reputation for human rights.

It is gratifying that we Greens are also leading the work on this issue to reduce the wrong equipment falling into the hands of the wrong people and regimes. It is, just like with arms exports, that we must adapt to a changed reality. The Arab Spring and everything that has happened since then has shown it very clearly. It is seven years since the Arab Spring started in Tunisia, and although it has gone relatively well in some cases, it does not look the same in all countries where the uprising spread. The problem is that several Member States were involuntarily indirectly involved in the uprising of insurgents. When the activists were chased by the dictators' security services, it was with surveillance equipment from Europe, and that in addition to several countries also holding the dictatorships under their arms both politically and with the sale of weapons. Sweden was no exception. One year before the protests began, we gave permission for the export of sensitive mobile equipment from Ericsson to Iran and Syria. And the same year, the Swedish Minister of Trade was in Libya to sell surveillance equipment to Gaddafi. For the proponents of the Arab Spring, these tightenings come too late, but for future freedom defenders, they can be the difference between life and death.

That is why I would like to expressly support the compromise that has been found here - perhaps I should say: the sum of many compromises. I hope that this will give our negotiators in Parliament a strong negotiating mandate. My group supports the reform of the regulation on export controls and stresses the need for modernized export controls that take account of changing political and economic challenges and advancing technical developments. In addition, we support the principle of anchoring the protection of human rights more firmly than before in dual-use export controls. At the same time, however, we have always paid particular attention to the practicality of the regulation. It must contain practical and precise definitions of human rights and control criteria. We not only need vague principles that anyone can interpret, but which can then also create unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles. An essential principle should be that only really critical exports are in focus and thus the export of less risky objects is made easier. There is no question that we are committed to more uniform export controls adapted to the new digital methods, but at the same time not to restrict the progress and export of modern technologies that are used for legitimate and legal purposes. The aim must be to close any remaining control gaps at EU level in a timely manner, particularly in the area of ​​digital surveillance technology.

It is clear at the moment that all 28 are not committed to the same level of implementation of the existing regulation. I hope that will change with the new regulation.  We also need countries, like France and Italy in particular, to make licensing data publicly available. It is unacceptable to hide behind the shield of privacy in this area.

I believe that we all agree that the development of ICT and surveillance software, without adequate control, can put our security at risk and, of course, also facilitate repressive regimes to persecute, harass and practice torture against opponents and defenders of human rights. And, of course, European technology cannot allow it to help export and contribute to it. I think it is essential to point out that, with European technology - because there is no adequate regulation to control exports - it may be facilitating the implementation of policies that are endangering our security and, what is more serious or just as serious , which are endangering the lives of human rights defenders, journalists and political opponents who act and work against repressive regimes. That is why it is so important to modernize, improve and tighten this regulation. But we believe that it is important that, throughout the process and at the end of the Regulation, the demands that the Socialists have been making and the text as approved by the International Trade Commission are maintained. It is essential to extend export control to ICT and cyber surveillance, incorporate the human rights dimension, include this general control mechanism to foresee that in the future unforeseen products may be subject to control and ensure uniform implementation in all the states. And, finally, once we get this Regulation, Commissioner, I ask you to try the same thing that you are doing with the Regulation that prevents the trade in instruments that infringe torture or punishment of death, which is its internationalization.They have made a great effort, they have taken a great step forward and, once we have the European Union Regulation, we have to ensure that they also adhere to the same principles in order to truly end this type of practice.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 299, "date": "2018-01-16.json", "name": "Janusz ZEMKE", "mepid": "96784", "text": "- Mr Chairman!

We are introducing a new EU general export authorisation, simplifying controls on intra-EU transfer on sensitive products and technologies, we are developing an electronic licensing system in Member States and we are facilitating technology transfers. All this will reduce the burden of controls for the companies and also make procedures more user-friendly.

The point is how to prevent such a dangerous product from being transferred within a company to a branch that is outside the EU and can therefore no longer be controlled. No general theoretical answer can be given here, but recent practice has shown that we can pursue such originals. We can follow the path how it finally comes to the regime where we want to prevent its use. We have seen this in the examples in Bahrain, Iran and many other countries - so it is possible if you investigate it, and the advantage of this article in our regulation is that we can then really punish the company in question, what was just not possible before.

Trade brings advantages - I think that is more or less undisputed. However, that does not mean that the benefits of trading will reach everyone. Sometimes they don't go down well with those who produce the values ​​for retailers. And that is why it is eminently important that fundamental workers' rights such as freedom of association and the formation of trade unions are secured so that those who produce the values ​​can also use the advantages and not only multilateral companies benefit. And there is also an aspect of competition. It cannot be that trade allows unfair competitive advantages through environmental and social dumping. Both considerations lead to the fact that we incorporate rules for the protection of fundamental labor rights and environmental standards into our trade agreements. The key question is, of course, how do we build them so that they are really effective? We have already made approaches in the past. I only want to remind you of the agreement with Korea, where we have indeed integrated a sustainability chapter, with, for example, domestic advisory groups - made up of three thirds of companies, employees and NGOs - accompanying the process. However, it has been found that the possibilities for action are very limited. There are no proper rules of procedure, naming it is not as easy as we imagined, and there is no provision for domestic advisory groups to take legal action. That led us to say: We need improvements. And in the course of the discussions about the agreement with Canada, the CETA agreement, we called for precisely these improvements and now also have a revision clause in the CETA agreement on the modernization and enforceability of workers' rights and environmental standards. So it is important right here to start how we can make improvements. Some time ago the Commission launched what is known as a non-paper, which actually contains two options. One option is: we will basically continue as before. And the other option is: We look at the US model, sanctions in the area of ​​trade agreements, if there are violations of workers' rights or environmental standards in connection with trade flows. I think this model cannot be ours. That is not manageable and actually does not address the needs. The question is: Isn't there a third or a fourth between these two models, where it is clear that enforceability is shaped by other mechanisms and that compensation for victims of violations of labor rights and environmental standards can also be built in? I myself tried, together with the Friedrich Ebert Foundation, to propose a third model that brings a clear three-stage regulation in motion, domestic advisory groups with reasonable rights, a panel of experts who can and can make binding judgments for both partners then an enforcement mechanism if this judgment of the panel of experts is not accepted. So the question is whether there are other models to discuss besides the two proposed models and how the process can be approached. This question is hidden behind the question for an oral answer, but also the question of how we should proceed with CETA. We said that after the provisional application, we want to start the negotiations in order to reform and further develop the processes, i.e. to take the revision seriously. And the question also arises: If we do not have a further developed model, shouldn't such revision clauses also be found in other trade agreements? Otherwise it will be difficult to convey why we act like this with one and differently with the other.And of course the question arises of how the public - business and trade unions - are actually involved in the process.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 311, "date": "2018-01-16.json", "name": "Cecilia MALMSTRÖM", "mepid": "4273", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, as the previous debate illustrated – and it’s basically the same audience and contributors here – I think we are all very committed to having a strong value-based trade policy, and that is why we are committed, in the Commission, to having and promoting labour policies, labour rights and environmental standards in all our policies, including trade policy. We have trade and sustainable development chapters in all our trade and investment agreements, and they are a key tool in promoting that – not the only tool, but a very important one that allows us to work with our partners and ensure a level playing field for our workers and enterprises. That is why, as Mr Lange said, we submitted it to the European Parliament, the Council and others. We wanted to talk about this and how we could increase the effective implementation of these chapters to make sure that they are even stronger. We proposed this paper outlining progress up until today, as well as putting forward two real-life examples of existing approaches and asking questions. This is not a proposal setting out only these two options; these are the two of which we are aware, but there could be others as well. That is why we wanted to have this debate, and we don’t want to limit the discussion in any way, so we welcome feedback and proposals. The fundamental question that needs to be posed is: what is working, what is not working, and what tools do we need to better implement the chapters? Trade policy is only one important factor, but it is not the only tool to improve the situation in other countries. There are synergies with development policies, for instance, and that has been acknowledged in the recently updated EU Aid for Trade strategy. We are still receiving inputs on this. Countries, organisations, Member States and parliaments have told us that they are still working on their proposals, but thus far there is broad support for a more affected and more assertive implementation of the trade and sustainable development chapters, and there are specific areas for improvement which have been proposed. There is a need for increased transparency; increased communication on developments in trade and sustainable development-related proceedings; in dispute settlement; the strengthening of civil society organisations when it comes to monitoring; the effective implementation of the existing provisions; and more assertive enforcement and stepping up of pre-implementation efforts in order to increase awareness in our partner countries and tackle non-compliance issues. These are a few suggestions that are important and that have been given to us. There has been no suggestion that the broad scope of the TSD chapters will be abandoned. The discussion has not been concluded yet, but there is nothing that indicates a consensus emerging on a policy shift towards introducing trade sanctions. The key issue here is that sanctions are supposed to counterbalance specific trade costs, demonstrating that the trade costs of a country not respecting certain basic social and environmental standards has concrete effects on trade. With regard to civil society, it is indeed a very important ally in ensuring that labour and environmental standards are promoted. Civil society is also an important partner that is able to alert us when there are things are not going well in a country. Therefore, we are considering increasing the organisational capacity of civil society structures, improving their interaction with government bodies under the trade agreements, and stepping up the pre-implementation efforts to increase awareness in our partner countries and tackle non-compliance. This includes the handling of comments and information from civil society. All stakeholders have the possibility to submit views and to advise the parties through the civil society mechanism, but this process could be clearer. As regards the potential impact assessment or public consultation, the final results will have to determine that. It is a little early to say whether such a process would be warranted. In any event there will be several opportunities, in addition to the current one, for the regular assessment of the effectiveness of the approach chosen through the annual implementation reports and exports to impact assessment. So, discussions are still ongoing. We welcome the input that has arrived so far and those who have indicated that they would be coming. We are looking forward to continue discussing these issues with Members of the European Parliament.

At the same time, it needs to remain a key advocate for fairer trade. The benefits of globalisation do indeed have to reach all citizens and all communities. The EU needs to strive for an effective application of sustainable trade clauses included in our free trade agreements (FTAs), and our citizens expect us to turn theory into practice in line with the EU Agenda for Jobs and Growth.  The provisions of existing trade and sustainable development (TSD) chapters already include a comprehensive set of binding provisions. These are based on multilateral norms, respecting the relevant ILO conventions and multilateral and environmental agreements. I strongly believe that the EU can make a difference in the essential fields of labour rights and environmental protection, amongst others, and also through its TSD chapters in our FTAs. The Committee on International Trade (INTA) has a strong preoccupation with the potential avenues to improve the current affairs in TSD chapters’ implementation, and so do the EPP members in INTA. In—depth analysis and thorough debate have already been dedicated to the possible ways forward.  In conclusion to all that work, I can share the EPP Group’s view that we see sanctions as a last—resort mechanism and would appreciate turning towards more effective ways to deal with the problem at hand. Trade agreements can serve as a good tool for economic diplomacy. However, a sanction—based mechanism, by its punitive character, could possibly destabilise the relationship with our trade partners and backfire in various counter—demands. The experience gathered so far at the global level shows that trade—related sanctions fall short of delivering the desired results. On the contrary, these have often worked to the detriment of those that have introduced them, and concomitantly to the disadvantage of the less privileged partner. We do not see conclusive evidence that sanctions could lead to an improvement of the effectiveness and the implementation of the TSD chapters. The EPP relies on the efficiency of dialogue with our partners, and with all the stakeholders, and cooperation with international organisations, as currently stated in the existing TSD provisions. The way forward is to consolidate these chapters and to strive for the more effective and sustainable implementation of this important pillar in our value—based trade policy. Some of the concrete proposals have just been stated and highlighted by Commissioner Cecilia Malmström, and the EPP strongly supports these suggestions.

Our third way to trade can finally establish itself as the global \"golden standard\". All the major players in international trade look to us, from Japan to the Mercosur countries, via Australia and New Zealand: all our partners are asking us to establish even stronger relationships. From this point of view, we welcomed the Commission's initiative to launch a process of reviewing the most suitable instruments to achieve this result. We have already succeeded, in some cases in an innovative way, in including binding compliance with more ambitious environmental and social standards in our internal regulations. It is important, at this point, to continue on this path and identify a model that can be applied in all our present and future negotiations. We therefore ask the Commission to take steps forward in considering approaches that introduce more binding mechanisms in an innovative way, also through a gradual sanctioning system, not necessarily a Copernican revolution, or through specific incentives that are combined with greater efficiency in the resources dedicated to monitoring. I am pleased that in your words, Commissioner, you mentioned monitoring because the subject of monitoring actually still represents a problem, because it is often difficult to identify the most suitable subjects to conduct the process in those countries where there is no civil society. with sufficient tools to operate in this sense. In the same way, specific revision paths of existing agreements will have to be envisaged on the basis of an ever greater capacity to carry out broad and detailed impact assessments.

I have the feeling that what we can see here is a clear tendency to call for sanctions in trade agreements we are negotiating with third countries, and we in the ECR Group oppose that approach. We worry that applying sanctions would have a counterproductive effect on how much our partners would be willing to commit in the scope of the TSD chapters. Again, there are definitely limits to which we can use trade policy for some achievements in the field of human rights or environmental protection.  There is no doubt that TSD chapters must be better implemented, but there are other instruments, other options, that need to be further explored. First of all, an introduction of measurable targets defining clear procedures on how to deal with complaints and how to launch government consultations. Thirdly, to recognise that each trade partnership is a different one and that civil society takes different forms in different trade partners. Last, but not least, we should also make better use of our own resources – our delegations, chambers of commerce contacts, Member States’ embassies and all diplomatic channels.

Indeed, this evening's debate brings us back to fundamental questions relating to international trade and human development. Trade is a means, while human development is an end. Logically, everything should be done to achieve the ultimate goal of sustainable development. It is about health, education, access to drinking water in developing countries, in particular. However, we see that the rules governing international trade are well codified; they are generally respected because in the event of non-compliance, they allow the aggrieved party to refer the dispute to the WTO dispute settlement body, which is empowered to apply the sanctions in the defaulting country. This is not the case when it comes to achieving the goals for sustainable development. Admittedly, the United Nations has indeed adopted a resolution to this effect, but in the event of non-achievement of the SDGs, no sanction is foreseen. The process to be put in place to remedy this major gap in global governance is long overdue and will have to be remedied. It is not because the task is difficult, because it seems impossible to do it, that we must fold our arms and wait for Godot, because Godot will not come, as Václav Havel said, because Godot does not does not exist. But the Union does exist. Yes, the European Union should step up initiatives to ensure that the objectives for sustainable development come with a real obligation of result. The European Union must act on two levels. First, at the level of global governance, by trying to convince its G7 and G20 partners, as well as its partners at the WTO, that environmental and social standards are not only essential, but above all in the interest of all countries and of all citizens of those countries.A second avenue to explore is to include in these bilateral agreements, with all third countries, accompanying measures in the neighborhood policy, in its development policy, in its trade agreements, with a view to achieving these objectives.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Liberals and centrists"}, {"id": 316, "date": "2018-01-16.json", "name": "Lola SÁNCHEZ CALDENTEY", "mepid": "125035", "text": "on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group. - Mr President, it is no longer a secret: the fever of signing trade and investment treaties at all costs will have — and already has — dire consequences for many people and for the Earth.

This is indeed a good moment to take stock of those experiences and it is commendable that you, Madam Commissioner, have opened a discussion on this topic and that you are open to input on various options.  Obviously trade agreements are not done in a vacuum, but they should be in line with other – may I even dare to say – more important policies, but please don’t take me wrong. The UN’s Agenda 2030 which Mr Goerens mentioned is the overall framework that needs to guide our trade policy, as well as other EU policies. Primacy of human rights, social rights, as well as climate agreements, environmental questions, should be the norm in EU trade agreements, and the sustainable development chapters are definitely a great addition, but I believe that without legal enforcement, they lack teeth and here I disagree with EPP and ECR speakers who seem to be talking about a more kind of soft way.  We do have mechanisms in trade policy. We have the GSP+. It does have the possibility to waive the benefits that we have given to our trade partners if things go the other way and against EU values, so I think it is only normal that when we talk about legal enforcement there will be some consequences. It could also be incentives when things go well in terms of social protection and environmental norms.  I believe that we can no longer afford to continue putting environmental and social considerations into a second class category. Environmental and social obligations need to be on an equal footing with commercial interests. There needs to be a balance of interests.

The current proposals on the table seem rather vague, for example there is no clear \"dispute settlement\" system based on real sanctions. Without a mandatory and independent system, where stakeholders, trade unions, civil society, consumers and human rights defenders are able to lodge their complaints, any attempt to link sustainable development to trade will remain a futile effort. In the past, the United States has already used, albeit with problems, a sanction system in trade agreements. I believe that it is necessary to start from an idea like that, creating a new and satisfactory instrument which, however, provides for sanctions, such as the application of economic duties where such shortcomings occur.

The European Union is said to be committed to respecting human rights, workers' rights and environmental standards in its trade policy. But it does not hesitate to engage in trade relations with countries that do not respect labor laws, nor the standards set by the World Labor Organization. The Union does not hesitate to engage with countries which exploit children, men and women crammed into rabbit cages, with the sole aim of producing more with maximum profit. Have we not seen here the repeated and desperate attempts by the European Commission to grant market economy status to China? Brussels tells us again that trade policy must promote sustainable development in trade agreements; It is a very nice initiative that is by no means respected. The free trade agreements with Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the Mercosur countries, which she so ardently defends, are not compatible with the notion of sustainable development. Hormone-boosted beef, bleached chicken, cloning meat or GMOs that will fill our plates tomorrow will have first toured the world, with the resulting carbon footprint.

At the same time, we also expect that our international partners follow the same standards. That includes trade. I therefore welcome the Commission’s initiative to improve and ensure more coherent, ambitious and effective trade and the sustainable development chapter in the future free trade agreements. However, the question is how to stay competitive whilst promoting such a high level of environmental and social standards.  Trade policy is closely linked to sustainability: trade is a means to promote not only economic growth, but also norms and values that will help to address today’s complex global value chains, achieving a level playing field whilst promoting social inclusion and environmental protection. European companies for many years now have been committed to delivering such sustainable solutions, both in the EU and abroad. Nonetheless, free trade agreements are not – and should not be – a way to promote the EU’s social environmental standards. Trade agreements must first and foremost focus on enhancing trade and maintaining the international competitiveness of European companies. We should therefore not make the beginning of negotiations or entry into force of the EU free trade agreements conditional on the ratification of international conventions and treaties.

I will have to disagree with my colleagues from the PPE who spoke earlier. This is a very important debate and what we have neglected in the past is that the trade-related rules we have introduced haven’t respected the fundamental rights of workers or the environment. We have put a lot of effort into ensuring the rights of investors. We have discussed investor- state disputes and mechanisms for dispute settlement, but what about the right of workers to organise themselves for collective bargaining? These rights are even denied by European companies in countries where we trade, so we need to have not only a value-based trade order, but also a value- and rule—based trade order; and with rules that can be enforced by sanctions if they are neglected by our partners. Therefore, it is important to link trade with sustainability and, I would say, with behaviour on how the rules work in globalisation. The Commission produced a very good paper on harnessing globalisation last year and one of its aims was to empower the EU to harness globalisation to benefit people.

As we already know from previous successful experience, a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) is the perfect entry door for many other policies, programmes and areas of EU interest, such as human and workers’ rights or environmental issues. The Gulf area is a top priority for the EU as well. Related to this area, the EU has many more topics on its agenda than just trade: defence and security cooperation, the fight against terrorism and regional cooperation for the support and stabilisation of surrounding regions, especially the Middle East and sub-Saharan Africa. All of these are high priorities on the EU’s agenda. Unfortunately, the EU-Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) negotiations for an FTA have been suspended since 2008. In line with the current debate on ways to improve EU trade agreements, I would like the Commission to consider the possibility of a country-by-country approach in the Gulf area. The EU has already signed successful FTAs with many third countries. I do not see why we cannot have a similar approach in relations with GCC members. The Commission must know already that several GCC countries are open to a bilateral FTA with the EU. We all know Oman as a successful, stable country – a role model for the whole region. We also notice the remarkable progress made by Qatar in its legislation on the protection of workers’ right and labour conditions – changes that have already been noticed by both the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and the United Nations. These two countries can represent a good start for a new approach in FTA negotiations to be considered by the Commission for this region. Such proceedings have the potential to unlock the process for the whole GCC. We can even use the experience from a different area of policy, namely the visa regime. A liberalisation in EU relations with the United Arab Emirates (UAE) was followed by a clear increase in trade between the parties and improvements, at the same time, of the human rights situation in the UAE. Therefore, visa liberalisation can also go hand-in-hand with negotiations for Free Trade Agreements with these countries and others in the region.

He was European and Irish, but very much a man who believed in the power of trade to free people from poverty and destitution. I think it is important to name him in this House, because I think we believe that too. He also, in his latter years, did a huge amount of work to help refugees, because he believed in humanity and the dignity of every human person. Maybe in that context we should frame this debate about trade and sustainable development. We should also be quite anxious that Europe is perhaps needing to lead on this, because the WTO is not functioning as you and I would like it to. Maybe the Commissioner could allude to that and why this debate is so important. The issues of human rights, workers’ rights and environmental standards are something we hold dear here in Europe, and we fight for better standards all the time. We want to think that, when it comes to trade, those who we make arrangements and agreements with also strive to reach those standards. The question is how we translate aspirations into reality: how we monitor, how we control and how we use that term ‘sanction’ not in the way it is framed in this question, but how we actually get countries to react and respond to our concerns. One of our colleagues here mentioned the protection of producers. In that context, I want to talk about the producers I represent on the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. There is a real dilemma here for us in the European Parliament, because agriculture is always an issue when it comes to trade agreements and our concerns for producers and the food supply system that we have here in Europe. To some extent, we have concerns not just on the environment, human rights and workers’ rights, but around animal welfare standards and food safety standards. So this issue is quite broad and it needs careful reflection. The trouble, I fear, is that people will turn away from globalisation, and that the values and the merits it brought that Peter Sutherland believed in with great passion will be lost to future generations if we do not get this right.

Not least at the insistence of the S&D group, the EU has anchored sustainability chapters in several trade agreements. That’s a good thing. In the end, however, the decisive factor is whether the agreements are also brought to life, and we have some shortcomings there. In this context I would just like to suggest three things: I think it is crucial to improve the monitoring processes. Above all, it is important to involve civil society in its entirety - this is crucial - and to involve it as early as possible. It is also important to ensure that civil society has sufficient resources. Incidentally, this is not only a task for the countries in which the civil societies are located, but it must be ensured that these resources are available, for example to be able to prepare or commission scientific expertise. A second thing is, if one has identified violations, to be able to react appropriately and to react in stages. In this context I would like to encourage you to think about the extent to which sanctions against our own European companies can be useful. Because with all the violations of labor law in Bangladesh, nobody can tell me that the European retail chains did not know this before thousands of people were burned there. So there are also ways to think about sanctions. And finally the third suggestion: we don't always have to just talk about sanctions, but also about help and support when sustainability chapters are adhered to.

The debate just before this one, on the report by Mr Buchner, was indeed about how we can increase export controls to make sure that dual-use surveillance equipment and other items are not used to abuse human rights. Very recently, before Christmas, you voted with a very strong majority in favour of the regulation for equipment that can be used for torture and the death penalty. Before that, there was a vote on conflict minerals, so I think it is totally unfair to say that there is no human rights dimension in EU trade policy. Today we are talking about how to enforce the chapter on sustainable development in our free trade agreements. We do not have free trade agreements with China or Pakistan or Equatorial Guinea or other countries that were mentioned here. We are talking about free trade agreements that we have negotiated in partnership with other countries. So we need to find a way where they can also agree to have it included in the agreement and that is a challenge. But more and more countries actually do sign up to the same notion as we do, that trade policy should be value-based, should be progressive, should include elements that are not only about facilitating trade, but that are also sustainable and fair. When we meet in different conferences and so on, we have a group of progressive-minded countries – and that group is getting bigger – who do want to trade in this way. There are other countries where this is less obvious, and that is what we are talking about. Sustainable development chapters in trade can be a very important tool here. We have seen that some countries have been persuaded by these chapters to involve civil society in trade evaluation; this has been very useful. I think we all agree that we need to enforce this in a much better way and we need to make them stronger. The question is, how can we do this in a way that that actually works? I do not have the final answer today. I know that some of you are calling for sanctions. This sounds attractive, but we need to find a way, as some of you have said, that is fair. We need to prove in a trade agreement that violation of human rights in sustainable development is actually trade-distorting, and that is not easy. I am still waiting for concrete suggestions on how to do that. We need to focus on how we can improve this. As I said, we have already received many useful suggestions and others have signalled to us that they are working on reports. They will send them in in the coming weeks and that is extremely helpful. We have been engaging broadly in conferences, my team has been travelling to many countries of the European Union, you in this House have been active and many NGOs and many national parliaments have been active in this debate, and that is very welcome because it shows that we need to find a way to improve this. There are many academic studies as well. Many of them prove that engagement is more effective than sanctions, but we are looking at this and talking to different researchers and different academic environments to get more input on this. The debate will still continue. It does not have a formal deadline, even if, we should wrap up soon, but I want to give the chance to those who have signalled to us that they are working on proposals and suggestions to get back to us. When we have a clearer picture of this – and the debate seems to be fading out – I will be happy to come back to this plenary and further discuss it.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Liberals and centrists"}, {"id": 342, "date": "2018-01-16.json", "name": "Rainer WIELAND", "mepid": "2323", "text": "Thank you very much, Commissioner.I thank all colleagues who have done their own speeches the honor of hearing the Commissioner's reply.The debate is closed.Written statements (Rule 162)", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 343, "date": "2018-01-16.json", "name": "Agnes JONGERIUS", "mepid": "125021", "text": "written. - In my opinion, the pie is still unevenly divided when it comes to the benefits of international trade. Shareholders and employers benefit more from trade than, say, employees or the environment. That must change. Not only for employees or for the environment, but also to combat unfair competition between companies. I admit that the history of the trade agreements concluded by the European Union shows a positive learning curve. For example, a sustainability section has been included in the trade agreement with South Korea. However, it is not enforceable. At CETA, we have demanded that enforceability of decent labor and environmental standards. The European Union must ensure that the chapters related to labor and environmental standards can be enforced in practice. This means, for example, that people must be able to associate themselves in trade unions and have the right to collective action. These standards must be enforceable by people at the local level, with reference to the trade agreement.

It is supposed to go beyond regulating and deepening our trade relations with a consequent positive impact on our partner countries. One way to do this is to include sustainable development chapters in EU trade agreements with third countries. They can be tools for promoting relevant international labor and environmental standards as well as for the overall projection of human rights and good governance principles. Note, however, that the provisions on sustainability chapters are already binding and subject to a mutually recognized dispute settlement mechanism. The European Commission should therefore exhaust all existing means, including the dispute settlement mechanisms already agreed. The criminal sanctions mechanism proposed by some could destabilize relations with our trading partners with whom we want to conclude sustainable trade agreements, and thus be counterproductive. Moreover, such an approach would lead to a lower level of protection due to the more limited scope of FTAs.

The inclusion of chapters on sustainable development in its trade agreements is therefore a very good evolution. However, the enforceability of these chapters leaves a lot to be desired. These cannot be substantiated at present, as there is no system of sanctioning for non-compliance. The great danger is therefore that the words remain fine and good intentions with regard to working conditions, respect for environmental standards and human rights remain a dead letter. There is no strong incentive for the EU's trading partners to comply with these provisions. I call on the European Commission to opt for binding provisions on human rights, workers' rights and environmental standards. Binding provisions, with sanctions if our trading partner breaches the provisions. This also requires close monitoring of effective compliance. In this way, trade will no longer be tolerated with countries where workers' rights and environmental requirements are questioned.
