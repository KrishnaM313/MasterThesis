On Saturday and Sunday I took part, on behalf of all of you, in the commemoration ceremonies held in Paris, in the presence of the leaders of the whole world.  History is a great teacher, but we do not always learn its lesson. It is therefore the duty of each of us to keep alive the memory of the millions of dead of the Great War. It is our task to preserve the historical memory of those events, reminding current and future generations that this immense tragedy, in which Europe committed its suicide, was the result of clashes, selfishness and confrontation between peoples. Twenty years later, unfortunately, nationalism once again led Europeans to fight each other. Today, one hundred years after the end of the First World War, we can see that the friendship and cooperation on which the European Union is founded makes a war between states unthinkable, but woe betide us to regard this state of affairs as irreversible.  The European project unites nations and guarantees peace, freedom and prosperity. It enables us to solve our problems through political debate and not on the battlefields. Let us defend this project and these ideals, not only for those who come after us, but also to pay tribute to the seventeen million who died in the First World War, whose sacrifice cannot have been in vain.  Finally, I would like to greet, with affection and pride, the many European nations born of this conflict, which this year celebrate the hundred years of their existence, including Poland, Romania, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia.  I would also like to express our condolences to the families of the dozens of victims caused by bad weather in Italy. In many regions, particularly in Valle d'Aosta, Veneto, Trentino, Liguria, Lazio, Campania and Sicily, weather conditions have caused the loss of numerous human lives and caused enormous damage to the economy, devastating many territories. The European Union stands ready to help the affected populations through the European Emergency Solidarity Fund. I would like to thank the European Commission for making civil protection available. I would also remind you that, thanks to the efforts of the European Parliament, it is possible to deal more quickly with requests for aid and to anticipate part of the funds requested.  The fact that many countries of the European Union are affected by devastating climatic events is, however, a warning sign for all of us. It is undeniable that these extreme weather events are the consequences of the wider problem of climate change. We must therefore redouble our efforts to combat it. The COP 24 meeting, to be held in Katowice, Poland, in December, gives us the opportunity to reaffirm European leadership in the fight against greenhouse gases and harmful emissions. I also welcome the ruling by the Supreme Court of Pakistan on the innocence of Asia Bibi, who was able to embrace his family again after eight years in prison. We are now a look forward to the conclusion of the judicial process and the ongoing review and we are confident that his acquittal will be definitively confirmed. I am in contact with Jan Fige and the Pakistani authorities to offer our support to the efforts to ensure the freedom and security of Asia Bibi and her loved ones.

We survived a terrible war and a totalitarian communist system at that time. Freedom and democracy are not given once and for all.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Greek public is shocked by the murder of Konstantinos Katsifas, a Greek citizen, but also a member of the Greek ethnic minority of the Northern Continent in Albania, on 28 October - the day Greece celebrates the victory against Mussolini's fascism. This anniversary is also celebrated in the North Continent, i.e. within Albania. Katsifas's attempt to explain and celebrate was also met with intimidation on the part of the Albanian authorities and, above all, in the context of a clearing operation by the Albanian police, he was murdered.  We denounce this case of the murder of Katsifa, which was politically supported by the Prime Minister of Albania himself, Mr Rama. And that wasn't enough! The Albanian authorities, for ten days, did not allow the family to take the body and bury the dead. I have also written to you, Mr President, to intervene on this matter.  At the same time, a terrorist atmosphere prevailed during Katsifa's funeral. All this is complementary to the oppression suffered by the Greek ethnic minority of Northern Epirus. Churches are being torn down, houses are being torn down, violent expropriations are taking place. This is a serious matter.  We therefore call, as the ECR, for this issue to be added as a special debate today, before the short debate on minorities, and we also want a resolution to be adopted. The view heard by some political groups that the issue can be discussed at the small session where we are discussing Albania does not apply.

We have faced the challenge of achieving legislative proposals that are acceptable to both the European Parliament and the European Council, as well as to the European Commission, but at the same time allow european energy and climate change targets to be met. I believe that Europe not only has its long-term share of responsibility for the global environment, but also, unlike many others, has the means and potential to be the main architect of these changes.  I believe that it is no coincidence that today's debate on the clean energy package, and in fact the entire plenary session today, starts precisely with the Energy Efficiency Directive, because this is how we implement the 'energy efficiency first' rule in practice, and I believe that this trend will also be taken over by most Member States in the development of their energy policy.  On the other hand, at the beginning, we did not all share exactly the same view of how ambitious we should be in energy efficiency. Often, and it was because we otherwise interpreted the results of impact studies, or used other sources of mathematical models of the cost of energy efficiency measures, we differed greatly. But the European Parliament has always been one of the leaders when it comes to promoting an ambitious European climate policy. As elected representatives of the people of the European Union, we have full responsibility for finding the effective measures that, in my opinion, citizens expect of us.  We entered into negotiations with the Council in the spring with the call for a binding 30% energy efficiency target at the end of 2030, while the Council supported the 30% commission proposal in a non-binding format. We have had very long and technical discussions about the cost of the measures being implemented, their return and the impact on economic growth. I have always been and remain convinced, and I am supported by the results of impact studies and a number of analyses, that, despite the initial expenditure, these energy efficiency measures will have a very positive impact on economic growth, employment and on reducing the European Union's dependence on fossil fuel imports. I am glad that, after very difficult negotiations and many rounds of trilogues, we have managed to reach a compromise of 32.5%. I would, of course, like to see this figure higher, after all, I have clearly repeatedly supported the figure of 40% in the European Parliament, but let us bear in mind that 32.5% was a major concession to the Council.  There were also great discussions about the so-called Article Seven, where we ended up reaching a very good level of 0.8% of final energy consumption. This is very ambitious, more ambitious than the European Commission's original proposal. I would like to see, personally, the inclusion of transport in this article, which i did not succeed in at the end, but I believe that the Member States will behave responsibly in this regard. Finally, I would also like to mention the subject of energy poverty. As you know, our political group has long been a supporter of the idea of combating energy poverty on this ground. This has also made it possible to see recently that the problems of people who do not have the power to pay their heat or energy bills are more and more resonating among politicians at all levels. I am therefore extremely pleased, and I consider this a great success, that we have succeeded in significantly strengthening this aspect and motivating the Member States to prioritise investment in housing for the most vulnerable groups of the population in their savings planning.  The proposal for a directive will be revised in 2023, in the light of the implementation of climate agreements as well as progress in innovation and technology. We have agreed that we do not remain closed to higher ambitions, and I firmly believe in these higher ambitions. In the climate agreement, we are committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40% by 2030, and increasing energy efficiency is the most economical way to do so. I believe that, by negotiating legislation on energy efficiency, we have indeed created a huge opportunity not only for our environment, but also for European industry, services and citizens, including the poorest groups, and for our competitiveness on the world market, which is increasingly under threat. I would therefore very much like the European Parliament to approve this agreement tomorrow by a large majority so that all our obligations under this directive are clear.", "language": "en", "original_language": "cs", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 2, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 19, "date": "2018-11-12.json", "name": "Michèle RIVASI", "mepid": "96743", "text": "  Rapporteur. Madam President, Commissioner, I believe that the text we are going to vote on is a historic text because it is really a comprehensive project, which contains more than eight legislative proposals, including the proposal for a regulation on the governance of the energy union. In addition, it lays the groundwork for compatibility with the Paris Agreement and, in view of the latest report of the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), it indicates that temperatures can rise to 1.5oC. This text is also a historic agreement because, for the first time, we are talking about a long-term strategy. The 2030 targets will then be set, which will have to be consistent with what we want to achieve in 2050. The governance text indicates that greenhouse gas emissions will be zero. This means that all the greenhouse gases we produce will have to be absorbed at the same time. It is really a goal that needs to be set. We often talk about 2050, but I think that at the level of the European Union, with the contribution of the developed countries, it would be nice if it were 2040. To do this, we must be consistent with the energy efficiency targets of 32.5% and those of renewable energy at 32%. It is true that these objectives are superior to those proposed by the Commission and the States. However, it will not be enough to reach 1.5oC because if you follow these goals, you can be above 2oC. In other words, the review in 2023 will be very important. It is also part of governance, with targets in 2022, 2025 and 2027. These steps are therefore essential if we are to be consistent with the Paris Agreements. It is also an innovative text at the level of governance because it ensures that, in the States, there are real debates and discussions with the various partners, that it is not always the executive that decides, that the different partners participate and that, at the same time, it is transparent. Because the Commission also needs civil society from the various Member States so that the objectives - since they are European objectives - can be achieved. So I think that both transparency and the internet platform will allow access to this data. But there is a downside: we need to be even more ambitious. For greenhouse gases, we have said 40%, but everyone knows that if we set ourselves targets for renewable energy and efficiency, we have to go up to 45%, and if the target is zero carbon in 2050, we have to go much further. We are even talking about 55% in 2030. Similarly, the Commission and the States agreed, we included the methane strategy, which was not included at all in the Commission's proposals. In this sense, it is an innovative text. But I have a question for the Commission, since it will have to present scenarios for the long-term strategy on 28 November. I would therefore like to ask Mr Caete what is the status of the Commission on this long-term strategy and, above all, I would like to say to him that it must propose scenarios at 1.5oC, as the IPCC Group is asking, precisely so that we are- and my colleague said earlier - ambitious about the positioning of the European Union vis-à-vis the rest of the world.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "Verts/ALE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 6, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Greens and regionalists"}, {"id": 20, "date": "2018-11-12.json", "name": "Jakop G.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on his excellent The regulation on the governance of the EU Energy Union and on climate action is one of the most important regulations that we have been able to deliver in energy and climate policy during this parliamentary term. For the first time, we are getting a coherent and collecting tool to bring about climate policy. We would never have come here without skilled colleagues from the Green Group. In particular, I would like to highlight the great work of Mrs Rivasi and Mr Turmes on this legislation, but not to belittle, also my colleagues from the other political groups who, together with the Commission and the Council of Ministers, have shown great willingness to compromise. We often think differently, not least in climate policy, but because of the very urgent situation, I am very pleased that we have been able to come together, agree and show common willingness to compromise. Because we can no longer afford to be passive. We can no longer push the deeper green transition into the future. The consequences of climate change are becoming increasingly obvious, and we are seeing how it will become increasingly expensive and increasingly painful if we do not act. In Sweden this summer was the warmest in a very long time. We had serious forest fires throughout the country, and had not been in favour of the rescue we received from our European colleagues, the situation would have been very problematic. Now we also see how it burns in California. The situation is increasingly acute in more and more countries. In recent weeks, we have received reports from the IPCC on how far we have left to be in line with our climate targets. That is why this regulation is so important. It is a road map for us to achieve the Paris Agreement. We see how a clear climate policy framework to get all the way to Paris is now beginning to take shape when we finally get to a zero emissions target. We have a call for all countries to develop national energy and climate plans and for a mechanism to be put in place to identify when our actions are not in line with our objectives, so that we can correct the course with a firm target against Paris. This regulation also creates long-term rules for Europe's businesses and industries. European companies need to know what is at stake, what strategies, what technologies European countries will invest in, so that they know that the investments they make in new and green technologies will be profitable. In this legislation, we also see how, for the first time, the EU is starting to work on CO2 budgets. This is an important and historic step in order for us to have a scientifically robust climate policy. The climate will not be saved by beautiful speeches, but by scientifically based policies and carbon records. This regulation is a first significant step towards the Union taking responsibility on climate change. With this roadmap, we are now laying the foundations for a future climate policy framework that ensures that the EU does its part to achieve the objectives of the Paris Agreement.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sv", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 21, "date": "2018-11-12.json", "name": "José BLANCO LÓPEZ", "mepid": "125044", "text": "  Rapporteur. – Madam President, today we can say that Europe is responding to the challenge of climate change.  The agreement reached in June on the Directive on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources is a great agreement. For multiple reasons: Firstly, because we are going to double the current rate of renewable energy and go further, I have no doubt, in the 2023 review; because we increase legal certainty and simplify administrative procedures, which are crucial to ensuring investment; or because we raise the share of renewables in highly polluting sectors, such as heating, cooling or transport.  But there is a unique element to this directive which I would like to highlight.  Europe is often accused of being away, of not being in tune and of not listening to citizens, and today we can proudly say that Europe has not only listened to them but has placed them at the heart of energy policy.  We have done so by enshrining for the first time the right to self-consumption, i.e. the right to produce, the right to consume, the right to store and the right to sell the surplus of the energy produced.  We have done this by betting on extending the benefits of renewables to the most vulnerable citizens, contributing to the fight against energy poverty.  And we have done so by pushing for fair energy transition measures so that those territories where the weight of coal was very important can have a fair transition process, that they understand that no one abandons them to their fate.  The commitment to renewables is a commitment to innovation, it is a commitment to economic activity, it is a commitment to quality employment in a sector where Europe lays the foundation for regaining global leadership, and is a commitment to our own energy sources to be more energy independent.  Yes, one of the pillars of the Energy Union is precisely to strengthen our energy independence. Hence the path we open with this directive.  More importantly, this agreement which we have reached, together with the efficiency agreement, will allow us to be much more ambitious, Commissioner, in the decarbonisation targets set by the European Union by 40% by 2030. We can go further, we can review it and we can reach 45%.  Europe must be ambitious and therefore raise its commitments at the next Climate Summit by giving a leadership signal and giving, above all, a sign of commitment to the world, especially once the United States has abandoned the Paris Agreement.  And if these achievements have been possible, it has been because of the climate of mutual trust, the teamwork and commitment of parliament's entire negotiating team and also the commitment of the Commission and, very uniquely, the shadow rapporteurs of Kelly, Federley, Tamburrano, Henkel, Paloma and Turmes, as well as colleagues from the Committee on the Environment , captained by Bas.

I would like to take this opportunity in plenary to thank you all for the role that the European Parliament delegation played in June in securing a political agreement. My special thanks go to the four rapporteurs: José Blanco López, Miroslav Poche, Michèle Rivasi and Claude Turmes, and also Jakop Dalunde. I would of course also like to thank President Jerzy Buzek and Adina-Ioana Vălean, and all the shadow rapporteurs involved. Without them we would not have got such an ambitious package. At the beginning of next month the COP 24 meets in Katowice, where we are aiming for a successful outcome to agree on the detailed rules for the implementation of the Paris Agreement. The European Union needs to assert its leadership and, by giving the files under the Clean Energy Package its strong support, this Parliament can play an important role in making this happen. Closing these files strengthens the European Union position as one of the most active leaders in the energy transition process and helps raise our collective ambition. These are perhaps the three most important dossiers in terms of delivering tangible benefits because of the targets contained in these new rules. They will set a stable and predictable legal framework for the way forward and enable us to make this major transformation for the economy and society – the clean energy transition. Let me now say a few words about the three different dossiers, starting with energy efficiency. The key element in the agreement is that it sets a new headline energy efficiency target for the European Union for 2030 of at least 32.5%, with an upward revision clause by 2023. Thanks to the European Parliament, we now have an ambitious outcome for 2030. The changes will also extend the current annual energy-saving obligation beyond 2020. This is a measure that has been a key driver in the progress made in recent years. Taken together, these targets are vital as they will attract private investment and support the emergence of new market actors. This will also help drive research and innovation towards finding new solutions. ‘Energy efficiency first’ is a key principle of our energy policy. It is an area where ambition pays off in terms of benefits for reinforced security of supply, improved competitiveness of our industries, GDP growth, and increased employment. The agreed text includes a number of tangible benefits for consumers, such as possible savings on their energy bills, improved living conditions and improved air quality. Furthermore, consumer rights on billing and individual metering will be strengthened. The new rules will make household bills more transparent to ensure that they are more understandable. Last but not least, energy efficiency measures also represent an important instrument for alleviating energy poverty. Let me turn now to the Renewable Energy Directive. Here again the position of the Parliament delegation was instrumental in securing a higher target for 2030. The text foresees a new binding renewable energy target for the European Union for 2030 of at least 32%. It also includes a review clause by 2023 for an upward revision of the European Union-level target. This is considerably higher than the 27% target originally outlined two years ago. In broader terms, the revised directive further ‘Europeanises’ our approach to renewable energy, creating conditions for a cost—efficient deployment of renewables across the European Union. It introduces the principle of non—retroactivity for support provided, improves the design of support schemes for renewables to make it more market-oriented, and it streamlines the administrative procedures. For consumers, it establishes a clear and stable regulatory framework on self—consumption – for the first time in European Union legislation – which I believe will encourage more and more households to become actively involved in the clean energy transition as consumers. On the design and support schemes and the scope of tendering, the Commission would like to reiterate, though, that while fully supporting the objectives of the Directive, the Commission considers that they could be achieved without the respective wording of Article 4. This declaration has been transmitted to the European Parliament and will be annexed to the minutes. That brings me to the third and final file, the new Governance Regulation. While the revisions of the two directives will provide further impetus for investment in renewables and energy efficiency – the two major elements contributing to reducing greenhouse gas emissions – the Governance Regulation establishes the process, ensuring Member States achieve this in a coherent and the most efficient way possible across all dimensions of the Energy Union. It complements the European Union ETS Directive, the Efforts Sharing and LULUCF regulations, and provides genuine European added value. The new regulation requires each Member State to prepare an integrated national energy and climate plan for a 10-year period, starting with 2021 to 2030. This unique tool will allow assessing progress in achieving the Energy Union and our targets as it will, for the first time, encompass all relevant policies and measures of Member States and the results of regional cooperation. The Commission may then make recommendations on the plans aimed at ensuring, in case of deviations, that the European Union meets the 2030 energy and climate targets in the most coherent, collaborative and cost—effective way. The European Parliament and the Council will address, on an annual basis, progress achieved in the Energy Union in all dimensions of energy and climate policy. I must underline that the rules fully respect Member States’ choices in determining their own energy mix. But it brings a fair and robust mechanism to facilitate the collective attainment of the binding European Union renewables target, the European Union energy efficiency target and the 15% interconnection target, while also considering research, innovation and competitiveness. For the sake of completeness, let me recall two declarations made by the Commission during the negotiations: our commitment to analyse methane emissions, while at the same time preserving our right of initiative; and on the importance of a clear division of competences within the future two committees assisting the Commission in the implementation of the regulation, which we would have preferred to be in one single committee. These declarations are transmitted to the European Parliament and will be annexed to the minutes. The adoption of these three dossiers will mean that we will have finalised half of the Clean Energy for All Europeans package and set our main energy-related targets for 2030. The fact that the targets agreed are higher than those originally proposed by the Commission means that we can probably achieve even steeper emission reductions by 2030. Our latest modelling suggests that meeting these targets will de facto enable a reduction of emissions of roughly 45% across the European Union by 2030, going beyond the 40% Paris Agreement commitment. This will allow the European Union to show true leadership with real action in next month’s COP 24 talks in Katowice. We are making progress on the other clean energy dossiers – regarding electricity market design, including risk preparedness – and I am optimistic that, with the same ambition and constructive approach from all sides that we have shown on these files, we can conclude these before the end of the year under the Austrian Council Presidency. Taken together with other parts of the package, I am convinced that these changes will have a positive impact on our quality of life and ultimately lead to cheaper household energy bills. Similarly, negotiations on the low—carbon mobility package are advancing and we hope to conclude the files under this Parliament. You will also be aware that the Commission concept for the next Multiannual Financial Framework will put climate—related spending at the heart of our budget. As well as raising the ambition for climate, including clean energy transition mainstreaming across all European Union programmes from 20% to at least 25% from 2021 onwards, we are looking to boost the level of spending in all the main budget areas, notably research and structural investment. One of the main legacies of this Commission and this Parliament will be that we have put climate change and clean energy transition at the heart of our agenda. This is what we need to explain to our citizens, especially in the run—up to the next European elections, where you can be proud of the important progress achieved together. I look forward to the debate. Statements by the Commission (in writing) Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources (recast) “The Commission notes that both Co-Legislators have agreed on Article 4 with the content going beyond the general principles of the Commission proposal COM(2016) 767 final. While fully supporting the objectives of the Directive, the Commission considers that they could be achieved without the agreed wording of paragraphs 3 (third sub-paragraph), 4 (second and third sub-paragraphs), 5 and 6 of Article 4, as demonstrated by the currently applicable Directive 2009/28/EC.” Proposal for a Regulation of the European parliament and of the Council on the Governance of the Energy Union amending Directive 94/22/EC, Directive 98/70/EC, Directive 2009/31/EC, Regulation (EC) No 663/2009, Regulation (EC) No 715/2009, Directive 2009/73/EC, Council Directive 2009/119/EC, Directive 2010/31/EU, Directive 2012/27/EU, Directive 2013/30/EU and Council Directive (EU) 2015/652 and repealing Regulation (EU) No 525/2013 Commission Statement on methane on Article 16 The Commission notes the agreement of the co-legislators relating to Article 16 by which a strategic plan should be presented for methane. The Commission confirms its commitment to analyse methane emissions, notably in the context of the Union's long-term strategy. The Commission emphasizes however that it reserves the right to respond in accordance with the rules of the Treaty, with due regard in particular to its right of initiative. Commission Statement on Article 44 The Regulation on the Governance of the Energy Union is central to the Clean Energy for All Europeans Package. This Regulation aims to set out the process ensuring the ambition and coherence of policies and measures which are taken at various levels for the achievement of the Energy Union objectives and, in particular, the 2030 EU climate and energy targets. In their Joint Declaration on the EU's legislative priorities for 2018 - 2019, the three Institutions committed to delivering on the objective of an ambitious Energy Union with a forward-looking climate change policy, notably by implementing the 2030 EU climate and energy framework, by continuing to follow up the Paris Agreement, including through legislation on clean energy for all Europeans. Against this background, the Commission notes the agreement of the co-legislators relating to Article 44, which provides that the Commission shall be assisted by two committees in the implementation of the Regulation. The Commission regrets that the co-legislators could not accept the Commission proposal that the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission should be under the control of a single committee, in full compliance with the applicable comitology rules set forth in Regulation 182/2011 and in view of streamlining and Better Regulation. The Commission reiterates the importance of a clear division of competences between the committees which is essential for a proper exercise of the Commission's implementing powers and the application of Regulation 182/2011 establishing horizontal rules applicable to committees.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 2, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 23, "date": "2018-11-12.json", "name": "Florent MARCELLESI", "mepid": "26146", "text": "  draftser of the Opinion of the Committee on Development. – Madam President, UN experts are very expensive.

An energy package that is stimulating on efficiency, renewables and also making sure that we have a governance in place, that it’s not only numbers on paper but that we are really going to deliver. I think it cannot be stressed enough that it was really Parliament, at the core, that raised the ambitions on all these files. The Commission was probably forced by the Member States to come up with a proposal that was written some time in 2014, but I have to say that the Commission, during the negotiations, was helpful and realised that it could step up. It was helpful also in indicating that the numbers that were being used were outdated and that therefore we could do more on efficiency and renewables, which we are all celebrating here today. But it was really Parliament that played a crucial role in achieving that. In the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI), we were very much focusing on issues surrounding biofuels and biomass. I think it is good to realise that, for the first time ever, we have sustainability criteria in place for biomass use in, for example, power plants. However, that was another big fight, especially with the forestry countries who do want to sell their biomass all over Europe but do not want any European regulation. We are taking the first steps now, but you will see that more will be needed to make sure that we’re not just burning trees in coal-fired power plants in the future, which is still a concern for citizens. On biofuel specifically, I think the market signal is very clear: we are moving away from food—based crops and we are moving towards advanced biofuels. That market signal is very clear and it was also an achievement of Parliament to make sure that the caps we put in place make sense. However, there is still one big discussion and that’s specifically on palm oil. We managed in the end, and Parliament was very clear: we want to phase out palm oil. We have now agreed on delegated acts with a deadline of the beginning of next year, but we hear some concerns that forces in the Commission are a bit doubtful about really making a strong proposal on that. Let me be very clear: if the Commission is not going to deliver on this, the debate on biofuels will continue forever. It’s in your interest to make sure that this system can work, but then you have to be credible on limiting the worst biofuels, palm oil in particular.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, hundreds of petitions from European citizens have helped to update the very important directive on the promotion of renewable energies and I, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Petitions, am honoured to have brought their voice.  Petitions have revealed shortcomings and critical issues, including systematic, both in the existing legal framework and in its practical application in the Member States, as in particular in the case mentioned of retroactive changes to support systems. This new directive strictly prohibits this practice, precisely in order to prevent those who wish to invest in renewable energy from having to fear that their investment could be jeopardised precisely by retroactive rules that undermine the economic stability of projects.  Those provisions for The Member States on the publication of a long-term plan for support mechanisms, covering a period of at least five years, are therefore also a good thing, so as to improve the clarity and security of investment in this sector. The Committee on Petitions had been a little more ambitious, however, with regard to the EU renewable energy target. We were asking for 35 % and, nevertheless, the 32 % achieved in the final agreement is a very good step forward compared to the European Commission's initial proposal, especially as it is safeguarded by an upward revision to 2023. Europe finally comes close to its citizens when it writes rules like this on renewables, because promoting the use and self-consumption of renewable energy means increasing the degree of democracy in our society, it means taking concrete action to protect the planet from global warming, it means creating jobs in the green economy, it means tackling the problem of energy poverty, which today still affects fifty million people throughout the European Union. , and above all it means working in practice to try to leave a future for future generations, because unfortunately until now this Europe has been heading in the opposite direction.

First of all, praise and thanks to the Commission: this Clean Energy package is really well coordinated, from energy savings to the expansion of renewables to governance and also the references to emissions trading. This has not always been the case in European legislation, particularly in energy legislation. But then I would also like to praise us – self-praise. I believe that Parliament has achieved a more intensive energy transition at important points, but without exaggerating it. Member States and regions have room to contribute their very specific strengths to energy production and also to energy saving. In this way, we achieve the environmental and climate targets without driving out the industry and without overburdening our cities and communities. However, these were very narrow decisions in Parliament. The left side - red, green, yellow - wanted to save 40% energy. This would have slowed structural change to renewables, and would have overwhelmed urban and municipal redevelopment quotas for public buildings. 3% refurbishment rate, that would have been 2 billion euros a year for a federal state in Germany, North Rhine-Westphalia. Savings, commitment, commitment, regulation – these are the favourite words of the left, the Greens and many populists, including here in the House. But climate protection is also creative. But every region must be able to contribute what it does best. Flexibility and security of supply are therefore required instead of paternalism.

This package represents the most important work done in the field of energy in this term, and it defines the way forward for our energy landscape for the next decade. It has been a tough battle for Parliament to succeed, as we all know and as has been mentioned, on the energy efficiency and the renewable goals. In the first reading in this Parliament we asked for 35% for both. We were not able to maintain that, but we can be proud of this result as we had to overcome the resistance of the Council and, unfortunately, also a rather weak basis to work on from the Commission. This again is proof that this Parliament is of utmost importance to keep ambitions very high, and in that sense the regulation on governance is very important, especially given the absence of national binding targets on energy efficiency and renewable energy. The Governance Regulation provides the Commission with the tool to integrate and evaluate the National Energy and Climate Plan. Each Member State has to come forward by the end of this year. If the sum of the pledges in these plans do not add up to the Union’s collective goals, the Commission can make a Member State step up that ambition. It is extremely important to step them up because, as we know, the proposals that are in front of us are a first step but are not enough to meet our climate objectives to keep the temperature well below the 2 degrees – and, you know, that should be 1.5 degrees. This package deals with the goals towards the 2030 targets, and in that context of climate and energy targets, that means tomorrow. Therefore, however important, this is not an end, and this is not a stop. These reports are a crucial step of many to come. Reaching our climate and energy goals, as well as each of the SDGs, in a socially just manner, is the top priority of the S&amp;D Group, and we shall put these challenges not just here, but in all the files that we negotiate: for instance, the Multiannual Financial Framework is the next step to come. We are also looking to the long-term Decarbonisation Strategy for 2050, Mr Commissioner.

Madam President! Three years ago, Europe's leaders shook hands on an ambitious climate agreement in Paris. Hand-strikes to take the lead in the climate fight. But it can sometimes seem that these very same governments have been affected by what might be called acute green amnesia. They promised us gold and green forests at the Paris toasters, but at the negotiating tables in Brussels, there could suddenly be a long way to go. This also applies to my own government in Denmark, which used to be even more ambitious in the green field.  Just look at the new renewable energy and energy efficiency targets that we are going to vote on this week. This is an obvious opportunity to raise green ambitions. Obviously because we know that climate change poses a greater threat than ever before. And obviously because we know that the price of solar and wind energy is falling year after year. Obviously because we have to be independent of Putin in the east and the sheikhs of the Middle East. It is good that we could at least make some agreements and congratulations to all the rapporteurs who have been involved, but we are not ambitious enough on behalf of the climate. We need to be even more ambitious, because otherwise we will lose the fight against climate change that is taking place at the moment. We are the first generation to experience these climate change, and we are the last to do anything real and effective to limit them.

However, we cannot sit back and relax. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report clearly points out that we have to do much more than we are doing already, and we should increase our ambition. Let me remind you that the Greens/EFA Group in the European Parliament have asked for a binding 40% target, in line with the Paris Agreement objective and in line with the needs, according to the IPCC report. Some colleagues are referring to realism and reality. But let me clarify that there is no stronger reality in the future than climate change. We can do nothing with our economic growth or industrial activity if the climate collapses. There is a huge difference between the 1.5° or the 2° climate change, and that depends on our ambition in the Energy Efficiency Directive and the Renewables Directive. This depends on this Clean Energy Package. I have to emphasise also that it’s not only about climate change and the environment. A higher ambition is a strong policy signal leading to more business actors to come on board for the energy transition. It means consumers living in decent homes, saving on their energy bills, and hundreds of thousands of jobs created in the green industries – up to 900 000 jobs according to the European Commission.

I have to say, as a citizen who has joined the institutions, that I feel particularly proud to have worked together with some fantastic colleagues, which have certainly led to results that I myself never imagined. I dreamed that the rights of producers and consumers of renewable energy would finally be established, that there was a European right in Europe to set up energy communities, it was a dream that I had as a citizen, and here in this House, together with my fellow Members, I found people who wanted the same thing and we managed to make it European law. This should be the Europe of the future, we are writing it here, because we are finally focusing on something real: energy, matter, the circular economy. Then the European Union was born as a Coal and Steel Community and we are somehow going back to basics, focusing on energy, no longer on coal but on a new form of energy and a new form of material management that is no longer that of simple production of steel and manufactured goods. This should be the Europe of the future. There is a lot of talk about sovereignty, about nationalism.

Madam President, if the fight against climate change is necessary, it is a pity that this noble cause is being misguided. In the context of the energy union, the energy transition becomes a pretext for the European Commission taking power over energy issues. Energy is essential to the operation of our businesses, to the lives of individuals or to travel, and energy is, by its very nature, one of the main strategic policies of a state. National sovereignty in this area is, for our political family, non-negotiable.  The energy efficiency objectives are in the direction of the common interest and an effective fight against energy waste, they are one of the few positive points of the texts discussed today. Conversely, interconnection objectives should continue to be a matter of free cooperation between states. However, they will be subject to the wishes of the Commission, which intends to organise the interdependence of free nations. Similarly, binding renewable energy targets are a serious attack on national sovereignty. In the case of France, they do not take into account the strong presence of decarbonised nuclear energy in our energy mix. With intermittent energies requiring fossil fuels to compensate for their variations in production, we risk arriving at the paradox of an increase in CO2 emissions.  Governance also requires Member States to submit national energy and climate plans. It also allows the Commission to obtain binding powers over the strategic choices of energy mixes. A Member State that does not follow the direction of your technocrats should explain itself publicly and would be subject to sanctions. We have already said this in this Chamber and we will say it again, this is not the Europe we want. Finally, beyond this energy union, it should be noted that the fight against massive pollution due to excessive free trade and the resulting transport is never mentioned. It is true that a proactive policy in this area would call into question your ultraliberal dogma.

It is crucial for the competitiveness of our industries, for future growth and job creation. Improved energy efficiency targets will secure a better quality of life for those in energy poverty.

To say the least, the European Commission and the Member States have not had the courage of our founding fathers in the face of these challenges. The European Parliament has been more ambitious, but 32% is not yet up to what we need to do or what we can do. But I'm optimistic because I'm a realist. Renewable energy represents economic and industrial rationality if we know how to protect our industries, especially from Chinese competition. First of all, they reflect the economic reality, of course. Renewable energy has a cost that has been halved in ten years for wind power, seven for photovoltaics while the cost of nuclear power has tripled. Renewable energy obviously represents social rationality. One million jobs are created worldwide each year around renewable energy, that's two to three times more jobs per unit of production than fossil fuels or nuclear energy. Renewable energy is also synonymous with rationality in the development of our territories. How many of our territories today are marked by job losses, economic losses, business losses? Let us invest in our territories with the energy transition, this is geopolitical rationality, this is the rationality of citizens. Finally, we allow citizen communities access to renewable energy.

Betting on decarbonisation risks permanently losing the competitiveness of industry and enormous social costs, especially for economies with a high share of coal in the energy mix, such as Poland. Decarbonisation unfortunately takes the mountain over energy solidarity and a just transition. It will hit mining regions such as Silesia hard.

This will threaten economic growth and increase energy poverty. I have more recognition for the Renewable Energy Regulation.

Our imports are increasing, and so this makes us vulnerable in the European Union in the long run. After all, we cannot continue to become more and more dependent on Putin gas and oil from the Middle East. And so we are also talking about the fact that it is the energy bills of citizens and the competitiveness of businesses and export opportunities that are at stake.

This is important because prosumers will not be able to be ignored by Member States' legislation, as they have often been.  Secondly, I would like to emphasise the role that has been given to local energy communities in this regulation.

Biofuels: we have decided to reduce the amount of biofuels on the market that can pose a high risk to ILUCs, but I also want to stress that biofuels produced from native crops do not compete with food production, and at the same time high-protein feed can be produced in this production, and yet we import this protein – from soybean, for example – from those areas where this ILUC effect also causes soybean.

Madam President, I would like to begin by thanking Theresa May for I would like to thank you very much for this debate and conclude by highlighting a particularly important element of this regulation. Carbon budgets are one of the most important instruments we have to ensure a scientifically robust climate policy. It is an easy-to-understand and effective instrument that ensures that we achieve our climate goals. It is therefore great that this tool is now being introduced into this legislation for the first time in an EU context. It is about time climate policy was treated with the same seriousness as fiscal policy. A European carbon budget opens up the possibility of that. Then we can see, black and white, how much carbon we have left to spend and reconcile our climate action against that amount. Just as Europe's finance ministers are today being held accountable for the budgets of their countries, I hope that the climate ministers of the Member States will face the same treatment. It should not be possible to overdraft one country's carbon account without consequences. More work remains to be done before we are there, but the vote tomorrow is an incredibly important first step.

Despite technological advances that have drastically improved the quality of life for most of the planet, without nature and its resources, man cannot achieve the fullness of his existence. Our place at the top of the food chain also carries certain responsibilities. One of them is rational management of natural resources, and we have often been underdiaded as both Europeans and people. Protecting fish stock is high on the list of priorities for both parties in this debate and that is what makes me particularly happy. Our primary motive is the same and we are looking towards the same goal, but the path we want to get there is somewhat different. No one disputes the need for a multiannual bluefish management plan in the Adriatic, but we must resist some simple solutions that would ruin the fishing industry. The Commission considers that pelagic stocks in the Adriatic Sea can best be protected by quotas, which fishermen and professional associations from countries exiting the Adriatic, their governments, the European Social and Economic Council, medac, the majority in the European Parliament's Fisheries Committee and myself as rapporteur agree with.  This view of the Commission is to ignore the good results of existing practices recommended by the General Fisheries Commission of the Mediterranean and the harmful play on the fates of hundreds of thousands of people. The Commission claims that it consulted stakeholders in drafting the proposal, but it is unclear which stakeholders they are, as, as I have already said, both the policy and the profession in the countries concerned by this plan are strongly against the Commission's proposal. The consultation process was clearly flawed or its conclusions were eventually ignored. They also seem to have realised in the Commission that their ideas do not have too many allies – neither among fishermen, nor among scientists, nor among member states going out to the Adriatic Sea or in this home – so they put an escapement strategy on the back door.  I am absolutely in line with considering all alternatives to the Commission's initial harmful proposal to introduce drastic quotas that would destroy the fishing sector in the Adriatic and later the entire Mediterranean, and strengthen the economy of third states at the expense of the Union's members. The conclusion of the profession is that the effects of the escapement strategy cannot yet be accurately predicted, and that is why we should leave the discussion about it for the future, when scientific research will be able to give us more concrete information.  The multiannual plan for the management of small blue fish in the Adriatic is not adopted in five or ten years, but now. It must be based on practices that have proven to work, not on someone's desires or political ambitions. Currently, for the entire Adriatic area, a Management Plan of the General Commission for Mediterranean Fisheries is in force, regulating fishing effort and capacity through spatial-time regulation and limiting the number of fishing days per vessel. In Croatia, Italy and Slovenia, countries that consistently follow the GFCM recommendations, they are already delivering tangible results and there is no reason why the continuity of fish stock protection should be broken by new measures of a completely different nature. The annual 4% reduction in catches for each Member State, from 2014 as a reference year, which I propose in this report is a reasonable measure in line with the GFCM recommendations and represents a continuation of proven effective efforts.  Unfortunately, the Commission has once again shown that it is unaware of the regional differences between north and south of Europe. Quotas from the north can't work in the south. The introduction of quotas in the Adriatic and then in the entire Mediterranean affects not only the fishing fleet, but also the processing industry and tun farms that depend on small blue fish. To survive, the processing industry and tuna farmers will have to import fish from third countries. This means that the European Union is destroying the economy of its own members through legislation and strengthening the economic and political position of others.  This is not the first time that the Commission has hit the interests of Member States and Union citizens who want to live off their work through poor policy, but Parliament should not agree to such a game.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ECR", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 87, "date": "2018-11-12.json", "name": "Ruža TOMAŠIĆ", "mepid": "119431", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, honourable Members, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Ms Tomašić, the shadow rapporteurs and their teams, as well as the Committee on Fisheries, for the long work on this important proposal for the Mediterranean. This is a proposal for a first EU multiannual plan in the Mediterranean. Having a meaningful plan in place is crucial, given the overall dramatic state of the stocks in the area, with around 85% of the assessed stocks being over—exploited. In the Adriatic, the picture emerging from the most recent scientific assessments on small pelagics is crystal clear and extremely worrying. The fishing mortality is too high for both sardine and anchovy, and the spawning biomass is at very low levels. While there are slight signs of improvement for sardine, anchovy has a high probability of collapse within one to three years unless drastic action is taken. I want to be very clear: we need to avoid a collapse of anchovy as we had in the past in the Bay of Biscay. We must act now and not allow a new case of collapse in EU waters.  Such a collapse is not only about the fish in the sea, but also about the jobs on land. To be precise, the sector employs 1330 direct jobs in Croatia, around 1000 in Italy, and more in Slovenia. Catches are worth around EUR 85 million per year. This excludes the secondary sector, with 570 processing enterprises with at least 6700 employees on its own and worth EUR 150 million. This is why I have put forward an ambitious and serious proposal, capable of effectively guaranteeing the long—term viability of these jobs and the benefits for EU citizens. I wish to be absolutely clear on this point: without the steps taken in the Commission’s proposals, it is only a matter of one to three years before the stock will fail and, in doing so, we would have most certainly failed the industry and EU citizens. This multiannual plan was designed to allow these stocks to recover. Unfortunately, the majority of amendments voted by the Committee on Fisheries are of serious concern and very problematic for the Commission. They are not in line with the basic principles and objectives of the common fisheries policy (CFP); they deviate massively from the approach agreed in other multiannual plans that are already adopted, like the North Sea and Baltic; and they derogate from key legislation, such as the Mediterranean Regulation, the current European Maritime and Fisheries Fund (EMFF) and the control regulation. Most importantly, some amendments would remove entirely the obligation to reach FMSY or any target with a clear timeline, would eliminate the need to take safeguard measures if certain biomass levels are not reached, and would minimise remedial actions. Amendment 48 also dilutes the landing obligation, which is a central element of the CFP reform. Moreover, amendments completely ignored the scientific advice according to which anchovy and sardines should be managed separately and removed the possibility of setting fishing opportunities on the basis of FMSY. Finally, the report, as adopted in committee, introduces provisions such as a 2% reduction of the combined catch level of 2014 over the next four years. This is freezing the catch levels at their recent peak, which would neither prevent the collapse of anchovy nor bring the stocks close to FMSY. Such amendments are much less ambitious than what has already been agreed with third countries in the multilateral context of the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM), meaning the deductions of 5% per year in the next three years. All this sends the wrong message to our partners around the Mediterranean – in particular, after all the efforts deployed into garnering their support for serious actions in favour of sustainable fisheries in both the MEDFISH4EVER declaration and the GFCM. It is also essential to avoid double standards, whereby northern European Member States have to comply with FMSY and clear timelines, while southern Member States have targets not in line with FMSY and no set timelines. Being the first Mediterranean multiannual plan, this would set a bad precedent. Therefore, I have to be very clear that these texts are not acceptable for the Commission. Keeping them would result in a make—believe multiannual plan, which would be nothing more than a set of transitional measures that essentially will allow to maintain current excessive overfishing. This is not enough, and this is not what we all promised European citizens when we adopted the current CFP. Finally, to end on a positive note, there were a number of sensible amendments in the Committee on Fisheries which had been proposed to address some of the criticisms from the sector on the introduction of tax. These concerned notably the introduction of an MSY biomass escapement strategy. In the end, they were not approved by the Committee on Fisheries but have been re—tabled for tomorrow’s plenary vote. If adopted tomorrow, the Commission is ready to examine these amendments in the light of scientific advice. We count on your support to take a responsible decision that will allow us to live up to the basic principles and commitments of our CFP and to the standards of other multiannual action plans. Only if we deliver on our joint commitments can we ensure the recovery of the stocks, and thus the profitability of the fleet and livelihood of the coastal communities which depend on them in the mid— and long—term.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 1, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "ECR", "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 88, "date": "2018-11-12.json", "name": "Elisabetta GARDINI", "mepid": "58758", "text": "  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, i.e. the european Union, we must not Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, your presentation is embarrassing. I have no other way of defining it, because you are well aware that you have put forward a proposal which, if you had the courage, would have had to withdraw and then present another strategy, that of escapement, which, quite rightly – there are forwarded e-mails demonstrating this – from the Commission passed as an amendment for one of our colleagues. This is an absolutely undemocratic act and a prevarication of Parliament's prerogatives, for which the Commission should apologise. I am sorry to ask, because we could also accept the escapement strategy if we could amend and improve it and not take it as an amendment by a colleague, rather than an afterthought by the Commission. Having said that, it is clear that the Commission has the political will to kill fisheries in favour of aquaculture, which could also be a strategy, but I do not know whether you also want mad fish after mad cow disease. I would like to be able to catch fish that have grown and lived at sea and that are nutritionally positive and good for my citizens, starting with the children to whom I do not want to give the fish that are bred who knows where and who knows how.

You always talk about supranational things, adapt to supranational bodies, do not go against supranational bodies.

As shadow rapporteur, I supported the multiannual plan for the Adriatic Sea as a tool for the management of marine biological resources, with the aim of rebuilding stocks and restoring the sustainability of the sector. The management measures proposed by the rapporteur, Mrs Tomašić, are insufficient to ensure the survival of small pelagic stocks and the absence of decisive action could lead to the collapse of stocks in a very short time. The figures are clear and agree with those of the Commission's Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries. In recent years there has also been a sharp reduction in the average size of the catch. Only a few vessels that have direct agreements with large companies operating in intensive industrial fishing would benefit from the rapporteur's proposal. The majority of small Italian fishermen, on the other hand, would need a regulation that would guarantee work for everyone, even for years to come.  I have tabled amendments on the Biomass Escapement Strategy, which I believe can be a good compromise to protect sufficient biomass to guarantee the sustainability and re-breeding of stocks, but also flexibility in the event of abundant vintages. The amendments provide for the proposal by the rapporteur, Mrs Tomašić – a 4 % reduction in catches – to be adopted for the next three years, and that from 2023, if stocks are not safe, we will move on to the Biomass Escapement Strategy. This strategy is also shared by the most representative Italian fishing trade associations such as Federpesca and Coldiretti Impresa Pesca.

That is why I believe that measures and measures must be taken that are useful and reality in practice immediately, because any continuation of this over-exploitation can destroy fish stocks, and I do not think that is what anyone wants. Certainly, the fact that the drastic measures proposed by the Commission affect communities in the area and local and regional economies is a certainty, and in this context we must take steps to find solutions to fill these jobs. We also believe that the measures to be taken must be close to scientific data solutions but also to the solutions adopted by GFCM, and we regret that this report only talks about management measures after the first three years, which does not enable - in my view - to adopt long-term measures.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, in two minutes I would have had a real hard time listing all the points that concern me about this plan, which passed through the Committee on Fisheries, but fortunately many of them were mentioned by Commissioner Vella. I have been in this European Parliament for four and a half years and I have been hearing in the Committee on Fisheries about the disastrous situation in the Mediterranean, 85 % of overexploited species, a sector in serious difficulty. Yet now that the multiannual plans, which are one of the pcp's own principled instruments, are coming, we can see immediately how much they are being diluted, forgotten, ruined, reduced to something that makes no sense, no value, no effectiveness.  The Adriatic plan included quotas as an initial proposal. In the Mediterranean, quotas cannot be talked about, they are taboo and they are something that cannot even be taken into account. Colleagues who are so concerned about the socio-economic consequences do not think about the socio-economic fallout of a stock that can collapse, and which would therefore leave the people who work and earn on this stock on foot, and do not even think about the fact that where stocks are fished in a sustainable way, the profitability of fishing has increased considerably and therefore with great socio-economic return.  Now we have a plan on our hands that we've never seen in the other multi-year plans we've made. It is not multiannual because it lasts only three years. The concept of maximum sustainable yield has disappeared and, above all, it does not listen to the concerns of science or rather choose which science to listen to. I would remind Mrs Gardini that the Ecosurveys you mentioned are made about demersals, whereas this is a plan for pelagics. These are two data that cannot be put together, it would take a minimum of scientific knowledge to know. Instead, STECF tells us that stocks are in serious crisis and that one of them is in danger of collapsing. So we need a much more effective measure than we have in this plan and I hope that the alternative that you will have on the list tomorrow, that of the Escapement Strategy, can at least pass to give fishermen support themselves with this economic resource.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 93, "date": "2018-11-12.json", "name": "Anja HAZEKAMP", "mepid": "125023", "text": "  on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

Scientists warn that the pressure on the ecosystem is so great that if we do nothing now, the point of no return is imminent. There's no going back if we continue on this footing. Then the plant and animal species in the Adriatic will be doomed. In recent years I have been closely involved in the fisheries plans of the North Sea and the Baltic Sea and these plans have not been very good, but this plan for the Adriatic is absolutely everything. This is a carte blanche for overfishing, a carte blanche to eradicate anchovies and sardines, species that are very important for the Adriatic ecosystem. I therefore believe that the rapporteurs who drew up this fisheries plan should be very ashamed of themselves. They are jesing the survival of ecosystems, and I hope that Parliament will put a stop to this.

In the last five years, however, the supply chain has lost 50-60 % of its value as a result of competition. That is why we have thought of management interventions that take proper account of the real state of resources and that are not based only on precautionary approaches. In general, before the adoption of a management plan, it would be appropriate to carry out an impact assessment, both on the real availability of fish stocks and on socio-economic aspects, as also established by the basic regulation on the common fisheries policy, which closely affect micro, small and medium-sized enterprises, which are mainly Italian. The introduction of a quota system risks leading the entire sector to collapse after more than twenty years of crisis. The aim of this plan is to achieve and maintain maximum sustainable yield for the stocks concerned, to make the fisheries sector sustainable and to provide an effective management framework.

The main and final objective of the Common Fisheries Policy is for the activity to be carried out in the most sustainable way possible, not only from an economic point of view, but also from a social, economic and environmental point of view. All scientific advice shows that the situation of small pelagics in the Adriatic is critical and that additional specific and concrete management measures that allow the recovery of antby and sardine populations need to be urgently implemented. The proposal adopted by the Fisheries Commission is currently due to its temporal limitation, since the proposed management measures are limited to 2022 and change very little the measures that are currently implemented and that the different scientific advice indicates that they are not sufficient. After intensive negotiations and talks between the different stakeholders, a consensus was found that allows, without changing the rapporteur's proposal, to define management measures to be implemented after 2022 and substantially alterthe form of management advocated so far. With the amendments submitted by the Socialists and Democrats, it is intended to ensure that, with scientific information collected annually, catches are defined to keep reproductive biomass close to a constant level. In S&amp;D, we argue that only with these additional measures will it be possible to maintain this fishery and prevent the collapse of small pelagics in the Adriatic. The Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries concludes that small pelagic populations will collapse if only measures such as those proposed by the rapporteur are maintained.

The small size of fish of course has an impact on their marketing, but it also raises the issue of pollution, which has never been more serious, especially in the Mediterranean, and which also affects plankton, the main diet of these fish.

This plan is a logical consequence of what we have developed over several years, so to speak, on the basis of the basic regulations for the common fisheries policy: the Baltic Sea Plan, the North Sea Plan, Western Waters. Of course, we also need to look closely at stocks in the Mediterranean. There is no question about that. In the Adriatic, we are talking about a fishing area that is relatively clearly defined – also geographically clearly defined – sardines and anchovies, pelagic species, which are ultimately caught either by silent fishing or by trawling.  The scientific evaluations on biomass are necessary and have been carried out over the years, but they also have a tolerance range of between -20% and +20%. That is why we must also be very careful about quoting, because it will be the first time that we have tackled this, so to speak, within the Mediterranean. It is our common goal: maximum sustainable yield. If this quota is introduced and a drastic reduction is envisaged for fisheries, for the small sector, then of course there must also be socio-economic measures, which we accompany from the EMFF, from the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund: temporary decommissioning, which will then also be remunerated accordingly, catch loss premiums, which are remunerated accordingly. The Member States must also start cofinancing there. In this way, we can only organise a recovery plan that has been in place for several years, so that stocks can then recover. This is also very important for fisheries. Of course, we do not want small-scale and small-scale fishing to go bankrupt, so to speak, but we must support it financially until the biomass is again so clear and so clear that there will be good production of young talent. In this sense, I can only say that our common objective is maximum sustainable yield – maximum sustainable yield – to preserve jobs, but also to maintain the tourist attractiveness of these fishing ports on the Adriatic.

When you have a situation where, as has been quoted, sardines go from 15 inches to 11 inches, that has to be explained. What’s going on?

A few weeks ago we brought a fishing delegation from the European Parliament to my constituency, and one of the points made by the fishermen is that they felt their voices weren’t heard enough.

I would like to turn straightaway to some of the specific points raised by honourable Members this evening.  Let me remind you that, according to the common fisheries policy (CFP), conservation measures have to be based on best scientific advice. This does not mean that we can base our management proposal on individual scientific opinions. It means that we should use scientific advice that has been validated by the competent scientific bodies, such as the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF) or the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) Scientific Advisory Council on the basis of a thorough review process. Such scientific advice cannot simply be dismissed because the outcome is disliked. Let me comment on the escapement strategy. The maximum sustainable yield (MSY) biomass escapement strategy is a model already used by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) to manage nine short—lived species, for instance, in the North Sea, the Bering Sea or the Bay of Biscay, and it has been very successful, for instance for anchovy in the Bay of Biscay. For highly valuable stocks like Adriatic sardine and anchovy, the escapement strategy allows fishing a higher fraction when the stock biomass is high and a smaller fraction when the stock is low, but always maintaining a high probability of sufficient biomass. In the long term, it should ensure higher catches while maintaining a low risk for the stock. STECF considers that the escapement procedure could be an appropriate tool to manage small pelagics in the Adriatic and to achieve the MSY objectives.  With regard to the socio—economic situation: the socio—economic situation of the fisheries sector is closely linked to the stock situation. Healthy fish go hand in hand with healthy profits. This can clearly be seen in sea basins where we have moved to FMSY and profitability has increased. This means that if we do not act or if our action is not ambitious enough, notably when we have a stock close to collapse, the socio—economic cost risks being very high. With regard to the emergency measures, given the management void for Adriatic small pelagics in 2019 and given the delay with this proposal for the multiannual plan, we proposed transitional emergency measures in the GFCM annual meeting in October. These measures establish an increased number of spatial temporal closures and a catch reduction of 5% per year until 2021. These measures will apply to the EU fleets and will be transposed in the TAC and Quota Regulation of the next three years.  Someone asked why we are moving away from existing measures. Evaluations of the existing management framework have concluded that it is ineffective and insufficient to ensure the stocks will be fished sustainably by 2020. STECF has advised that managers consider using catch or landing restrictions as a more effective management tool for small pelagic. For example, even if effort is reduced by 20%, this does not necessarily translate into a 20% reduction in catches or fishing mortality. If a vessel comes across a school of small pelagic fish, it can take a large quantity in a short amount of time. Reducing catches, on the other hand, translates directly into an equivalent reduction of fishing mortality.  I would like to make three other comments: first of all, that quotas in the Mediterranean do not work; I totally disagree with this. Quotas in the Mediterranean have worked. The only stock in the Mediterranean which managed to recover was tuna, and tuna was recovered with a quota management plan set by the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT).  Another argument is that fishermen in the south should not be expected to do the same as those in the north. Why? What is the difference? The difference is compliance and the difference in the result is very significant. We have fishermen in the north – in the Baltic and in the North Sea, on the Atlantic – complying and their stocks have improved. Their profitability has improved. Quotas and management have given the result. Ten years ago, we had nine stocks at MSY. Today, thanks to management by quota, we have 54 stocks at MSY. This cannot be said of the Mediterranean, where we have 90% stock still being overfished, and where we have stocks still deteriorating and we will have almost non—existent profitability.  Finally, my last comment concerns the suggestion that I should be ashamed and that I am escaping responsibility. I do not think this is fair. I am not ashamed because I am acting in the long—term interest of the fishermen and in the long—term interest of the stocks. I would be escaping responsibility if I were ignoring scientific advice and if I were supporting overfishing. In the Mediterranean it was always said that quotas, rules and regulations do not apply. Why? Because in the Mediterranean the Member States are not alone. We have North African countries with us. So rules and quotas only apply to EU Member States, but not to North African countries. Again, this is far from the truth. Here we have two stocks which are dwindling. They only concern three of our Member States and still they do not want to manage. Why? Because they want to be different from the fishermen in the north.  Finally, let me finally remind everyone that all member countries in the Mediterranean signed the MedFish4Ever Declaration in Malta to start better protecting our Mediterranean fish stocks. May I ask if it’s going to be our own Member States who run away from this commitment. I hope that tomorrow this House will adopt a report which will set the Adriatic multiannual plan on a course very much in line with the CFP and with other multiannual plans (MAPs).

So, I was mething in my backyard. Universal solutions cannot deliver the expected results and I am therefore pleased that various proposals from all relevant stakeholders have been considered in the preparation of this report. The highest quality solutions that have almost plebiscite support from fishermen and the profession have found their place in the report and it is now up to us to give them political support. The Commission's proposals, which unquestionably lead to the weakening of our fishing industry, job losses, economic strengthening of third countries at the expense of Union members and medium-term discrimination against Adriatic fishermen against the rest of the Mediterranean, are unacceptable. Citizens chose us to protect their own interests, not other people's. I am sure that this report will receive parliament's support because it is based on solutions that are in line with the GFCM recommendations that are already delivering results. The introduction of quotas is rejected by both fishermen, and the profession, and scientists, and the governments of the Member States entering the Adriatic Sea. I believe that the Commission has taken a rather rigid position here, but I also believe that there is scope to change this position once Parliament adopts this report. And, Mr. Commissioner, you're comparing this to tuna— this has nothing to do with each other. You know that as far as tuna go, quotas weren't the only thing that restored tuna. Likewise, when the quotas went up, we couldn't get all those jobs back, all those boats that the fishermen lost.

Quite tragically, these events have highlighted our vulnerability to both natural and man-made disasters. Hence the continued need for investing on the ground in better preparedness and better prevention. EU support should help regions become more resilient and more sustainable. This is the rationale behind the cohesion policy.  You know very well that under the current programming period, almost EUR 8 billion have been channelled to the climate change adaptation and risk prevention. Clearly, disaster risk management is a main focus of our policy. We invest in early warning systems, awareness-raising, flood-protection infrastructure, green infrastructures such as flood plains or green urban spaces. Besides prevention, we work on preparedness, in particular support for equipment and vehicles or training for civil protection units.  It is also important to mention the contribution of the EU’s rural development policy. Support includes investments for the restoration of damaged agriculture and forestry land and production capacity, the restoration of rural infrastructure and preventive actions and risk-management tools for farmers.  But building prevention and resilience is a very complex process which entails a long lasting match between public investment and the reality on the ground. This is why, following the disasters of last year, the Commission adopted the so-called ‘risk EU package’, which included a screening of all relevant operational programmes. The aim here was to see whether there were any gaps in the support we provided.  The good news is that the current priorities in our programmes already match very closely with the highest risk that Member States have identified themselves in their national risk assessments. This is partly thanks to our funding.   More generally, we offer flexibility in our programmes. This means amendments can be proposed and swiftly agreed to shift resources towards areas that are most in need. So, if changes are necessary, they can still be made under the current funding period. The Commission is also supporting Member States in the implementation of the Floods Directive and will publish by the beginning of next year, an assessment for the first flood risk management plans prepared by the Member States under this directive. This mapping will allow adequate and coordinating measures to reduce flood risk. Besides a long-term approach to natural disasters, there is, of course, an emergency dimension. The Commission’s risk EU package, which I just mentioned, was also introduced to upgrade the EU’s emergency response, notably by revising the European Union’s civil protection mechanism put in place in 2001 to provide external assistance to Member States or a third country. It goes without saying that the Commission stands ready to help any affected country through this mechanism. Last, but not least, we have the EU Solidarity Fund, directly managed by my services. The European Union Solidarity Fund is pivotal as it complements rapid-response measures helping regions and countries to restore essential infrastructure, ensure continuity of public services, assist populations and protect cultural heritage.

Yes, indeed, in the last few days of October and the first days of November, a storm has passed over the whole of Europe, and this has also affected the Alpine region and the Italian Alpine region in particular. In my region, in South Tyrol, in Trentino, especially in the particularly affected Belluno, there has been rain over the day, there has been flooding and wind gusts of up to 200 kilometres per hour have bent over entire forests. Millions of cubic metres of wood are now lying and need to be reworked. In my region alone, 1.1 million cubic metres of wood are affected. This is particularly tragic because it is also a Unesco World Heritage Site, with wounds that will be visible for decades to come. The forests do not grow overnight. But what is particularly tragic is that people have also died: in total, 32 people have died in Italy – it was also southern Italy, the region of Sicily in particular. In my region, a volunteer firefighter who tried to help people at night has died in this work for his fellow human beings, which I find particularly tragic. Quindi, penso che sia bene che facciamo questo dibattito oggi, anche per mostrare la nostra solidariet, e condivido in pieno quello che lei, signora Commissario, ha detto appena adesso. Ma la solidariet deve diventare concreta. Certo che serve anche la prevenzione, per la gente colpita della prevenzione in questo momento ha poco vantaggio, serve aiuto, serve l'aiuto concreto.  Quindi dobbiamo fare di tutto affinché si apra il Fondo di solidariet. Viviamo in Italia in un momento dove a volte mi sembra che l'Unione europea viene resa responsabile per tutto. L'Unione europea responsabile per le difficolt economiche del paese, per le infrastrutture che crollano e per i flussi migratori. Viene dipinto un quadro molto buio dell'Unione europea.  Quindi questa anche un'occasione per noi. Un'occasione per far capire agli italiani e alla popolazione italiana che esiste l'Unione europea che aiuta, l'Unione europea solidale, l'Unione europea che in un momento di difficolt sta dalla parte della gente, e quindi dobbiamo sfruttare questa occasione.

Thank you for your condolences and solidarity, which I will extend to the families of the victims of an absurd tragedy in a hell of water, mud, carelessness and disinterest. You think the body of the last missing man, a young doctor on his way to work, was recovered only four days ago. In just over ten years, natural disasters have cost the European Union around EUR 100 billion. We are talking about a third of the entire budget that the Union devotes to cohesion policies. It is clear that, in the face of massive climate change, if damage is to be limited, preventive action must be increased and cohesion policy must be the instrument for supporting them in addition to the Solidarity Fund.  Local and regional authorities benefiting from cohesion measures are also the first to deal with the impacts of disasters. Disaster prevention is one of the central axes of regional development, and it is clear that cohesion must become the main source of funding for the prevention and fight against climate change, if we consider that, according to ispra data, within a century the increase in the average temperature in Italy could even exceed two degrees.  Prevention measures and interventions are left to the Member States of the European Union. It is up to them to invest and spend on infrastructure policies, but states and regions often forget to do so or cannot sustain the necessary investment. So, Commissioner, we really need the European Union's intervention now, because the EUR 114 billion devoted to climate change response measures, which is serving our budget, is no longer needed.  We need, in the face of a huge disaster, as we saw in my land only ten days ago, of all concrete solidarity, of aid, support, of funds, of compensation for those who, in addition to life, have even lost what was their work, their daily lives.

You see, such serious events have happened there that we felt a duty to move as a Venetian community. Thousands of volunteers have arrived, 100 000 hectares of forests have fallen, forests that have always been protected, Commissioner. There is a model there that is called \"the rules\", which have protected that extraordinary territory that is a very beautiful but very difficult territory. We also made some mistakes there. The first mistake we made when we decided to pass the energy by air through wires and poles. This led to the great disaster: thousands and thousands of utilities cancelled for days, people in great difficulty. And all this because in past years we have not wanted to spend a few extra money to bury those cables.  I must thank Mr De Carlo, as well as mayor of a community in the province of Belluno, because he accompanied me and made me understand how important it is. I have already run out of time, but I would like to conclude with three very very important facts. You see, St. Mark's Basilica has been totally submerged.

And even more so, in view of the tragic events and the victims that we have mourned in recent weeks, it is clear that hydrogeological rehabilitation is the real and absolute priority for Italy. It should be for the Italian Government, it should be for the European Union, and instead we continue to hear about budgetary constraints, fiscal compacts, TAPs, high-quality trains, major useless and harmful works that drain enormous resources.  Again, the government continues the tradition of Craxi and Berlusconi with a new building amnesty. On the contrary, resources would be needed, first and foremost for those municipalities that are engaged in the detection of building abuses and that instead lack the essential structures for the application of laws against abuse. Municipalities which, as a result of budget cuts and constraints, have been deprived of resources, powers and means to tackle a very serious problem. In Sicily, in Casteldaccia, a whole family lost their lives because it was not possible to complete the process of demolishing a building built by a river and certified as abusive for years. Damage also multiplies due to the thirst for continuous profit.

We ask Europe for maximum cooperation to help the Venetians, friulians and all Italians who have been affected by the bad weather and who are already working to rebuild our countries.  We do not want Europe's alms, because our people are used to working, pulling up their sleeves and doing it themselves. In Brussels we are only asking for what is ours, which is the Italians.

Of course, this is not about an ordinary file; it is about people who have lost their loved ones and some of them who have lost everything. To them, I think, we have to have the same message, together: that Europe cares, that Europe is here to help. It is our common job. You know, of course, that I am in charge of Cohesion Policy, and I think Cohesion Policy has in its very essence the European solidarity. The European Union as a whole has benefited each time about European solidarity. So it’s quite natural, when floods occur, that the European Union’s mission – European Union added value – lies by the side of the victims in the damaged regions, not only on the ground but also in the air. Last week, for example, after the request from the Italian authorities, the European Commission mobilised the Copernicus emergency satellite. I think close to 50 highly-detailed satellite maps were provided to assess the damage to the affected regions. I am sorry to say, but it’s not fair to say that Europe didn’t show solidarity to Italy. Italy is the first country that benefited in the last year by the Solidarity Fund. I would like to remind you about our solidarity at the time of the earthquakes. I was there on the ground. President Juncker was there on the ground, and on the emergency procedures we released EUR 1.2 billion for the four regions affected by the earthquake in Italy. So let’s not be populist. We are waiting now for the assessment of the damage because we cannot do the assessment of the damage. It’s part of the job of the Italian government. We are working hand in hand, but we cannot assess the damage when we don’t know how much. And I would like to tell you something: you in the European Parliament and in the Council made the regulation of the Solidarity Fund, and it was not written in the regulation how we measure the life of one person. You put in the regulation – the European Parliament – that we assess only economic damage. It’s tragic that we don’t compensate, and do you want to do for the next programing period this idea to compensate the families who lose the life of their loved one? But we don’t have in the regulations something like that now, so we assess only economic damages and we waiting for the Italian government to give us the assessment. We are also open to shift or change operational programmes on the request of the Italian government. I am in direct contact with Madam Lezzi, with the Minister. They are working hard with the local administration because it is not easy to evaluate the damage. But Europe is here, and we are here day by night to help, and we were there during the earthquake. So I think it’s very easy to blame the European Commission. But look also at what is happening in local and regional policy, because in some regions – not even now – the money that we have released last year in Italy didn’t reach the people affected by the earthquake. I would like just to say that we have large interventions in Europe – in Madeira, in Greece. You know very well that last year we were in contact in Greece, in Evia. We showed solidarity but it was the same problem: that we don’t have how to measure the lives and it was not an economical area there in Greece, so Greece didn’t qualify to apply for the Solidarity Fund, unfortunately, but we compensate by more EU funds for the Attica region. I think we need to show to the people how much and strong the response in the European Union is needed to such tragic circumstances. But we have to be fair: to be fair that we have shared management and shared responsibilities. Of course we are coming with the emergency response. We come also with the Solidarity Fund, which is not an emergency tool; it compensates for the day one. But at the same time it is also the responsibility of the government and the local authorities, for which I have full sympathies in such moments. So let’s face things very clearly: things will not get better. Unfortunately the effects of climate change are getting harsher, and we will certainly continue to pay the price of decades of unsustainable land and country planning. We need to put all our efforts, all our ideas in prevention and resilience-building to mitigate the effects not only of floods but also, as I said, of forest fires, earthquakes, coastal erosion and drought. Europe must keep strong on emergency response. It’s a matter of saving and preserving lives, as I said, but it’s also a long-distance run that will go beyond the many multiannual financial frameworks to come.

We need to develop and implement ecologically conscious solutions that are naturally fit, where we can channel the huge excess water that we draw from flooding and use it to alleviate water scarcity during drought. Sustainable management of the body of water generated after flooding should aim to provide as wide a range of ecological services as possible.  The other fact about the floods, which I would like to draw your attention to, is the latest IPCC publication that it is still possible to keep the temperature rise below 1.5C!

The European Union's motto is 'United in Diversity', which emphasises respect for diversity as one of the fundamental values of the European Union. Minority rights are not only important for minorities, they are in the interests of all of us. We are well known that the deregard for minority rights leads to hatred, ethnic conflicts and even wars. Yes, here on our democratic continent, we have seen more ethnic carnage and war in the last 20 years, starting with the Balkans and, hopefully, ending with Ukraine. The tragic police action and manslaughter against the Greek minority in Macedonia the other day has also been insted by ethnic tensions. A well-functioning, strong democracy recognises this and does its best to maintain peace and security. The protection of the rights of minorities is a means of doing so. I therefore consider the institution of the EU Minimum Minority Law to be primarily a peace project, which also benefits the majority nations. Today, nearly 40 million citizens in Europe consider themselves to belong to national or linguistic and cultural minorities. And rightly so, these 40 million people want to preserve their traditions and cultural identity. EU Member States generally provide a high level of legal security and comfort to minorities in their territory and the legal framework for this has been developed in most Member States. Unfortunately, EU practice and access to services in this direction are no longer so ideal, and unfortunately it is often the case that, without the rights declared in international conventions, ethnic discrimination is used to inst cause tensions between citizens and the nationality card is also used to gain political power. To prevent these abuses, I have prepared this report, which is in order to create a accountable European minimum minority law. Of course, Member States continue to define their own minorities on the basis of the principle of subsidiarity. The three pillars of my report and the proposed minimum law are the EU-wide guarantee of education, culture and language rights. Because I believe that the European Union is capable of legislating in these three areas. We have respected the exclusive powers of the Member States, the political rights: the definition of territorial self-government and electoral rights remains the responsibility of the Member States. I am particularly interested in discrimination, hate crimes and hate speech and the means of combating them, which is in the interest of all of us. My aim is to give people belonging to minorities the courage to exercise their basic cultural and linguistic rights in their homes and on the streets, anywhere in Europe, without fear. My aim is to ensure that education in minority languages is accepted and of a high standard throughout Europe, forming bridges between the cultures of the majority and the cultures of the minority, knowing, accepting and supporting each other. The Treaty of the European Union states that 'the Union respects its own cultural and linguistic diversity and ensures the preservation and further enhancement of Europe's cultural heritage'. If our real aim is to preserve our European culture and pass it on to future generations, then we also have a duty to ensure the rights of minorities! I call on my fellow Members to support my report and the Commission to send its legislative proposal for EU minimum legislation as soon as possible.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hu", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 122, "date": "2018-11-12.json", "name": "Andrea BOCSKOR", "mepid": "124712", "text": "   – First of all, I would like to thank my fellow Member Jozsef Nagy for drafting this report, as this is another step towards a single protection of minorities at EU level.

Mother tongue education is essential for the enforcement of language rights and Member States should therefore be encouraged to give regional and national minorities an adequate opportunity to learn their mother tongue and to learn their mother tongue at all levels of education in the regions in which they live. The right to education is the fundamental right of all people, and education in the mother tongue plays a key role in preserving identity and culture.

And that is exactly what Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union says. And if the European Union has taken on the so-called 'Copenhagen dilemma' to try to fill the mandate of commitment to the rule of law, democracy, respect for fundamental rights and judicial protection by an independent judiciary, it must also come to a structured and articulated mechanism for the protection of minorities in the European Union.

One of the key assets of the European Union is diversity: diversity of languages, cultures, traditions, religions and origins. After all, as has been said here, our motto is ‘united in diversity’. Besides, our Union rests on the values of human dignity, equality, the rule of law and human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities. Any discrimination against national minorities is explicitly prohibited under Article 21 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.  However, as noted in your report, the European Union and the Commission have no overall competence to rule on the protection of national minorities. These questions fall under the sole responsibility of the Member States, which have an obligation to guarantee minorities the full enjoyment of their human rights. In that respect, the Commission closely monitors the transposition of the relevant EU legal framework. This includes the Race Equality Directive, the Employment Equality Directive, the Framework Decision on combating racism and xenophobia by means of criminal law, the EU free movement acquis and the Audiovisual Media Services Directive. To extend the current anti-discrimination legislation, the Commission proposed, ten years ago already, the Horizontal Equality Directive.  I take this opportunity to call on all Member States to adopt this proposal, which will benefit many while disadvantaging nobody. We are also doing substantial work to tackle discrimination, racism and xenophobia. We have a High Level Group on Non-Discrimination, Equality and Diversity, a Group on Racism and Xenophobia and the National Roma Contact Points network. All this work brings together representatives from Member States to exchange good practices and put non-discrimination, hate speech and hate crime on their national agendas. The Commission is also promoting best practices regarding the democratic participation of underrepresented groups. This topic will be part of the discussion at the Annual Colloquium on Fundamental Rights, dedicated this year to democracy. Promoting minority languages is also an important driver for social and economic inclusion. The Commission has recently adopted a proposal for a Council recommendation on improving the teaching and learning of languages by taking the multitude of linguistic realities into account. We also have the Rights, Equality and Citizenship Programme, the Erasmus Programme and the Creative Europe programme. Besides, the Commission raises awareness on the importance of language learning through public events like the European Day of Languages or the national awards of the European Language Label for innovative learning projects.  Let me conclude by emphasising that the Commission strives – and will continue to do so under the next financial framework – to ensure that fundamental rights – and in particular the right to non-discrimination – are respected when EU law is implemented. Where we cannot propose legislation, we will use a soft law instrument, exchange of best practices and funding to help promote the rights of minorities.

Nevertheless, there are no common EU standards and definitions on minority rights in the Union. This is all the more important because persistent harassment, discrimination and violence deprive citizens of the full enjoyment of fundamental rights and freedoms and hinder their equal participation in society.  In recent years, we have seen far-right forces promote xenophobic violence and hate speech. There is an increase in hate crimes and an increase in racist, xenophobic or religiously motivated hate speech. Given that in an increasing number of Member States the far right is gaining in popularity, it can be assumed that discrimination against minorities is likely to increase.  The union's fundamental problem is that it does not have the instruments to enforce respect for the rights of minorities from the Member States. This area should therefore be the subject of constant monitoring and dialogue within Parliament, the Commission and the Council. It is a good idea to establish a body within the existing Commission structures responsible for the recognition and protection of minorities in the Union.

I welcome the Commission strategy on mainstreaming digitisation into EU development policy announced last year, and EU Commissioner Mariya Gabriel’s statement that Europe is dedicated to helping Africa build a single digital market. We managed to prepare in our committee a very comprehensive text addressing the main opportunities and challenges that digitisation brings to development cooperation and humanitarian action.  Nelson Mandela said that communication technologies have transformed the way people live and the manner in which countries develop. They have the potential to enable us to solve many of the critical problems confronting us. If this potential is to be realised then we must find ways of turning these technologies into a resource for all people, despite the challenges they face within their communities.  What does it mean? Digital technologies have huge potential in terms of reducing poverty, increasing the competitiveness of the economy and creating employment opportunities. Whereas digitisation is rapidly growing globally our partners from developing countries continue to lag behind, losing the opportunity to fully utilise their human capital towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. According to the 2016 World Development Report on Digital Dividends, six billion people lack access to high-speed internet and four billion still have no internet access at all. At a time when digitisation is growing fast, this lack of access is a major challenge to development as it continues to widen gaps and inequalities in the world. At the same time, a huge increase in mobile services is securing across the planet and the numbers of mobile users are now surpassing the numbers of people having access to electricity, sanitation or clean water. Digitisation can be a powerful development tool in a number of policy areas such as governance, education, health, gender equality, economic growth and agriculture. In order for it to be effective, bridging the digital divide has to be mainstreamed into every other policy area in accordance with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. In order to realise these goals, both developing countries and developed countries, as well as all actors – both public and private – need to maximise and join their efforts.  In the European Consensus on Development which is a crucial document on development policy of the EU and its Member States, we can find the bold statement that they will continue to support information and communication technologies in developing countries as powerful enablers of inclusive growth and sustainable development. Special attention has been given to supporting digital literacy and skills to empower people, especially women, and people in vulnerable and marginalised situations to promote social inclusion and to facilitate the participation in democratic governance and the digital economy.  We are all aware of the fact that in this area of developing cooperation, public funding will not be sufficient for a truly transformative digitalisation process. For this very reason, there is a need for public-private cooperation based on development principles.  The private sector needs to get involved and play a role through its expertise and innovation know-how. I am convinced that the substantial support from the EU, international actors and both public and private sectors, will allow us to step up the process of bridging the digital divide with a strong commitment to this process from the developing countries.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 151, "date": "2018-11-12.json", "name": "Michaela ŠOJDROVÁ", "mepid": "124710", "text": "   – Madam President, I would like to thank my colleague Bogdan Wenta very much for this report.

Poverty is one of the direct consequences of lack of information.

Digitalisation also means the development of public utility applications that can be used by local public administrations for the benefit of citizens.

Digitalisation is a key factor for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, and of course it provides cost-effective solutions to development needs by creating high—quality jobs and sustainable growth. It is also an effective instrument to address challenges such as social exclusion and inequality, cybersecurity, data protection and governance.  In May 2017, the Commission services put forward a new Digital4Development strategic approach, the so-called D4D, which outlines four priority areas for future EU interventions: access to open, affordable and secure broadband connectivity and digital infrastructure; digital literacy skills; digital for growth, entrepreneurship and job creation; and digital technologies as an enabler. The D4D approach has gained momentum. It is now reflected in the European Consensus on Development and in the Communication on a new Africa—Europe alliance for sustainable investment in jobs. More generally, under the current period, the Commission’s development policy has put a strong emphasis on digitalisation. Last year alone, over EUR 100 million were invested in projects covering mostly regional digital infrastructure. Besides, over EUR 200 million are being invested to support a new initiative in key thematic areas: energy, governance, education, health and agriculture.  We also have the European Union External Investment Plan adopted in September 2017, which can support digital solutions for local needs. Thanks to its financial arm – the European Fund for Sustainable Development – it helps secure private investment. So far, two projects have been selected for a total of EUR 175 million.  Lastly, the European Union, in collaboration with the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, is preparing the first Africa e—commerce week in December. The objective is to trigger policy harmonisation for an African single digital market and to engage with the local private sector. Now, looking towards the future, the Commission will continue in the context of the next Multiannual Financial Framework to support developments through ambitious digital policies, with a strong focus on youth. We will also prioritise digital education skills and technical and vocational training to ensure the labour offer matches market demand. We also wish to strengthen our political dialogue with partner countries and regional organisations – in particular the African Union – to promote good governance and an investment-friendly climate. We will also strengthen the actions of our EU delegations, notably by setting up a network of contact points on D4D. To conclude, in the light of our discussion, we can all agree that we have reached a pivotal moment. Together with the EU Member States, the European financial institutions, the private sector and civil society, we have the opportunity to truly influence the impact of digital transformation worldwide. In this endeavour, the Commission is confident that the European Parliament will keep momentum and remain a strong partner. Thank you for your attention.

Investing in digitalisation can be a powerful driver of growth in these countries, but it is essential that such investment reaches everyone, regardless of gender, geographical affiliation or economic status.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank the colleagues in the Committee on Development, and in particular the shadow rapporteurs. The work we have done together has allowed us to obtain a unanimous vote in committee, minus one abstention. I hope that this unity will be met tomorrow, because it will give strength to Parliament's position. All the more so since this unity was done not to the detriment, but to the service of strong, clear and precise positions.  The first aim of this report is to put education back at the heart of development policies.  Education is more than education. Quoted many times this evening, it is of course a goal in itself because it conditions progress in many areas: health, democracy, economic development, gender equality. Essential and demanding, in the case of a complex and long-term policy, education has been neglected. At the global level, as at the European Union level, aid fell between 2009 and 2015. It rose from 11% of the EU's total aid to 7.5%, and globally from 8.3% to 6.2%. This is completely at odds with the stated objectives. Of course, efforts have been made since 2016, they deserve to be praised. But they are not enough to catch up. They must therefore not only be pursued in the long term, but they must also be greatly amplified. To do this, we need to make financial commitments and spend 15% of our development assistance on education by 2030. Specific targets must be included in the next multi-year financial framework. At the same time, the Commission must now consider how to achieve development objective 4 and define a strategy to achieve it. It is to do so in a new communication, which will replace its last text of 2002, updated with a working paper in 2010. Education must therefore be made a priority for development policies. To be effective, clear priorities must be set. That is what the Development Committee has done. We make choices. We set two priorities. The first is to ensure free and quality basic education for all. I am talking about basic education, which has been hit hard by the credit cuts. Basic and inclusive education is the 12-year primary and secondary education cycle and must be free of charge. We must therefore support public education and not commercial private institutions that seek to take advantage of the education market, as they would in any other market. That's the first priority. The second is to strengthen our support for the least developed countries, not only because they are obviously the ones who need it most, but also because that is where aid is most effective. These two priorities are not the priorities we are pursuing today, so we need to rectify that. The EU and Member States must spend at least 50% of their aid on basic education by 2030 and at least 40% of their aid, still by 2030, to the least developed countries. So these are clear and specific objectives, priorities assumed. Finally, it must be more effective, it is not enough just to put more money, it is not just enough to meet clear priorities, it must be implemented effectively. We need reliable, accurate and independent assessment instruments.  Member States' assistance must be combined, coordinated with delegations or joint programming. We also want our partners to take ownership of these policies, and that is why we have chosen to focus on budget support. Finally, only one-third of aid for education comes from multilateral organizations, compared to two-thirds in the health sector. There is a need to strengthen the participation of multilateral organizations, and in particular the global partnership for education. We now have a concise and clear report, which sets out political priorities, methods to be preferred and numerical objectives. I hope that this text will be adopted tomorrow by the largest majority of Parliament, so that it can be useful to all those involved in education.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 159, "date": "2018-11-12.json", "name": "Stanislav POLČÁK", "mepid": "124704", "text": "   – Madam President, I would like to stress that reducing the resources spent on education is definitely a bad trend that needs to be reversed.

Without quality universities, particularly poorer regions will not be able to cope with the brain drain, as these brains will, of course, be seeded in places with better education. If we do not invest in tertiary education, European universities will not be attractive to the work of researchers, which may mean that Europe will no longer be able to compete with the very global players in the field of technological development.

We will, of course, take into account a number of recommendations put forward in this report. The right to quality education is a fundamental right for all. It constitutes an essential condition for the enjoyment of human rights and for the achievement of all the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Moreover, by investing in education, we fight poverty. Basic reading skills could take at least 170 million people out of global poverty.  The Commission agrees that education should remain at the core of our development cooperation, focusing on those most in need. The European Consensus on Development highlights the importance of education for promoting responsible citizenship, developing sustainable societies and boosting youth employment. Your report constitutes an opportunity to recall these objectives. It gives additional input and impetus to our common endeavour. As recently stated by the World Bank, the investments needed in human capital have become more important as the nature of work has evolved. The content of education programmes and the skills acquired by students have to be relevant to the needs of the current and future labour market.  In this context, the European Union will continue to support scholarships and exchange programmes between tertiary education institutions and build capacities and knowledge within universities through actions such as Erasmus+. As recently announced in our new Africa—Europe Alliance for Sustainable Investment and Jobs, by 2020 the European Union will have supported 35 000 African students and academics through the Erasmus Programme. By 2027, these figures should reach over 105 000.  In your report, you also underline the importance of gender equality and the inclusion of vulnerable children and of course, the Commission shares your view. These two elements must remain essential components of quality education, contributing to fulfilling the 2030 Agenda by leaving no one behind.  The Commission also welcomes your emphasis on education in times of emergencies and crisis. Ensuring continuing education for children and young people living in crisis situations is a pressing issue, particularly for girls. Already now, more than 60% of the European Union’s bilateral funding for education goes to countries affected by conflict and fragility. Furthermore, our humanitarian budget for education in emergencies has gone up from 1% in 2015 to 8% this year and 10% in 2019.  But of course we need further and more coordinated efforts, also with our international partners. For this reason, the Commission adopted its first ever policy framework on education in emergencies and crises in May 2018, a new major dimension of our actions. The Commission also welcomes the call in the report to involve all stakeholders in the dialogue at international and local level. Multilateral work is as important as bilateral country work. Currently the European Union supports 45 developing partner countries with bilateral education funding worth around EUR 3.4 billion. The European Union is also a major contributor to the Global Partnership for Education, which brings together all relevant actors to achieve the objective of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all.  Overall, the targets set out in your report are ambitious, but consistent with the international agenda and with the Commission approach. We very much look forward to continuing in the years to come our cooperation with Parliament in keeping quality and inclusive education high on the European Union’s development cooperation agenda.

Education is not only a fundamental right but is also the key to development, as it plays an essential role as a multiplier for development itself. It implies an increase in skills and opportunities for individuals, generating a critical spirit and economic independence. Perhaps we underestimate the fact that millions of children in the world do not have access to education due to conflict, forced displacement and violence, because the real risk is that a whole generation will remain in a perennial state of need and dependence.

This resolution demonstrates that many European colleagues did not understand that Romanians have the right to express their will in a referendum, whether the result of which we like it or not, and that Romanian citizens have exactly the same rights and privileges as any other European citizen.

Nothing is now different from this point of view. Romanian citizens are unqualified supporters of the European project, the Romanian government has shown openness to the European Parliament and to all European institutions and this must be appreciated. That is why I believe that the agenda of some politicians or political groups should not also build the agenda of the European Parliament. The discussions in Romania concern only internal political issues and, as such, cannot accept biased opinions, such as those of right-wing leaders. I call on my fellow MEPs to be fair to Romania in tomorrow's vote on a resolution that is an unjustified action and to treat it wisely, not in a political or electoral key.

I know those concerns will be shared by journalists, unions and federations across Europe and indeed across the world, and they have my solidarity.

Why? I dare say that the problem is not in the economic situation and not even in the refugee crisis, but in the rapid decline in the significance of Europe in the world. The population of Greater Europe at the beginning of the 20th century was one—third of the world population. Now the share has dropped to 12%, and by 2050 the Europeans will be only 7% of the world’s population. The share of the EU economy by 2050 will be reduced from the current 15% to 9% of the global economy. Visible changes have already occurred, but not only have they become visible to society, but the loss of significance of Europe leads to the loss of many past advantages, and people feel that. This is not a reason for fear and panic, but a reason for honest re—thinking. Then there will be less surprises and more useful solutions for our citizens.
