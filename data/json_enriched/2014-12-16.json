The Commission has already had an opportunity to discuss this topic with the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON) on 2 December. I am looking forward to discussing this important topic further with you today and in the period to come. Let me start by recalling that the economic and financial crisis revealed important weaknesses in the original economic and monetary union set-up. In response, Europe has taken action on a number of fronts. Action has been truly impressive, especially compared with what was considered feasible just a few years ago. The euro area has been significantly bolstered by the setting up of a strong permanent firewall in the form of the European Stability Mechanism to ensure financial stability. We have created a banking union to address the fragmentation of the financial sector and to facilitate access to financing. Finally, we have strengthened our economic governance in order to reinforce economic and budgetary coordination.  The six-pack and the two-pack are the core elements that have led to the strengthening of economic governance. They have led to a strengthening of budgetary surveillance under the Stability and Growth Pack, the broadening of the scope of surveillance to include the area of macroeconomic imbalances as well as countries experiencing difficulties with financial stability, and to the codification in legislation of integrated economic and budgetary surveillance in the form of the European Semester.  In line with the legal requirements in the various pieces of legislation, the Commission has concluded a review of these new instruments. Broadly speaking, the review clauses require us to assess three elements of the six-pack and two-pack. First of all we have to assess the effectiveness of the regulations; this means to what extent the new rules have been effective in achieving their objectives. Secondly, we need to evaluate the impact of the rules on enhancing closer coordination of economic policies, and finally how the rules on the new economic governance have contributed to sustained economic governance in the European Union.  Due to the limited time span since its entry into force, experience with the application of the new governance system has been limited and a number of specific instruments remain untested. This concerns more specifically the excessive imbalances procedure. Furthermore, the system has so far been applied in specific economic conditions during and in the aftermath of the severe crisis. This limits the possibilities for judging the effectiveness of the systemʼs preventive role.  For these reasons the review the Commission published in November is short and factual and takes stock of the application of the new instruments since they have been in force; that is, autumn 2011 for the six-pack, and 2013 for the two-pack. It discusses separately the issues of fiscal surveillance, macroeconomic imbalances and the framework for countries experiencing difficulties as regards financial stability. It also briefly discusses the interlinkages between the various elements.  The review also highlights some improvements introduced by the six-pack and two-pack reform. Notably it has deepened and widened economic governance and has contributed to achieving progress as regards fiscal consolidation and correcting macroeconomic imbalances.  Finally, the Commission’s review identifies some possible areas for improvement. This relates mainly to the complexity of the system with regard to overlapping instruments, as well as to the complexity of some of the specific instruments themselves, for instance in the Stability and Growth Pack. Complexity could pose challenges for transparency and implementation.  The Commission’s assessment also points to the need for increased ownership of the necessary reforms in the Member States, which could help step up implementation of the reform recommendations under the European Semester. This would improve outcomes in terms of growth, imbalances and convergence.  Finally, the review highlights the need for better involvement of national parliaments and stakeholders to ensure better legitimacy and accountability. Our system of economic governance can only reap its full potential if it has ownership of all relevant stakeholders. This includes notably this Parliament as the key institution to ensure the democratic legitimacy and accountability of EU-level economic policy decisions.  The Commission therefore sees the review document as a starting point and a basis for dialogue and debate on the appropriate way forward in the coming months.

We support the Commission in taking a positive view of the existing legislation on the six-pack and the two-pack. We are seeing a trend that budget deficits are slowly recovering in most Member States of the European Union. We also support the Commission in regularly calling for far-reaching structural reforms from the Member States. We also believe, of course, that economic policy reforms are the right way forward. We support the Commission in saying that the Stability and Growth Pact in its current form is sustainable and future-to-be. This also means that the Commission should not hesitate to apply existing rules. The Stability and Growth Pact is the starting point for a successful, competitive and promising European economy. Anyone who advocates fundamentally weakening the Pact denies the mistakes of the past. The times of debt-making and fine-moneymaking have not brought success in the medium or long term – on the contrary. We have seen a spiral of a debt and financial market crisis. It is humbug to say that compliance with the Stability Pact prevents investment and growth in the Member States. The Stability Pact is not a growth hurdle. The Stability Pact reminds Member States of their obligations to use their budget funds in a sustainable, efficient and forward-looking manner. These are sometimes certainly unpleasant truths. Nor can a positive investment climate be induced unless reforms are tackled at the same time. Any examination of flexibility must be addressed under this premise. The credibility of the Stability and Growth Pact must not be jeopardised. There must be no distinction between large and small Member States. We therefore expect the Commission to act in the interests of the stability of Europe.

In the previous Parliament, we made an unprecedented step forward in banking, laying the groundwork for the banking union. Basically, the opportunity we now have, in this Commission of the last chance, is that of putting in place measures that will not only overcome the financial crisis, but also avoid a crisis of the political Union. For this reason, the work we are opening here is of major importance. However, you present the six-pack and two-pack balance sheet in a short and factual way, without taking into account the state of under-inflation and serious social crisis, or the under-growth of the euro area and the Union as a whole. It seems to me, however, that if the legislators have given us an appointment, it is not simply to hear this summary. I must admit that you published a document that, on the same day, It seems to me that there are more forward-looking ideas, with the annual growth review, which recognises the seriousness of the situation, and in particular of this social crisis, which focuses on both supply and demand, which acknowledges the existence of a lack of investment and the risk of stalling in several sectors and which invites Member States with budgetary room to use them. Finally, with regard to the multilateral dimension of the European semester, you underline the need to put the economies of the Member States into perspective. Unfortunately, in a way, I have the impression that this mindset is not reflected in your assessment of the six-pack and the two-pack. You are telling us that they have not been tested in normal times. This is obvious, since these rules had been adopted in an exceptional context, to deal with an exceptional situation. However, the result is clearly not there. We must ensure that the debate that begins remains multidimensional. When the Heads of State and Government confirmed this end-of-year meeting last June to evaluate the six-pack and the two-pack, they also gave you a mandate to define the flexibility margins of economic governance. We are waiting for you on this point. We hope that the document you put on the table will not define new rules, but will move from a logic of strict rule to a real steering of economic policy. It is not the same thing.  I hear that some people are very attached to the rules. So are we. But we know their limit, since they cannot be applied, that they infringe on the sovereignty of the Member States and promote anti-European sentiment, that they are too complicated to allow this appropriation which you have mentioned. We expect you on this interpretation, on this possibility of flexibility and, above all, we know that the roadmap is once again open for this famous report of the four presidents, in which the European Parliament wants to play its full role. Because everyone is telling us that if we do not move forward together on economic governance, Europe will be offended. The Europe of last chance is where it must be done, despite a certain paralysis and the impression, at times, that the debate between the Member States is now limited to exchanges of bird names. We believe that we need to get back to work, to start talking to each other normally, to understand each other and that, in this situation, you are waiting for the good ideas of Parliament and the goodwill of the Council.

Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to thank the commissioner for her work and for the work she has I very much welcome the fact that we have this debate today. It is a debate on the two- and the six-pack, but in a more general sense it is also a debate on the success of economic governance in the European Union. If you look at it from this broader perspective, it is clear that this debate is a debate about the failure of this kind of governance. Because in the beginning there were rules that were clear, simple and transparent. It was the rule that there should be no more than 60% of debt, that there should be no more than 3% of new debt, and that there is a principle of non-assistance, that each state should be liable for its own debts and that no state should stand up for the debts of another state. These rules did not last. They were softened in 2005 in the reform of the Stability and Growth Pact and replaced by more complex rules, by less transparent concepts such as a structural deficit, the precise definition of which, I believe, few Members are able to reproduce. This structural deficit should now have been reduced by at least 0.5 percentage points from year to year, even by up to 0.8 percentage points for states that are in an excessive deficit procedure. But we haven't seen anything like it. The reduction in the structural deficit has taken place in small and smallest units, far from the target of 0.5 percentage points per year. Then, in 2010, the non-assistance clause, the crucial building block of the Stability and Growth Pact, was also broken. Instead, the ESM was created. In the form of the EFSF and the ESM, shadow budgets have been created at EU level, where new debt has been built up that is not attributed to individual states. The two-pack has been introduced, the six-pack has been introduced, the European Semester has been introduced, a very complex set of scoreboard indicators has been introduced, so that you can now justify any form of fiscal policy on the basis of any indicator, so that the rules are degenerated into complete arbitrariness. Ladies and gentlemen, that is the wrong way to go! It will make everything more opaque, complex and arbitrary, opening up opportunities for states to continue to operate irresponsibly, as we see at the moment, particularly in France. We must return to the one and crucial regulation, that is the principle of non-assistance. If we return to the principle of non-assistance, then each state will have its sovereignty, its fiscal and economic policy decisions to take as it can itself take responsibility for, given that it and only it will have to pay its debts. Then you do not need economic governance, then you do not need to make any recommendations. Then we can simply focus on reminding the states that debts that these states make must be paid by these states and the taxpayers of those states, and by no one else. This is enough as an incentive to return to reason and responsibility within the eurozone.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 5, "date": "2014-12-16.json", "name": "Cora van NIEUWENHUIZEN", "mepid": "125019", "text": "  on behalf of the ALDE Group. Mr President, today we are discussing the evaluation of the so-called six- and two-packs. These are the two measures put in place in recent years to extend and strengthen the Stability and Growth Pact. The Commission's evaluation of this is full of fine analyses, but it avoids the main point of discussion, namely whether and how much flexibility can be applied in maintaining budgetary rules. The Commission has indicated that it will take a position on this in January. Today, therefore, I can only rely on the omens of the past few weeks. And those omens are anything but favorable.  President Juncker himself said in a French newspaper last week that this Commission sees the enforcement of budgetary rules as a political decision. The additional delay that France received last month in order to get its budget in order makes it clear once again where that institution can lead. The French postponement goes against the agreements that were laid down less than two years ago, less than a year ago, in the two packages we are debating today, the six-pack and the two-pack. In its own evaluation of these packages, the Commission states that additional delays are only allowed if a country has made good progress on reforms but is facing an unexpected economic setback. However, in its assessment of the French budget for 2015 at the end of last month, the Commission made it clear that France has done far too little to get its budget and economy in order and reform. This delay was therefore not based on the budgetary arrangements we have made with each other in the euro area, as the Commission itself points out. The decision to postpone smacks of political clapping.  The first ten years of the euro have shown what happens when the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact become a political plaything. What is needed in the budgetary rules is not 'more political' and not 'more discretion' and not 'more flexibility'. Instead, the new investment plan should be seized upon as a stick behind the door to strengthen the rules. Only those countries that adhere to the Stability and Growth Pact, and only those countries that have implemented a majority of the country-specific recommendations should have access to the investment money of that plan. In this way, countries will not only be penalized if they do not comply with the rules, but also a reward in the form of additional investments if they do comply with the agreements. This is fair, efficient and clear, and we are strengthening budgetary rules, the European economy and confidence in the European Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "nl", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 6, "date": "2014-12-16.json", "name": "Marisa MATIAS", "mepid": "96820", "text": "  gue/NGL Group. – Madam President, Commissioner, any assessment of the economic governance programme would have to start with one very simple and serious thing: it was to say that it failed. It failed because the new rules were not effective, because the impact on economic policies was more unemployment, it was less growth, it was more macroeconomic imbalances, and because there was no economic consolidation of the euro area.  Therefore, the Commission's economic governance proposal was a failure. It's garbage. It's garbage and it's toxic waste. What you should do and the Commission was to start over, start from scratch. And I will tell you, Commissioner, what the objectives of the economic governance programme of these two specifically were: to control debt. Is it more controlled? No! Increased. Control the deficit. Is it more controlled? No! That control also failed. Consolidate the European economy. Failed! There are more imbalances. Reduce spending. The only way to reduce spending was to destroy what remains of the welfare state. So it failed. Have more stability. Failed. Have more growth. Failed. A budget treaty that is a total failure, because it is permanent austerity.  Now the Commission is talking about flexibility, of allowing Member States to deduct in the deficit calculation the investment they can make. We always stand for it. You've always refused. And now they are presenting, now that our accounts are destroyed, now that the member states on the periphery do not have a cent to invest, because all the cents go to the interest on the debt, now you come with flexibility. Flexibility for who? Commissioner, any assessment has to be serious, and to be serious, it has to take into account the results, not blind goals.

Frankly, we cannot share that view at all. It is of the utmost urgency that the Commission shifts the narrow current focus on a mechanical reduction of structural deficits towards a different perspective. Today, putting debt levels – both private and public – on a sustainable track by making massive budget cuts to basic welfare systems across Europe has dramatic social consequences and is damaging the European recovery. The current policy response has actually increased debt levels instead of reducing them. We see therefore the current framework as a self-defeating framework. Not only are the rules not serving its purpose but they are also bringing Europe towards its third recession. We are in urgent need of a genuine counter-cyclical approach. We have already shown how the rules cannot even be effectively implemented as they are designed. The discretionary flexibilities have now become the rule instead of the exception, as these ends are being systematically and inefficiently used after the social and economic damage has already been done.  It is also massively short-sighted of the Commission to claim there is no need to review the Macroeconomic Imbalances Procedure. The current procedure puts most of the burden on the deficit countries. We need to provide a more systematic approach. The Greens, therefore, are disappointed that the Commission considers the current economic governance framework a success and feels that there is currently no need for a revision. We believe that in order to achieve a genuine counter-cyclical approach, we need a legislative proposal that could codify, in a revised six-pack, a qualified treatment for investments generating large societal and environmental benefits. We also believe that there should be a particular treatment of the debt incurred for recapitalising the banking sector. Commissioner, the average debt in the euro area is 90% of GDP. However, around one-third of that debt finds its origin in support measures provided by Member States to the banking sector since 2008. This debt is unfair and unsustainable, and its treatment should be urgently revised. We also see a need for codifying in the legislation some key concepts, such as the conserved structural balance, which at the moment is totally discretionary. There are no clear rules about it. In Spain, for instance, the potential output – as estimated by the Commission – implies an unemployment rate of around 20%. We do not think such a rate reflects the potential of the economy. We would therefore advocate a more complete definition of the concept reflecting a wider theoretical background. We are also in favour of completing the scoreboard for macroeconomic imbalances by adding social indicators. In his hearing, Commissioner Moscovici committed himself to including those social indicators, so I would really like to see that implemented. On the application of the rules, I have to say that in recent days the Commission asked Spain, for instance, to further reduce its deficit by making additional cuts of EUR 4 billion. The country suffers from massive unemployment. Half of the unemployed do not receive any kind of support. Can the EU continue ignoring that reality when revising national budgets using its current rules? This is socially blind and economically suicidal. That is why, dear Commissioner, we, the Greens, believe that the legal revision is urgently needed in order to exit the current stagnation.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 8, "date": "2014-12-16.json", "name": "Steven WOOLFE", "mepid": "124966", "text": "  on behalf of the EFDD Group. – Madam President, I wholly expected Mr Dombrovskisʼ speech to present a glorifying story of how the six-pack and the two-pack have helped lift Europe out of depression and Mr Dombrovskis, once again you did not fail to deliver. After all it is Christmas – Members of this House – and it is Christmas when parents tell all their children lots of fairy tales about what good there is in the world when we know there is bad outside, and in this Chamber once again you told us lots of fairy tales. Because, as you have heard from Members around this House, the main point of the six-pack is control. Control of government budgets; control of the decision-makers on spending; control of the peoples of Europe and their democratic, elected governments. Debt up, stability down, no growth, only poverty throughout Europe, and at Christmas that control, and the story of Christmas, should show you why Europe is going wrong. Because millions of Europeans will be celebrating Christmas by telling their children that Father Christmas will be delivering presents for them – and at Christmas, if the EU had control of Father Christmas, the story would be totally different.  First of all Father Christmas would not be allowed to drive more than 4.5 hours without having a 45-minute break under EU directives. It may well be that even Rudolph would have to be fitted with a tacograph; certainly under EU directives he would have to have a stamp of the EU flag on the backside. Under various animal directives it would be certain that he could not even use the reindeer and if there was not a directive, there would be calls from the Members of this Chamber for an intergroup to be set up on the protection and prevention of abuse of Santa’s reindeers.

The French patriots make the same observation as you and condemn the abysmal debt, the consequence of the privatization of public money by the world capital markets. This chronic over-indebtedness makes citizens future debt slaves. Tomorrow, our foreign creditors will demand even more social austerity, more privatization, fewer public services and less sovereignty, at the expense of domestic demand. See the economic and social tragedy you have caused in Greece and Cyprus with your structural reforms! Yes, each Member State, in order to remain free, must indeed reduce its deficits and its public debt, but economic efforts must focus on bad spending: the exorbitant cost of mass immigration, the cost of the permanent rescue of the euro - 17 billion euros a year for the past four years in France - the cost of social fraud, etc. Sovereign states need national instruments - control of borders, their currencies, their budgets, banks, national priority, etc. to return to balance in public accounts without austerity. Everything that your federalist Europe has confiscated precisely. It is by abandoning your imaginary world and thanks to our patriotic economic model that the Europe of nations will return to sound public finances, jobs and economic growth. The United Kingdom does not need the six-pack, nor the two-pack, to have a lower level of debt than France and above all economic growth of more than 3% this year.

He has already been criticised for the fact that the document we are talking about is short and factual. I would like to congratulate him on that, because I think his analysis is abundantly clear: either 'the rules of the six and two-pack have worked', or 'we have not had enough time to assess them in practice'. Then I say, 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it'. We drew up these regulations in the previous period when the euro was hanging above the precipice. I think this European Parliament should be proud that we had the courage to take these steps. Because if we had had the macroeconomic imbalances from the beginning, for example the procedure for macroeconomic imbalances – that is, by the way, about imbalances in Member States, let us be clear about this – we might have avoided the dramatic situations that we have seen in a number of Member States. But what I think is really the most important thing is that we can talk to each other at the moment about a text. That text is clear, but let us also take a look at the practice. The British say so beautifully – perhaps I should not quote the British in this debate, but the proverb is magnificent – 'the proof of the pudding is in the eating'. We can talk to each other about a text, but at the same time the rules we are discussing here are already stretched in practice, then we are already working to get the foundation under that healthy euro. So the EPP will also judge this Commission on whether it maintains the agreements that I believe we have made in the previous period with regard to a number of Member States. I won't name names, but we all know which country is the elephant in this meeting room. The proof of the pudding is in the eating. Not only talk about texts, but also shows in practice that you support them. We will assess the Commission on that.

It has been six years since the crisis began, and the European Union is now contrasting with the other international blocs. The European economy is stagnant, in some areas it is in deflation, there are 25 million unemployed, there is unbearable public debt and internal imbalances are enormous. Politically, we're on the verge of collapse.  The anti-crisis engine predicted in the single currency was monetary policy, but it is exhausted. Interest rates are close to zero, and yet the economy does not react. And in this frightening situation, the European Commission, when it thinks about the economy for 2015, proposes a neutral, non-expansionist fiscal policy, only slows austerity.  In the face of this, I ask: in an area that no longer has exchange rate policy, monetary policy has been neutralized by the crisis, what would have more to happen for the Commission to propose a countercyclical fiscal policy? Jean-Claude Juncker's investment plan is clearly welcome, but unfortunately there is no artificial stimulus to compensate for the lack of economic activity. At the moment, looking at the six-pack, we see that what is provided for in the law is that the adjustment process can deviate from the trajectory in three circumstances: if there is a severe slowdown in the economy, if there is an external shock that does not depend on the will of the Member States, and if structural reforms are implemented to strengthen competitiveness. But real structural reforms, not short-term cuts. And I ask: has this been what the European Commission has applied? No. All adjustments to the timing of the adjustment of public accounts have been presented with a political concession. It's not a political concession, it's in the text of the law, and that's what we have to focus on, and that's what we have to change the agenda about. Because without economy and without a job, there are no balanced public accounts.

For example, we are now seeing it in Belgium, where, for the first time in 25 years, the government is trying to put that budget in order with new recipes, a government that is cleaning up the budget and not raising taxes for that purpose. It is even more difficult to implement structural reforms, but they are still necessary if we are to grow our economy and we want to help people get jobs again. There is no confidence in the future. There's a lot of opposition. You have all noticed this also from the many strikes that are currently taking place in Belgium. Trust is the key word here. Without trust, no social peace. Without trust no investments. Without trust no growth and no jobs. But that trust will only come when we keep course, when we implement what is agreed, effectively. A $300 billion investment plan may sound like a nice one, but we might as well throw that money away if we don't reform at the same time and eliminate the deficits. That is why I fear that the European Commission is too positive in its evaluation of the two-pack and the six-pack. Yes, deficits have fallen, but at the same time – as Mr Lucke also pointed out – the euro area debt ratio has increased and new debt is undermining that confidence that is so desperately needed.

On average, the indebtedness of the member states was too high even before the introduction of the euro. Even before the economic and financial crisis, it was too high. It is still too high now. It is therefore strange that some Members of this House are demanding more debt in order to combat excessive old debts. This cannot be the right way to go, but we must get out of the debt trap, and that can only be done through structural reforms. Anyone who introduces a common currency also needs institutions to assert the Community interest. This is exactly what two-pack and six-pack have done to tighten up the Stability and Growth Pact, which, incidentally, was first broken by Gerhard Schroeder and the red-green federal government in Germany and by the French government. Those who do not abstheise the rules undermine the stability of a common currency. The crucial moment is that we enforce the rules and here, Commissioner Dombrovskis, we have hopes for you. In Latvia, they have shown how structural reforms can put a country back on a growth path. Moreover, the countries of Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain have also made great efforts, and the population has tightened its belt. Meanwhile, a light can be seen at the end of the tunnel. Countries have returned to a growth trajectory. The crucial question now is: what are the countries of Italy and France doing? Here, the Commission must ensure that the rules also apply to the large countries and not just to the small ones, that they are applied together, and we want to insist on this.

You have presented a review of the rules that we have reformed here. It was a very controversial legislative package at the time.  Your review paints the situation in pastel. In fact, the rules that we have adopted here are not such that you would dare to apply them in a really consistent manner and even to establish transparency as to whether these rules are currently being applied. If we look at whether the structural deficits of the euro countries have really fallen as agreed at European level, we have to note that out of 18 countries, 14 have not been able to fulfil their remedial measures, which were actually agreed. But now some colleagues are presenting – as if this problem does not exist at all – that the rules must only be applied harshly. If they did, they would lead Europe into recession. That is why it is right that you have given a little more space. At the same time, however, you cannot stand up and say that the rules are all fine.  Secondly, there are colleagues who say that we need to return these more complex rules to simple, simple rules, which are then simple and harsh. But they are pro-cyclical. That is why the answer to the problems of implementing the tightened Stability and Growth Pact rules is a common economic policy in the euro area, in other words an end to tax competition, and also a very clear common fiscal policy, where the states that are stronger economically invest more so that others have more room to rehabilitate their budgets.

It is a matter of credibility: the credibility of the Union and in particular the governance of the euro area, which has set even more ambitious objectives in this area, with the budgetary pact, and the credibility, Mr Vice-President, of the new Commission. Following my epp colleagues, and in particular Mr TheUrer, I would like to warn here that the rules must apply equally in all Member States, regardless of their size. I would remind you that the need for new legislation - six-pack and two-pack - was to be adopted because the original rules - the Stability and Growth Pact - were not implemented. In 2003, it turned out that the two largest economic powers in the Union - Germany and France - have, at the same time, come out of the way. They asked - and obtained without great difficulty - flexibility and interpretation of the rules that emptied them of their content. The conclusion reached is that the Union could not function on the basis of an unspoken principle which, for States, is not too big to fail but somehow too big to be blamed - too big to be punished. If we do it again today, if the Commission is inflexible in the face of Greece and Portugal, but trembles with the countries we say are bigger than Spain, then the whole system will collapse. In the end, we will inexorably fall back into the situation we wanted to avoid at all costs, the situation in which financial operators and rating agencies decide the fate of our economies instead of politicians.

The Commission has recognised the situation in the recent Annual Growth Survey, but now the Commission should address these problems by adjusting this economic governance framework. I believe that the first adjustment is to create more room for manoeuvre for investments in the Stability and Growth Pact and, first of all, to make sure that Member States’ contributions to these new funds for strategic investment are neutralised with regard to the Stability and Growth Pact. Secondly, we need to have a more balanced macroeconomic surveillance looking not only at the economic problems but at the social problems.

In my view it is profoundly undemocratic for the Commission to tell Member States what they should tax and what they should spend. But that is the consequence of entering into a single currency. And it is increasingly clear that the euro single currency is not working for the very diverse economies within its borders. As a result, millions of young people across the EU are not working either. Youth unemployment is 40 % in Italy, 55 % in Spain, 58 % in Greece. That is a tragedy for millions of families. The Stability and Growth Pact is right to control spending and borrowing in euro area countries, but it needs to be accompanied by an appropriate monetary policy and this is impossible for the ECB to achieve. Whatever the Commission might say about economic governance it does not acknowledge the fundamental flaw that exists in the construction of the euro. A single interest rate is never going to be appropriate for all members of the euro area. And I would say to Mr Dombrovskis, if you want the euro area to flourish you and the Commission are going to have to bring up the subject of fiscal transfers, because you cannot have a situation where you fix the interest rate, you fix the rate of exchange for all the euro area members, and you then tell governments in Greece and Italy what they can spend and tax, without transferring money from rich euro area members to poorer ones – and that is something you are too afraid to address.

Should we also include debt from public enterprises? I think we should, and this will be one of the main ideas in our future debates.  Talking about the revision of economic governance in Europe, we have also to consider regional and local governments with fiscal and legislative powers. The deficit targets for those administrations have to be proportional to their share of government spending. Only in this way will we ensure that there is no discrimination between different levels of government. This is especially important in countries where most social spending is done at regional level but tax-collection powers are still monopolised by the central government.

We believe that this common currency should be kept and the question is therefore: are the instruments we have today to ensure the cohesion of economic and monetary union appropriate and are they being used correctly? In terms of the nature of the instruments we have, it is clear that when we have a pay budget discipline and a revenue competition, the only adjustment variable is spending. Having maintained budgetary discipline, as defined today, without tax harmonisation will lead us to a perpetual reduction of the role of public authorities in society. We do not think this is a good thing, so fiscal discipline must be complemented by fiscal convergence and, also, by setting binding social and environmental targets. When you are required, as a government, to balance your budgets but also to reduce poverty and your ecological footprint, this leads you to make budgetary adjustments of a nature other than those we are seeing today. Triple discipline, therefore: social, environmental and budgetary. Finally, the semester is widely used today to encourage structural reforms aimed at reducing, on the one hand, the role of the state, I have mentioned, and, on the other hand, the direct and indirect costs of labour, by putting workers in competition with each other. We believe that the semester should instead be used as an instrument of cooperation between Member States to enable convergence towards the highest level of our social, environmental and democratic standards.

The euro area is still in crisis: Europe has seven million more unemployed, a third more than at the beginning of the crisis, the debts of the states have not been reduced, the investment deficit is estimated at 300 billion euros per year and deflation is lurking in the Union. But, above all, the gap between the Member States is widening, which is a paradox of the rules of convergence, which actually lead to divergence.

But it is now essential to radically reform European governance tools, to prioritise investment, to integrate social criteria, particularly that of employment, and to move towards fiscal convergence.

First of all, I wanted to say at the outset that I believe that a system of fiscal discipline is absolutely necessary within a monetary union in which countries retain their fiscal powers and, at the same time, there is no system of fiscal transfers. We must therefore develop a system of discipline based on transparent rules. I would like to remind you that the crisis in Europe occurred not because the euro was introduced, but because some countries or some banking systems in some countries were simply indebted beyond measure. On the other hand, there was no obligation to be indebted anywhere. At the same time, I would like to say that three years of experience with the six-pack and the two-pack show that some adaptation of these instruments is necessary. Firstly, I would like to draw attention to the fact that this is a system that is too complex and complex – not for experts, but for the public. This type of system opens the door to different interpretations; i will give an example of endless discussions about the degree of flexibility within the fiscal rules. The system must therefore be simplified to make it more understandable to ordinary people as well.  Secondly, the system is too much based on policy decisions. This concerns not only the political mechanism for introducing the excessive deficit procedure, but also the discussion of whether to extend the deadlines for the submission of relevant documents for certain countries, i.e. the largest countries. I believe that if we have legal rules, they should not then be the subject of a political vote.  Thirdly, I would also like to stress that the most important thing is national ownership - national ownership. We must not allow politicians to point to Brussels all the time and say: it is Brussels that is forcing us to impose some kind of fiscal discipline. No, fiscal discipline must be enshrined in national law, in a consistent manner for the entire European Union, and then politicians will have a duty to implement national laws and regulations.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 50, "date": "2014-12-16.json", "name": "Patrizia TOIA", "mepid": "28340", "text": "   Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, if the provisions of the two pack and six pack were designed to contain debt and promote growth and if the situation is so bad in all respects today, I ask you, what has yet to happen to understand that something is wrong?

Flexibility is not the opposite of credibility, as some authoritative people have said in recent days.

If it is only automatic and accounting, then let us govern ourselves from a computer not from a Political Commission.

This inaccuracy further undermines the credibility of the euro area administration. 2) There are still countries in the euro area and in the currency union that do not actually fit into it.

Several speakers stressed the complexity and failure of this system, which needs to be reformed or, better, abolished.

Of course, we have heard Mr Juncker's statements that these provisions can be applied flexibly, with the aim - I think - of calming the protests of parliaments and, even more, of the peoples of Europe. Because the results are known: it is the destruction of pension schemes, the all-out social regression and the destruction of the productive apparatus.

However, it was not until the financial crisis of the first half of 2012 that Europe assumed that its economic problems were even more serious and that it essentially needed to have a common economic policy, a project from which the banking union emerged.

We cannot analyse each country's fiscal policy by studying only the effect of its budgets on that Member State. We need Europe to internalize the effects of fiscal policy across the Union, not just in each of the countries. We must therefore review these fiscal rules and the whole coordination of the Union's economic policy in order to take account of this comprehensive approach to national economic policies. And we also need to reform the Stability and Growth Pact, not only to give the system more flexibility but, essentially, to incorporate this European analysis, in order to incorporate this comprehensive approach to the effects of each country's budgetary policies on the Union as a whole.

First of all, the road to undermined social security, increased unemployment, lost competitiveness as well as social unrest goes via spending money you do not have.

It is not consolidated budget policies that have caused the problems. The cause of the problems is the belief that you can solve economic problems by increased deficits and increased debt burdens. That is false, but that is exactly what we have seen. Secondly, there is the review of the Stability Pacts. It might be good to do this, but even better would be to do a real review in those cases where the Commission is dealing with deficit countries which have postponed their structural efforts and are not living up to the rules. Credibility is about being credible. The European Union must be credible; the Commission must be credible; the Stability Pact must be credible.

Inflation is too low for debt-burdened households, unemployment is too high, growth is low and confidence is shaky.

The bad weather for the European economy is not taken into account, let alone whether the budgetary rules fit into these bad weather conditions. And then one specific point. In the budgetary framework, the structural deficit is a very important concept. It is in theory a great concept and in practice a lousy size. It's like flying with a broken altimeter. Research shows that different institutions, the IMF, the OECD and the European Commission, give a different estimate of the structural deficit and in the course of the year the estimate can change considerably.

I was surprised to hear that many people said that the rules have failed. I guess what we can see failed for sure were the pre-crisis economic policies of many states, the policies that were generating higher deficit, the policies that increased debt-to-GDP ratios, were increasing expected expenditure and were calling for credibility and tolerance for bad economic policies.

There are concrete successes: Ireland has come out of the memorandum, Portugal has come out of the memorandum, Latvia and Lithuania have done a good job and taken the ticket to the euro, Cyprus is generally doing well, as far as I am told; unfortunately my country, Greece, is still trying but has not succeeded. But I will tell you that Greece's problems, because I was 35 years a journalist and publisher, I was watching them both before the euro and before the 'two pack-six pack' and before the stabilisation mechanisms, and I will tell you that in general they were the same; i.e. we were giving large pensions, we had an excessively rich welfare state that could not be financed by the private sector of the economy and I will tell our friends the British anti-Europeans and Eurosceptics, who say that in Greece we have huge problems because of the euro, that we used to give pensions to Greece that were 100 or even 120% of the last salary, while in the UK pensions – because I had read about them – were in the order of 35 to 40% of the last salary.

My first comment is that I believe the very nature of economic governance forces us to look beyond this six-pack and two-pack into areas such as, for example, the banking union; even if it is not an element of economic governance we all know that it can bring stability to the system and also influence the capacity of the EMU to deliver. So when identifying the areas for improvement within economic governance, I think we have to have this broader perspective.  My second comment is on rules versus procedures, and my colleague Mr Niedermayer alluded to this issue. I think that the economic governance framework has indeed put many rules in place but their success hinges on the right policy choices. We also know that citizens, when looking at the outcome of economic governance, do not differentiate between the policy choices – mostly made nationally – and the rules on which the system is based. This can of course raise doubts about the viability of the system as well as its democratic credentials. So I think that while respecting the rules, we also have to have better tailor-made policy choices and also we have to carefully assess and hopefully fill in the legitimacy gap.  The third point is on growth. I think, in particular today, that any economic governance needs to have a strong growth perspective, and structural reforms are of the essence here; and yet the governance framework does not provide for a mechanism to foster those reforms. Contractual arrangements which were proposed by the four presidents two years ago had until recently disappeared from the radar. The Eurogroup conclusions from December seemed to reopen this issue, so I hope that we will also have a strong commitment as a catalyst for structural reforms. I also hope that the Commission will push in this direction and will play a leading role in this issue.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 81, "date": "2014-12-16.json", "name": "Hugues BAYET", "mepid": "125002", "text": "   Mr President, Commissioner, when it is necessary to assess and revise measures with such serious macroeconomic consequences, the scope of the assessment must of course be broad enough to allow for a coherent analysis. Now, for the six-pack and the two-pack, what assessment do we have? From a technical communication from the Commission, which addresses the evolution of public deficits, one point is all. Little or nothing about assessing the impact on economic growth. Nothing about the evolution of unemployment. Nothing about the evolution of social rights. And nothing about poverty assessment. However, for the daily lives of the vast majority of Europeans, the evaluation of the two-pack and the six-pack is clearly quite different: it is budgetary austerity, it is a frontal attack on social rights, a significant increase in poverty and the questioning of fundamental rights such as universal access to health care. The evaluation must therefore be followed by the determined and socially just reaction. Europe, while controlling its public deficits, must once again become a lever for social progress and hope. In this regard, we could create a new social eight-pack, which should above all include a policy of assumed public investment, where the private sector does not take its responsibilities - the latest FIGUREs from the ECB have shown - but also, obviously, an effective and coordinated taxation of large capital and corporate profits. A major employment effort, the introduction of a European minimum wage and an effective fight against social and environmental dumping would be other foundations. Austerity, as is now evident, has not worked. The social setback was planned but it is, unfortunately, cruelly at the rendezvous. Economic failure, on the other hand, ends up discrediting the strategy - if we can call it that - of blind austerity. A comprehensive assessment would have the merit of producing obvious conclusions.

We must achieve clear objectives, otherwise we will not follow the mandate that the citizens have given us.

This message was shared, in words, with statements by all the groups with only two or three against. This means combining economic growth with stability.  But in a time of crisis, growth comes first, otherwise it will not come out. Without growth we continue to have stability and it becomes almost like a noose around the neck. And if for growth we have to use more debt – only, and I really say, alone and as an Italian I can understand its concerns – for investments, why not do so? I am convinced that investment is the springboard for real growth and that would really create jobs. I fully support Juncker's plan for fiscal union. In Italy it would really solve many problems given the taxation that we have. You see, some Italians are here in Strasbourg complaining about the European Stability Pact.

The Commission communication is a small step but we need to go further. As an ultimate proof of failing austerity policies, the economic governance framework needs profound change, and as the European Parliament we have the legislative key. The facts are: 25 million unemployed people, economic stagnation, deflation, excessive debt, high deficits, democratic deficit. These rules are hurting instead of working.  Laudable as it is to keep the deficit under 3%, we need to recognise the cost too. Therefore, I believe the economic governance framework needs to be broader and take into account social elements. The key questions are: what are the Member States doing to tackle poverty, tax fraud and youth unemployment? How do they increase education opportunities? These criteria need to get the same weight in the analysis as the level of public deficit and debt.  Given the interconnection of all our economies, I do recognise the need for effective management of our economies and, yes, smart investments need to be treated in a flexible way. The reform of the six-pack and the two-pack will be an important test to show that the EU takes European citizens seriously, and an opportunity to make a European project people can believe in.

Too often, governments of individual countries behave irrationally, of course in the context of satisfying their constituents as much as possible.

The Commission reports to us that it has carried out 42 in-depth reviews and identified 5 cases of imbalance, but has not acted.

As I said at the beginning, the Commission sees the follow-up to the review, and the process of strengthening economic governance in general, very much as a dialogue with all stakeholders. The European Parliament is a key partner in this respect. I have carefully taken note of the remarks and points raised. They will help us to see the strong points of the economic governance framework, as well as the areas for improvement. Similarly, I very much look forward to the work being done by Ms Berès and the shadow rapporteurs in preparing their own-initiative report. A number of points have also been raised by colleagues that are probably somewhat outside the scope of the review of the six-pack and two-pack. Nevertheless I will make some brief responses to those, because there were a number of questions as regards the best use of flexibility within the Stability and Growth Pact. As you are aware, the Commission is preparing some more detailed guidelines or a document on the best use of flexibility within the existing Stability and Growth Pact, precisely in order to look into this issue. We will be presenting this document early next year and looking at various issues, including a number of issues raised on taking into account economic cycles, the treatment of investment, and the treatment of structural reforms. But once again, it is worth emphasising that we are making this document within the framework of the existing Stability and Growth Pact. More specifically, on the question of the treatment of investments for the European Fund for Strategic Investments: this is something which the Commission outlined already when presenting the investment plan. The Commission will treat that kind of investment favourably, understanding that, while – just like any other expenditure, it would count towards deficit and debt – it would not trigger specific procedures under the Stability and Growth Pact should the Member States exceed their thresholds of whichever procedures by an amount no larger than their contributions to this fund. We are really ensuring this favourable treatment. Of course, it is clear that the topic of strengthening our economic governance system is far from finished. I am looking forward to engaging with you and other stakeholders in intensive debate during the coming months.

Worse, after two recalls, it can fine states that are reluctant to comply with Brussels' injunctions, a fine of up to 0.1% of GDP. Added to this is the \"two-pack\" which strengthens the Commission's powers in budgetary supervision of Member States. Moreover, the \"two-pack\" requires states to rely on independent growth forecasts and submit their budget to a budget control body. Finally, the fiscal compact (TSCG) will have to become a reality in 2018. This 'golden rule', a genuine austerity plan, will put national budgets under some control and kill the growth of Member States.

The Commission boasts of the progress made in reducing deficits in the Member States and the reduction in the number of countries under the excessive deficit procedure. However, looking at the overall economic state of the Union, it is difficult to regard the policy as a comprehensive success. Societies most affected by the sanitation measures introduced at the behest of the Union are increasingly starting to rebel. The political crisis in Greece, the strikes in France and Italy, make us reflect on the social costs of the measures taken to reduce the budget deficit. In fact, in addition to the decrease in debt, it is difficult to identify any other positives. The economies of many Member States are once again approaching recession and unemployment remains high in many of them. From this perspective, it is difficult to talk about the unequivocal success of the current economic governance package.

After two recalls, states that were reluctant to comply with the Brussels injunctions were fined. The \"two-pack\" further strengthens the Commission's powers in the area of budgetary supervision. As a result, Member States are forced to rely on independent growth forecasts and submit their budgets to a budgetary regulator. To this arsenal is added the fiscal pact (TSCG), demanded in its time by the duo \"Merkel-Sarkozy\", which will come into force in 2018. This 'golden rule', or umpteenth austerity plan, will end up putting national budgets under guardianship and annihilate any idea of growth in the Member States.

It is true that we have not yet been able to test the measures in different economic circumstances, but mechanisms such as the annual publication of the reform and stability programme, the European Semester and so on ensure sufficient early detection of problems and timely action.  We have better control and member states need to be more careful and precise in planning their budgets.

It is the recognition by the European Union of a kind of local economic protectionism. However, this exorbitant regime of internal market law is threatened by the European Commission, which now sees it as a so-called situation rent, when in reality it is the guarantor of the survival of the economic fabric of the overseas regions.

The request was submitted to the Commission on 18 June 2014 and further information was added by 13 August 2014. The recession has had a serious impact on the consumption patterns of Italian households, as the latter have reconsidered their purchasing decisions, in particular as far as the purchase of durable goods is concerned: household consumption in Italy decreased in four of the five years 2009-2013 compared to the same period last year. Consequently, the Italian market for household appliances decreased from EUR 3174 billion in 2010 to EUR 2649 billion in 2013, a fall of 16.5%. This explains why production in sector 27 under NACE Rev. 2 has fallen for 6 consecutive years (2008-2013) at the level of the 28 EU Member States.

A banking union should serve to create transparency of operations across banks in the Union while shielding national governments from the burden of bailouts should their big banks collapse.

However, the Resolution Authority will inevitably be coloured by political considerations of a multilateral nature, as is happening now in the European Central Bank.  Quite likely, the political dynamics of the Resolution Authority will hardly be different from those of the Eurogroup when, say, the latter was dealing with Southern European countries. Not all banks will be equal. Least able to counter such considerations will be the banking systems of medium to small Member States, especially in economies where financial services have become a significant sector.

Nach den von Ihnen zu Recht verurteilten Vorgungen heute Morgen in Pakistan fellt es schwer, yesterday in ruhigem Ton 'ber das Arbeitsprogramm der Europ-ischen Kommission zu reden.  Es follt mir aber nicht schwer, Ihnen im Namen der Kommission sehr herzlich zur Verleihung des Aachener Karlspreises zu gratulieren. Ich bin ja selbst Karlspreistr-ger - und zwar ein doppelter. Einmal hat das luxemburgische Volk 1986 den Karlspreis als Volk erhalten, zu dem Volk geh-re ich nach wie, vor und ich hatte die Ehre, ihn selbst im Jahre 2006 in Empfang zu nehmen. Die Reihe der Karlspreistr-ger wird durch Ihre Bestellung noch beeindruckender, Herr President. (Beifall) With regard to the work programme of the new Commission, let me say, Mr President, that I had the impression during the election campaign, in which you were my rival but nevertheless a friend, like Guy Verhofstadt and others, that European citizens wanted to see a new beginning in Europe. At least that's the impression I got after visiting some 20 countries and thirty-three European cities. I have fallen in love with Europe again, because there are few times when, in such a short period of time, you can discover so many sensibilities, see so many colors, meet so many men and women. We agreed, during the process of setting up the new Commission, that it should focus on the essentials, on the major subjects, defined by the guidelines that I had the honour of developing before you on 15 July and at the end of October. I think we agreed that any problem that exists in Europe is not necessarily a problem for the European Union or the Commission. Indeed, many of us thought that the principle of subsidiarity should be rehabilitated and the task of solving this problem should be given to the levels of power - namely Member States, regions or local authorities - which are best able to respond to the problems in Europe. On the basis of these principles, in accordance with the Commission's guidelines, we have examined 452 legislative initiatives that are currently under consideration and which are being debated. We have done so with the main priorities that must be those of the European Union in mind. The top priority, the one that is not in doubt, is based on the elements of growth and employment. That is why, some three weeks after its installation, the Commission has proposed an ambitious investment plan that will occupy not only the minds, but also our meetings over the next six months, and I would be grateful to the European Parliament for working closely, courageously and with a concern for the work well done, in the consideration of these texts. Mr President, we wanted to limit the number of new initiatives we are going to undertake and launch. There was a time when the Commission announced 130 new initiatives a year. We are announcing twenty-three new initiatives for 2015; we are presenting the work programme for 2015 and not the work programme that will cover the duration of the legislature. We limit the number of new initiatives by applying the often disputed principle of discontinuity: we will withdraw, amend or amend eighty-three texts that are on the legislative table. New initiatives, in addition to the important investment program, include all those related to taxation. I repeat in this regard that the Commission will present in the first six months a directive on the automatic exchange of advance decisions, namely tax rulings - as they say in bad French. In addition, the Commission will present an action programme for the fight against tax evasion and evasion by establishing in principle the fact that the country where the profit is made must become the place of taxation. (Applause) This will happen and I would like to say very amicably that I am sensitive to the fact that, day after day, I am invited to do what I said. I said it and it will be done in 2015. Frans Timmermans, whom I congratulate on the zeal with which he coordinated the Commission's work on its work programme, met with each of the Commissioners separately. He prepared this programme with the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament. He has - I must say this - merit and since he is the one who deserves the work done, I will leave it with your agreement, Mr President, to the first Vice-President to set out the Commission's work programme and priorities.

The Charlemagne Prize is something that is very close to you and me because we are from the region. Aachen is the pivotal city in the region we are from, and the origins of the Charlemagne Prize are so intimately linked with the idea of healing the wounds after the Second World War that to be honoured with the Charlemagne Prize is one of the highest distinctions any European can receive. I want to congratulate you on that.  Through you, Mr President, I want to thank this House for the elaborate cooperation in preparing the Commission work programme for 2015. As President Juncker has just said, we want it to be focused on priorities for 2015, and we want it to be about 2015 – not about 2016 or 2017, etc. Of course, the Commission will also have priorities in the years after 2015, but these will be in the work programmes for the years to come.  This Commission wants to deliver change in terms of the way we work, but we can only do that in close cooperation with your Parliament and with Council. Therefore, when today we present the Commission work programme it is also an invitation to the European Parliament to use it as a platform for discussion between our two institutions, and then also to bring the third institution in legislation into the fold when they also have to play their role, namely the Council. As President Juncker said, we have 23 new measures on our list. We are breaking with the practice of listing everything for fear of being incomplete, and we are only putting forward the things we will actually do in 2015. No more, no less. This does not mean that preparatory work will not start for future initiatives to implement the political guidelines to be presented in 2016 and 2017, like the multiannual financial framework mid-term review. Of course it will, and Parliament will be kept closely informed.  Our first priority, as the President has already said, is to deliver on the investment plan for Europe. We showed we can act quickly by presenting our strategy within the first month of the mandate. Now we need to implement and deliver to unlock public and private investments in the real economy of at least EUR 315 billion over the next three years.  We will table an ambitious digital single market package to create the conditions for a vibrant digital economy and society. This will be done by complementing the telecommunications regulatory environment, modernising copyright rules, simplifying rules for consumers making online and digital purchases, enhancing cyber-security, and mainstreaming digitalisation.  We will take steps towards a European Energy Union. It has never been so vital to ensure energy supply security, integrate national energy markets, reduce energy demand in Europe, and promote green technology.  Deepening economic and monetary union is important for the stability of the Eurozone, and, together with our plans to create a capital union, will attract investors to Europe. In parallel, we will invest in reinvigorating the social dialogue at all levels. We want to promote fairness and opportunity in our societies. We will look at new ways to support Member States in getting people, especially the younger and long-term unemployed, into the workplace and making sure they have the skills they need to stay there. We will present a package of measures to promote labour mobility while supporting Member States’ efforts to ensure that benefits are not abused.  A fairer approach to taxation is something citizens rightly feel very strongly about. Our aim should be that companies’ profits are taxed in the place they are made, including in the digital economy. We will bring forward an action plan to that end alongside proposals on transparency of tax rulings and relaunching work on the common consolidated corporate tax base. We will develop a holistic and balanced European agenda on migration. Citizens expect us to improve the management of migration into Europe while keeping it an attractive destination for talent. We will strengthen our better regulation agenda and follow up our commitment for democratic change. We have already started with important improvements in the transparency of our meetings with interested representatives, and I am looking forward to a debate with Parliament on how we move this agenda forward. We have looked at what we are planning with a critical eye. Will this initiative contribute to jobs and growth? Will it add value beyond what Member States are able to do? Will it be effective in changing things on the ground without adding unnecessary burdens? All the initiatives we are taking are well within the ten priorities President Juncker agreed with your Parliament upon his election. We have also asked the same question: ‘is it is necessary and useful?’ of the 400 or so pending proposals that are already on the table, applying the principle of political discontinuity that is set out in the framework agreement between our two institutions. It is very often set out as a principle but, in practical terms, it is very often difficult to actually apply it, as I have discovered in the last couple of weeks. At the start of the new legislative cycle, it is time to clear the decks so that time and energy can be invested in those proposals that will have the biggest impact on jobs and growth and which have a good prospect of being adopted in the near future. So we have looked through every pending proposal across all sectors and decided whether we want to maintain, amend or withdraw them. We want results on the ground so, where it is clear existing proposals would be not be agreed in a way that meets our objectives, we will propose alternative, more effective, approaches. That is the case with the Energy Tax Directive, which we propose to withdraw because the Council has watered it down so that it no longer meets our environmental objectives of taxing fuel in a way that reflects real energy content and CO2 emissions. We are also proposing to withdraw the existing proposal on the circular economy to make way for a broader and more ambitious approach that can be more effective… (Interjection from the floor: ‘Shame!’) Let me finish and then you can still cry ‘shame’, but perhaps it will not be necessary. What we want to do is actually to make sure that the circular economy is indeed approached in a circular way, and not just half the circle. This means that we will withdraw the present waste proposal and come back with a more ambitious proposal that will cover the whole of the circular economy, and we will do this in 2015.  We will not drag our feet with this. We will do this very quickly, because we want the circular economy to be in pole position when the Juncker plan is being put into effect so that the economy that can profit from investment is indeed smack in the middle of the circular economy. This is what we want to do. So, if we withdraw the waste package, it is because we want to put something on the table that is more ambitious and that really can make a huge contribution to a part of the European economy that really needs a boost, which is the circular economy. We can also do this in line with the Juncker plan. I am deeply convinced of this. No ‘shame!’? Good. As I said, we will present this new, more ambitious proposal to promote the economy next year. In parallel, we will promote investment in this sector through the new European Fund for Strategic Investment as well as European structural and investment funds. In the political guidelines, we said we would assess the air package and our conclusions are clear. There are good prospects that the medium-sized combustion plants proposal will be adopted soon, closing the unacceptable loophole in our source legislation. The proposal on national emission ceilings has proved more controversial, and there is a gap emerging between what Parliament and Council might view as an acceptable outcome. We will bring forward, in the course of the ongoing negotiations, a modified proposal which we hope can help bridge this gap by better reflecting synergies with the energy and climate package, and by reducing the administrative burden. We are optimistic that negotiations will be a success and that agreement can be reached. I stress that we are not compromising on the goals we want to attain, but we are looking critically at the methods we can use to bring parties together so that we have a conclusion that can actually be implemented soon, so that we can achieve cleaner air in the EU. We have discussed the Maternity Leave Directive a lot. Let me be clear. The Commission deplores the persisting barriers to women’s access to and progression in the workplace just as much as you do. Over the past years, perhaps partly because of our proposal, many Member States have improved their maternity leave arrangements. However, there are a range of other issues that also need to be addressed to enable more women to participate in the labour market. We are ready to work with you and the Council to make one last effort to unblock the directive. But if there is no breakthrough in six months, we will take it off the table and come instead with a new initiative tackling those issues in the round. So yes, we will remain ambitious – yes we want this directive to succeed – but if it still continues to go nowhere, we will take new initiatives to break through the glass ceiling to create better positions for women in the labour market. We believe that it would be more useful for everyone to invest their time and effort in such a discussion than in an ongoing institutional stalemate. The onus is now on the three institutions in the next six months to create momentum around this proposal. If you really mean business, we can do it; if not, we will have to come up with something else. This is all part of our better regulation ethos. Our work programme also has a strong implementation simplification dimension. It again includes a set of regulatory Refit initiatives through which the Commission assesses the existing stock of legislation on a rolling basis to ensure that laws remain fit for purpose and deliver on their objectives in the most efficient and effective way. So what comes next? We will now discuss the withdrawal proposals with you, and we will only enact them after hearing your views. It is clear to me that we can only get things really done if there is an agreement between three institutions.  On the priority initiatives, we look forward to following up with the Parliament and the Council. We would like to work with you to identify a list of files on which the institutions can make a common commitment to progress swiftly to bring the benefit to the citizens as soon as possible. We look forward to a good and deep structural dialogue with your committees in the course of next spring and summer. On the basis of this experience, I hope we can move to a deeper understanding of interinstitutional programming in the future.  The Commission’s work programme is not the end of the affair or the dialogue. It is the beginning of a dialogue, and I am very much looking forward to this dialogue and coming back to your Parliament early next year if you allow me, Mr President, to continue that. Today is the start; we need your support.

It is Christmas time and we are decorating trees, and at Christmas time for many years now we have done the exercise of the Commission work programme where everyone wants to put many decorations on this Christmas tree! However, the exercise of the Commission work programme is completely different and I would like to welcome and congratulate the Commission on this work programme, on behalf of the EPP, in achieving – at least so far – this impossible exercise by not making the Commission work programme into a Christmas tree where everyone finds their own point. We welcome the change; we welcome the simplicity and sticking to the basic principles, the ten priorities of the Juncker programme and investment plans in this work programme. I understand, and the same problem exists for Parliament: we all want our decorations on the Christmas tree and in this exercise we have seen in this election that we are losing the basic priorities. The word priority comes from the Latin word for ‘one’. Priority means one. Ten priorities are already more than one. Twenty-three priorities are more than ten. However, twenty-three priorities are more than 452 which is an extremely important and efficient exercise. The EPP would like to see efforts concentrated on the key items and refrain from taking initiatives which are not essential. Also we have to pay very strong attention to the implementation. Very often parliaments and our colleagues demand other elements and legislation just because the implementation is not done, so I would also welcome concentration and orientation on the implementation issues. We would like to see a growth-oriented Commission work programme creating all the conditions needed for more jobs, more mobility on the labour market and therefore better educational skills, notably in the IT sector, and the establishment of a real energy single market ensuring energy security and supply and going further towards a real and secular digital single market.  We also support your endeavours to have less bureaucracy at all stages at the national and Union level, using taxpayers’ money in a more efficient way in the fight against tax fraud and tax evasion, as well as simplifying the life of the economic actors, farmers, SMEs, because entrepreneurship needs a friendly environment without unnecessary administrative burdens and obstacles, and facilities in capital and financing access. We are therefore welcoming change. However we have been through this exercise so the implementation of this Commission work programme is the key. We are therefore in favour of a new deal allowing the Commission, Council and Parliament to define together the EU priorities. Whether this Commission work programme is the starting shot for that we will only know later on, but I wish us all the best of luck and strength to the Commission for the implementation.

We increased their legitimacy and, in return, demanded a different relationship of trust than the previous one: more dialogue, more joint action, more accountability. \"I want to work with Parliament in a transparent manner, in a spirit of loyalty, mutual trust and cooperation, taking into account and respecting the co-legislators of the Union equally. I propose to update the methods of cooperation and work between the Commission and Parliament through constructive dialogue'. They're not my words. These are your words, Mr Timmermans, and they are words that I fully share. Believe me, I am very sorry to have to convey to you, on behalf of our group, our disappointment and some anger. What we have experienced in recent days and hours in relation to the Commission's work programme does not correspond to those words which I share. It's too much like the past to accept that this time it's different. Opacity at work, media versions, confusion, lack of information relevant to Parliament. Confidence between Parliament and the Commission has been damaged. The distance has increased. But we will have to reflect on that and I welcome the words that have just spoken today, pointing out that not only do different things, but do things differently. We will try to do it in the next resolution and that should be the work program. My group has priorities. They know them perfectly. Reducing unemployment, especially among young people. We demand, I said, a profound, visible, rapid and effective turn on taxation. I have to acknowledge with satisfaction that, on this particular point, certainly partly because of our pressure, the Commission has made a significant proposal. We want more and are ready to work together with the Commission to advance taxation in 2015. The social model has to be defended. We also want measures to combat growing social and territorial inequalities, to combat poverty in the Union with solidarity. On these issues, positive subsidiarity is needed, but also a strong European Union, which is able to respond to these challenges. Just a few seconds to point out that, on the matters for which they are proposing withdrawal, my group has some reservations and fully agrees that the objectives must be maintained, even if the procedure has to be changed: on maternity leave or on the circular economy. In any case, we are ready to work together with the Commission.

As parents we take our children to school to learn and trust them to be safe, and our hearts go out to those families who have lost children today.  We do face unprecedented challenges. Our economies are under pressure, our resources are under pressure, security is under pressure and Europe needs to change. The Commissioners have talked about change, we need to see them deliver. We must build our economic strength. Yes, we share wider objectives – higher living standards, the environment, opportunity, equality – but we need strong economies to deliver this. So the economy must come first. And every EU initiative should face that simple test: will it make it easier or harder for businesses to thrive? Too often in the past we have seen the EU churn out new laws without thinking through the impact on growth, on small businesses, on innovation. This must stop and our decisions should be based on evidence.  Mr Juncker promised our Group he would keep a chief scientific adviser. Please keep that promise, Mr Juncker. Instead of focusing on yet more new laws, we should also make sure the existing ones work, and if they do not, then let us change them. And the last Commission promised to reduce burdens. Will you keep that promise, will you set a target for cutting red tape and then stick to it? We need to focus on growth, the single market in energy and services, and new public procurement rules should reduce costs and help growth. Let us deliver those changes. In 2015 we want to look forward to 2050 and not back to the 1950s. We need vibrant digital markets, conditions that let industries succeed and increase external trade too. And if we do not conclude that deep trade agreement with the US, then yes, we will be left behind. We need to unlock investment, especially for small companies and for infrastructure, investment built on private funds, on equity and not just public debt, because the crisis in public debt is not over.  Budgetary stability is still key as are structural reforms, but this does not mean centralising social and employment policies, because overruling national governments would risk even deeper resentments. And, Commissioners, we cannot have one set of rules for public spending at home and another set here in Strasbourg and Brussels. You must cut costs and waste from the EU budget and put the EU’s own finances in order. It is because public services are so stretched that the people of Europe have concerns over immigration. These must be addressed. Yes, we must cooperate with third countries and help tackle the causes of migration. But serious actions must also be taken to stop abuses of the migration system, both within and outside the EU. Our single market is meant to help businesses and consumers trade easily across 28 countries, not a bureaucratic one-size-fits-all monolith stifling creativity and reducing competition, not red tape, not regulation. That is our vision and we will work with those who share it.

First of all, we are talking better lawmaking today and in my view that would also mean transparency and indeed involving Parliament, but to my knowledge we are having a debate today on the basis of a document that was leaked to the press. I find that an unusual procedure. ALDE naturally supports efforts to slim down and simplify EU legislation, but we believe in smart trimming, not in taking a blunt axe to the trunk of the tree.  The Commission should not throw the baby out with the bathwater by arbitrarily scrapping laws. The Commission should respect the democratic policymaking process and not pick and choose. No one can be opposed to eliminating unnecessary regulation, but what one person considers unnecessary may be considered essential by someone else. The Commission wants to concentrate on the big themes and ALDE, of course, fully supports that. Now ALDE considers equal treatment a big theme, but in the Commission’s logic the blocked anti-discrimination directive is unnecessary red tape. ALDE considers transparency a big theme, but in the Commission’s own logic the access to documents law, blocked by the Commission and the Council, should be scrapped. ALDE considers sustainability a big theme, but the Commission’s red-tape slayer wants to withdraw the proposals for waste and air quality. ALDE also considers upholding democratic values and the rule of law a big theme, and unfortunately in many Member States it is a very topical issue these days, but the Commission proposes no instrument. Democracy and the rule of law are also necessary. Conversely Parliament rejected the proposal for an EU PNR scheme but the Commission keeps pushing for it without any proper justification or evidence for its necessity.  In our view the Commission should focus on improving the process rather than ignoring the outcome of democratic decision. ALDE strongly objects to the withdrawal of files only and exclusively because the Member States failed to take responsibility and the Council is paralysed. If that were the rule, many good laws making the lives of EU citizens better would not have existed today. There would be no banking union, no European patents, no standards for the health and safety of workers in the internal market, no common asylum rules.  Scrapping or simplifying certain laws may be useful, but how will the Commission tackle goldplating by Member States, a major cause of excessive red tape? How will the Commission ensure better implementation of EU laws by Member States, and will the Commission finally introduce a sunset clause in all legislative proposals. Last but not least, will the Commission drastically raise the standards of transparency and access to documents so as to allow for full accountability and public scrutiny, which in my view is key to better lawmaking?

Mr President, you are right: this Parliament is indeed the last-chance legislature here in Europe. If we want to reconcile our citizens with the very idea of European integration, we must - as you have often said - bring Europe closer to the citizen. But what does it mean to bring Europe closer to the citizen, other than to ensure that our Europe works for the majority of our citizens, not just for a minority? If we want to achieve this, I think we have to go through three directions. The first is social justice. You have told us that you want Europe to deserve a social triple A and, in this, we can only approve of you. Some will say: 'Social policy is not a competence of the European Union'. Quite the opposite! Let us first talk about tax justice: you have already announced a few initiatives on this subject which, without going to the point they should reach, represent at least a step in the right direction. There is still a lot of work to be done in terms of tax transparency and these are relatively easy, from a political point of view, to implement. We encourage you to do so. We also believe - and I did not hear this in your speech, nor in Mr Timmermans's speech - that, contrary to what we heard in plenary this morning, we need to review the economic governance package, in order to make the social objectives of reducing poverty and inequality and the environmental objectives as restrictive as the budgetary targets. The budgetary choices that governments make will thus be choices in the direction of reducing inequalities and our ecological footprint, rather than in the direction of their worsening. We must also review - and I have not heard it either - the directive on the secondment of workers and stop using the semester to actually put the workers of this continent, especially the most insecure of them, in competition with each other. Finally, you need to put in place the social impact assessment of all measures, including the budget measures you want to take. The second axis is long-term environmental sustainability. I continue to hear from the Council, here in Parliament and in the Commission that the ecological transition of the economy is a burden. \"We'll do that when things get better,\" they say. Yet for Europeans, it is both a requirement - we continue to depend on the outside for our energy - and an opportunity! This is how we will set Europe at the forefront of the next industrial revolution. The third and final axis is the need to address the democratic deficit. I have heard ideas about transparency in lobbying. What I have not heard is that the European semester, the instrument par excellence of policy convergence in Europe, must be subject to much more democratic scrutiny, at the levels of both the European Parliament and national parliaments. We really need to give legitimacy to the discussions that are taking place at the moment when the country-specific recommendations are being developed - recommendations that, more often than not, result from behind-the-scenes agreements between government officials, often at the official level, and Commission representatives, without either being accountable for democratic representation. In fact, measures are taken or imposed without anyone paying the political cost. At this point, we are no longer in a democracy. I will end with the question of better regulation. Mr. Timmermans, you told us that better regulation does not mean no regulation, nor deregulation. You have said some interesting things about the \"waste\" package, and I take note of that. I would like you to confirm to me that it is no longer a question of removing air quality measures. Finally, with regard to REFIT, it is a device used, including by a majority of this House - I am a democrat, therefore I recognise this - to continually weaken the social and environmental protection measures we need if we are to lead, especially the most fragile among us, a decent existence. REFIT cannot be the pretext for a large-scale deregulation operation. In conclusion, I would like to encourage you to show a better sense of customer service. I was very surprised to see that it took five days - five days! Commissioner Hill to respond to the letter sent to him by the banking federations, calling for the withdrawal of the directive on structural reforms of the banking sector. It took her five days to take her back to her Account! Real customer service reacts instantly to this kind of demand from the big banks; the commissioner really should make him a much more enthusiastic lawyer than he is now. It is, of course, out of the question for us that this directive should be withdrawn.

I even noticed on the Berlaymont Building last week a great big banner with your face on it and the rest of the Commission team – a new start for Europe under team Juncker. Well I do not know about ‘new’. This Commission has got four former Prime Ministers in it, it has got 19 former government ministers in it, it has got seven former Commissioners in it. I do not know about some bright new fresh start for Europe. It looks a bit more like the knacker’s yard for failed domestic politicians.  And at the top of it, as President, we have got you. Now I do not want anybody here to think that I am questioning Mr Juncker’s competence. I am not. You are certainly competent. You are a good operator and there are 240 multinationals who all managed to avoid hundreds of millions of euro of corporation tax by paying 1% to 2% tax in Luxembourg during your term there as Prime Minister that would testify that you are certainly a more competent operator than the man that went before you. But please do not give us ‘new’. You were Prime Minister of Luxembourg for 19 years and you headed up the Eurogroup. ʽNewʼ you are not. You and this Commission, frankly, are as stale and musty as a corked bottle of wine.  We are being encouraged by your sidekick, Mr Timmermans, who, by the way, today talked about the ʽcircular economyʼ. Sir, I have not got a clue what you are talking about but it sounds absolutely lovely. You told us today that you are going to adopt a minimalist approach to legislation. Again, rather like Mr Juncker, you are rather brighter, cleverer and sharper than those who have gone before you. We are not going to get from you any more proposed bans on olive oil being poured into dishes that we dip our bread into in restaurants and I suspect that you will not be updating the curvature of cucumber regulations that came in a few years ago. Minimalism is one thing, but what it fails to address is the fact that the very last time we attempted to address within the European Union how big the body of law that had already been imposed on our businesses was – that was in 2005 – it was 170 000 pages of active legislation. It is probably now a quarter of a million or perhaps even more than that. I would suggest to Mr Timmermans that what we do not need is minimalism. If Europe is to become competitive and to trade globally and competitively, what it needs is the axe. You have actually got to start getting rid of excessive regulation, particularly on the small and medium-sized enterprises, which in any free market economy could not be expected to maintain the same standards for everybody and everything as the giant multinationals. But there are two areas where minimalism will not work. One is in negotiating with the United Kingdom about immigration. Mr Juncker, you have made it clear that it is non-negotiable. The free movement of peoples is non-negotiable; the British want wholesale change. Secondly, there is Greece’s membership of the euro when it is clear for all to see that she, and everybody else, would be better off without it. I suggest that, whatever your work programme is, the next five years will actually be dominated by Greece and the euro and Britain’s membership of the European Union. I suspect that you will spent most of your time dealing with those issues.

As an ardent lover of Europe and an advocate of European cooperation between our Member States, but at the same time as a critical and sceptical member of parliament on your concept of the European Union, I was in fact pleased with the Commission's intention to limit its legislative priorities and initiatives. For example, I myself am an active waste recycler and I have always supported Flemish initiatives in this direction as much as possible as an active citizen and also as a politician. But what is the advantage of European patronising in this area seems to me to be completely unclear and undesirable and in any case unnecessary. More can be achieved through voluntary agreements, possibly stimulated by trade agreements.  The energy you put into a coercive system in relation to countries that do not want or can follow will lead to incomprehension and cost more money than anything else.

Contrary to what has been announced, I do not believe that this Commission is dusty and nothing has changed in it. I very much welcome the fact that the Commission's objective is better legislation. I agree that a review of Community law is needed. The question must be asked whether the acquis communautaire is not duplicated, where there are loopholes in the same law that make it difficult for us to operate, which need to be replenished, and where there are reserves that strengthen, above all, economic growth or social cohesion. Secondly, the review of the passage of part of the programme from the previous Commission requires a swift decision to ensure that Parliament is not uncertain about the fate of the projects we have already started work on – m.in. on the clean air package or the waste package.  Thirdly, I would like to support the european Commission's priorities, and in particular the Energy Union. It must be acknowledged that the question of security of energy supply, the decommissioning of energy islands, the development of transmission infrastructure or diversification of supply are extremely important, in particular in the context of the crisis in eastern Europe. Furthermore, the functioning of the internal market is important, including, I stress with all emphasis, the free movement of persons or the implementation of the Services Directive, as m.in well as the Digital Agenda as the basis for rapid and smart growth or the development of entrepreneurship, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises, together with the entire investment package presented. I also consider it very important to tax profits where they are made. We know examples of transfers, especially at the beginning of the transformation of countries such as mine, from the countries where the profit was made, to the countries of origin of companies that operated in the area.

This machine is not working and we need to restart job creation in order to overcome the stagnation trend we are in, in order to overcome economic and social divergences between Member States, and in order to pave the way for new activities: a green transition, a smart and innovative economy.

This also means having a fiscal rule with more room for investments and this, we know very well, means having a credible agenda to tackle tax avoidance and to exclude harmful tax competition.

This is a very negative phenomenon, which affects young people in particular today and to create development prospects for them that will enable them to live in a dignified life in our countries, in the countries of the European Union, and not to go beyond it in search of jobs – because this is not a way to combat unemployment – it is a great prospect today. In January 2014, less than a year ago, the previous European Commission issued a communication on the need for a revival of European industry. Even then, the candidates for European Commissioners, m.in Elżbieta Bieńkowska, now Commissioner, spoke of the need for reindustrialisation. In this regard, a few questions need to be asked, Mr President, namely, the rebirth of industry and reindustrialisation, and I understand that this is the same in Europe. What has been done about this since January 2014? Until now, this remains in the sphere of demand. How do climate-related constraints come to this?

You have introduced to us the programme, a version of which was leaked a few days ago. This was fine, it was advance notice so we could be prepared. But on the other hand, I hope that the information that this programme has been driven by the services and the Secretariat General is not a leak, but just gossip, because what we expect from a political Commission is very thorough political work. Now on the programme: it is a good paper. It is still general, of course, and we will have to get down to the nitty-gritty, but I think that it addresses a number of issues. On the other hand, what I notice in the plan is that we also somehow slightly neglect other issues which are of daily concern to citizens. The economic and social agenda is definitely among these, but there are other issues which may be less prominent. Now on the investment plan: I really regret that the Commission, at least at this stage, missed an opportunity to link the benefits which the investment plan is to bring with the structural changes which need to occur in the Member States. I would be looking for conditionality, in other words. Now in terms of better regulation, I think that this is a good first step that we have seen today. I am a little bit concerned as to whether we will see a real system soon enough; this is what I am looking for and what I am missing in the plan. There is no system; there are no targets; there are no benchmarks. We need to look at its complexity. A final remark: we are currently in the process of withdrawing legislation. Hopefully this is the right thing to do, but I would expect that this process would be based on impact assessments. Legislative initiatives have to be based on impact assessments, and so should their withdrawal. I am not sure I understood it; I would appreciate a clarification on that.

But the document that was leaked last week does not yet adequately show this – far from it in many respects. I do not know exactly why, but we should talk about it.

This House prevailed in the last parliamentary term – in banking regulation with Mr Karas's report – that from 2015, from next year, all financial institutions will have to prove country by country where they make what profits and where they pay what taxes. That is a good principle. That is where Mr Karas, who has listened carefully, who has been able to welcome him, who has achieved this for the European People's Party. There is Mr Lamberts, who has spoken. He has pushed this through for the Green Group. I was the shadow rapporteur for the Social Democrats, and we have achieved this for the Social Democrats. Is it so unfair that my group expects you today, in view of the discussion we have on tax avoidance practices, to finally extend this to all multinationals? Why is this proposal not in your work programme? It would ensure overnight that many avoidance practices cease to exist and that we can finally achieve fair taxation and justice for tax citizens in Europe. You say that I assume that this is a newer development, that there is an action programme by June of next year. I very much hope that this will be included in this action programme.

We attach particular importance to the progress of these two priority areas in 2015. As EPP coordinator in the Committee on Women's Rights, I would like to quickly raise two important issues. The first is one of the EPP Group's priorities, the draft Women on Boards directive. We would like to urge the European Commission to weigh, as far as possible, on the ongoing negotiations in the Council to carry out the draft directive on greater representation of women on the boards of large listed companies, known as Women on Boards. We in the European Parliament voted for a reasonable and balanced compromise, and the EPP Group had contributed a great deal to that. We really hope that this file can be completed in 2015. With regard to the draft directive on maternity leave, we have also heard you. You are moving forward, in my opinion, in a lucid, realistic and reasonable way. We have taken note of the idea of considering a withdrawal, if there is no substantial movement or initiative within six months.

After listening intently to your proposals, I do have a couple of observations.  My first observation is on the issue of tax havens. I welcome the fact that you recognise the problems we face in your work programme, though I have got to be truthful, the cynic in me does wonder if this would have been included if it were not for the recent LuxLeaks scandals.  Mr Juncker, this Parliament made it clear last year that we wanted immediate action to tackle tax evasion, outlining priority areas such as country-by-country reporting and blacklisting for tax avoiders. That was last year, and so far we have seen little action. In that time, citizens across the EU have continued to see their wages cut, health services cut, public services cut. Day by day, week by week, people from all over Europe, who continue to pay their taxes, have seen their living standards squeezed. Yet in this time we have continued to allow large corporations to avoid paying their dues, avoid paying what they owe and avoid living up to their responsibilities. We need legislation now. No longer can we turn a blind eye to tax injustice.  My second observation is in regard to the scrapping of the air quality package. Mr Juncker, I warn you now. Kicking this legislation on air quality into the long grass will have serious implications for public health across the EU. Air pollution kills 400 000 people every year. To scrap legislation that could save so many lives is not just appalling, it is actually totally irresponsible. This will send a message to everyone that the EU is no longer interested in promoting progressive environmental health policy. I urge you, Mr Juncker, to reconsider this issue now.

You talked about fighting tax evasion and tax fraud. Taxes, you said, must be paid where they are generated. How credible is this according to your Luxembourg model? Should tax fairness then also apply to employees or only to entrepreneurs? Where is the investment in social justice?

We are already working on that. It is my colleague, Éduard Kukan, who is managing the subject - and we have received a very positive signal from Commissioner Hahn in this regard. I am convinced that we will work very well together, especially since in recent years we have also been a little surprised by the changes in the South and the East. We were ill-prepared and we sometimes felt here in the European Parliament that we were not very well positioned to make certain decisions. We are therefore aware that today, the reform of the European neighbourhood policy cannot be a mere cosmetic reform. We must try to respond to the great challenges of our time and, indeed, find a balance between East and South. I would also like to say a word about the agreement with the United States, because of course these negotiations are important for economic growth and jobs, but also in terms of policy.

But we tell you that this point must be taken to the end. Especially in the substantive political relationship with Parliament, if you want a Europe that is more open to the citizens, if you want us to move in the same direction. From this point of view, we are not there, as our colleague Mr Guerrero said. So, in addition to the selection effort, which is all well and good, there is also a more organic division of the individual measures around the priorities; next to better regulation, we want better implementation. There is too much bureaucratic elephantine, too many procedures in the last, too much outsourcing of work. We also need more transparency. But what I want to say basically about the content is that, if the implementation of the investment plan, named after you, Mr Juncker, is central and immediate, we must also tackle the issues of economic policy. There will be no investment and growth unless some things are corrected. This morning we had a very interesting debate on flexibility, the revision of the rules or implementation, with a different approach to the rules in force. We want to reassure you and I would like what was said in this morning's debate to be reflected in the Commission's first acts. With regard to the document on flexibility that we are all waiting for as a kind of post-Christmas cadeau, we want – I am speaking on behalf of my country, 40% of Italian voters have chosen my party, which has made a stronger proposal for a stronger Europe but a different Europe – a flexibility that is intelligent, that is, useful to the common objective of growth; we want good investment, good spending, therefore flexibility that helps GDP growth and not that it spoils public finances. Stop thinking about flexibility that goes into unnecessary public spending! There is talk of flexibility on investments, on the cofinancing of projects within the 2020 Agenda, on the cofinancing of the Projects of the Juncker Plan, on those of the Structural Funds. This debate must therefore already be contained in the commission's first acts. Then we want more social initiatives. We loved that triple A. We want to work for that. We want initiatives for culture, for the social economy, for the withdrawal of foundations and finally, in relation to the specific points, I would like to link up with those environmental objectives that my fellow Members have already mentioned.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 1304, "date": "2014-12-16.json", "name": "Fredrick FEDERLEY", "mepid": "124989", "text": "   Mr President, I put my trust in Mr Juncker in the election of this House and I put my trust in the Commission.

That is why these Commission priorities are certainly a promising approach. I would like to highlight two priorities in the short ness. Firstly, as a new impetus to promote jobs, growth and investment, the investment package is certainly a very important and important stimulus here in order to restore confidence in the European economy as well.

Even today, we need evidence of a bold, dynamic but reliable European Commission, so my New Year's wish is that people not only in my country, Slovenia, but across Europe, should follow and co-create European policies with the same enthusiasm as we did a decade ago and more. If we fail, it means that we have not learned any lessons from the past: whether it be tax fraud, the rise of extremism, nationalism in Europe or the dying of desperate people in the Mediterranean Sea, because, despite the tragedies, we do not have a comprehensive solidarity and asylum policy.

The Commission would like to be political and ambitious, and I would like to see that, because it is desperately needed to seize that last opportunity for Europe. The question is whether the work programme for 2015 shows that ambition. That is why I am asking the Commission for three points of attention. First, 'better regulation' should not get bogged down in a discussion about rules. Better regulation means for me and for us a better Europe, a Europe that is understandable to all. Environmental legislation is needed to move towards a sustainable economy, and that is in the interests of all. I am also pleased to hear that we can expect new proposals for air quality and circular economy this year. Secondly, LuxLeaks has shown that it is seriously wrong with the income tax in Europe. We are now calling for a Commission plan of attack with more public access through country-by-country reporting, a blacklist for companies and more regulation to eliminate unilateral tax arrangements. Thirdly, Jean-Claude Juncker has promised us a Europe that will become Triple A in the social field.

Social protection is for me an essential right in Europe. In your work programme, you suggest that the issue of social dumping must be addressed within the framework of worker mobility and that the solution would be to combat abuse. But, Commissioners and Commissioners, social dumping is more than that: it is downright an attack on our European social system. It is the competition between workers, to which none of these workers wins. The best-protected workers are unemployed, while the least protected workers are exploited. SMEs are also not winners. Those in Europe who try to respect workers' rights are SMEs that are now bankrupt. Mr Juncker, neither you nor I were elected to destroy workers' rights or the fabric of SMEs in Europe. Therefore, the priority must, of course, be the revision not only of the Directive on the Detachment of Workers, but also of all the tools at our disposal to ensure that social protection in Europe is indeed a priority. The second point concerns maternity leave. We've talked about it before. I am delighted to see that the Commission will finally put this issue on the agenda and the Council intends to take its responsibilities.

Do you know which sector is the third largest in Europe? The one that employs 20 million people? The one that gives most SMEs a job, an opportunity, a margin? It's tourism. And tourism didn't make it into the program plan, as it's not mentioned. I know that we have little to do with it from a legislative point of view. But if we are talking about a united Europe, a competitive Europe, we cannot forget it. If we are to solve the problem of youth unemployment, we must turn to this sector.

But I see you now in your new role, and I will certainly get used to it very quickly. I have little experience in the European Parliament, and I am learning very quickly. I was a member of a national parliament for many years. I was elected six times. You get used to the way of working in a national parliament, and now I have to get used to the way of working in the European Parliament, which is different. For instance, I would have loved to answer Mr Farage, but he apparently did not have the time to wait for our answer. This is something I am not really used to in a parliamentary debate, but apparently that is the way we do things here. Secondly, a document was leaked last week. President Juncker and I were very upset about that because it really does not help us to work very well. What happens is that it creates a huge row in the media and you all react to that. Even today, many of you went into that leaked document. I decided, with my parliamentary experience, not to react. I could have gone out immediately and said: ‘This is bogus. This is not what we are doing. We have a different line and we are going to take a political decision on how we work’. But, out of respect for Parliament, I did not do that because I thought that I need to present the Commission Work Programme in Parliament and not in the media. So you are always fighting with at least one arm behind your back if somebody leaks a document and you do not defend your position when everybody here reacts to a leaked document. I would ask you, if I show the respect which I think I need to show to Parliament to present our plans here, then please also listen to what I say and react to what I say – not to what you have read about a leaked document in the press. It would make our work a lot easier if we listened to each other. I try to listen to you. This is what we have decided as a Commission, and this is what we are going to do. Indeed, on the environment, we are going to – as I have said, very clearly – maintain some existing programmes. We are also going to have an overhaul of the waste package, but to make it complete in terms of the circular economy and to make sure that it can benefit from the opportunities that the Juncker plan will offer in terms of investment for the circular economy. We will not lower our ambitions. We will not do that. We will not lower our ambitions in terms of providing cleaner air to Europeans. We will not do that. But we will change some of the proposals on the table, because we believe that either they are creating an unnecessary burden and we can do better in terms of the quality of the regulation, or the Commission needs to assume its role as independent proposer of legislation seriously by trying to bring the other institutions together to really make a decision on the quality of air. That is our role. That is what we will do, but as part of a positive agenda – not by lowering our standards. Likewise, on social matters, it is of extreme importance for this Commission that we do bring things a step forward. I was asked about that particularly as regards the Commission Work Programme Labour Mobility Package. We want to support mobility and tackle abuse, because there is a lot of abuse and abuse does undermine freedom of movement in the European Union. We also want to allow workers to benefit from openings for jobs in other Member States if that is at their disposal. How will we do this? We will have an enhanced EURES database on vacancies throughout the EU; we will update the social security rules; we will ensure better implementation of the Posting of Workers Directive so that it cannot be used to abuse the rules; and there will be – as we have announced – a targeted review of the Posting of Workers Directive, starting in 2015, to ensure that there is no place for social dumping in the EU, because we see social dumping in the EU today. Just go and talk to people in the transport sector and they will tell you that. So this is where our ambition lies. If we talk about the position of women – and this is extremely important – we are not just talking about what is morally right: that I, as a father, can absolutely not accept that my two daughters are in a worse position on the labour market or in society than my two sons. This is unacceptable to me. But there are also clear economic reasons. We are hurting Europe’s economy because we do not create a level playing field for women in the labour market. So we need to move on these subjects, but we also need to be pragmatic about this. The proposal for a directive on maternity leave has – for many Member States – already been completely bypassed by reality. It has been on the table – blocked – for eight years, so Member States have taken steps that go beyond what is in the proposal. We want to improve the situation, and if that means that we can do it on the basis of this proposal, let the other institutions show us and we will facilitate it. But, if it means that this is not going anywhere and we are not improving the position of women in the labour market, we will take other initiatives to make sure that we do go forward on these issues. Had Mr Farage still been here, I would have said that on one point I actually do agree with him. It is good to have a debate on things we agree upon. I would have told him that he is right when he says that there is too great a burden EU-wide placed on small and medium-sized enterprises. We need to do something to lift that burden on small and medium-sized enterprises. If you lift the burden on small and medium-size enterprise, very quickly they will hire one, two or three extra people, and that is a direct contribution to fighting unemployment in the European Union. In that sense, I thought that Mr Farage, for once, really had a European spirit. I am sure that he was not on tranquilisers. He would then have told us exactly what he felt. I think that is what we have learnt from UKIP these days, but I also want to engage him in this debate on how we go forward to improve Europe. I have one final remark, since this was raised by many of you. Of course there are many important issues. But just because an issue is important, it does not mean that Europe then has to act upon that issue. If we want to improve the situation in the labour market, and if we want to improve the social situation in the Member States, this cannot come just from the EU. The EU has a role to play there, but it is just as important that Member States actually take steps forward. That is why I would propose that the Commission and the European Parliament make an extra effort to engage the Council in these debates, because many of these things will have to happen in the Member States. Therefore, Member States, represented in the Council, will have to be engaged if we are to take these few steps forward. Once again, we have prepared the Commission Work Programme and decided it today. We present it to you today, and, as far as I am concerned, this is the opening of a dialogue. It is not the final word from the Commission.

To achieve this, the Commission should propose a coherent, complementary action plan to increase the Union's competitiveness. Two of its main parts should be the Investment Plan and the lessons learned from the review of the Europe 2020 strategy. President Juncker's investment package is a good starting point for boosting Europe's investment potential, but its success depends m.in. on the involvement of private investors, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises. We also need more synergies between m.in programmes between the Structural Funds and Horizon 2020. Although it is possible to combine funding under the programmes, it is not sufficiently practiced. More assistance is therefore needed for potential beneficiaries whose projects can be achieved through support from different sources of funding. Such projects both contribute to innovative solutions as well as to increasing economic and social cohesion. Furthermore, in view of the forthcoming review of the implementation of the Bologna Process in 2015, I hope that, as a member of the monitoring group for the implementation of this process, the Commission will propose concrete proposals to increase its importance and further development.

In Hungary, for example, indirect food VAT is 27%, and additional special taxes are added to it. As a result, traffic has decreased noticeably and operators are forced to resort to legal avoidance techniques. Another example from my country is that the overtrawing of tobacco products and the overhaul of the tobacco distribution system have caused a 40% reduction in turnover, which can be explained and demonstrated by the increase in the turnover of black market products.

Madam President, yes, the truth is that we have accumulated our work in the Committee on Budgets a little bit and that is why today we have so many reports to discuss and tomorrow we have to vote. The truth is that little or nothing would foreshadow that we were going to reach an agreement in time for the 2015 budget or for the much-needed 2014 amendings. And this has been thanks to the work and involvement of many of the people who are here today, in this House. And that is why I would like to begin my speech by thanking Commissioner Georgieva and her entire team, the Italian Presidency, mainly with Ambassador Sannino at the helm, and also all my colleagues, because we have worked hard over the last few months to reach this agreement. He said that nothing would foreshadow that we had an agreement in time because the positions were far between the Council's initial proposal and Parliament's proposal, but also far between the members of the European Council themselves, among the 28 countries themselves. They were distant postures. There were institutional misgivings between institutions, between countries, doubts in the figures and, moreover, money in between, which is the budget. And so we had an explosive cocktail on the table. Three main issues that we had to solve: how to end 2014, how to deal with 2015 and, above all, a plan to solve the defaults in the medium term. I don't think anyone is satisfied with the outcome of the negotiation. And of course, I, as rapporteur, can say that I am not. Neither by the figures nor by the functioning of the negotiations or by the lack of political content in the debate. But I also know that, after a whole year of work to reach this agreement and to achieve a budget, the last proposal we had on the table, and which today is what I am asking you to support tomorrow with your vote, is the best agreement we have been able to achieve. Because that agreement puts 4.7 billion euros more to pay for programs that were already implemented. That is, EUR 4.7 billion more for NGOs, so that they can continue to bet on those who need it most, for SMEs, so that they can continue to finance key projects for economic recovery, or for farmers who have been affected by the Russian veto, for our town halls and for our regions, so that they can continue to care for citizens. And because in the end, that is what a budget is about, in this European case: to serve citizens; either through scholarships, through infrastructure improvements or by providing quality food; helping five million refugees in the Middle East or supporting an innovative project by small and medium-sized enterprises; financing food banks or collaborating with projects against female genital mutilation or ablation. That's what the budget is all about. And in order for these projects to continue to be funded, we have fought from the European Parliament. Because the alternative to this was non-agreement. It was not having a budget for 2015. It was to miss the opportunity to use that extra EUR 4.7 billion thanks to revenue not provided for in the Union budget. A non-agreement would have jeopardized the investment programme which the European Commission has just presented to us, because it is 100 per cent based on the European budget. We know that that 4.7 billion is not enough, because the problem of defaults is greater. And that is why we have placed so much emphasis on seeking a commitment from the Council to be able to work since the beginning of 2015 on a real plan to tackle this problem. A plan that should go to the source of the problem. Because the Union does not have a spending problem: it is only 1% of gross domestic product. We have an income problem. And the solution is not to cut payments or reduce the budget. The solution is to increase the Union's own resources and therefore reduce national contributions. I regret that the financial transaction tax is currently frozen because no agreement has been reached in Ecofin. That is why I believe that the High Level Group of Own Resources is more necessary than ever, in order to provide resources for a strong, properly funded budget and, above all, to the protection of purely accounting sterile discussions.

Firstly, when I come to the other institutions, I am grateful that we can finally bring together the general administrative costs for the European External Action Service, finally be able to bring together transparently and sensibly, that we have agreed at the ECJ that we will finally seek a solution for the new judges, and thirdly, that we should also be able to achieve the whole rate of reduction, for the ECJ, for the EEAS. , have raised sensibly for the two committees again, and that we, as A Parliament, have also achieved synergy effects with the Economic and Social Committee and with the Committee of the Regions in cooperation, in fact what we have set out to achieve. In other words, the problems in the other institutions were not as great as in the Commission.\" In the area of the Commission, the old invoices have really plagued us the most, and I would like to say one thing above all: it is not acceptable that, at the end of the day, with the new budgets that we have, we should then, for the most part, only pay old invoices, and that, in doing so, we have actually developed the programmes that we have recently developed for months, some of them over two years. , which must start successfully, put the brakes on, artificially stop them, so that we are still able to guarantee the deadline for payment. This is a situation that is unacceptable. That is why I think it is a great success that we want to discuss the payment plan and the implementation guarantee of the multiannual financial framework together at least once and also to seek a solution for this. I hope that the Council and the Member States will be more present in these meetings – and I say this very clearly – than in the committee that we wanted together on the agencies, the analysis of their tasks and then the corresponding financial resources. I would really like to warmly invite the Council to take seriously the issue of the payment plan plus the implementation of the new programmes, because we want to move forward in this European Union.  The European Parliament has not been prepared to just demand more in a restorative way, but we have really met you and dealt with you and have also met you in some difficult situations. On the other hand, however, we would also like you to be equally accommodating to the legitimate concern that old bills must be paid, that they cannot be left behind and that the European Union should not be at fault, because that should also be your concern.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 1361, "date": "2014-12-16.json", "name": "Gérard DEPREZ", "mepid": "1473", "text": "  Rapporteur. Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, at the beginning of the negotiations, the European Parliament, through the Committee on Budgets, had set three objectives. The first objective was to stabilize - if not be able to reduce - the worrying, if not unsustainable, level of unpaid bills: 5 billion in 2010, nearly 25 billion at the end of 2014. First priority, therefore, to stabilize the unpaid. The second objective was to resolve the dispute between us and the Council - and the Council alone, for that matter! - regarding the budgetary status of special instruments, particularly for payments. The third objective, a key objective, was to agree with the other two institutions on the urgency of implementing a plan to clear unpaid bills to limit the amount to a sustainable level. What can we now draw from the long weeks of negotiation that we have had? I should point out that 'negotiation' is a somewhat inappropriate term, since at most meetings we have had to hear the Council say that it is not in a position, unfortunately, to reach a common position. With regard to the balance sheet and, first of all, the payment appropriations, the agreement provides for 2014 - and for 2014 only - an additional fresh money - fresh money as they say - of 3.529 billion, or two thirds of what we originally demanded. I should point out that we have committed ourselves to asking for what the Commission considered necessary - namely 4.7 billion in 2014 - to prevent the situation from deteriorating with regard to the amount of unpaid bills. With regard to the budgetary status of special instruments, the dispute between the Council's position on the one hand and that of the European Parliament and the Commission on the other, could not be resolved favourably. While a temporary, seemingly neutral solution could be retained for EUR 350 million of unused margin credits, the substantive issue has not been decided. With regard to the plan to clear the growing amount of unpaid bills, an agreement, which I consider to be genuinely positive, has been reached. The Commission will have to submit an updated assessment of the total amount of outstanding payments in March 2015 and propose other scenarios. The three institutions will commit to implementing a plan. And I will quote this sentence, which sums up the commitment we are asking the Council to formalise before us: \"This plan will be validated by the three institutions in due course before the presentation of the draft budget 2016\". In short, as is taken as a whole, the agreement reached between the two branches of the budgetary authority is, in our view, acceptable and deserves to be supported, as the Committee on Budgets did on Monday evening by a very large majority. Having said that, Madam President, I cannot ignore a few small mediocrities: 30 million here, 11 million there, in terms of redeployment, which the Council has made a point of granting one or the other of the recalcitrant Member States. This mediocrity does not grow, in my opinion, its authors. Nor can I forget the Council's obsession with access to the requests of either Member State to spread the supplement due under the reassessment, which it had accepted, of their GNI. A text is presented to us on this subject, of which I am co-forward with Mr. Lewandowski; I will leave it to him to present this text, which I will vote without raising an eyebrow because it is part of the agreement, although I think of the verbal gestures of the honourable Prime Minister who is at the origin of this misstep.

This week we are finalising a very difficult process of budgetary arrangements for the period 2014-2015, as part of the european Union's own resources regulation, as expressed by the European Parliament. I do not envy the participants of the concination, in which I did not participate for the first time in ten years. But I do not envy because there is always some additional circumstance of these negotiations, an element of the annual budget. Last year, it was the link between the annual budget and the arrangements for the 2014-2020 financial perspective. This year, this additional circumstance was a change in the calculation of payments based on gross national income and VAT, which also complicated the negotiations.  But from year to year there is one and the same problem, namely the draft budget of the European Commission is not an idea of the Commission, it does not come from a vacuum. It is a down-and-down, conservative assessment of estimates coming from 28 countries. Hence the frustration in the final negotiations, when this conservatively verified sum is then challenged by the Member States in the final negotiations. This year, an additional circumstance was indeed a significant change in the calculation base of gross national product and VAT, which for some countries meant good news – they had overpayment, for others bad news – they had underpayment. In the case of the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, these were large sums of money.  This problem was so absorbed by the Member States that by the end of the formal deadline for negotiations they were unable to reach their position, but at the same time they expected Parliament to have an urgent procedure, a hasty procedure for expressing an opinion. We have noted this paradox – on the one hand – of the budgetary delay and, on the other hand, of the desired haste, recognising the opinions and the amendment to the own resources regulation as part of the final budgetary arrangement. Today we have an agreement for the period 2014-2015 and we also have a positive opinion on the amendment to the own resources regulation. However, we are introducing two amendments to the regulation in the name of transparency of the financial and budgetary situation of the European Union, namely the mandatory notification to the European Parliament of late payments and the result for the European budget.  At the same time, we do not renry critical remarks about the budgetary procedure itself, and that is the content of legislative resolution. Namely, we draw attention to the fact that these statistical changes have been made by the Member States themselves, and in some cases this makes it easier for them to settle differently with the European Commission. The iron rule – as I pointed out – has so far been to make additional payments within 1 December. On the other hand, countries that are extremely inflexible and do not make any facilitation of the budgetary procedure have called for ease and flexibility, and in fact are also leaders in cuts in those budget lines that are clearly linked to the competitiveness of the economy, job creation and growth. This does not simplify the European Union's own revenue system. This complicates the system more, so the ultimate element of our parliamentary position is to recognise the High-level group on own resources to actually look at the system. The Committee on Budgets voted on this last week. We expect to complete the formalities in tomorrow's vote.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 1363, "date": "2014-12-16.json", "name": "Benedetto DELLA VEDOVA", "mepid": "4739", "text": "  Mr President- in-Office of the Council. - (IT) Mr President, Honourable Members of Parliament, Vice-President Georgieva, ladies and gentlemen, it is an honour for me to speak during today's plenary session for the debate on the political agreement reached by the Council and the European Parliament on the European Union budget for 2015 and the amending budget package for 2014. The Council has already formalised its agreement on 12 December and we look forward to the outcome of the European Parliament's vote tomorrow. As you know, the agreement was reached in a particularly complex negotiating context because of the many issues we have had to address. I believe that, never before have there been so many amending budgets to be adopted, and I also believe that we have never had to draw such a high level of unpaid invoices from the European Union, which has engaged us in an intensive debate at the end of which we have agreed, in agreement with the Commission too, to set in motion a path which will allow us to continue along the same path. , in the coming years, will enable us to bring the European Union's indebtedness back to more acceptable and sustainable levels. There were different points of view on how to reduce the level of non-payments and late payments and I believe that, in the end, we found a good compromise. I am therefore sure that the European Parliament also agrees that allocating AN EXTRA EUR 3.5 billion to the 2014 cash allocations is an important result for the functioning of the European Union, since the growth in the stock of bills to be paid is being put an end to and, at the same time, the foundations are being laid for its gradual absorption in the years to come. Specifically, the total amount for 2015 is 2 818 million euros, by activating the margin for unforeseen events, EUR 361 million resulting from the use of the margins available in relation to the expenditure ceilings in the 2014 budget and a further EUR 350 million, relating to the so-called special instruments that are added to the margin for unforeseen events, postponing to a later stage an agreement between our institutions on whether or not they should be included in the expenditure ceiling. I believe that this amount represents a fair balance between the public finance constraints to which the Member States are subject and the financial needs of the European Union for the implementation of its spending programmes. As regards the 2015 European Union budget, a total of €145.3 billion is foreseen in commitment appropriations, +1.8% compared to the amended 2014 budget, €141.2 billion in payment appropriations, +1.6% on the amended 2014 budget. The amount of appropriations thus identified allows sufficient margins to be left under the ceilings of the 2014-2020 Multiannual Financial Framework, to allow the European Union sufficient room for manoeuvre to respond to any unforeseen events. I am convinced that in these terms the 2015 budget will guarantee the necessary resources for the intelligent and effective implementation of the new programmes, given that this is the second annual budget, under the new Financial Framework 2014-2020. Just to give a few examples, I would like to highlight the payments for heading 1a (Competitiveness for Growth and Employment), where resources are allocated to research, training and small and medium-sized enterprises, which are growing by 33%, or EUR 3.9 billion, compared with the 2014 budget, including the adjustments made. The Eu ropean Union's foreign policy budget also received a significant increase in payment appropriations of around 8.5%. Other increases include additional resources granted in the area of external border control and migration flows, as well as newly established financial supervision agencies. As far as agricultural policy is concerned, the demands of the operators in the sector affected by the Russian embargo on EU agricultural products have been accepted, which will receive additional support financed from the increased revenues at specific destination, without therefore affecting the reserve for agricultural crises, which will remain available for any additional needs that may arise during 2015. I believe that these results should also be assessed in the light of the extremely short timetable we have had at our disposal to define the European Union budget for next year. After the lack of agreement in the conciliation procedure on 17 November, the Commission presented a new 2015 budget proposal and, on 28 November, proposed a new compromise on pending amending budgets for 2014. Nevertheless, we have managed to reach an agreement on 8 December in time to be able to allow it to be adopted before the end of the year and therefore to avoid the use of provisional twelfths at the beginning of 2015. The negotiations have therefore been very intensive and the achievement of the agreement is an extremely positive sign of the ability of our two institutions to find the necessary intense in the interests of our citizens. I would like to express once again my satisfaction with the results achieved and thank all the parties involved in the negotiations. In particular, I would like to thank President Arthuis, as well as the three rapporteurs, Mr Gardiazabal, Mr Hohlmeier and Mr Deprez, who have worked hard in the negotiations and have taken a constructive and cooperative attitude when necessary. I would also like to thank Vice-President Georgieva and his team for facilitating the successful conclusion of the negotiations with great impartiality.  I will conclude by expressing my conviction that the agreement reached with Parliament represents a perfectly consistent response to the three crucial challenges facing us next year: continuing to reduce the backlog of unpaid bills, not compromising the efforts made by the Member States to consolidate national finances and providing the necessary resources and incentives to promote economic growth and the creation of new jobs with benefits for all European citizens.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "NI", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Non-Inscrits"}, {"id": 1364, "date": "2014-12-16.json", "name": "Benedetto DELLA VEDOVA", "mepid": "4739", "text": "  Member of the Commission. - Madam President, thank you for the opportunity to address Parliament before tomorrow’s vote on the Draft Amending Budgets for 2014, the budget for 2015, and also on the Opinion on the amendment to Regulation No. 1150/200. I think we can all agree here that these have been particularly difficult negotiations. This is the first year of the new MFF. We have put into practice what has been designed for the MFF for the first time. It was also a time when we had to find ways to stabilise the level of unpaid bills, and it is happening when many of our Member States are facing very difficult fiscal situations at home, but we are all working very hard to find the pathway to an agreement.  I want to thank both branches of the budgetary authority for coming up with a sound budget that provides continuity and predictability but, more important than anything else, it sends a signal to our citizens that despite differences and difficulties, we can come up with a solution that serves them. It is oriented towards their needs.  Thank you very much to the Chair Jean Arthuis for his leading role in the negotiations; to the rapporteurs Ms Gardiazabal and Ms Hohlmeier, and Mr Deprez, and also of course my former Commissioner colleague Mr Lewandowski now sitting here, for all he has done in his previous occupation to help us to come to this agreement. I also want to thank the Italian Presidency. Minister Padoan came to us at a very critical moment. Many of you have worked tirelessly throughout this process, and now we have a solution that I hope will be voted through tomorrow because it is a very good outcome of the negotiations. Of course we in the Commission believe that what we put forward as regional proposals were sound, but we can live with what we have now and it is, as many of you have already said, crucial for us to serve our programmes and to serve our people.  Let me first say a couple of words about the 2014 Draft Amending Budgets. This is a particularly tough year from the budgetary standpoint because we simultaneously face pressure for payments for the last programming period, bills that are coming in the last year, and the adjustment to a tighter budget envelope for the new MFF, and finding an agreement on the additional needs for 2014 through the amending budgets, and in particular through amending budget 3 – DAB 3 – the mobilisation of the contingency margin and making good use of the windfall of revenues from fines. This was paramount for the successful outcome of the budgetary procedure, and I would say that it also paved the way for a decision on the 2015 budget.  We have heard the assessment on the numbers. Let me just add three brief points: firstly, we are also benefiting from some redeployments and transfers of appropriations to 2015 of a programme that has not moved sufficiently this year. That allows the total amount of money for reinforcement for paying bills due to go up to EUR 4.25 billion. Of those, EUR 400 million are for Heading 1A, EUR 2.85 billion for the backlog of cohesion policy in Heading 1B and EUR 750 million for reinforcing the international programmes to help us to help people around the world in desperate situations. On the 2015 budget, let me outline what we believe is particularly valuable in the agreement. First it is focused on investments in our core policy priorities. It underpins what we have to do to strengthen the competitiveness of Europe and of course underpins the EUR 350 billion investment plan that we have presented. Secondly, vis-à-vis the 2014 budget, we have a modest step up but it is sufficient to help us adjust to the two pressure points I spoke about. For commitments the increase is 1.8% – EUR 2.6 billion – and for payments the increase is 1.6%, which translates into EUR 2.2 billion. That allows us EUR 3.9 billion more for Heading 1A and EUR 581 million more for Heading 4 where the pressures on Europe are so strong. As the Presidency mentioned, we managed to meet the needs of our farmers affected by the Russian ban and by falling price levels in the milk and meat markets without tapping into the crisis reserve. We also have – and this is a very important point to recognise – a healthy development on the ratio between commitments and payments. For 2014 and 2015, as a result of what we have done, this ratio is 97% vis-à-vis an average of 89% in previous years, 2009 being 83% for example. What does that mean? That means that it will be easier to get on top of the issue of the RAL that is going too far and too fast for our budget comfort. We are very pleased with the demand from Parliament, which was accepted by the Council, to have a payment plan, because this would lead us towards sustainability and I can inform you already that the Latvian Presidency – the forthcoming Presidency – is taking this task very seriously.  I met with the Minister of Finance and also with the Minister of Foreign Affairs who will be the front minister for the Presidency in the next six months. The payment plan is for us to bring to an end what we have been experiencing this year in terms of unpaid bills. Our discussions in the coming months will also touch upon the issue of special instruments. In these negotiations we have agreed to disagree and leave the issue open. We placed EUR 350 million in special instruments above the ceiling for 2014 but with an understanding that this is not the final call, so we have to engage in discussing it and hopefully bring it to a final call. We, as you all know, in this period of time had to deal with the issue of exceptionally a large GNI adjustment, EUR 9.5 billion in adjustments, that had come as a surprise to some of our Member States. We have a very limited proposal for an amendment to address this issue and I want to inform you that eight Member States are opting for deferred payments as provided by the amendment. Given that, I hope Parliament tomorrow will provide an opinion on it and it will be a positive opinion. Let me conclude with three points. Firstly, we have a budget and now we have to make the best use of the money we have. This for us in the Commission is a top priority to focus on results, on the quality of spending. Secondly, we, in the midst of negotiations, had a meeting of the High Level Group on own resources – I am very honoured to be one of the three Commissioners now added to this group, which has very critical work which it has to continue to deliver on. And last but not least, we in the Commission – you heard it in the new work programme – are very determined to drive towards this alignment of priorities and budget so we can show our citizens that the European Union delivers where it matters the most to them.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "NI", "partyIdeology": "Non-Inscrits"}, {"id": 1365, "date": "2014-12-16.json", "name": "Jan OLBRYCHT", "mepid": "28288", "text": "  author of the draft opinion of the Committee on Regional Development. - (C) Madam President, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur Commissioner, i would like to thank you very much for Today we are discussing the budget before the vote and, in fact, we are very pleased that a compromise has been reached. However, I think we need to be aware of some relativism on this issue. It is better that we have a budget than if we had a makeshift budget. This situation is, of course, much better than the situation that could have happened. On the other hand, we are also aware that the negotiations have been very difficult, as the Commissioner has said, and there are some very symptomatic elements in these negotiations. Firstly, much of the attention has been paid not to the 2015 budget, but to the 're-election' of the 2014 budget. Until the last minute, we discussed avoiding disaster in 2014 at the expense of a very serious debate on the consequences in the 2015 budget. The situation was unusual because in previous years the discussion on 2014 was very detailed and started much earlier, and here we had a debate on 2014 with the post-2015 theme. Yet 2014 and 2015 are crucial for regional policy. The Commissioner spoke about the fact that 2014 and 2015, in accordance with the N+2 rule, are the end of the accounts, in other words all settlements, including demands for payment, come in 2014 and 2015. We are all aware that there must be more money. In other words, today's satisfaction with the negotiations is a relative satisfaction, but we should consider whether the system in this version will continue to work.

And let's not be afraid to call it debt, because that's what this is about. This enables the credibility of the Institutions of the European Union and the realisation of our priorities for growth and jobs. This agreement also stabilises the European Union's debt and avoids the collapse of the budget. So in 2014 we have around €4 billion of extraordinary revenueto meet the high level of unpaid. Extraordinary revenues from the European Union budget in 2014 were on the table, which were the result, inter alia, of fines. Without this agreement, Member States would receive this revenue in their national budgets, which was unacceptable, not least because there is a large amount of invoices already overdue and not paid as I mentioned. For 2015, we have also managed to minimise the cuts that the Council has proposed. In addition, we have strengthened our commitments with regard to programmes for jobs and growth.

The fact that, just a few years ago, the Council claimed that the Commission's figures on arrears were wrong – that is what we have done. We have also left behind the problem of resistance. Now the Council has come to say: yes, we are prepared to put fresh money into the European budget, because the payment crisis is no longer to be denied. That is a good thing, and we have made progress on this. But now we are in the phase where healing must begin. I am pleased to hear from you, Madam Vice-President, that you are already in dialogue with the Latvian Presidency, because the Latvian Government must now be the one to implement this, namely to give life to the payment plan. We in the European Parliament's Committee on Budgets cannot imagine this other way than that we receive a very regular report from you, Madam Vice-President, on how payments are developing. I hope that the forecasts are correct that the money that is now there will be enough to stem the payment crisis. But I am not very optimistic about that.

Madam President, I would like to thank the president for her I welcome the Commissioner, the representative of the Council, and I would of course like to thank all those who have been involved in drawing up these documents, although we in the ECR Group are not at all satisfied with the result. We will be able to adopt a whole package of measures this week. These are different budget additions for 2014. On the one hand, we are talking about aid in the event of a disaster, and it is also about technical adjustments. These are uncritical operations. We carry them with us. On the other hand, it is a question of financing outstanding invoices. This is important, of course, it is existential. But these compromises, which have now been drawn up, are far from sufficient. Payment of around EUR 4 billion is now foreseen. However, the EU has EUR 23 billion in debt. And debts in the form of unpaid bills are, as the previous speaker said, debts that we have to pay. We in the ECR Group therefore reject these additions. If we look at the 2015 budget, we must also make the starting conditions for 2015 clear: at the beginning of the year, we will have EUR 20 billion in debt. This will reduce the available cash from EUR 141 billion to EUR 121 billion. At the same time, however, we have provided for EUR 145 billion in payment promises to be made. I ask myself and ask you all: how can this bill be taken up? I dare say not at all, unless the EU enissues new rules of calculation. However, I would advise against that. If I then remind myself that we have already made promises of well over EUR 200 billion that are not yet due, then this whole situation will become even more dramatic. This budgetary procedure is far too complicated. We are talking about general reserves, special reserves, flexibility instruments, special financing, on top or not on top. None of this is transparent. This reminds me more of a language by George Orwell, who at the time had foreseen that politics would eventually speak in such a way that the citizens no longer understand it. When I see that the Commission's original proposal was EUR 142 billion in means of payment, the Council 140 says that Parliament originally had 146 – we have now returned to 141.

Madam President, let me first thank our rapporteurs, Mrs Gardiazabal Rubial, Mrs Hohlmeier and Mr Deprez, for thanking Mrs Georgieva, and for thanking the Italian Presidency, in particular Ambassador Sannino. We are on the eve of our budget vote. I would like to express regret and hope. My regret is about the way our budget procedure is going. During the three weeks of conciliation, except with the Italian Secretary of State, we were unable to exchange with government-level interlocutors. For twenty-eight MEPs mobilised, there was not a minister to answer them. It was not until the twenty-first day, the last day of conciliation, that the Council finally made us aware of its proposals, which were unfortunately unacceptable. The accumulation of unpaid invoices on the Commission's desk is close to 30 billion. This serious drift puts many operators in difficulty and undermines both the authority and the credit of the European Union. I would like to denounce the Paradoxical Attitude of the Council. Indeed, in 2014, the European Union benefited from unforeseen resources, up to a maximum of five billion, the result of fines and late interest. For Parliament, it was important to allocate them to the payment of the most urgent invoices. It is a basic principle of good management. However, we have been met with the Council's refusal. I was stunned by the autism of national governments that refuse to live up to their obligations once they have accepted the credit commitments. Absent from our negotiations, ministers look like good managers by refusing to pay what they owe us. Should they be reminded that payment is only the mechanical consequence of their previous decisions? In any event, what we were asking for could, at best, only have the effect of stabilizing the European debt. Where, for 2014, we expected 4.7 billion euros, we got 3.5 billion. For 2015, we were expecting 2.3 billion euros, we got 1.3 billion. That's a total of 4.8 billion euros instead of 7 billion. It is therefore clear, ladies and gentlemen, that the amounts on which we have sealed our agreement do not solve the problem. But what is my hope is the commitment on both sides to implement a procedure to clear the sneaky debt of unpaid bills. The first step is to know exactly what this amount is, as of December 31, 2014, and to agree on what can be considered the reasonable and sustainable amount. The clean-up will aim for the gap between the two and will have to be completed as soon as possible. This means that the appointment scheduled for 2016 to revise the multi-year financial framework should mobilize us from the beginning of 2015.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 1370, "date": "2014-12-16.json", "name": "Liadh NÍ RIADA", "mepid": "124987", "text": "  thar ceann Ghrúpa GUE/NGL. – A Uachtaráin, ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil le mo chomhghleacaithe, leis na rapóirtéirí agus leis an gCathaoirleach, an tUasal Arthuis, i gcomhair an méid oibre ar fad atá déanta acu i dtaobh réiteach éigin a fháil ar an scéal seo.

We also acknowledge that the agreement is certainly not one of the worst, definitely not in comparison to some other budget deals concluded during the last years. However, I believe that the deal does not allow the very difficult payment situation to be stabilised.  As Mr Deprez has already reminded this Parliament, we had three goals, three strategic objectives. First, to stabilise the payment situation, where we failed. Unpaid bills accumulated. Second, we need a differentiated approach on special instruments, and we failed because there is no decision. Thirdly, we needed a plan to reduce unpaid bills, and we failed because the written declaration does not seem to be so binding. Ms Gardiazábal Rubial said she is unhappy with the figures but that, nevertheless, we should vote for the budget. I do not think so!  My question is: why should we support that kind of deal at the vote and why should we be so very afraid of provisional twelfths? Au contraire, we should embrace the provisional twelfths because only that method will force the Council, the Member State governments in the Council, to understand finally the depth of the problem and perhaps even to move a little bit to solve it.

If we reject the budget tomorrow – and take your time, consider it again, consider it – if we reject it we will get one or two months of provisional twelfths but we will have a new situation concerning how this European Union budget is finally made, and the real role of this Parliament according to the Lisbon Treaty must become more evident.

We have always maintained our position during the negotiations. The clear problem to be solved concerns payments and, unfortunately, this agreement does not solve the situation at all, but even makes it worse.  In 2014 we got the union minimum but it was in 2015 that, in my opinion, the approach was completely wrong. It has once again been agreed to sacrifice the need for payments at the altar of political commitments. In my opinion, this is not serious: the figures for next year include commitments of over EUR 145 billion and payments of EUR 141 billion. The 4 billion that are lacking will therefore be added to the twenty abundant that the Union still has to liquidate today. Next year we will find ourselves in the same conditions. In fact, probably even worse. It is not possible to continue in this way. The credibility of the European Union itself is at stake.

I want to explain to you how this is seen in the United Kingdom. There is a perception that taxpayers are being asked to contribute more and more and that they do not actually get enough in return. For that reason, the recalculation of GNI and the extra British contribution of GBP 1.7 billion plays into the same feeling. It is within the rules, but a recalculation in which Greece and Italy pay more, and Germany pays less, comes across in a particular way to voters.  In May, over 50% of the vote in the United Kingdom went to parties which want less Europe. You may well believe that to be a minority view across the European Union, but it is a majority view in the United Kingdom. If anything, it underestimates the strength of feeling. Two polls in the last week both showed that 58% of those expressing an opinion wanted the United Kingdom to leave the European Union altogether. So this budget – back to the budget – is an elegant compromise but it is a compromise between the Council, the Commission and Parliament. I understand that it is a compromise that many, if not most, Members of this House are unhappy with, even though they may, when it comes down to it, vote in favour of it. But this is where there is a yawning chasm. A chasm between what goes on here and what is going on in the United Kingdom.

Thanks to the clear and strong position of Parliament we managed to reverse most of the Council’s proposed cuts and almost stabilised the current payments backlog.

This is a huge amount and we need a plan to reduce it. That is why I welcome the decision to draw up a plan to decrease this backlog. In this regard, I welcome Vice-President Georgieva’s readiness to cooperate with us in dealing with this problem.  However, some outstanding issues remain. One of the most important ones concerns the special instruments. As I am the Rapporteur on the mobilisation of the EU Solidarity Fund for advance payments for 2015, I can confirm that the Council still believes that payment appropriations for this instrument have to be within the margins of the budget. This is another way in which the Council is trying to further cut the multiannual financial framework (MFF).

Commissioner, i would like to thank you very much for Despite Parliament's tough stance towards the Council and the Commission regarding the combined consideration of as many as six amending budgets for 2014 and the 2015 budget, the achievements of the trilogue are not significant. Although the Council finally agreed that, under the third amending budget, the appropriations from penalties and fines should, instead of going back to member states' budgets, be used to pay outstanding bills, but this amounts to only EUR 3.5 billion out of nearly EUR 5 billion of all appropriations. The level of payments for 2015 has also been increased from EUR 140 billion, as the Council wanted, to EUR 141.2 billion, as proposed by the European Commission in its new draft budget. In total, therefore, we have an additional EUR 4.7 billion in payments, only that the amount of outstanding bills is approaching EUR 30 billion and these funds will only serve to improve the liquidity of the budget, and unfortunately not to solve the problem of outstanding payments. I am also very concerned about the Commission's suggestion that the so-called eur 480 million crisis reserve be allocated, after all, from non- or indirect non-agricultural subsidies in a situation where the Russian embargo on EU food is likely to continue throughout 2015.

My express thanks to the two rapporteurs. It was heroic. Researchers, innovation and growth in Europe will be grateful for this commitment. I would also like to thank the Commission for not buckling its second budget proposal. However, one thing has to be said: in the area of innovation and in many other areas, we are only dragging the problems behind us in payments of almost double-digit billions. We have reached a point where directors and directors-general must consider whether they can still sign contracts because they are on the verge of budgetary infidelity. This problem is stabilized, but not solved. I would like to make it clear once again, and not only in the context of the interest of the Horizon budget: if Horizon becomes a quarry either for saving efforts or for the search for new programmes, simply because it is easier to plunder the programme rather than to deal with the Council in substance, then I warn against the next round of budget discussions. Taking EUR 2.7 billion exclusively from Horizon 2020 for the Juncker programme is, in my view, frivolous. We are swapping investment for investment, and that will not lead to more growth in Europe. There must be burden-sharing if we want to make this programme, and the easy way must not be chosen again: if we take it out of a programme that the Member States do not allocate, then the political resistance is less.

What we have is not a budget of joy. We may be on the eve of Christmas, but what we have is no basis to feel completely relieved of the difficulties in front of us, because they are still there. But it is a budget of responsibility. For those who said ‘Why do we not just jump into provisional twelfths, let us forget about this budget deal’, let us remember two things: firstly, provisional twelfths would bring us a lower level of budget simply because 2014 is a so much lower base. But secondly, and most importantly, the probability we now have to secure the amount of money from fines with DAB 3 will be much lower when we cross into the New Year. Faced with this fiscal reality that we would be substantially worse-off – not only because provisional twelfths in the first months would mean a lower budget, but because the injection of fresh cash would be potentially lost or would be much smaller and unable to cure the problem in hand, which is to stabilise unpaid bills – I for one am relieved that the negotiators, the two arms of the budgetary authority, were able to secure this budget for us. This budget is not one of joy, but of responsibility. I want to stress four points here in closing. First, we are bringing the unpaid bills to a more manageable level. The accuracy of our projections still stands, we expect up to EUR 25 billion at the end of 2014. This is EUR 1.6 billion more than we had at the beginning of this year. We would have liked not to have it. We would have liked to stabilise the level, but at least we have a chance to step into the year less concerned about the mountain of bills than we would have been otherwise. Secondly, to those who have been speaking about the accuracy of our data time and again in the negotiations: I am very proud of my team, some of whom are behind me. We have shown that we are very clear; we know the numbers, we understand the trends and we are going to use the clarity of our analysis to underpin the payment plan and to ensure that it becomes a reality. Thirdly, I want to repeat once again to those who are worried about our farmers: we have found in this package a way not to dip into the crisis reserve. We are paying, without dipping into the crisis reserve, for the impact of the Russian ban and other events in the agricultural markets. Fourthly, some spoke about the Solidarity Fund. Since we have a deal, we can provide help to Croatia in the order of close to EUR 9 million, to Bulgaria for EUR 10.5 million, and to Serbia, a country that is eligible and is now in negotiations. But what is the most important point I want to convey? That I have heard from many of you a desire that we improve our budgetary process. That next year we do better, we engage earlier, we work harder and we reach a deal on a more structured, trust-based basis. If there is one thing I have been very concerned about during these negotiations, it is that they have shown a degree of erosion of trust, and we have – for the sake of our people – to restore trust. We have to build a budget that is more joyful. We need budget negotiations that are a more joyful event than those we are leaving behind. Once again, I would like to thank the Italian Presidency for its sweat and tears. Thank you to the negotiators in the Parliament.

Of all those of us who have intervened, I believe that there has been no one who has not referred to the very serious problem we have of defaults.  Some of us are more Europeanist and more enthusiastic; others are less so, but all of us who have spoken have talked about the European Union's serious problem of non-payment. And it is clear that, since 1 January next year, we have to put ourselves to work on that plan on which we have placed so much hope and in which we have relied so much to accept this agreement which , as I said in my first speech - is not satisfactory, at least for Parliament. And it is not because we really believe that the European Union can do much more with a better budget. And since I am European, and as I believe that the European budget can contribute a great deal to the European project, I am not satisfied with the agreement we have reached. But it is also true that, if it had been for some of us, we would not have a budget, we would not have humanitarian aid, we would not have Erasmus grants and, as the Commissioner said, we would not have even money to pay the aid to the 6,000 parades we voted for this morning in plenary, and I think we also have to be consistent with that work. So we've got a lot of work to do. I believe that 2015 is going to be a crucial year, because if we can implement a plan that really solves the problem of defaults, we will be able to deal with the coming years and the next budget negotiations in a better situation than we have faced this year. Because the worst thing, probably, wasn't the numbers.

Above all, however, I would like to add to the words of my colleague Eider Gardiazabal Rubial: in the future, we will be asked in Europe whether we are prepared to promote innovation, research, jobs and the future viability of the European Union.  We will not only be asked for old invoices. In other words, we must solve both problems: paying the old bill, but also the ability to innovate and the ability to channel our financial resources towards it.  That is why it is important to me that innovation programmes, and that an investment package, should not be at the expense of innovation, as Mr Ehler has said, but that we will use resources from other areas. And we will have to discuss it for the future. It is important to me that we in Europe – whether that is the case in the field of IT, in the field of future technologies, in the field of information technologies, in the field of aerospace, in relation to the independence of the European Union in terms of competitiveness in a wide range of areas – we should stand up. Elsewhere, competition is growing, and that is why we need to plan the budget carefully. One step has been taken, but many steps still need to be taken.

Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow the page will be turned, at least for 2014-2015, and regrets are no longer of any use. In fact, regrets are not a policy. In my opinion, the best thing to do now is to look to the future. It seems to me that there are three important things for the future. With regard to the immediate future, we have reached an agreement between the three institutions for the plan to clear the outstanding debts, within a time frame that has been set. We will therefore ensure that this clean-up plan becomes a reality and that all institutions live up to their commitments. For the medium-term future, several speakers have said this, but this is a no-brainer: the current system is gradually reaching paralysis and will lead to a deadlock, since it is based on the contributions of Member States, taken from their national budgets. The issue of own resources will become a political emergency. We feel that if we continue in the current logic, all the Member States will become little Margaret Thatchers, who ask for their money back, and gradually this will lead to a total impasse. For the more distant future, I have a concern: I am convinced that citizens' support for the European budget will not increase in the coming years, if we persist in the current logic. For the most part, expenditure and means of payment pass through intermediary institutions, which forget to tell citizens that the money they receive comes from the European institutions. I am convinced that, if we want to legitimise the European budget in the eyes of public opinion in the future, we will have to find a way - not for now, but it will be necessary - to establish a direct link, so that the European citizen perceives the effort that is made in common for the benefit of all.

One reason for this has been the burdensome rules for the vetting, approval and implementation of projects. A case in point is roadwork contracts in Malta. Though miniscule by European standards, they were subject to Brussels-based contract and award rules even when their size makes them unattractive to outside contractors. That lack of interest delays project preparation. Meanwhile, the need to follow to the letter Brussels-based procedures creates problems of compliance for small-scale Maltese contractors. So, projects are delayed. Costs escalate.

The draft budget for next year is therefore very important in view of the prospects for economic recovery. It is therefore essential that the 2015 budget includes additional funds to promote the functioning of the economy while protecting the most vulnerable social groups. It is good that the main allocation for this purpose is around EUR 67 billion, which will be allocated to growth and employment. Supporting the improvement of social, regional and economic cohesion should become an important element. The European Parliament should support these budgetary provisions, which will also increase funding for education, research and innovation, as their growth of 38% is projected next year compared to the previous year.

Eu ropean Union Member States alone have provided almost one and a half billion euros of humanitarian assistance since the start of the Syrian crisis in 2011. This is in addition to the EUR 666 million in humanitarian aid from the Eu ropean Union budget and provided by the Commission.  As honourable Members are aware, the Council has just approved, together with Parliament, the 2014 amending budget, making a further EUR 214 million available to the Commission's humanitarian aid budget for this year. Much of this amount is used for the European Union's response to the Syrian crisis. This is a clear demonstration of our commitment to providing humanitarian aid to those in need, particularly those affected by the Syrian crisis.  Yesterday, the Council adopted conclusions on the situation in Syria and we expressed our grave concern at the dramatic lack of funding in response to the UN's calls for 2014, which led to the temporary suspension of assistance to Syrian refugees by the World Food Programme – the World Food Programme – and we called on the international community to step up funding in the run-up to winter and in response to the forthcoming calls for 2015. But we did not just ask the others, the Member States were among the main donors who reacted immediately to the World Food Programme's emergency appeal for funding for Syria. For example, the Netherlands, Germany, Ireland and Belgium collectively contributed more than $14 million.  Together with the Commission's contribution from the Eu ropean Union budget, this brings the European Union's collective response to this emergency appeal to more than EUR 20 million. We welcome the fact that this has now succeeded in helping to fill the shortfall experienced by the World Food Programme and that food aid for 1.7 million Syrian refugees can resume as planned. It is tragic that in a crisis the size of the Syrian crisis there can barely be enough money to meet all the needs of internally displaced persons. Many of those who had to leave Syria often did so by carrying nothing but the clothes they were wearing. But we can certainly make sure that we do not increase their suffering. Reducing food assistance to those who have lost everything is unacceptable to the Council and to the Member States. In the Council we have coordinated very closely, between the Member States and also with the Commission, the response to this unprecedented crisis. We make sure that there is no overlap in our collective response as we try to fill, as best we can, the gaps in global funding. In this context, let me also point out that the Member States of the European Union are one of the main donors of the World Food Programme. Even before the recent emergency appeal, EU Member States had paid more than EUR 150 million to the World Food Programme in 2014, just for its action in the context of the Syrian crisis. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we believe that the World Food Programme is one of our main executive partners for the provision of European Union humanitarian assistance. Both as the European Union and as Member States, we have a long tradition of cooperation on a bilateral basis. We will therefore ensure, together with the World Food Programme, that appropriate measures are taken in terms of both funding and planning. We must ensure that shortcomings such as the one we have seen do not happen again.

There is no question but that the Syrian crisis is unprecedented. Both in terms of its humanitarian consequences and for its financial implications. An immediate reaction by international donors is a precondition for avoiding a further deterioration in the situation. A comprehensive response to the crisis cannot be built on our normal budgets. We must work together to make a strong EU response possible. We have a collective responsibility to find the means to achieve this goal.  The WFPʼs decision to cut back food assistance is a reminder of the overwhelming impact of the biggest humanitarian tragedy of our times. I want to underline that the EU as a whole is responding to the Syrian crisis needs. We are responding to the call by the WFP which has resumed its aid scheme to Syrian refugees.  I want to express my sincere appreciation for the broad support of this Parliament in this crisis. The European Union has led the international response to the Syrian crisis. We have provided more than EUR 3.1 billion.

The WFP is our second largest humanitarian partner after the UNHCR. We are fully committed to our partnership with the WFP. As a matter of urgency, we have allocated an additional EUR 5.5 million to the WFPʼs aid scheme for Syrian refugees. With this amount, our funding for 2014 is up to EUR 18 million, on top of the EUR 61 million allocated in December 2013. We will continue our efforts to mobilise additional resources. It is no accident that a few days ago both the WFP and Valerie Amos from OCHA, who is very well known, expressed their appreciation to the EU for our generous humanitarian support. It is true that the WFP has by far the biggest needs in this crisis, estimated to reach USD 1.8 billion this year. This amount goes beyond the USD 1.6 billion needs of the UNHCR. The fact that approximately only 60% of these needs are matched with funding is a major problem. Unfortunately the WFP is only one of the many partners in desperate need of funding. For this reason we have repeatedly warned the donor community that the gap between needs and funding is unfortunately not sustainable. Syria is the biggest crisis we face today but it is not the only crisis. Think of Iraq, the Central African Republic, South Sudan, etc. All of these crises have stretched humanitarian budgets beyond their limits. Certainly money will never be enough; therefore we need more cost-effective and more targeted operations from humanitarian partners. This also applies to the WFP.  This year we will finish with EUR 165 million in humanitarian assistance for the Syrian crisis. This is already less than half of the exceptional EUR 350 million we managed to mobilise in 2012. Next year our Commissionʼs initial humanitarian funding will be down to 100 million.  There will be additional money forthcoming soon. I will use all the leverage I have to achieve that. But my efforts alone, unfortunately, are not enough. We need strong collective action for next year. We expect needs of USD 7.2 billion for the Syrian crisis alone. This is a substantial increase compared to the record figure of USD 6 billion for this year. The Syrian crisis will remain a top priority in the years to come. The whole region is feeling its impact. We have to find ways to increase funding and make it sustainable, otherwise it will be a short fix. We must adopt a long-term approach. We must continue honouring our pledges. It is not only our moral duty, it is also a question of life or death for millions of Syrian refugees. As you know, a few days ago I came back from a joint mission with Vice-President Federica Mogherini and Commissioner Johannes Hahn to Turkey. There we also visited refugee camps along the Syrian border. The situation on the ground is overwhelming. Cuts in food assistance will be felt there first. It is our collective responsibility to stop this from happening. We must work together to avoid this situation. At the end of the day, however, what is needed for the Syrian crisis is a political solution. UN Special Envoy de Mistura has our full support in this regard. It is a support reflected yesterday in the Foreign Affairs Council conclusions.

One million and 700,000 refugees in neighbouring countries have used the UN's worldwide food programme, which suspended aid deliveries for several days in December due to a lack of funding.  What is encouraging is the fact that the funds were raised as soon as possible for the world food programme to continue operating. It also encourages the swift response of our Commissioner Christos Stylianides, who immediately announced additional financial assistance for this program. It is important to note here that the EU has settled its commitments to the world food programme on time, as there has been a variety of disinformation about debts under this UN programme. In this case, the European Union remitted the funds in time, but this case also underlines the importance of making timely funding in humanitarian aid. In many cases, people's lives depend on it.  However, other partners in the international community should also be invited to take more responsibility in the financing of humanitarian aid.

I have felt your support, and I thank you very much for this support in this very difficult job and in these very difficult circumstances. Let me finish with three clear conclusions of our debate today. Firstly, I repeat that the crisis we are discussing today is unprecedented, both in terms of its humanitarian consequences for millions of people, and, of course, its financial implications. It is a crisis that has enormous implications for Europe – for us. A comprehensive response to this crisis cannot be built on our normal budgets. This is, unfortunately, very clear. As you have already mentioned, a credible EU response is needed. We have the collective responsibility to find the means to make it possible, and we need to realise that if we do not invest sufficient funds in the region, the consequences will surely be felt far outside the region. My second point is that we are doing everything possible, within the Commission and together with our Member States, to respond effectively to the needs. The European Union, as a whole, has led the international response to the Syrian crisis. We are the leading donor to the Syrian cause. We must remain the leaders in this regard.  Thirdly, the humanitarian response cannot stand by itself. This is a protracted crisis. It requires an integrated response in close cooperation with development actors and national authorities. We are already working together with our development colleagues to better integrate the humanitarian aid with the resilience stabilisation assistance. On this, again, we need to find ways to step up our financial assistance. At the end of the day, the Syrian crisis requires – as you mentioned – a political solution. Unfortunately, the humanitarian problems need a political solution and humanitarian assistance at the urgent stage. We need to work hard with all actors involved to achieve this very difficult goal. I am sure that our support as the European Union to the initiative of Special Envoy de Mistura is crucial, critical and helpful.  Thank you again for your attention.

For Moldova, it is a breath of fresh air in a sector of vital importance for the Moldovan economy: fruit growing. Its importance, however, goes beyond apples and plums, as we shall see in a moment. It also serves as a practical demonstration of solidarity in the face of hardship.  The EU and Moldova signed their Association Agreement on 27 June 2014. The Moldovan Parliament quickly ratified it on 2 July 2014. As if by coincidence, shortly thereafter an import ban was imposed by Russia on agricultural products from Moldova. On 7 August 2014, Russia also imposed a ban on food imports from the EU itself in the context of the Ukrainian crisis, which, of course, is linked to the wider question of our Eastern Neighbourhood. The root of the problem lies in the fact that Russia sees itself, wrongly of course, as the object of some sort of geopolitical plot by the Western world. It is a conflict generated by a dramatic clash of world views. It is the 19th century fighting the 21st century. Blood, invasion from within, propaganda, lies and apples became the ingredients of a very strange new form of warfare. Seeking some relief, the Moldovan authorities have turned to the EU requesting urgent support to reduce the economic impact of the Russian ban, in particular for the most important products of Moldovan food growers: apples, plums and table grapes. The Commission decided to respond positively. The Council agreed and I hope we, the Parliament, will also give our blessing this week.  The ban is hurting Moldova’s economy in a rather dramatic way. Agriculture accounts for around 40% of Moldova’s GDP. Its horticultural sector alone employs a quarter of a million people – that is 10% of the active Moldovan population. Obviously they mostly live in rural areas and they cultivate small and medium family plots.  A few words on the legal context of this proposal: the Autonomous Trade Preferences (ATPs) are an instrument whereby a trading power, such as ourselves, may offer concessions to a country in order to support its economy without asking for trade concessions in exchange. ATPs for Moldova were originally introduced by the EU in 2008 by the very regulation that we are amending this week. The Commission now proposes to amend the ATP regulation by introducing three new duty-free quotas for fresh apples (40 000 tonnes), tables grapes and plums (10 000 tonnes each). The quotas will apply until the end of 2015, when the whole regime will expire.  The quotas for the three products concerned are extremely limited in volume compared to the potentially competing EU production. For apples, for instance, which is the most sensitive product, it is only 0.4% of our production, and they address very different market segments than most EU production. More specifically, in light of the cultural and geographical proximity with Romania, it is very likely that most of the additional volumes of the three products will be absorbed easily by the Romanian market. For apples, for example, Romania this year has a fall of 22% in production, and the quota under discussion tonight covers only 8% only of Romanian production. So there is still a gap there to be filled by others. A few words now in Romanian. Sper ca autoritățile moldovene să reușească să transforme aceste cote într-o poveste de succes, care să ajute cu adevărat fermierii moldoveni. Și aș vrea să fac un apel și la operatorii economici din România, să folosească această oportunitate cu deschidere față de colegii din Republica Moldova.

Honourable Members, whereas the current focus in the media very much turns around the events in Ukraine, there is, as you know, another very important neighbour to the European Union, which is the Republic of Moldova. That country faces the economic consequences of a political choice to sign an Association Agreement with the European Union.  The Republic of Moldova chose that its economic development should be based on European values and a deep and comprehensive free trade area with the EU. This was a choice in favour of us, it was not directed against anyone, yet products which were almost exclusively exported to Russia can no longer find their way to that market. The preferences under the Free Trade Agreement with the Commonwealth of Independent States that Moldova enjoyed in bilateral trade with Russia were also suspended for a number of key products.  We know that it is possible to maintain free trade areas with several trade partners at the same time, and that business makes the choice of the market in which it sells its goods and services. It is not and should not be a zero sum game, which is why we need to support Moldova, our Eastern partner. We need to help it not only in the process of implementing the deep and comprehensive free trade area – and we are already assisting Moldova with this – but also through any other means we have.  That is why the Commission proposal to amend the autonomous trade preferences regulations offers Moldova temporary additional relief for its needs, in undertaking efforts to reroute the exports of its apples, table grapes and plums. Anyone who trades with partners abroad knows how difficult it can be to reroute exports to new markets and find new partners there. So the proposal that you will discuss here today is a temporary measure, as the rapporteur so correctly said. It will expire in a year. The Commission proposes to apply it retroactively to imports from Moldova from August this year, when the first bans were introduced on Moldovan exports. The duty free quotas proposed – for plums, apples and table grapes – do not endanger the EU market, and that was also made very clear in the statement by the rapporteur. I am aware that there are concerns here surrounding the possible impact of this on our own farmers, but I am convinced that we can support and show solidarity for Moldova without any domestic risks. To give a concrete figure – others were mentioned before and this is another one – imports of apples from Moldova equal 0.8% of total EU production, plums 1.4% and table grapes 1.1%. So I think this is a good opportunity for us to show solidarity with a neighbouring country in need.

Russia, which is making efforts to seduze the Moldovan government and fuel separatist tendencies in the disputed regions. It is clear that Russian sanctions on the Moldovan agri-food sector are the same means of political blackmail as, for example, an embargo on Polish fruit and other agricultural products. Moldova will not be safe and sovereign if its economy is weakened or ruined by Putin's retaliation. On 27 June, we made a great commitment to say that we want Moldova closer to the European Union. The Russian embargo is aimed at the political and economic interests of the entire European Community and the aid will benefit Moldova more than the financial outlay of the States. The introduction of autonomous trade preferences for Moldova as soon as possible is justified by the economic and political interest of the Union.

But we must note the negative reaction of the authorities in Moscow to this process - a process that was in the mutual interest, both Moldova and the European Union, but it seems that this very fact that Moldova is going its own way was unacceptable to the Russian authorities and their geopolitical goal of dominance over the space of the former Soviet Union.  That is why in July they banned imports of Moldovan agricultural products to punish the disobedience of land they still consider their possessions from former Soviet times. Of course, such a Russian measure has had negative consequences on the Moldovan economy where the agricultural sector is very significant, and it is enough to mention the example that 10% of the working population works precisely in the horticulture sector. That is why, in such a situation, I think it is necessary to support the Commission's proposal by introducing three new products: apples, grapes, plums on the free customs regime of EU imports within ITM regulation.

I hope the Association Agreement will be an important instrument in providing for this – and I am personally convinced that it will – including by means of FDI, which will be able to reap the benefits of the huge single market. On enlargement, this is about plums and apples, it is not about enlargement. There are many, many veto players in the enlargement game, and there is no issue whatsoever of surreptitiously pulling Moldova into the EU by adopting a regulation on apples. That said, it is a free world and Moldovans are free to want to join Europe, and political actors and civil society actors in Europe are free to support their choice, so we will have a political and democratic process. Madame la Présidente, Monsieur Schaffhauser, on blâme la victime pour le viol. On évoque ici la négation de l'identité moldave, mais c'est vraiment du délire. Personne ne nie l'identité moldave.

Firstly, the majority of Parliament had decided that a country such as Ecuador, whose independent economic and social policies led significantly to the reduction and overcoming of poverty and reached an average income of USD 4 000 per capita per year, would therefore be excluded from the European system of trade preferences. This will be the case for Ecuador on 1 January 2015. Secondly, the Council and also the same majority in the European Parliament voted in favour of the free trade agreement negotiated only with Colombia and Peru, which was originally intended as a regional agreement and which, from Ecuador's point of view, calls into question its own development objectives. That is why President Correa wanted to conclude an agreement on cooperation and development as an alternative. Instead of working with all the Andean countries to develop common objectives, however, the European Commission only allowed accession to the free trade agreement as an option. Unfortunately, this strategy worked. In particular, the competitive situation, but – we must also point out – the change in the global economic environment for some of Ecuador's most important export goods has become so acute that the government under President Correa has now agreed to join the Colombia/Peru Agreement. However, this remains controversial in civil society and could put the complicated governing coalition in a difficult position. Do we want that? With this law, Ecuador is now building a bridge so that it can maintain its trade preferences until the free trade agreement enters into force. In the interests of the people of Ecuador, I am not explicitly opposed to the construction of bridges. However, I would like to point out that, Commissioner, in your current role in formulating the regulation, you have deliberately closed your eyes to the internal political situation in Ecuador. They have created a constant threat to be able to demolish the bridge at any time if Ecuador adopts regulations that could be detrimental to European exports. This is intended to strengthen the liberal economic part of the government against the left in the government. Unfortunately, my amendments, with which I wanted to defuse this conflict, did not receive a majority here in committee. A majority on the right of the centre here in Parliament has also willingly abandoned Parliament's right to veto a Commission suspension decision, despite the expertise of Parliament's Legal Service, which considered the procedure for a delegated act to be imperative. Personally, I also consider this decision to be a mistake, and I can only hope that it does not set a precedent.

Just a few years after having left the negotiations in 2009, Ecuador has now made an important and clear policy choice in favour of trade and integration into the world economy and global value chains. Last Friday, I met with the Ecuadorian Trade Minister, Francisco Rivadeneira, and initialled the protocol for the accession of Ecuador to the EU-Colombia-Peru Agreement. For Ecuador, this trade agreement supports its model of society and economic development. We will provide the country with an opportunity to diversify its trade and economy and improve the livelihoods of the population. We should support and encourage this choice, and it is in this perspective that we should consider the regulation as an important complement to the trade agreement. We proposed this regulation very rapidly after the conclusion of the negotiations in order to ensure that there would be no disruption in the preferences that Ecuador is enjoying today. I welcome the European Parliament and the rapporteur’s quick adoption, extending the preferences and thereby preventing a negative impact on the exports of Ecuador. Ecuador will, as you know, graduate from the GSP+ preferences at the end of this year, and around 60% of Ecuadorian exports to the EU benefit from substantial preferences under this scheme. The regulation that we discussed today will bridge the gap until the agreement fully applies, and that provides certainty and predictability to producers and workers in the EU and, more importantly, in Ecuador. If the gap between the graduation from GSP and the entry into force of the Agreement were not bridged, Ecuador would face a sudden increase in duties in January, only to see them fall back later on. A sudden increase in duties would be a lot when it comes to loss of market share, which is extremely difficult to recuperate later. We would be talking about increases in duties in excess of 20% for products such as tuna and shrimps, and an average increase of duties of more than 15% of all Ecuador’s export under the GSP scheme. I am aware that many Members in this House attach great importance to the implementation of this regulation, particularly when it comes to the requirement for effective implementation by Ecuador of relevant human rights, ILO, environmental conventions and international agreements, as well as the procedure to be used in the event that a suspension of preferences is warranted. This is also important to me, and I raised this with the Minister whom I met last week. Rest assured that we will monitor this and we will keep Parliament informed on the implementation of these provisions. We are ready to inform you, whenever requested to do so, and to ensure the required transparency in the implementation of the regulation, as well as to make use of the good practices that we are developing within the context of the GSP scheme.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Liberals and centrists"}, {"id": 1493, "date": "2014-12-16.json", "name": "Santiago FISAS AYXELÀ", "mepid": "96729", "text": "  PPE Group. – Madam President, Commissioner, thank you very much.

From next January, Ecuador will no longer benefit from the advantages offered by the GSP+ and this mismatch would cause serious damage to economic operators on both sides.

We supported his amendments in committee, but think it was right not to bring them back in plenary in order not to delay this process. The EU, as we have heard, is Ecuador’s most important trade partner for non-oil exports. Any temporary and unnecessary disruption in trade would have had a severe impact on Ecuador’s economy, and would most likely result in exporters looking for alternative markets with easier access than the European Union. Instead, with this bridging solution, we can continue to encourage and support trade between the EU and Ecuador in order to ensure that both parties are able to benefit from the future free trade agreement.

I welcome the debate today and the vote we will have on this report tomorrow. After our positive vote in the Committee on International Trade (INTA) last week, it is important to bring it to plenary before the end of the year. The approval of this agreement before the end of the year is important, as many economic contracts in Ecuador have to be negotiated now for the next year. I think that free trade agreements more than public debt can push Europe again into economic growth. I think that exports more than public deficits are a better way to recover our economic growth. I support the Commission’s attempts to open new markets and reduce tariffs and other regulatory areas to facilitate the entry into these markets for EU companies. In the International Trade Committee Liberals voted against the amendments proposed by the rapporteur as we believe that these amendments were risking delaying the application of this agreement. I fully support the extension of preferential access for goods originating from Ecuador before the FTA enters into force. However, I also believe this should be conditional on Ecuador showing a clear commitment that it will open its markets to EU companies.

However on the report as such, or on the matter rather, I am not completely happy because as the rapporteur, Mr Scholz, has pointed out, this is really showing how trade is not working for development, showing indeed how trade should not affect development.  Under the old conditions a regulation was put in place that effectively forces developing countries to make a choice as to whether they want to get rid of their preferred market access to the EU or sign up for a free trade agreement, even if that does not follow their development agenda and even if that is not what some in this Parliament, at least, think should happen from a developmental point of view. I think this is effectively blackmailing and undermining a society’s right to development.  This is precisely what happened here in Ecuador. Ecuador was forced to join the Peru-Colombia agreement otherwise it would lose its preferential market access.

On the other hand, it also sends a clear political signal to Ecuador and its people that the EU is determined to forge closer relations and to proceed swiftly towards the entry into force of the agreement itself. It can also help Ecuador diversify its economy and work towards further eradication of poverty in that country.  We are also making progress towards the entry into force of the agreement.

The last time I began he had not started and it seemed rude not to welcome him so this time I am going to welcome him to his position. And the reason is that I think there is a genuine feeling amongst the members of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs that we very much want to contribute to the internal security strategy. This is, at its very core, probably what we do the best, protecting our citizens, adding value to what the Member States do, but also understanding that this is one of the most dynamic and interesting areas. We have something of a clean sheet for the next four years. I understand that we have to fill this blank sheet, this gap. But of course it is going to be complex. We are dealing with some of the most dynamic and sensitive areas: cybercrime, cyberterrorism, the issue of foreign fighters and so on. I will say something about that in a second. We want to play our part and if I can leave one message it is that the members of the Civil Liberties Committee with their expertise and experience want to input into the Commission strategy. And we understand that this is a Council competence in so many areas but we have something to contribute. And we also have to contribute to the balance between protecting our citizens and understanding that fundamental rights are also extremely important in creating that balance. The security situation in Europe has changed dramatically in recent years so the European Union is confronted with the effects of new cross-border conflicts. New technologies are creating fast-growing new threats. This is even clearer when we think of those foreign fighters that have joined terrorist groups abroad and, of course, one day may return to Europe. This resolution is only the beginning of a process for a new, updated internal security strategy. With it we are launching an initial discussion on the features and priorities of a new strategy which will be released by the Commission next year. It sets out areas that the Civil Liberties Committee and the Parliament consider vital to take into account in order to improve and enrich the strategy. By agreeing on this resolution we are making it clear on the Parliament side what we want to see included, and this includes putting a stop to the activities of international crime networks and dismantling them, preventing terrorist attacks, enhancing cybersecurity, ensuring border security and increasing resilience to natural disasters. That gives a sense of the broad nature of this strategy but it also includes what we believe is our expertise in contributing to the strategy. The resolution sets out guidelines on exactly how we can respond to these threats and on what instruments should be implemented in the strategy. It is important for us on the Parliament side to understand that we need to make better use of those instruments that we already have before creating new ones, and this is what we say in our resolution. With this new strategy we need a critical evaluation of those current instruments, both at EU and national level, and we need to learn the lessons from the previous strategy before we embark on any new instruments or any new strategies. We need a more hands-on effective operational cooperation amongst Member States, for example more use could be made of existing valuable instruments such as joint investigation teams, and that has been said many times amongst the members of our Civil Liberties Committee. Of course, we need to take a balanced approach, which I mentioned at the beginning of my speech. In many security areas, for example, the right balance should be found between freedom, security and justice. We learned this from our surveillance inquiry; we learned it from the data retention ruling. I need not say too much more about this, but just to understand that these recent developments make us understand that security goes hand in hand with fundamental rights. But we also have expertise on the Parliament side in relation to cybersecurity threats and we can contribute richly to the many complex areas that are coming up in relation to foreign fighters, passenger name records and the many new complex areas where the members of the Civil Liberties Committee have very good experience, both on the security aspects and the fundamental rights aspects. When the Commission publishes its communication for a new strategy in 2015, the Civil Liberties Committee will react in order to promote a more substantial and focused debate and discussion in this area. Commissioner and Members of the Council in Office, when we add value to the internal security strategy I think the time for Parliament to stand aside is long gone. I think the members of our Civil Liberties Committee are poised and ready to contribute to this strategy. I think we have the experience to do it and I very much look forward to hearing the members of the Civil Liberties Committee give their ideas to you for this next four years, which I think are going to be exciting, complex but very worthwhile.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 1506, "date": "2014-12-16.json", "name": "Benedetto DELLA VEDOVA", "mepid": "4739", "text": "  Mr President- in-Office of the Council. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council attaches particular importance to the renewal of the internal security strategy. This has been a priority for our Presidency. I am therefore delighted to have the opportunity today to outline the Council's vision of the main priorities and actions of the renewed ISS. Considerable efforts have been made to ensure a follow-up of the strategic guidelines adopted by the June European Council, which called for the review and updating of the internal security strategy by the first half of 2015. Ministers' discussions on this began in July, with the aim of providing guidelines and a contribution to the European Commission, which is expected to present its communication on the renewed ISS in the spring. At the beginning of December the Council reached agreement on a number of aspects relating to the renewed ISS. These principles partly answer the question. The first is that the renewed ISS should identify the main common threats and challenges in the area of internal security for the coming years. The Council considers that these include organised crime and serious forms of crime, in all their manifestations – terrorism, radicalisation and recruitment of terrorists, as well as terrorist financing – the problem of foreign fighters, which has been recalled, returning fighters and lone wolves, which dramatically pose a particularly serious and unprecedented threat to the security of the European Union. The Council also identified threats arising from cybercrime and the use of new technologies in general, as well as the consequences of both natural and man-made disasters. The second principle should be the need to develop a comprehensive and coherent approach. This means involving a wide range of actors and integrating decision-making at all levels, from local to regional, to reach European and international level. Developing a coherent approach means that this approach should be global, multidisciplinary, integrated and intelligence-driven. The availability and exchange of information to combat transnational crime and terrorism will be paramount and we will have to pay particular attention to new technologies. Equally important is the dimension of justice. The coordination of investigations and prosecutions in the Member States must be encouraged and improved, including through financial investigations aimed at confiscating the proceeds of crime, as well as the efficient use of joint investigation teams and mutual recognition and judicial assistance procedures. We must also strengthen our operational cooperation and develop our border management capabilities; this imperatively requires the use of state-of-the-art technologies. A third key principle is the need to include the growing interdependence between internal and external security. The renewed internal security strategy will have to take account of the external security dimension and vice versa. The issue of foreign fighters is a clear example of external aspects having a significant impact internally. A fourth principle should be respect for fundamental rights. The strategy must contribute to a Union that protects its citizens, fully respecting their rights and freedoms, as well as those who are staying or visiting the European Union. It should also facilitate the promotion of social inclusion and social cohesion, last but not least. The renewed strategy should focus on implementation to implement existing instruments and legislation and strategic measures. The Council proposed that the Commission should submit an annual report to the European Parliament and the Council on the actions undertaken within the framework of the strategy. This should allow us to monitor developments and provide regular updates on the measures taken to strengthen internal security within the Union. It was also asked what timetable is set for the adoption of the new internal security strategy and how the Council intends to take account of Parliament's contribution. The European Council set a precise deadline for the review and updating of the internal security strategy, i.e. the first half of 2015. Much will, of course, depend on the ermpi of the Commission's communication, but we understand that it will presumably be available in the spring. I therefore hope that we could have a renewed ISS agreement by June 2015. As you know, the The Presidency organised, together with the Commission, a high-level conference on the ISS renewed in September 2014. A number of Members of this House have been invited to this conference, at which Mr Sleyley has referred to the fact that the Commission has not yet taken a decision on this report. Moraes was one of the main speakers. The results of this meeting have made a useful contribution to the drafting of the Council conclusions on the ISS, but we have also taken into account the Commission's final report on the implementation of the ISS, which in turn took into account your resolution in this regard. The LIBE Committee has also been briefed on developments. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me say that I await your views on this point with interest. I am sure that some of the recommendations in your motion for a resolution are in the renewed ISS. I am thinking in particular of the need to make better use of existing instruments before creating new ones, the need for a global, balanced and holistic approach and more effective operational cooperation between the Member States. You also referred to the importance of the judicial dimension, as well as to the need for proper democratic control.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "NI", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Non-Inscrits"}, {"id": 1507, "date": "2014-12-16.json", "name": "Benedetto DELLA VEDOVA", "mepid": "4739", "text": "  Member of the Commission. - Mr President, this oral question tonight is taking place under the shadow of an abhorrent crime that was committed this morning. I would like to express my sorrow and repugnance at the loss of innocent lives today in Pakistan. In a civilised world brutal attacks like the one today in a school in Pakistan are an insult to humanity, a crime against humanity, and to whatever human beings across the world hold sacred.  This horrific event and the ruthless murder of innocent children depict the abhorrent face of terrorism. Terrorism is a global threat, it is a global menace. In the European Union we are committed to the struggle against terrorism and we are working closely with our partners so as to protect the right to life of all peoples irrespective of race, religion or ethnic origin.  Honourable Members of Parliament, I want to thank you for having given me this opportunity tonight to reflect with you on a renewed EU internal strategy. The renewed EU Internal Security Strategy, the new European agenda on security, should be a common agenda when the security of our citizens, their rights, our democratic values, the well-being of our societies and our economy, are at stake. The Union’s institutions need to work hand in hand. We need to find the common ground on the main threats, principles and priorities when renewing the Internal Security Strategy.  The Commission sees a clear need to have all European institutions working together to formulate and, secondly, implement the future European agenda on security and wishes to facilitate this process.  In reviewing the Internal Security Strategy the Commission will build firstly on the preparatory work undertaken in the course of this year; secondly, on the Justice and Home Affairs Council conclusions adopted on 5 December; thirdly, of course, on the resolution Parliament intends to adopt tomorrow. These contributions will guide our work for the months to come.  I suggest that once the Commission communication has been issued, Parliament and the Council engage in a dialogue to find common ground on the future of European security to provide effective, swift, practical and achievable solutions.  Your resolution sets out a broad security approach based on fundamental principles, instead of listing specific legislative and policy actions. This corresponds with the ambition of the Commission to provide a strategy-driven agenda which will connect to existing or already envisaged measures.  The resolution also highlights the importance of finding a balance between continuity and change. We need to foster and strengthen what works, and adapt things where evolving or expected developments require new actions or the revision of existing ones. The implementation of legislation and the consolidation of achievements, as well as enhanced practical cooperation, will be priorities for future work. Consequently, monitoring and evaluation of the effectiveness of legislation and policies is essential. 1 December 2014 heralded the era in which justice and home affairs policies were finally set on an equal footing with other EU policies, thanks to the full application of the judicial review by the Court of Justice and the enforcement powers of the Commission. This will benefit the required monitoring and evaluation and will enhance citizens’ rights and legal security.  Close monitoring of the implementation of newly adopted instruments on the procedural rights of defendants and victims’ rights and on improved application of existing instruments on judicial cooperation in criminal matters will strengthen the judicial dimension of the Internal Security Strategy, a point which has also been highlighted by your resolution.  The Commission intends to continue to submit regular reports to Parliament and the Council on actions taken under the European agenda on security. This would assist you in monitoring the implementation of the strategy and will strengthen its democratic oversight.  As regards the content of the European agenda on security, the Commission cannot at this stage go into the details of what its future communication will set out. However, there is no doubt that we have to continue to fight international and cross-border crime, prevent terrorism, address radicalisation and recruitment, work against cybercrime, protect children from abuse, and increase Europe’s resilience to crises and disasters. This is not new. What is new is that the actions currently covered have to be adapted to address evolving challenges and threats.  The actions should be based on an intelligence-led approach providing guidance on how to effectively tackle rapidly evolving security challenges. A coherent set of risk and threat analyses by Europol and other relevant European Union institutions and bodies, in close cooperation with the Member States, should operationalise this approach. This requires close strategic and operational cooperation, and the exchange of information between law enforcement, judicial authorities and EU agencies is fundamental. We have to work more closely on prevention and protection. Access to information and information exchange, innovation and research will ensure a clearer link with the external dimension and cooperation. A citizen-centred approach and the integration of fundamental rights in all actions should be the guiding principles of the European Agenda on Security.  The Commission will be particularly attentive to the implementation of all envisaged measures and instruments and will assess their compatibility with fundamental rights as enshrined in the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights. Respecting the Charter requires that measures which interfere with fundamental rights are proportionate. In the context of that balance, fighting threats to public safety or indeed the fundamental rights of others are legitimate objectives.  Trust and confidence in the institutions is also a matter of concern. Security policies must be seen as serving citizens to keep legitimacy and support. Citizens need to be better informed of the problems, and the implementation of internal security policies is not only essential for making instruments effective but also to strengthen the credibility of the institutions in the eyes of citizens and demonstrate to victims that action is taken. To ensure that EU internal security also means acting beyond EU borders and in cooperation with third-country partners, important steps to integrate external and internal security measures have already been taken. These are, for example, the establishment of the Cyber Security Strategy. But much more needs to be done and those measures need to be followed up and further put into practice; for instance, by strengthening the operational link between the EUʼs internal and external security policies.  I fully support the emphasis that you have put on having an integrated, comprehensive and holistic approach to priority areas. Different policies and actions, going beyond the public sector too, need to be integrated if we wish to tackle security concerns in all areas effectively while facing financial constraints and safeguarding fundamental rights. The renewed EU agenda on security could also benefit from research and innovation. The European Union needs to continue mobilising the tools essential for security preparedness and resilience, in particular information and communication technologies and technologies in the forensic field, whilst respecting fundamental rights. It could consider using its research and innovation programme Horizon 2020 and pursue cooperation between law enforcement and the private sector, notably to develop more technological autonomy. Finally, increased legitimacy in the eyes of European citizens requires the full association of this Parliament and the involvement of national parliaments. In addition to former reports on the progress of the strategy’s implementation, the Commission is committed to engaging in regular dialogue with this Parliament and to debating relevant matters with national parliaments. I look forward to working together with you in the Council on this new European agenda on security.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "NI", "partyIdeology": "Non-Inscrits"}, {"id": 1508, "date": "2014-12-16.json", "name": "Monika HOHLMEIER", "mepid": "96780", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Mr President, Commissioner, Secretary of State, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his excellent work and for the work she has said.

We had a committee here in the last parliamentary term, the so-called CRIM Committee, which dealt with international organised crime and its europe-wide and also global networking. It is frightening to see what is happening in this context. We are confronted with increasing international terrorism and extremism, which, as is now being demonstrated in Pakistan, puts us in horrible situations. We have now reached a level of cybercrime in which international networks challenge us on a daily basis and the normal bank robbery has become a small dimension compared to the billions of dollars in damage that are taking place on the Internet every day. We will indeed have to make better use of existing instruments, as Claude Moraes has said, because if administrative assistance, in part, still takes months today, then this is far too slow for the criminals. We will need to be faster, more flexible and better coordinated.

To begin with, because it must contemplate this disturbing assembly of new threats arising from cyber security, the mutant characterization of international terrorism, the extremely aggressive nature of cross-border crime and, above all, the mixing of security threats with those arising from natural events or disasters. That is why we are obliged, in this European Parliament, to add value to the definition of the situation and the strategic response of the European Internal Security Strategy for the coming years 2015-2019.  It is time for us to recognise that, in the face of this drastically changing security situation in Europe, all available resources must first be optimised. It has already been said: joint investigation teams, security in police cooperation, reinforcement in judicial cooperation, in intelligence, in the effort to share all available information. But it is also time to say that all this must be done in coherence with the values proclaimed by the European Union, by the Lisbon Treaty, by the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, which means an effort to consistent with the value of fundamental rights, in particular data protection , in particular the Data Protection Directive, which is under way in this European Parliament, and the case-law of the European Court of Justice interpreting it.

Since we adopted the previous Internal Security Strategy, the Lisbon Treaty has come into force and the Charter of Fundamental Rights is now incorporated in European Union law.

Furthermore, the phenomenon of enormous proportions of terrorists, fighters of Allah, returning, those good gentlemen who, after becoming terrorists and warriors of Allah by profession, return, perhaps to Milan, Paris, Vienna, London, and we must welcome them, open the doors to them: let us establish a European register of qualified terrorist!

A common Europe needs a common policy through increased police and judicial cooperation in a spirit of European solidarity.

In order to achieve a high level of security, however, we need, above all, appropriate framework conditions, confidence in the rule of law, which will only arise if the institutions of law enforcement function.

The next step must be taken – a package of legislative directives, regulations in order to maximise harmonisation and convergence of criminal law in the Member States.

The second problem – the security of the external borders. In the last four years, new dangers have emerged. Who could have foreseen in 2010 the huge waves of refugees, the attempts of terrorists to take advantage of illegal channels, sewers, foreign fighters?

Online services offered to criminal organisations are flourishing, making them difficult to detect and costing the world economy almost €250 billion a year. We must have an answer to the new patterns of action of criminals. One of them is the development of \"security by design\": the introduction of security solutions during the development of new products and services.

I therefore call on the European Commission to carry out a thorough analysis of the current ISS instruments and to propose their effective use in the new security strategy. At present, the security issue is taking on new dimensions, not only because of the conflicts in our immediate neighbourhood, but also because of the dangers within the European Union – the growing radicalisation associated with terrorism and violence. According to the latest statistics, more than 3,000 Europeans are fighting foreign conflicts. And I'm asking, how did these people get there? We need to break the network, the tentacles, the octopus that operates here in the European Union and is gaining new members through the Internet for these activities in foreign countries. And this is one of the fundamental priorities not only of the European people, but I think of all the smart people who sit in this hall.", "language": "en", "original_language": "cs", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 1528, "date": "2014-12-16.json", "name": "Angel DZHAMBAZKI", "mepid": "124873", "text": "  Dear Mr President, Honourable Commissioner, Honourable Representative of the Council, Colleagues, I have read in detail the findings of the report on the implementation of the European Union Internal Security Strategy 2010-2014 and believe that the assessment cannot be positive alone.

I would say that I start with a basic point: that, in general, we all agree that security today is one of the main priorities, not only for Europe but also for the whole world. What we must note, however, is that this debate and the initiative we have taken to adopt a new European security agenda comes at a particularly critical time for both Europe and the whole world: new forms of security threat are emerging, which is also a fundamental right and protected by democracy, by respect for fundamental rights. , from the conquests of the civilized world, from respect for human dignity. And Europe has built on these principles. The fact that there has not been an integrated coherent security policy is due to the fact that others have been the forms of threat in the past and others now. As I said before, we have the obvious threat of terrorism, which we do not know when and where it will strike, and we are living it these days: organised crime, human traffickers and traffickers, the circuits, the drug traffickers. All this is combined. There are not a few cases in some corners of the world where organised crime is tied to terrorism. And the organised states, despite having means and capabilities, have not been able to crack down on this phenomenon. One of the fundamental rights which Europe and the free world have conquered with great sacrifice is therefore protected from this internal security agenda. I would like to reiterate once again that the policy we aspire to adopt will in no way lead Europe to isolationism. I have said this characteristically: we do not want a Fortress Europe. Europe must be open. Nor should we combine immigration with terrorism, because this perception in the past has led to the wrong policies, too many times. And I would remind you once again in this Chamber that all those of us in this area come from immigrant nations, so the whole approach must be based on completely different criteria. But we do not lack courage or determination. I have listened very carefully to what you have said. And I will take them very seriously in drawing up our final proposal. Many discussions will follow and I am sure that through this space perhaps one of the most important policies will emerge that will ensure peace, certainty, security, the free exercise of human rights for all the peoples of Europe and through this message Europe will be a world leader in the war against terrorism and any form of threat designed to strengthen the foundations of world democracy.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 1530, "date": "2014-12-16.json", "name": "Benedetto DELLA VEDOVA", "mepid": "4739", "text": "  Mr President- in-Office of the Council. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Council attaches particular importance to Parliament's views, of course, and we have taken note of the arguments that have emerged during the debate.

Challenges and measures for action must be evidenced based and this requires a pooling of resources that include information. Understandably security policy requires the collection of data, yet this is to be done in strict adherence to principles of data protection and in full respect of human rights. Organised crime such as human trafficking and human smuggling is not a new issue of security, yet the EU has so far not been able to address this effectively. This has increased migration flows and made the EU Mediterranean border a deadly space. This clearly indicates that closer cooperation among Member States and with third states and non-EU related bodies is key and that an internal security system is only effective if it recognises that it depends also on foreign and security policy. An EU security strategy fighting organised crime requires effective preventive measures rather than merely repressive ones. It also requires full respect for the dignity of victims.

A reality which means that the security situation in Europe changed significantly in the last years. Many of today’s security challenges are cross-border and as such go beyond the capacity of one individual Member State to respond to them effectively. The EU urgently needs a holistic approach in order to address these rapidly changing security threats including foreign fighters and cyber-security threats. It is imperative that the EU protects all individuals, especially the most vulnerable ones, and focuses in particular on the victims of crime and terrorism. In this day and age the interdependence between internal and external security is constantly growing and the renewed EU Internal Security Strategy should also take into account the external security dimension. As part of the EU’s external policies due consideration should be given to migration and refugee policies, cooperation with third countries in tackling criminal phenomena and establishing an effective common return policy whilst enforcing readmission obligations in agreements with third countries. Furthermore, terrorism in all its forms remains a significant and ever-evolving threat to the EU’s internal security. For these reason that I call for a forward-looking and strategic ISS.

The data presented by the Commission in its latest report on the implementation of the ISS certainly bear witness to a commendable commitment, but unfortunately the reality is different and often not very encouraging: just think, for example, of the EU's inability to adequately cope with the trafficking of human beings that takes place on a daily basis in the Mediterranean, and the harmful consequences in terms of criminal economies linked to the management of migrant reception systems.
