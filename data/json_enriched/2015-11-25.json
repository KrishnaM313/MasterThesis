Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, you have just recalled this new barbaric act which was committed in Tunis and I think that the Council is absolutely joining you in condemning this cowardly attack and expressing our sympathy, all our thoughts to the courageous Tunisian people. In the same way, I would like to reiterate our thoughts of sympathy for the victims, their families, the city of Paris and all the other victims of terrorism, and you have spoken about it. Today, more than ever, we need solidarity in the face of this scourge of terrorism.  A decided action, capable of defending our freedoms, our values, but also the security of our fellow citizens. We need the broadest and most intense European cooperation possible, and it must involve all those who are ready to engage with us in this relentless fight against those who sow terror by blindly killing. Never before have we needed a strong and determined Europe, capable of acting in a fast, coordinated and solid way. The Presidency, after the Paris attacks, immediately convened an extraordinary \"Justice and Home Affairs\" Council on 20 November, after which ambitious actions were decided. The Council has decided to confirm its commitment to counter-terrorism with a focus on operational measures. It is essential to mobilize all energies to achieve results and make our societies safer. Let me now elaborate on the measures that have been taken.  With regard to the NRL, the Council aims to quickly achieve the implementation of this scheme at European level. The Presidency hopes to reach an agreement with Parliament at the next trilogue and we are fully aware of the importance for you of concluding the negotiations on the data protection package. The Presidency reiterates its commitment to finalize the negotiations before the end of the year.  With regard to the trafficking of firearms, the Council is trying to combat illegal arms trafficking more effectively within the European Union, drawing on revised texts and operations carried out within the framework of the so-called political cycle of the European Union to combat serious international organised crime. The Presidency will begin discussions on the Commission's proposal for a revision of the Firearms Directive, which the Commission has just presented, as early as this week.  With regard to the strengthening of external border controls, Member States are committed to immediately implementing the necessary systematic and coordinated controls at external borders, including on those enjoying the right to free movement. The terrorist at the Jewish museum in Brussels had a European passport, the terrorists who acted in Paris in January, Copenhagen and again in Paris on 13 November had European passports for some of them. I call on Parliament to take into account this reality and the expectations of our fellow citizens.  A modernization of the border control systems of Schengen member states will be implemented by March 2016. For third-country nationals, Member States will systematically register, including fingerprinting, third-country nationals entering the Schengen area, and carry out systematic security checks using the relevant databases. Finally, Member States will strengthen the controls at the most exposed external borders, including deploying, where the situation requires, rapid border response teams and police officers to ensure that screening and security checks are carried out in a systematic manner.  With regard to the exchange of information, the Council is committed to implementing a series of actions aimed at using the tools put in place to the maximum of their capabilities and enabling the most effective cooperation possible. Member States will thereby ensure that national authorities systematically introduce data on all suspected foreign terrorist fighters into the SIS II database.  The Council welcomes the establishment of the European Counter-Terrorism Centre within Europol on 1 January. The new Europol regulation, on which we hope to reach an agreement without delay, should be consistent with the mandate and objectives of the centre, including the internet content reporting unit. Member States will deploy counter-terrorism experts to the centre to form a enhanced unit to support cross-border investigations capable of providing rapid global support to investigators in the event of a major terrorist incident in the European Union.  The Council calls on the Commission to present a legislative proposal to allow Europol to systematically cross-reference its databases with those of SIS II. In terms of combating the financing of terrorism, the Council called on the Commission to put forward proposals to strengthen, harmonize and improve the competence and cooperation of financial intelligence cells, and to ensure that these cells have timely access to the necessary information in order to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing. The Council also recommends strengthening control of non-bank payment methods.  As part of the judicial responses to terrorism and violent extremism, the Council welcomes the signing by the Eu in Riga on 22 October of the Council of Europe Convention on the Prevention of Terrorism and its additional protocol on foreign terrorist fighters. It welcomes the Commission's intention to present a proposal for a directive updating the framework decision on the fight against terrorism before the end of this year. The Commission also recommends improvements to the Criminal Records Information System (ECRIS) and preventive actions.  All of these measures require a demanding follow-up; Council will take care of that. Our firm and determined response must be done calmly, in accordance with fundamental rights and in accordance with our charter, which remain our guiding principles.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 3, "date": "2015-11-25.json", "name": "Jean-Claude Juncker", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President of the Commission. Mr President, Mr President of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, we will remember this Friday 13 November, the day when an unrelenting fate has descended on the City of Lights. So many destroyed biographies, unfinished dreams, interrupted journeys, and unenforceable plans and projects.  We share the mourning of the French and we will support the reaction of the Republic. Today, even more than tomorrow, I say \"Long live France and its Republic\", which is also ours. (Applause) I would like to repeat to this high house what I said immediately after the terrible attacks in Paris. I warn against dangerous, pernicious amalgamations of putting refugees, asylum seekers, migrants and terrorists on an equal footing. Those who perpetrated and fomented the attacks in Paris are exactly the same people who force the unfortunates of this planet to flee. No amalgam! (Applause) We must not turn misfortunes into oratory effects. We must not give in to this temptation, in fact dramatically ridiculous.  I mean here that we must safeguard the spirit of Schengen. Yes, the Schengen system is partly comatose and those who believe in Europe, its values, its principles and its freedoms will have to try - and they will do - to resuscitate the spirit of Schengen. If the spirit of Schengen leaves our territories and our hearts, we will lose more than Schengen. A single currency makes no sense if Schengen falls. It should be noted that Schengen is not a neutral concept, an innocuous concept, but that it is one of the centrepieces of European integration. I would like, once again, to appeal to the Member States to do what they have promised. President Schmit this morning elegantly recalled a number of decisions carried out by the Council and the Member States. We must continue in this direction and the Commission will do everything in its way to ensure that the Member States are made to remember their commitments. We will have to see better than before the immediate neighbours of the European Union. The collective performance of Jordan and Lebanon is admirable, so we must assist with enthusiasm the peoples in question who bear a heavy burden in the context of the refugee crisis. We tend to focus on our cooperation with Turkey. We mustn't forget the others. That is why, months ago, the Commission proposed, and the Council had adopted, the establishment of a trust fund for Africa, which covers EUR 1.8 billion. It was a decision that was not taken, as is often said and as can be read almost every day, at the valletta summit. This is a decision that the Member States, on the basis of a Commission proposal, had taken several weeks earlier, with this additional remark which Member States have committed to provide themselves with an additional EUR 1.8 billion to bring this trust fund to Africa to EUR 3.6 billion.  We intend to ensure that the promises are fulfilled and we are grateful to the Luxembourg Presidency, whose speed we welcome, for moving forward with the revision of the European legislation on firearms, and in particular on the deactivation of it. We in the Commission believe, as do others, that the European Passenger Register should be set up, including for intra-European flights. I am aware that this proposal will raise many questions, but it is clear that the PNR must also find application with regard to intra-European flights. I believe that the Secret Service needs to cooperate better. Together with Guy Verhofstadt, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Belgium at the time, we attended two or three European Councils after the attacks in New York. Already, a week after the attacks in New York, we, the heads of state and government, had promised ourselves that the Secret Service would function better and in a concerted way. This was not the case. Today, we are told that the Secret Service must cooperate in the best possible way. I would like us to achieve this necessary cooperation between the secret services this time.  (Applause) In keeping with President Schmit's remarks, I would like to confirm that in December the Commission will propose a text on the creation of a border guard and coastguard corps, which is a necessity to better protect our external borders. On Sunday, a summit will be held with the 28 Member States and Turkey, which will focus on the refugee crisis. I'd like to to pay tribute here to First Vice-President Timmermans for a remarkably well-conducted work, when, on three occasions, I believe, he went to Turkey to discuss with the Turkish authorities the ways of cooperation that we can establish with that country. We will adopt a joint action plan with Turkey and, for the rest, we are negotiating the details of these arrangements.

When I came home on friday night after an appointment, I was actually looking forward to a football match between Germany and France and then, like all of us, I was shocked when I turned on the TV and saw the pictures from Paris. We are all deeply saddened and in mourning. First of all, our thoughts are with the victims. Unfortunately, God's often talk too quickly about the perpetrators and too little about the victims. That is why our thoughts are first and all with the victims and their families. (Applause) It is prudence and determination is needed. First of all, prudence. When I saw the pictures, of course, I also thought of Charlie Hebdo – a few months ago in Paris. And there was a name in my mind, Ahmed Merabet. He was a policeman, a French policeman who stood guard at Charlie Hebdo and defended Charlie Hebdo. And he was a Muslim. Also last Friday, a week ago, many Muslims were murdered by madmen, by terrorists. That is why we must first of all be aware that it is not Muslims, it is not Islam that is our problem, but insane extremists and terrorists who are our problem. It would be a victory for the terrorists if we allowed an entire religious group to now be under general suspicion. (Applause) I would like to emphasise a second principle, which the President of the Commission has already mentioned: refugees who come to Europe are victims of terrorism and not perpetrators. That is why a mix-up that is now being carried out by some populists and extremists in the political sphere is inadmissible. That, too, would be a victory for the terrorists if we put all refugees under general suspicion. (Applause) Thirdly, ladies and gentlemen, the terrorists hate our way of life, freedom, the joy of life, tolerance, democracy. That is why we must not allow ourselves to question our nature. I have great respect for the people of Paris, for the people of France, who are just showing that they do not let terrorists destroy their way of life. Finally, ladies and gentlemen, i.e. back to Ahmed Merabet, a policeman who paid with his life to defend our freedom. Ladies and gentlemen, in front of the European Parliament in Brussels are soldiers, young men protecting our work. That is why I would like to say thank you to all the authorities who hold their heads every day for our safety. Thank you for that! (Applause) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report, which As a politician, of course, there is a lot going on when we talk about these issues. It goes through one's mind, President Schmit, that we in the Council can actually copy and paste. For many years, the same thing has been decided in the Council, the same speeches are constantly being made, and unfortunately nothing is happening. You have to make sure that something finally happens! That is what the people of Europe expect. And we, too, internally, must be critical of each other. That would come to mind as a politician. I hear the French Minister of the Interior appealing to us as a Parliament that we should finally deliver results on PNR. And here I have to say on the part of my group: we deliver! For months, for years, we at PNR have been of the opinion that this has to come. And many other colleagues, the Socialists and Democrats in particular, voted against PNR in the European Parliament's Home Affairs Committee. I must also say to the French Minister for the Interior: please talk to your group if you believe that we are not making progress! (Applause) But, frankly, ladies and gentlemen, I do not want to put this reciprocal reckoning at the heart of my speech. I had thought about it, but I do not want to do it, because I want to promote, namely, to work together, to tackle the issues with each other, to move forward with PNR, to move forward with Europol's issues, to take the lead in the data protection directive, in the fight against the financing of terrorism, so that we can get results there, and in terms of data retention, so that we can get them throughout Europe. Our investigative authorities need this data! Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she That is what drives us. We in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats want to achieve results, and we want to achieve this together in Europe. We must be aware that it is a challenge for the whole of Europe, for all of us in European responsibility. I appeal to everyone not to talk in the next few weeks, but to finally put action into action!

By remaining ourselves, we will wipe out terror. For many of our cities – I am thinking of Paris, brussels – this is the most difficult time since the Second World War. Never have our fellow citizens felt so threatened. We all feel a great vacuum inside: but this must not become Europe's 11 September. We must not allow fear and the logic of emergency to become normal; we must not fall into the blackmail of terrorists who want to push us towards division. This is the time for unity and responsibility! Those who think of gaining electoral support by splitting the European front, trumpeting the false equation – juncker said, Weber said – 'refugee = terrorist' is an enemy vulture of European citizens. We need cold blood, we need more Europe, closer Europe to France, to François Hollande, to all French citizens, close to Tunisia, stronger in the world, wherever these bastards are 60.  Hollande invoked Article 42 and the member states' response must be yes. But we can go further, we can go beyond the intergovernmental dimension by affirming Community European measures. That is why the Eu ropean Union, as President Juncker said, is having taken up the initiative in the field of security and defence. Well, Mr Juncker has been able to announce greater flexibility in the application of the Stability Pact for security expenditure. This flexibility must apply to all States of the Union that invest in security. It is clear, in fact, that we will win the battle against terrorism if we invest economically and politically in prepared intelligence services and if we facilitate their coordination at European level. We need not only more technology: we need \"superexperienced\" human resources, capable of addressing the new profile of jihadist terrorism. More Europe also means applying Schengen in its entirety and not dismantling it, because within the Treaty there are already measures that can and must be implemented to ensure greater and better protection at the external borders. Our group has worked and will work consistently to ensure that an agreement is reached on the European PNR by the end of the year. Together we also want to guarantee citizens' rights in the area of privacy, and so the two dossiers on European PNR and data protection go together, as mandated by this Parliament.  In order to defeat terrorism, we also need real reflection on our society. It is clear that there are other causes too, but let us not forget the conditions of unemployment, misery and segregation in which areas of our cities live, where some young people grow up who may be more tempted by the charming and macabre siren of terrorism. Europe must reaffirm its model of a cohesive and supportive society and it must be made clear that Islam is part of the identity of this continent and that it has nothing to do with Daesh's ideology of death. In foreign policy too, Europe must make Europe. Funding channels must be cut; we must isolate Daeh politically, we must strike at the business, criminal circuit, money laundering, trafficking in human beings, the hypocrisy of certain realities in the Gulf. Europe must act as Vice-President Mogherini is doing, ensuring a role as a mediator weaver between states and actors on the ground.

We knew then, as we saw the pictures coming in from Paris, as we shared the grief of the people of Paris and of France, that it could all happen again in Tunisia – and sadly that is what came to pass overnight. Our solidarity should be not only with the people of France but also with the people of Tunisia and with all the victims of terrorism and Daesh. (Applause)  One of the terrorists involved in the Paris attacks spent his nights drinking alcohol and smoking cannabis, and another never went to the mosque. Two British terrorists ordered a book before they fled to Syria last year. The name of that book: Islam for Dummies. Yet all these terrorists claim to be carrying out these acts in the name of Islam, and are prepared to slaughter innocent people on a Friday night in Paris – people eating dinner, watching a rock band, just going about their own business. It could have been in any of our cities. It could have been aimed at any of us but, sadly, there is method to their madness. Firstly, they hope to inspire copycat attacks and recruit more terrorists. Fortunately, the vast majority of Muslims will not fall for this. Secondly, even though most victims of Daesh attacks are in fact Muslims, they want, through these attacks on our cities, to provoke a backlash – to convince Muslims that Islam is despised in the West. We all need to come together to show them that they will not succeed. In the aftermath of the attacks there have been the inevitable statements about the incompatibility between Islam and Western democracy. We may even hear some of that in this Chamber today. But let us be inspired by the words of Antoine Leiris, who lost his wife, Hélène, in the Bataclan. He told the terrorists: ‘I will not give you the gift of hating you.’ How brave he must have been to write those words to people who had just murdered his wife – to people who had shattered his life, to people with a love for death, who attacked a city known for its love of life. It is at times like this that our humanity must become stronger and not descend into a spiral of hatred and blame. We need to come together to learn the lessons, to strengthen our resolve and to develop our response – a response that must be measured and proportionate. For if, every time they attack us, we erode our freedoms, there may eventually be no freedoms to defend. The balance between security and liberty will always be hotly debated, but we should debate this delicate balance without accusations, without any of the insults I see flying across this Chamber, and without questioning political opponents’ determination to fight terrorism, because this whole House needs to come together to agree on clear and tangible measures to strengthen our protection, such as introducing the passenger name record system by the end of the year. The ECR rapporteur, Timothy Kirkhope, will deliver on this, working with all the other Groups and also addressing the concerns about civil liberties. Better sharing of intelligence between national agencies is another such requirement. This does not mean we need an EU intelligence agency; the answer is not always more Europe. The answer is to build trust between the agencies of the nation states to make sure they share the intelligence that they have. Stronger external borders – building on last week’s Home Affairs Council – are also essential, because so long as the EU’s external borders are weakened, there will be calls for its internal borders to be strengthened. However, we should not pretend that every terrorist crosses borders to come into the EU. Many, sadly, were born and were radicalised in EU Member States – some searching for an identity or a sense of belonging, others radicalised in prison; some violent individuals looking for a new cause, others vulnerable and fooled into believing in a violent shortcut to paradise in a world of temptation. Better integration must be part of the solution, for where there are young people who feel that they do not belong to the country in which they live, where they are ghettoised, ISIS/Daesh will see them as potential recruits. These are all important debates that we will have in the months ahead. But today, whether you believe in a United States of Europe or whether you believe in a Europe of nation states, we should all unite to state a simple message: we will not surrender to hatred. We will not surrender to intolerance. We will not surrender our freedoms. You can attack us, you can injure us, but you will never break us.

Mr President, I want to continue where Mr Kamall ended his intervention and say that I was also shocked by the way that we have behaved since 13 November as politicians. Instead of showing unity - we have seen it again in this debate this morning - we throw insane accusations at each other. In the French language, there is an expression for this: we speak of \"political politics games\", to which we sometimes play and which exploit the tragedy of Paris, ladies and gentlemen, to score easy points in elections, let us say against Europe, against refugees, against Islam and even against the European Parliament. We will hear it in a few moments. Marine Le Pen will do it again.  I find this undignified and it is above all unworthy to say: \"You are responsible for terrorism, because you have not reached an agreement on the PNR\". I must tell you, ladies and gentlemen, that the exact opposite is true, because the reality is that this Parliament had proposed from the outset a regulation - not a directive - with direct and immediate effect to create a single system at European level, which would be transnational in order to avoid precisely the systematic failures that we see every time that either national intelligence service that knew the criminals did not pass on the relevant information to the country. The events took place. This was the case in 2004 in Madrid, as was the case in 2005 in London, and this is now the case again in Paris.  We make the same observation every time. And what do we have on the table? It's a directive. In the best case scenario, it will take at least two years to implement it and, moreover, it is twenty-eight NRPs that we will create in the European Union. I believe that at least there should be a mandatory exchange of information between these 28 systems, but of course, Minister, the Member States refuse it. So, I ask you today, who is responsible for the absence of the NRL?  I was President of the European Council, I was there with Jean-Claude Juncker on 11 September 2001, when we were able to create in six months - Jean-Claude, you remember - the European arrest warrant which was a mandatory system, not like the measures you have just listed, which are always voluntary, voluntary and whose application depends on the will of the States. For the record, Mr Weber, only Mr Berlusconi was against and negotiated a transition period, for himself, I suppose, of almost ten years. It was not until 2014 that the system came into effect in Italy.  So let's stop making political quarrels here in this house. It's too easy to launch attacks like this! What is imperative now is unity and solidarity around France; I would even say a common front, a Europe united in the fight against Daesh and terrorism. This would be the best tribute we can pay to the 130 young people who perished, who were shot during the attacks in Paris. It is in the same spirit that I will today call for the creation of a European intelligence agency. Mr Cazeneuve, the French interior minister, is right when he says that we must fight terrorism urgently and focus on the immediate implementation of the many measures that have been taken since the Charlie Hebdo attacks. But we still find that ten months later, a dozen states have not yet transferred the data required by the Schengen computerised system - twelve states for ten months that do not transfer the necessary elements! In my view, governing means not only implementing the measures that have been decided, but also planning and preparing for the future, especially in the fight against terrorism. Terrorists, ladies and gentlemen, know no borders, so we must also have a security and intelligence capability that also crosses borders. Let's take the case of Abdeslam, who is still on the run - it's still screaming! He was checked on the night of the attacks by the French police in Cambrai, he was able to continue on his way because the police did not know him, but I can tell you that the Belgian police did know him! Well, I'm telling you that with a European intelligence agency serving all European police, Abdeslam would certainly have been arrested. That is the reality that citizens need to be told. If we have to choose between sovereignty and security, I choose the security of our fellow citizens, which must prevail over sovereignty. It is in this spirit, Mr Juncker, that I have sent you and Mr Avramopoulos a concrete proposal on how to do this. In the same we also have to show unity and solidarity with France in the use of Article 42. We did not discuss this today because - let us be honest - for far too long we have outsourced our problems: inside the Union to France, as in Mali; and, outside the Union, to the Americans. If the Americans do nothing, nothing happens - as in Syria, for example. A European military coalition around France has to break this stalemate, eradicate Daesh and also facilitate a political solution. I hope that this coalition around France on Article 42 may be the start of a real European Defence Community and foreign policy. Again, I repeat: this is the best tribute we can pay to the 130 young people who were victims in Paris.

Mr President, I would like to thank the The European Parliament demonstrated unity last week and I hope it will do so today when it comes to condemning the terrorist attacks in Paris, In Tunis, In Bamako and wherever in the world for what they are: attacks against people, against our values, against everything that really constitutes our civilisational experience, our civilisational coexistence in this century. There is no excuse, no justification. Everyone must know: you don't kill people! But let us also not be swearing or abusing the concerns, with the feelings of grief of people who have witnessed the attacks, either directly or through the media.  There have been two sentences in the last few days, some of which have been repeated today and which I think are very important: terrorism cannot be confused with the refugee issue: and refugees have just fled the terror that we are experiencing in Europe. In reality, however, not much remains of this appeal to reason and decency.  I would remind you of Mr Orban, his sentence: all the terrorists were migrants. A sentence that is as contemptuous as it is sneaky. Because all non-terrorists are and were migrants. All human beings are migrants. Mr Orban is a migrant. Is Mr Orban, and the question may be asked, a terrorist? In the light of the terrorist attacks, we should make it clear that, in my view, the closure of borders between Member States within the European Union, the debate on ceilings, the rejection of refugees and the macabre definition that we are currently experiencing, of so-called safe countries of origin, are precisely part of this false debate, this abuse. This is not only run by a few, but we have prime ministers from our European Union here, we have party leaders here, it goes right through.  Please do not repeat the mistakes of 9/11! What gains in security, cooperation and development have the war against Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya brought to the international community? Terrorism against terrorism is the worst of all responses. Neither airstrikes nor drone strikes have dehydrated the roots of terrorism. I would also refer here to the statements made by the American drone pilots, who have said precisely that their way of waging war has led to the recruitment of new terrorists. Bringing suffering to civilians cannot be our answer.  Join Turkey and Russia at war? No thank you! Together with Russia and Turkey, to launch a political diplomatic offensive? Yes, absolutely! I think that must also be our response to yesterday's developments. As the EU, we have other possibilities, different responsibilities. We should be aware of that. I am thinking here of the situation in the banlieues, but also in other conurbations of European metropolises. This is where we must start with an offensive to integrate and create prospects for young people. We have – and I would also like to point this out – a debate on a new sustainable neighbourhood policy. I would strongly like to support that. That can and must be our answer. I would like to point this out.  Otherwise, please talk about stopping arms exports! Let us not just talk about the sources of finance that need to be withdrawn, we are also talking about stopping exchanges or allowing them to trade in oil and cultural goods.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, like all of you, I was deeply shocked by the attacks in Paris two weeks ago, and like all of you, my thoughts are with the victims and their loved ones, I would say to all the victims, those in Paris, Beirut, Sinai and elsewhere. But beyond these emotions, our responsibility as policy makers is not to give this or that measure to our citizens to reassure them, but to take concrete, evidence-based measures that address problems. The first fact is that most of the terrorists who have carried out attacks in recent decades in Europe were known to the police and intelligence services, but not all, simply because the information, the intelligence is not shared. Even though they were known as dangerous people, they were not subjected to the necessary surveillance, simply because of a lack of resources. The first lesson we need to learn is to make intelligence sharing the rule and to give ourselves the means to use that information. From this point of view, the immobility of the governments of the Member States has contributed to the attacks being able to take place. In the face of this, we understand that the response of wanting to put all of our societies under constant surveillance is both inadequate and democratically unacceptable. Inadequate, because it is not the information that is lacking, but its sharing and exploitation. Unacceptable, because in a democracy there is a basic principle which is the proportionality between the measures adopted and the desired effect, and that nothing can justify the widespread supervision of our societies. China is trying and failing to prevent terrorist acts. On the other hand, of course, Mr Schmitt, we must tackle the arms trade, we must tackle the financing of terrorism, we must tackle the abuse of the internet used to spread hate speech and violence. So much for the immediate response. Yes, Mr Cazeneuve, you are right, Europe must recover, but the Europe that must be taken back is that of the Member States which remain bowed to their national self. They have still not realized that when it comes to security, as in so many other matters, there is only shared sovereignty. Now, I think we will not be able to save the money to answer three questions. First, what is the effect of our multiple interventions in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and elsewhere on the terrorist threat? Do these interventions reduce or increase it? I think the question is open.  Secondly, what about our successful relationship with this successful Islamic state - I mean Saudi Arabia. A state that flouts fundamental rights, crucifies, beheads and cuts off its hands, but with which we have excellent relations - I still remember Mr Valls not long ago. But what do you want? Our addiction to oil makes us dependent on people like that. You have understood that the energy transition is not only an ecological issue, it is also a strategic issue and a security issue. The third question we have to ask ourselves is probably the most fundamental. The other embarrassing fact is that the terrorists who have acted in recent decades have grown up here, have passports , as you said Mr Schmit, I believe - from here. Why have our societies become fertile ground? I am under no illusions, we will still hear hate speech and violence for decades to come. We must ensure that our societies are not fertile ground for these discourses, that they fall flat, and here we can ask ourselves the question of a society where everyone's competition with all is the rule, where consumption is the only horizon, where exclusion progresses every day, where ethnicity or religion is increasingly a factor of exclusion. One wonders how all of this contributes, but is not the sole cause, to the increased risk of terrorism. I know that emotions are strong, I think we must resist the temptation to be overwhelmed by them, because if our societies carried by these emotions were to be tense in a security retreat, the terrorists would have won! I conclude, Mr President, by recalling that France, which was attacked two weeks ago, has put freedom, equality and fraternity at the heart of its republican values. I believe that it is by keeping what was a promise to all our citizens and all the citizens of the world that we will be able to live safely in free, open and democratic societies.

The attacks really brought home to us the danger that we face on our streets today. If we are to deal with the greatest threat that we and our children face in this century – that of Islamic fundamentalism – we must resolve the situation in Syria. We must first realise who our enemy is, and who our enemy is not. We must not see foreign policy through the eyes of the student common room. We must realise that geopolitics is not black and white; there are very often grey areas, and we must be grown up enough to say that sometimes my enemy’s enemy is my friend, just as we did in the Second World War with Joseph Stalin. We need to put together a grand coalition of nations including not just the Western powers but also Russia, China, India and Muslim nations as well. We must come together to cut out the cancer of radical Islamism which brought carnage onto the streets of Paris and, I believe, will attempt to repeat the same evil on the streets of another European city sometime soon. We need to admit, too, that Bashar al-Assad is not a threat to global peace by comparison with the Islamism of Islamic State. But we must also look at ourselves and ask whether our policies have aided the terrorists – and sadly, the answer is yes. This place is in denial. You are clinging to Schengen and freedom of movement of people, just as Neville Chamberlain clung to appeasing Hitler when it was obvious to all that this man could not be dealt with. The obsession with these policies, and the failure to admit that you have been wrong, are placing the lives of our citizens in danger. I warned in this Chamber six weeks ago – to howls of derision – that freedom of movement of people in Europe would, in the end, lead to freedom of movement of jihad, and, unfortunately, I was proved correct. We must take a hard look in the mirror and ask whether our tolerance is leading to intolerance – and again, the answer must be yes. Last week I took a walk around the Brussels suburb of Molenbeek. I was saddened by what I saw, but unfortunately I was not surprised. It is a snapshot of everything that has gone wrong with the failed policies of political correctness and aggressive multiculturalism. It is a ghetto where many home-grown jihadists live, egged on by Saudi-sponsored Wahhabism. So, if we are to take steps to solve the crisis that we face, we must first cut out its source – which is the problems in Syria – through a global coalition. But at the same time we must take preventive action at home by reinstating border controls and clamping down on Saudi-sponsored Wahhabism, which is a growing, clear and present danger within many of our communities.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, France went through an absolutely appalling ordeal on Friday 13 November. I think the first respect for the victims is to name what murdered them. However, no more in the mouths of our French leaders than in all the speeches I have heard this morning, I have not heard the killer name. The murderer is not terrorism. Terrorism is the weapon in the killer's hand.  The murderer is the ideology he carries and in the name of which terrorism kills. This is Islamist fundamentalism and you have to say it, because if you do not say it, if you are not able to name the enemy, then obviously you will not be able to fight it. But maybe it bothers some of you to name him. Because naming it means questioning a number of international friendships. This raises the question of whether, in fact, we can continue to have Saudi Arabia and Qatar as allies. This raises the question of Turkey's ambiguity with regard to Islamist fundamentalism. This forces us to face each other and to think that, yes, all the international agreements we have made, the international alliances we have made, are actually pushing us today objectively to be allies of Islamist fundamentalism rather than to be the enemies of it.  So I propose that these alliances be changed and I consider that all those who fight against Islamist fundamentalism should be seen as allies, without any reservations. This obviously involves Muslim countries fighting against Islamist fundamentalism: Egypt, the United Arab Emirates. It also, of course, goes through Russia. It goes through Iran. So, as part of this grand coalition, we can consider being effective against Islamist fundamentalism.  But in many respects , I am obliged to say as well - France's alienation from stupid European policies is now an obstacle to the return of French security. At the forefront of these idiotic policies is the issue of mass immigration, which is the breeding ground for communitarianism and the answer to the questions you are asking yourself. But why are there terrorists who were born in our territories, in Europe? Well, because mass immigration has led to communitarianism and communitarianism is the breeding ground in which Islamist fundamentalism comes to seek and recruit its future soldiers.  The European Commission announces that three million migrants will arrive in the European Union next year. Of course we do not put a line of equality between migrants and terrorists. But the fact remains that what I denounced in this Parliament in September, namely the infiltration of jihadists amid the flow of migrants, is a reality. That reality killed last Friday. You can pretend not to see that, but that reality is there and you cannot ignore it. To continue to leave these flows of migrants uncontrolled when you know full well that the Union and the countries bordering the Union are totally unable to control anything, let alone the identity of those who arrive, is to deprive ourselves of the means to combat this terrible danger.  So, I'm telling you, we want to get back to our national borders. We do not trust Europe's borders, which are a real sieve. Today, the French borders are again temporarily controlled. We will do everything in our power to ensure that they are controlled absolutely definitively. You talk about controls, intelligence, but what controls? Passports held by terrorists are not false passports. These are real passports issued by the Islamic State in the administrations they have taken control of, in Syria. This, too, is a reality that must be looked at in the face.  In the same way, you have imposed austerity on us. This austerity forced us to disarm. It is because of austerity that the Union has imposed on countries that we have fewer military personnel, that we have fewer policemen, that we have fewer gendarmes, that we have fewer customs officers. We no longer want your austerity policy. We no longer want you to decide what the priority is in our budget. Again, we want to regain our budgetary sovereignty and decide that it is more useful for us today to give a budgetary priority to the security of our territory. We are the ones who want to decide this! Since November 13, the state of French spirit has changed. The European institutions must understand that, for us, nothing will ever be the way it was before. The madness of migration, the hatred of borders, the \"austerity\" obsession, the poor choices in international alliances have become dangers clearly identified by the French. A growing minority shared our views on these issues. There is no doubt that the gaze is now overwhelmingly lucid. We will continue to denounce these dangers in order to defend the security of the French people in the face of the actions that I consider criminal of the European institutions.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "NI", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 24, "date": "2015-11-25.json", "name": "Bruno GOLLNISCH", "mepid": "1164", "text": "   Mr President, for decades, indeed, the majority of this Parliament, the governments of the Member States and the European Commission have encouraged the mass immigration of populations that are too often heterogeneous in relation to our peoples, our values, our history, our aspirations.

Even when it has legal jurisdiction, it does not have the administrative means, let alone the financial means to apply directly itself. It must rely on the goodwill of the Member States and their services, and that is where everything gets bogged down. With regard to the fight against terrorism, the first action plan was adopted after 11 September 14 years ago. What's the case? A European counter-terrorism coordinator has been established. It has no staff, no budget. Worse, we have developed effective means and we are now discovering that they are all shockingly under-used by the member states' services.

In this sense, we must show solidarity with what happened in Paris, Saint-Denis, but also in Beirut, Bamako or Tunis. We must provide a European response to this situation. We need more internal security, more external security, more internal solidarity, more external solidarity.  Inner solidarity - this is of course the PNR.

Paris has been touched in what is most precious: its youth. It was his children who were injured, his children who were murdered. Paris suffers, but Paris continues to live and stand thanks to solidarity, the unity of its people, the whole country and Europe.  What do these terrorists who have chosen to become the enemies of our society, our values, our way of life want? They want life to stop. That's why we'll continue to live. They want war between us. That is why we will not renounce mutual understanding in any way. And they want us to be scared. That is why we must take all the decisions to protect, truly protect, and defend, truly defend our fellow citizens!  This is what we expect, what we demand from European leaders, heads of state and government. Because, as we know, the threat is there. It is serious and it is sustainable. The urgent need is for a Europe of security and intelligence. A true European PNR, the sharing of data of terrorism suspects, the creation of a file listing foreign fighters, systematic checks at the external borders of Schengen are measures expected by all, terrorism having no borders.  The urgency is to mobilize against totalitarian fanaticism that kills, tortures, beheads, crucifies, rapes. The major powers, the United States, Russia, the European Union, and the regional powers, including Turkey and Iran, must unite to intensify the fight against the Islamic State. But at the same time, and this is essential, they must work towards a political solution to stabilize Syria. Tunis, Bamako, Paris, Beirut, Sharm el-Sheikh, Baghdad, Ankara, the list of recent attacks is long, too long. The times we're going to live are going to be difficult.

I would also like to thank all those of you who sent messages of solidarity to France after the murderous madness it suffered. We are always overwhelmed, upset, bruised by these lives stolen in the prime of our lives, by the massacre of this beautiful, fiery and smiling youth, who have fallen under the fire of bloody fanaticism.  Our urgent duty today is to bring to life human solidarity, citizen unity, to do everything to ensure that our fellow citizens of the Muslim faith are not confused with murderous obscurantism. Our duty is to make people aware that refugees are not the cause of terrorism, but that they are the first victims. Our duty is to contribute to the security and protection of our citizens, with in mind that security will be all the stronger as freedoms and democracy are preserved. Our duty is to reflect on the past, on the causes that may have produced these abominations. Among them were the wars that destroyed Iraq, then Libya. The murky alliances with the purveyors and financiers of the new fascisms, the current reorientations of political, diplomatic and military strategies, placing them under the aegis of the United Nations, are first steps. But it is time to get the Monarchies out of the Gulf and Turkey - which yesterday shot down a Russian plane fighting Daesch - from their murky games and clearly support the Kurdish forces acting on the ground to push back the Islamic State.  Lessons must be learned from the positive role of public services and thus out of the current budget rationing. It is time for human investment in the commons of the police, health, customs, justice, local authorities, education and culture. At the same time, we need to rethink European security and justice cooperation to make it effective. Finally, there will be no way out if the people are not given new hope, which is why the European Union should take the initiative of major Euro-Mediterranean and Euro-African reconstruction and co-development plans in the area of infrastructure and services, in order to enable the people to access the human common good. Consider that if we stopped military spending for a single week, it would allow all children to access school. All over the world, for the past few days, the Marseillaise, our French national anthem, has been resounding.

Today we share the grief of the families and loved ones of the victims, the pain and the shock of the wounded. We share the horror that struck the French, but also experienced by other countries, victims of barbarism, such as Tunisia yesterday. I thank all public services for their dedicated work and hard work. We must also salute the solidarity shown by citizens who have helped complete strangers, who have opened their doors to those foreigners who sought refuge in chaos.  But some of the words taken in this Chamber do not seem to me to be up to the task. Some reactions are nauseating, aiming to use this drama for political purposes to attack their political opponent. You hold up our values - freedom, equality, fraternity - without recognizing the solidarity that underlies them, without grasping the humanist message of a nation that, struck by hatred, has responded with tolerance.  To act effectively, let us ask ourselves about the world in which we live and shape with our laws. Radicalization, hatred, wars do not come from nothing, there is fertile ground for jihadism: the inequalities and oppression that are growing stronger every day. It is also a society in which some refer to refugees fleeing acts as scapegoats as the attacks of 13 November. So, as a response on our territory, they want to smoke us with announcements as symbolic as ineffective: the loss of nationality, the proliferation of laws of general surveillance. We are wasted precious time in convincing the public that these security gadgets are the solution to the terrorist risk.  I would not have words harsh enough to denounce the lack of cooperation that allowed the intolerable to happen. Already in January, the heads of state and government promised us more cooperation, coordination between police and judicial services. Yet, ten months later, they come to us again the same promise, even though we have proof that the sharing of information between France, Germany and Belgium might have prevented this macabre Friday the 13th. How ironic to learn that it is thanks to third states that the French authorities have been able to find the accomplices of the terrorists! Let us break down our intelligence services, share our information, European-citizens the fight against terrorism, create a European prosecutor's office, fight seriously against arms trafficking and tackle the illicit financing of terrorism. Let's finally be clear-headed. As for our foreign policy, France and the European states have for too long supported dangerous links with Qatar and Saudi Arabia, and I would like to end by saying that our democracy, which is their target, must be our weapon.

It is time to become aware of the crippling angelism that characterizes part of this Parliament. I take as an example what Mr Verhofstadt pointed out, namely the blocking of the PNR file for four years under the pretext of respect for individual freedom. But too much freedom kills freedom and undermines human rights.  It is also time to name things by their right name. Why talk about Daesch? This exotic name remains nebulous and does not reflect reality.  The criminologist, Alain Bauer, rightly pointed this out. The name \"Islamic State\" captures exactly the reality. We are dealing with a state and that state is slaughtering in the name of a religion. It is in the name of this religion that he destroys our treasures of civilization, that he massacres his own compatriots and it is out of religious hatred that he kills our youth who are guilty of loving music and wine. He hates our freedom to believe or not to believe in God.  As stupid as it was, it wasn't Bush's America's intervention in Iraq in 2003 that created chaos. This intervention served only as a match. It's a long-smouldering fire. The colonization of settlements that overwhelms France has been ideologically and politically organized by our governments for more than thirty years. It is not surprising that the Islamic State is recruiting its terrorists here. What are the responses to the strikes of these states in Syria? I am not sure that these strikes in Syria calm the young people of our suburbs, young radical Islamists revolted. We have an immigration problem. It is uncontrolled and unassimilated immigration that jeopardizes the balance of our societies. To say so is neither racist nor xenophobic.

It has not been enough when it comes to information: we still do not share the information needed to attack terrorism. It has not been enough when it comes to cutting off the sources of funding of terrorist groups. It has not been enough in the social response: austerity policies have further damaged education, integration, social services, public services...  Nor has it been enough to structure a common Union foreign policy that responds coherently to conflicts, where these radicalisations and terrorist groups are fed. Nor have we done what is necessary to build a European response.  Indeed, today the Council presents us with a number of measures which we support, but many of these measures were available to the Member States, which have not used them.  There has been an anti-terrorism strategy since 2015. There is a counter-terrorism coordinator. Europol exists. There is Eurojust. There is the COSI.

Then we hear a lot of solemn statements about democratic values, fundamental rights and the rule of law. Much of this is lip service, because a raft of new measures is announced after every single attack, but their effectiveness is doubtful. The Council and Commission have so far refused an evaluation on the basis of Article 7, as requested by this House. Maybe now they will finally do it. Implementation of the measures by the Member States is patchy and inadequate. Then there is a near obsession with electronic mass surveillance – whereas what is needed is much more investment in human intelligence, in people on the ground who know what is going on in the banlieues and in Molenbeek. Why do we tolerate the existence of ghettos in our cities that are no-go areas for the police – where the police do not even dare to get out of their cars – so they cannot know what is going on? Let us start investing in human intelligence. Lastly, with regard to the passenger name record (PNR) proposal, I am asking the Council and the Commission to stop the campaign of lies.

Without getting lost in the fantasies of security and, I hope, without losing sight of the principles that animate the best of its republican history.  In the moment we live, the main virtue, it seems to me, is discernment. We would benefit, here as elsewhere, not to speak of a war of civilization, because what we are experiencing is not a war of civilization for the reason that Daesch is not a civilization but a totalitarianism. This is not a war of civilizations because they are not warriors that we face but cowardly assassins who attack helpless people and by surprise.  As for discernment, Islam is no more involved in this matter than any other belief. Once again, religious fundamentalism is the mask of a war for money and money. We must also give up stigmatizing poverty as a source of crime. The crime has no social origin. Crime has an ideological and human origin. He starts from all walks of place. It would be good if we did not point the finger so rudely at this or that neighbourhood when the children of the rich as well as those of the poor can be swept away by the folly of death. And if we have to make a point here, let us remember the responsibility that has been taken by all those who have wanted to weaken states in their regal missions. In my country, there are 12,000 fewer police officers, the army has been reduced by 20%. All of this was one of the causes that contributed to the lack of resources to deal with the blows we were about to take. We must put an end to this policy of weakening the public service. As has been said, we must put an end to this benevolent blindness and amnesia towards such and such countries which are merely practising in large and with the institutions of the State what a group like Daesch and others are doing. The cause of terrorism lies in the wars between the powers to control an area of the world where immense wealth is controlled and where immense wealth occurs. It is therefore by stopping the war that terrorism will be stopped. It is not by making up the entire population of Europe that we will learn anything more than what we already know about the risk it contains. The cause of terrorism is in war. It's the war that needs to be stopped. The cause of terrorism is in the money. It is these circulations that must be stopped.

In Europol, information sharing is almost dysfunctional, as large numbers of Member States do not share information on known suspects and risks.

The current proposal by the Council on an EU PNR directive is in fact an extraordinarily expensive model of 28 silos full of completely irrelevant information on innocent travellers.

Since 11 September, the UNITED States has been followed by new victims, new terrorist groups, destabilisation in areas of the world and migratory flows. History teaches us that most terrorist organisations are neutralised through political processes aimed at eliminating all forms of support for terrorist groups and not through the direct use of military force. The terrorist threat today does not just come from outside but is lingers within Europe: we have seen that several of those responsible for the attacks turn out to be young, European citizens who were born here, who live here, and who are also the economic and social factors responsible for social exclusion, inequalities, discrimination, lack of integration, which predispose them to violence. We should therefore ask ourselves whether these economic and social factors, these European economic and social policies, are not also unsuccessful and complicit in the formation of this terrorism. We must therefore focus on preventing radicalisation through education, tolerance, mutual respect for cultures and social inclusion.

In order to establish a safer environment, we have to define a balanced framework in which security and liberty can coexist, as you cannot be free without being secure.

As a result of its split, Europe has remained powerless in the attacks on Iraq. Equally helplessly, we are now discussing refugees, this colonial damage to a broken Syria that is largely unafter caused from Europe, and we now bear its greatest burden – financially, morally, socially and more. It is precisely because of this fact that we should be all the more united in front of the US and also russia with demands to stop the war.

It was very timely, very constructive and it sent very strong signals. Allow me once again to come back to a concern that has been raised by many of you today, namely the link between migration and terrorism and the link between religion and terrorism. I will repeat what I said last night in this place – and President Juncker has said it this morning: we must absolutely dissociate those who are in need of international protection – of our protection – from those who are seeking to attack our values, the very fundamental values of our societies. It is those same terrorists who refugees are fleeing from. Let me also once again remind you that almost all the perpetrators of the latest attacks on European soil were European Union citizens, and not all were of Muslim origin. We have to ask ourselves why these young people, who are born and bred here, decide to leave, to forsake our communities and, finally, to turn against us. Daesh wants us to think in opposites, in black and white and to feel the antagonism that they are creating and fomenting. Let us not fall into their trap. Let us not give in to fear and panic. Honourable Members of Parliament, of various political affiliations, we are all smarter than that and we know that a united European response is the only answer to the threat. Together we can improve our resilience to terrorism and address the complex causes of radicalisation. We are all collectively safer in unity and should come together. We are moving forward on the PNR negotiations and will ensure a fully operational and effective instrument, which will of course respect proportionality. As regards the checks at our external borders, in parallel with our package on European border and coast guards, we are exploring the need to include possible modifications to the provisions of checks of European Union citizens against databases for public order and internal security reasons. In the meantime, Member States should use all the tools available to control external borders. The tools are there. Moreover, as many of you mentioned Schengen, let me make this clear: Schengen is the most tangible example of our greatest achievement in the European integration process. It is only by making full use of Schengen that we will be able to react to the threats. But we also need more trust among ourselves to share intelligence – many in this room today have said this – and prevent the possibility of a repetition of the horrendous attacks like those in Paris. Europe cannot stand without trust between all of us – among the EU institutions, among the Member States and among citizens. That is why it is so crucial that Member States send, not just their experts, but also their intelligence to the counter—terrorism centre in Europol, which will be fully operational on 1 January 2016.

After all, climate change does not stop at national borders, nor does radical ideas and terrorism. More cooperation is therefore needed, not less. Enhanced cooperation within the EU but also internationally.  Within the EU, this involves greater cooperation between intelligence services, the maximum sharing and exchange of information (while respecting the privacy of ordinary citizens) and the creation of a European intelligence service. All this in combination with proper control of our external borders so that Schengen can be maintained. But more cooperation is also needed between the EU and third countries to stop terrorism and to help countries like Syria move towards a transition to a democratic state. Only an international coalition can do that.

Thank you for being here today. Mr President, your personal history shows a constant and profound commitment to the defence and strengthening of the European project.

Today you will address a Parliament and a European Union that is still deeply shaken by the attacks and the terrorist threat. A terror that shocked us all, which had as its objective our Europe, our values, our youth. Italy has united with great solidarity with the people of French and Italy itself has lost an exemplary citizen of its own. Yesterday, Mr President, you were in Venice, where the funeral of Valeria Solesin, the young researcher of the Sorbonne killed by terrorists at the Bataclan, was held in St Mark's Square. Her smile, her face, her commitment to volunteering, her research and her call for women to participate in the world of work will remain indelible and demonstrating what divides Valeria Solesin's Europe from the murderous madness of jihadist terror. The whole of Europe is gathered around the family of Valeria Solesin and all the victims of terror.  Europe is threatened by crises and global problems. It must rise to the challenges we face. As you yourself said when you spoke to members of the European Parliament in Italy, the choice is between a Europe that tackles phenomena and governs them, and a Europe that suffers events without being able to guide them.  Italy is on the side of the answer. It was the driving force and inspiration behind European integration, even when the rest of Europe was not yet ready to follow economic governance and the common immigration policy.

Mr Schulz, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the European Parliament for giving me the privilege of addressing this House, which represents the peoples of the Union. I am taking the floor at a particularly dramatic time for all of us. Europe is wounded: Brussels, Copenhagen, London, Madrid and Paris are painful and ineradicable lacerations on the body of our Union.  We are still dismayed by what happened in Paris and we are all trying – together – to address the pain that has been felt by the families of the victims, the physical and moral suffering of the injured, the sense of anguish and insecurity in our communities. I would like to reiterate once again, with force, total and unconditional solidarity with France, its institutions, its people, and particularly the families affected by this immense tragedy. Yesterday, as President Schulz has just mentioned, we said goodbye to Venice, to Valeria Solesin, an Italian girl, a European girl, whose young life was cut short, with heinousness, along with that of 129 other people. I would like to combine the memory of Valeria Solesin with the memory of this Day to combat violence against women. In Paris, our everyday lives, our conception of being together, our habits were affected: that way of being, thinking and living that is precisely and characteristic of the citizens of the Union. This year we recalled the 70th anniversary of the end of the Second World War and, last year, the centenary of the beginning of the First World War. Two tragedies from which the immense suffering was born, the idea of a Europe that knew how to unite rather than fight has grown and rooted itself. The European Union is the result of this long and vital process that is still under way and it is the progressive integration that has enabled our fellow Europeancitizens to experience a period of peace and social, cultural and economic development unique in the history of our continent. A story that has produced rights and increased protections for all. The Europe that you represent was born of solidarity, of former enemies who were able to unite in the name of common values, of former cold war adversaries who have been able to create, in recent years, the largest area of democracy and freedom that ever existed, making a decisive contribution to stability and peace.  However, this is no longer enough. We are all being asked today, with arrogance, for more responsibility, more initiative, more cohesion. Only in this way will we be able to overcome the arrogant challenges that terrorism brings to our homes, having bloodied the Middle Eastern, African and Asian lands, which are still seriously affected, as last week in Bamako and yesterday in Tunis. The contrasts of the bipolar era have helped to push European countries to stand together. Today, from the east and from the south, new strong instability has come to our borders. It is more essential than ever to promote – together – intelligent neighbourhood policies in order to share peace-building strategies, isolating all extremism. The European Union is, in the international context and in the collective imagination, a point of reference for every person, people or State that bases its existence on peace between nations, freedoms and respect for citizens' rights. A political embankment against obscurantism. That is why they are attacking us head-on, as has also happened to the United States of America.  I am addressing a Parliamentary Assembly which represents the people of Europe and which, at the same time, is the guardian of the plurality of identity that enriches our Being Europeans: the battle that sees us engaged not in a short time, requires unity. Unity and determination, in order to combat, together, all violence and to guarantee full security for our fellow citizens; preserving the essential defence of freedom and rights.  The architecture of the European institutions is based on the values of democracy, tolerance and acceptance. In view of the enormous migratory pressures coming from countries where terrorism originates and in the light of the dramatic events in Paris, the question today is whether some of these principles should not be called into question, starting with the free movement of persons. Hence the recurring temptation to close the borders, both external, by blocking the way for those fleeing war zones or hunger, and internally, by compressing one of the many great freedoms that we have laboriously made the right of our citizens. I believe that we must face these challenges in the light of the values for which we declare our fight.  Answers that are only apparently simple do not help us, either ideally or in terms of appropriate and effective solutions. On the ideal one, because they push us to renounce the fundamental principles of our being rights that we have built and that we have a duty to protect, for us and for future generations. Simplifications are not even persuasive in terms of lasting solutions, because the phenomena we are witnessing are global in nature and no country alone is able to face them, however strong it may be, however proud it may be, like everyone else, of its history.  During the Second World War, democracies, starting in the United Kingdom, did not wonder how to save themselves alone, but instead knew how to call for the greatest international mobilization of consciences. Today it is up to the European Union to hold firm the helm of civilisation and humanism. It is through an effective increase in cooperation between the Member States – from security apparatus to intelligence activities – that we will be able, together, to defeat terrorism, to make our citizens safer and to protect our way of life. It is only by working together more – and not less – that we could rise to this challenge, including in the field of the common foreign and defence policy.  We must not forget that sixty years of progressive integration, while respecting differences, specificities and traditions, have created a European demos: a growing fusion of our society which has produced concrete and visible results in terms of rights, protections, sensitivities and ways of leading one's life, from one end of the Union to the other, from Lapland to Cyprus, from the Danube Delta to the Algarve. A single Area of European Freedom, which we cannot lose but which, on the contrary, we must be able to extend, in order to protect the good of security.  The Union has produced European law – presided over by the Court of Justice – which is part, in many areas, of the daily lives of our citizens: a common heritage that they could no longer do without. And you, the legislators in this Parliament, know this better than anyone. The voice of the citizens of Europe, who have stood up in recent days to call for the fight against barbarism, has been a testimony to Europe's pressing demand for unity.  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are faced with an apparent paradox: on the one hand, we have witnessed the progressive emergence of this new European demos; on the other hand, the Union and its Member States are showing fatigue, increasing difficulties in dealing with and resolving, together, the crises that have affected them. It was the result of the international financial crisis, which did not leave the sovereign debts of states unscathed; It has been the result of the serious crisis which has depressed the economies of many Member States of the Union, with serious repercussions in terms of social cohesion. In recent years, the need to be able to look far has not always guided us, and if we can learn from it and global solutions to global problems must be given. We need to move from the emergency logic, which has characterised the approach to crises in recent years, to a long-term vision, which allows the Union to develop policies that stimulate growth, create jobs and permanently reduce inequalities. This is the way to guarantee our citizens a prospect of economic and social progress and to ensure that Europe plays a leading role in the emerging world.  Thus, for example, with regard to monetary union, the report of the five Presidents sets out a path on which, I hope, appropriate political and methodological convergences can soon be reached – because time is short – defining the indispensable role of the European Parliament in order to guarantee its democratic foundation.  The institutions – and the European institutions are no exception – are strengthened if they know how to renew themselves, if they know what can be improved without yielding to destructive or paralysing pressures. For example, in terms of completing the single market or applying the principle of subsidiarity more effectively between the Union and the Member States. We must be able to make choices of greater unity in all the areas in which we are committed.  The free movement of persons, put under pressure – as I have said – both by the phenomenon of migration and by the threat of terrorism, has as its logical corollary the strengthening of cooperation between the Member States for the protection and management of the common external border and, secondly, for the creation of common institutions capable of managing migratory flows. Only those who do not want to see can pretend that they do not know where the painful caravan of people going back to Asia and the Middle East, Africa to Europe, comes from. They repeat the tragedy of the Jews fleeing Nazism; of the hundreds of thousands of prisoners of war who roamed Europe in the aftermath of the Second World War in search of hearths that had been destroyed; of the refugees whose community homes suddenly had become part of another country. They are the heirs of those who, at the risk of their lives, went through the Berlin Wall; of the citizens who, defying the minefields, were trying to cross from Hungary to Austria.  The world is on the move, on the legs of millions of women, children, men, often victims of cruel human traffickers: it is a helpless army, marching in search of its own salvation. What can we oppose their reasons for? It is not they who are fleeing death and violence, our enemy. They are heading for Europe, seen not only as a place of prosperity but even more as an area of freedom, the protection of rights and peace. We must defend Europe's security, but we cannot disfigure it in order to make it less attractive.  Rather, Europe as a whole needs to update its rules in order to deal with a phenomenon that is different, by nature and by size, from the time when the asylum rules were written. The Dublin Agreements capture a reality and a past that is no longer there. That is why they are outdated: overcome by reality, which is an inflexible judge. The need is to define new rules based on the principles of humanity and security, solidarity and responsibility, and in any case adapted to the new reality before us.  The choice, in the final analysis – and not only in the field of migration – is, I would like to repeat, here too, before you, as legislators of Europe, between a Union that tackles phenomena by trying to regulate them and a Europe that suffers events without being able to govern them, with the consequent increase in internal imbalances and mistrust and mistrust between the Member States.  Our values will affirm their authenticity and consolidate their authority if they are able to receive gratitude and admiration for the welcome and help given to those in difficulty. This message would help to water down the propaganda of hatred and death sown by fundamentalist terrorism, in so many countries, from the Middle East to Africa and also – as the sad reality of these days reminds us – in the cities of Europe.  At the meeting between the European Union and African countries in Valletta in recent weeks, as well as in the diplomatic activities under way with Turkey, some important first steps were taken. We have defined strategies and made clear commitments. It is now a question of honouring the offers of aid to countries along the Balkan and Eastern Mediterranean routes and of following up the commitments made with African countries on development cooperation and mobility. It is right to help them, and this seems, moreover, to be the only way to be perceived as credible partners and to be able to call for greater cooperation on returns, in order, moreover, to prevent migratory flows from having even greater and completely unstoppable dimensions in the near future, and also to prevent terrorism from finding additional breeding grounds in other countries in difficulty.  The need for greater and better Europe is felt with particular intensity, at this troubled time, also in terms of foreign policy. A process of increasing régionalisation is under way in the world. Increasingly manifest and structured macro-areas will be called upon to assume responsibility for managing the balance of the planet. It is a phenomenon that is born and develops by looking with appreciation – often with admiration – at our experience, at the model created by the European Union.  The world needs Europe and it needs a united Europe. Of a Europe that knows how to complete its organic design, and I am thinking of the Western Balkans area. The Union can foster the international convergences necessary for Syria, Iraq and Libya by seeking shared choices that effectively counter the forces of disorder and terror. Yesterday's tragic events confirm its urgency. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with the vote in May 2014, the citizens expressed the inescapable need for a change of pace on the part of the Union's institutions, in order to overcome any delay with regard to the indication of that horizon of values contained in the Treaties and in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the Union. I look with great respect and confidence to this House. The European Parliament has always played a leading role and Italy is one of the supporters of this institution, convinced as it is of its essential role in the process of gradually deepening the political issue of the European Union and consolidating its democratic foundation.  If the world turns to the example set by the European Union for non-dissimilar forms of growing peaceful cooperation elsewhere, the European shipyard cannot remain halfway there. We can't look back, other than to assess what we've left behind of mistrust, rivalry and confrontation which, in the last century, devastated us. Designing the future, starting from the difficulties and challenges we are experiencing, is the way to govern the present well, with its problems so serious.  I would like to remind you, once again, of Jean Monnet's statement: 'We cannot stop when the whole world is on the move'. In the wake of this exhortation, I wish you all the best of good work in the service of Europe and peace.

We have managed to conclude the negotiations on time and the very good news is that, for the first time in a long time, the Member States have unanimously approved this budget. This proves that we have found a compromise that suits both. I would like to congratulate the Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, Mr Jean Arthuis, the rapporteurs, Mr Fernandes and Mr Deprez, as well as Mrs Gardiazabal Rubial and Mr Geier, for their tireless work, and above all the Commission which has inaugurated, I believe, a more transparent procedure in order to reach a compromise more quickly and to avoid costs and reasons for anger in order to arrive with more serenity.

But the budgetary challenges are simply a reflection of the tragedies affecting Europe, the budget being, of course, an important element, but perhaps not the most difficult, as we know and as the previous discussion and the excellent speech of the Italian President also showed us very well.

My second point is that the Conference of Presidents will decide tomorrow, as far as I know, on the establishment of a so-called TAXE II Committee.

I would like to express my thanks for your objective tone and I would like to try to respond to it in a truly factual way. We have 24 official languages here, and it is absolutely impossible for anyone who understands Finnish to sit in the Portuguese cabin at every meeting. In other words, we also have a number of languages that are interpreted in the relay. The second interpreter has to wait for the first interpretation to be there. The English colleagues are still in a very privileged situation. But a number of colleagues sitting in this House have even become accustomed to it with Greek colleagues: this 'kat' is called 'against'! So I personally have never felt in any way misled by the \"for\", \"against\". That is one thing. So we cannot wait for that to be in every interpretation. Today, I believe, we have had 101 roll-call votes and at least as many open votes. If we invest ten more seconds for each vote, until every language is there, then we will completely swell. In other words, we must ensure efficiency. I've gotten used to talking to no one if someone thinks I've made the wrong decision. Suffice it for a colleague to call 'Check', then I will check the vote. Otherwise, I think I was wrong today. Today I really felt insecure about some things, because it was really confusing. Then I said of myself that we are doing an electronic check. Otherwise, this is a relatively easy exercise.

I tried to speak in a debate last night in the catch-the-eye where catch-the-eye was cancelled.

It ended on Friday and even Friday afternoon. As a result, there were three actual voting sessions. However, for some time now, all the votes have actually been concentrated on Wednesdays at noon. A neighbour of Ms. Le Pen was complained that she had voted for her once or twice, but on that day, for example, the voting session lasted two and a half hours. It must be understood that a number of colleagues also have physiological obligations, which can sometimes lead them to abstain from participating in our European democracy.  Therefore, I am not incriminating you at all. There are two remedies. A short-term remedy is to learn that in German dafar, dagegen, enthaltung, it means for, against and abstention, in Greek, iper, katà, apochi, etc. It does not take much experience to assimilate the language of each presiding officer.

The proposal was to increase the allocation of payment appropriations by an additional EUR 1506 million (on the heading \"security and citizenship\") and EUR 24 million under the heading \"Global Europe\", which is additional, basic and essential aid, given the dramatic development of this situation.

Efforts should be made to improve the monitoring of any unpaid bills, mainly through the establishment of an early warning system.

For Hungarian Ps, it is a success to reverse the reduction of the Pre-Accession Fund (IPA) previously proposed by the Council, as these instruments have a decisive impact on the accession aspirations of the candidate countries, such as Serbia and the Hungarians in Vojvodina. In addition to effective financial support, maintaining the level of the Pre-Accession Fund also sends an important political message and encouragement for candidate countries.

The European Union imports more than half of the energy needs, and at the same time the regions from which these energy sources come are becoming increasingly unstable, thus jeopardising the security of energy supplies. That is why the European Commission has established an Energy Union strategy.

However, additional staff and, consequently, resources are needed to carry out this important task.

After all, each country has its own peculiarities and comparative advantages, and any leveling in the tax field essentially wrongs and undermines the countries that have invested and emerged in the financial sector. With the same false rationale for a single tax rate in the EU, a single rate of VAT, uniform taxes and prices on consumer goods and many other absurdities must be imposed.

The Member States of the European Union have lost huge sums of money as a result of these unfair tax transactions, and this has profoundly hampered fair competition. I support the fact that large multinational corporations should pay taxes in the Member State where they carry out their economic activities and make profits, rather than legally shifting that profits to other Member States which grant tax credits to those companies. I fully support the right of states to compete in the field of taxation, but this competition must be fair. I agree that Member States need to coordinate their tax laws more in order not to create loopholes that companies would use to reduce the tax due.  I repeat that I support fair competition between the countries of the European Union in the field of taxation and believe that tax legislation should remain a national responsibility. Unfortunately, the report consists of proposals that would undermine the sovereignty of the Member States in this area, and i therefore abstained in the vote.

The outcome of the work is summarised in this report, which analyses the current situation and outlines recommendations for the future. The final text is rather satisfactory, as many of the points listed as necessary are the same as those I have been advocating for a long time: public and comprehensible country-by-country reporting, a full CCCTB to be carried out in the immediate future, an automatic and comprehensive exchange between Member States on tax arrangements.

To this end, it will be necessary to convene the whole society and various areas of knowledge and action. It is also an ideological battle against fear and the values that are most dear to us.

The fight against the radicalisation of EU citizens is primarily the responsibility of the Member States, but the mutual cooperation of states, particularly in the area of the exchange of intelligence on these individuals, is crucial for preventing radicalisation and terrorism. A common approach is therefore needed, as these are EU-wide issues. The latter is malnourished in ensuring an adequate level of safety and this needs to be changed. I also supported the report because it is about developing a comprehensive strategy to prevent radicalisation, which must provide longer-term solutions for the security of European citizens.

Counter-terrorism is not worth shortcuts, and that is just what this report seeks through the recommendation of populist measures.

Attention has been drawn to the need to improve the system for monitoring and exchanging information on persons coming from outside the EU's external borders and moving between Member States and analysing websites with a view to spreading content praising terrorism. An important point is also the call for greater education of those at risk of radicalisation and dialogue between leaders of different communities.

The key word here is prevention and we must fight radicalisation with proactive measures such as close cooperation between law enforcement agencies, effective management of our external borders and targeted cooperation with third countries, inter-cultural dialogue, the role of the religious community in countering fundamentalism, hate speech and terrorist propaganda, and through the education of social and civic values to prevent marginalisation.

The report deals in particular with the prevention of radicalisation and recruitment of EU citizens by terrorist organisations and calls for an action plan on the part of the Commission. Among other things, the rapporteur highlights the problem that radicalisation often takes place in overcrowded prisons, which is why guidelines and training for staff and educational programmes for prisoners to prevent radicalisation in prisons are to be implemented here. Other areas of action include the fight against online recruitment, training in educational institutions, the need for an EU Directive on PNR and enhanced cooperation between law enforcement authorities in the Member States within existing systems. These include, for example, the Schengen Information System (SIS) and other platforms.

Last week, for the first time, MPs and imams who rejected the extremist interpretation of Islam discussed the causes of interfaith tensions and the directions for joint action. Today's report underlines the importance of education and interfaith dialogue as key areas for preventing radicalisation. The events in Paris have reinforced our findings in our working group that, in today's difficult times, there is a real need for a partnership of credible teachers, regular dialogue, as extremists spread distorted, misinterpreted interpretations of Islam among our citizens.

We must recall that religious communities continue to be an integral part of society and their importance will not diminish in the future.

Today, instead of giving weapons to Europeans so that they can defend themselves, they are discussing how to restrict access to it.

This year alone, Europe has been repeatedly hit by terrorist acts. Most recently, with the horrific attack in Paris, it has become clear that we need to address the root of the problem, radicalisation.  Often the terrorists are European citizens who were born and raised here but who have been radicalised and recruited to commit atrocities. That practice needs to be stopped. That is why we support the report's message on combating radicalisation and recruitment.  However, we are far from in agreement with all the tools presented in the report. Despite this, we have chosen to support the report. Our position is that the EU should contribute where it brings European added value, for example through the sharing of best practices, police cooperation and, above all, PNR.

When we talk about radicalisation, we need to have an overview of the factors that contributed to radicalisation.

This report is the official response of the EP to this and has been reinforced by several green amendments which focus on 'better prevention than cure'. We call on the Commission to come up with a comprehensive strategy on occupational exposure to endocrine disruptors. We ask for recognition of risks associated with stress at work, including burnout. The existing directives on health and safety at work should also not be eroded by the European Commission's REFIT programme, which seeks to simplify legislation, which can also have negative consequences for the health and safety of workers.

It is difficult to say this figure without being ashamed; it is difficult to say this figure without understanding that behind the numbers there are truncated lives, lives of women who have been killed by machismo, by the machismo it kills, by those who think that women are their property, by those who understand that society is not egalitarian. And in the face of this figure, in the face of this reality, today, 25 November, we have the responsibility, we have an obligation to raise our voices, to avoid silence, to commit ourselves, to work to end the largest social scourge that the world currently has and which Europe currently has. We have to take responsibility. It's time to leave the ads, it's time to leave the words and it's time to act, because women can't wait any longer, because day after day we see in the media, in the news, as there are women who, just because they are women, are killed, their lives are truncated and the lives of their sons and daughters are truncated.  We need to live in a more egalitarian society. We need to make commitments: it's our obligation, it's our responsibility. And that is why we are launching a number of questions to the European Commission today. This is not the first time that this debate has brought us to Parliament's plenary and we hope, with today's debate, to have the European Commission's commitments for all the work that needs to be done from now on.  We want to know when the European Commission is going to present the strategy of equality between men and women. This Parliament has already ruled on what the content of this strategy should be, and it is essential for us that a large part of the policy aimed at equality between men and women takes priority in the fight against gender-based violence.  But besides, we want to know other things. The European institutions have already taken some steps in this area. The victim protection order was an essential element. Less than a year ago, the deadline for Member States to transpose has been met. We want to know when the European Commission intends to make known to us the assessment of how the implementation of this European protection order has worked.  But we also understand that it is essential that legislative action can be taken. This is not the first time, Mrs Jourová, that you have heard this complaint from the European Parliament. Only with measures to support organizations, with awareness-raising programmes will we not solve this situation. It is necessary to legislate because legislation is a compromise, the legislation implies an obligatory compliance with the legislation by the Member States to combat gender-based violence.  We have heard on many occasions to say that there is no level of competition in Europe to combat gender-based violence, but we do not resign ourselves and believe that things can be changed, because – I have said it more times in these debates – if we have managed to give Europe competences in the fight against the economic crisis, we will also be able to seek the skills that Europe must have to combat gender-based violence , to fight for a fairer and more egalitarian society.  So let us all look for one - the Council, the Commission, Parliament – to seek that legislative capacity, because we cannot continue to wait, we cannot continue to make announcements that are simply left in that, in compromises, and which then do not translate into realities.  We are talking about women's lives, about the lives of half the population of Europe. They deserve our respect, they deserve to be aware that it is in our hands to do much more than is being done so far.  This is an issue that should involve us all, all institutions, at all levels. It is already necessary to join all efforts because women deserve it; because the memory of all those who have been killed by sexist terrorists deserves our work; because we are talking about the future of our generation, but also that of our daughters; because it's our responsibility and it's our obligation.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1763, "date": "2015-11-25.json", "name": "Věra Jourová", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, I would like to thank you for raising this very important and serious subject on the occasion of the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women. It is an important political signal that both Parliament and the Commission decided to join the UN Women’s Orange Day campaign to mark the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women and to light up their buildings in orange today. Violence against women remains a challenge in every country in Europe. In 2015 women are still beaten, humiliated, raped, mutilated, stalked, harassed and forced into marriage. Violence happens in their homes at the hands of their partners or family members. It happens in the workplace or in education from colleagues, fellow students, professors or bosses. It can happen on the streets or online from strangers. We know that one in three women in the EU has experienced physical or sexual violence or both. Violence has a lifelong impact on the health and wellbeing of victims, as well as on their families. This in turn has an impact on the economy and society as a whole. Promoting gender equality and combating violence against women go hand in hand. Women need to be empowered to leave abusive relationships and to challenge violence when they encounter it. They should not be hampered in fulfilling their potential in the workplace and in society. I will present in December a detailed Commission plan and commitment on improving gender equality in the years to come. I am prepared to submit also to the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality (FEMM) the proposal for the Gender Strategic Document for the years 2016 to 2019. We have worked on this with all stakeholders throughout this year, and your input in the process was also very valuable. Among the priorities it will include further measures to support Member States in preventing and combating all forms of gender-based violence. Regarding gender-based violence, the Commission is taking a determined and comprehensive approach based on legislation, awareness-raising and funding, as well as improving knowledge and data collection. I will start by focusing on legislation. The EU adopted legislation to prevent violence against women and to protect and support its victims, including in areas such as sexual harassment, trafficking in human beings, sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children and child pornography. Our modern victims’ rights in the Victims Directive, on which we have worked closely with you, just entered into force on 16 November this year. This will have a huge impact on some Member States, for instance those which will have to establish victim support structures, which are of key importance for gender-based violence and which do not exist in all Member States yet. You can count on my commitment that the Commission will be guiding and monitoring the effective implementation of this piece of legislation, as well as the broader legal framework. We have to ensure that available protection measures are actually granted to persons at risk and applied in practice. Since January 2015, victims of domestic violence have benefited from reinforced protection when travelling or moving to other EU countries. Protection orders granted in their home country can circulate across EU borders. The transposition situation is encouraging. Thanks to enforcement procedures initiated by the Commission, we now have national rules transposing the European Protection Orders Directive in 21 Member States. I am glad to inform you also that on 9 October the Commission published a roadmap on future accession of the EU to the Council of Europe’s Istanbul Convention. The roadmap is a first concrete step towards accession to this powerful tool to combat violence against women and domestic violence. EU accession to the Convention would reflect our commitment to combating human rights violations and discrimination, both within and beyond the EU. The Commission also supports awareness-raising and concrete grassroots actions by Member States, civil society organisations and European networks. This year, EUR 8 million was allocated to combating violence against women under the Rights, Equality and Citizenship Programme. We have also empowered advocates for change among female genital mutilation-practising communities, trained services for victims of sexual violence in universities to better respond to incidents and young victims’ needs, and supported Member States in sensitising the general public to this problem. I am proud to inform you about last week’s decision to award a total amount of EUR 4.3 million to nine international projects combating violence against women linked to harmful practices. Within the framework of this awareness-raising work, I am also committed to putting into place focused actions on violence against women in 2017. We are currently planning future activities and would welcome your cooperation. I would also like to say a few words about the importance of improving our knowledge about the causes of gender-based violence on a regular basis. It is essential because it allows for monitoring of the situation across the EU and also helps us to formulate and implement better policies. My services are working with Eurostat and the European Institute for Gender Equality, two key actors in this area which, I believe, can help to fill the gaps. Finally, let me be clear that I see a need to address cyber-violence against women and girls – an emerging form of violence. We have EU legislation and policies on children’s – including girls’ – safety and protection from bullying, abuse and exploitation online. In addition, the Commission has launched a EUR 3 million call for proposals to combat sexual harassment and sexual violence against women and girls, including through new technologies and social media. Proposals are now being assessed.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1764, "date": "2015-11-25.json", "name": "Teresa JIMÉNEZ-BECERRIL BARRIO", "mepid": "96806", "text": "  PPE Group. – Mr President, Commissioner Jourová, thank you for your commitment to the victims. Today is International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women and some can still wonder why this day. Well, because it's critical that society reacts. All efforts are few to raise awareness and promote strong actions to put an end to this scourge, which we cannot get used to. The dynamics of \"I don't see, I don't hear and I don't talk\" have to end. It is necessary to break that wall built with the fear and loneliness of the victim, because the one who wins, in the face of that desperate silence, is the aggressor, who feels strong to continue to mistreat, harass and, at worst, kill that woman whom he claims to love. Most cases of violence against women come from their partner and, in the case of children, from people around them. It is important that victims report, but to do so they have to feel protected. I am therefore proud to have been rapporteur for the European Order for the Protection of Victims, so that national restraining orders are recognised in any European country, which promotes the safety of women fleeing their assailants. There is still a long way to go in European legislation. That is why we have put forward this oral question, in order to know what European strategy the Commission is carrying out. Greater commitment is needed to eradicate this human rights violation, which is a consequence of inequality between men and women. An estimated 35% of women and girls experience some form of physical or sexual violence throughout their lives. And this has to stop, because I firmly believe that if we work in education, also in prevention, in victim protection and, of course, in greater control of aggressors, we can avoid so much pain caused by these violations, which so often even young women do not distinguish. Love doesn't have to hurt or control, and of course it doesn't have to kill.

Seven women a day now die from femicide, which simply means dying by being a woman. These include genital mutilation, human trafficking and sexual exploitation.  We want to say, quite simply, enough! That is enough, because it is unbearable to see that today in Europe we practice this laissez-faire in relation to these discriminations. Commissioner, Article 8 of the Lisbon Treaty simply says that we must ensure equality between men and women in Europe. You are the guardian of these treaties in the European Commission.

Gender violence is also a men’s issue and, above all, a sad and a shameful reality. As has already been indicated in different interventions, at some point in their life, one in three women and girls experience physical or sexual violence from men. Most shockingly, almost half of this violence is committed by the partner of the victim, causing 2 500 deaths every year in the EU. That is seven women each day losing their lives because of sexual assault, domestic violence, relationship abuse or female genital mutilation. Let us recognise that, for too long, men have avoided the issue of violence against women and often cast it aside as being just a women’s issue, and I think that is the problem. As long as gender violence is seen as a women’s issue, men disconnect and we – men – must break the violence. Impunity for committing violence against women should be a thing of the past and justice needs to prevail for all those women who are victims. For that to happen, I would say to the Commissioner that I think we need an EU-wide strategy to combat violence against women. Many EU countries do indeed have laws today protecting women against such violence, but there are also many others that do not have them and which could do much better. The Istanbul Convention, initiated by the Council of Europe, in fact obliges countries to fully address violence against women in all its forms, to prevent it, to protect the victims and to prosecute the perpetrators, but so far the reality is that the Istanbul Convention has only been ratified by 12 Member States of the European Union. That is why I think we need to do something special, namely EU accession – the accession of the whole European Union – to the Istanbul Convention so as to close the loopholes in European and national legislation, to protect women far better and certainly to condemn countries with blood on their hands. So zero tolerance in the fight against gender violence is, in fact, the only way to address it, and we – not only women, but men and women – must unite and speak out, and that means break the silence.

Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating Mr Violence against women is a terror that goes on in silence. It takes lives and it shrinks our living spaces. We live in a culture that actually accepts that men's violence and abuse of women can continue. It is a culture that keeps public figures who have committed blatant abuses of the bodies of girls and women on their backs, or even pays tribute to them. I am thinking of former IMF base Dominique Strauss-Kahn. I think of the singer of Noir désir, Cantat, who murdered his girlfriend. I'm thinking of Roman Polanski. The list can be made longer with men from all our countries. We are here today because this Parliament has called for European legislation with minimum levels to combat violence against women, and we are not going to let go of that issue. In solidarity with the women of Europe and the world, I call for the Istanbul Convention to be ratified now. I demand the right to legal assistance and specially trained police and social services. I demand a judiciary that provides justice for those who are vulnerable. I call on the EU Member States to draw up action plans to combat gender-based violence. I also call for women's shelters – women's shelters that work day in and day out with women who have been victims of gender-based violence – to be properly supported and resourced. They are a source of knowledge and they are our fellow sisters in this work. I also want girls to have access to feminist self-defense. It is an obvious way to strengthen self-esteem and strength in young girls. We must stand up to the violence that restricts our lives against the culture of violence and the culture of silence that we have. A culture that blames women and woos men. We have to break with it.

The figures have already been said, but I will repeat them because they are terribly monstrous: one in three European women have experienced some form of violence and one in four, some sexual assault.  Is Europe going to recognize you once and for all? This is our first security issue. And how do we deal with it? Some Member States of the European Union still have laws that conceal, protect or disguise this violence.  In this question we present to you, Commissioner, we ask you for solutions, urgent solutions, because every day women are killed by someone who believes themselves to be their master and lord, to the point of taking their lives, and every day many women must flee and leave their home, despite being the victims, in order to seek some safe haven.  We can't wait. We need strong pressure against those governments which do not do what they should, because they are complicit in the killers, and we are urged by a European directive against sexist violence. We need the maximum involvement of the European institutions.  Mrs. Jourová, I see you resigned.

Yes, we all have to do more; not only the European Commission, we must act at all levels. You mentioned that the Commission is the guardian of the Treaties and especially Article 8, which is the equality article. I am very much concerned about equality and I want to bring about effective actions using effective instruments. You call for new legislation. I said clearly that we are going to accede to the Istanbul Convention. As regards a possible new directive on combating violence against women, I myself do not think that a new directive is something that will solve the problem quickly. Just look at the process of preparing European legislation. I am not criticising it, but even if we find a legal basis for this, it would take several years to bring it into force in the Member States and to allow it to do its work. So I am talking about other instruments. I am declaring here that there is a problem with the legal basis for legislation, because violence against women is a criminal wrongdoing. So it is up to the Member States to use their competences in criminal law. We can, and we must do what we can. We will do it through accession to the Istanbul Convention, which gives us the competences to act also in the legislative sphere. What I see as the more efficient instrument is to invest the available funding into efficient awareness-raising, into campaigning, into support for grassroots organisations and civil society and into the training of experts and professionals in order to further help the victims of violence. As regards other actors who the Commission is prepared to support, we must first of all talk about the Member States that we are supporting, but at the same time who we are pushing to enforce legislation which must improve the situation. We must speak openly about society as such, because violence against women in many Member States is happening with silent acceptance within society as if it is something normal. In some Member States this is even silently accepted by the media. So we should look in this direction and together try to improve the situation. Local communities must not be blind and deaf. They must understand that something is happening around them. Let us speak about the victims themselves. Ladies and gentlemen, I have the recent statistics and the research saying that only 15% of violence against women has been reported to the relevant authorities. Yes, the victims remain silent, and that is also because they do not have enough trust in the authorities that they will act to help them. This is what the Victims Directive is about: that victims should not fear reporting violence and that they could expect efficient support from the relevant authorities. And finally – and Mr Verhofstadt mentioned this – we should consider men themselves. Yes, they must also do something to improve the situation. I was in Sweden recently where they have very good programmes specifically focused on men, who have an essential role to play in combating violence against women because, without their understanding that the situation must improve, we cannot change anything. This is a complex issue. This requires a list of many measures done by many different actors on many levels. So let us do it.

Violence against women is universal and affects all Member States, which is why the European Union as a whole should develop a common strategy to combat it. The Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women, recognised as the gold standard for anti-violence policies, is one of the most effective legal tools in the fight against gender-based violence. The Convention makes it clear that nothing, including elements of religion or culture, can justify violence, and prevention is rightly based on linking anti-violence policy to gender equality policy. The Istanbul Convention also guarantees the introduction of concrete, effective measures in the fight against violence, such as a 24-hour hotline and shelters for victims of violence or interrogation procedures to protect against secondary victimisation. The popularity of the Convention is evidenced by the fact that 25 EU countries have already signed it, twelve of which have ratified it. In order to support and speed up these processes, everything must be done to ensure that the EU accedes to the Convention as a party.

When we reasoned about the causes, we talked about machist culture, how to educate men to respect their wives, sisters, friends, daughters. I myself have often written and talked about all this. I still consider this to be valid and important. However, I have learned that to change things we cannot wait for others to change. It's got to be us.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Valletta Summit on Migration has enabled us to give concrete expression to the Union's commitments. Strengthen our political cooperation with African partners at all levels to address the root causes of illegal migration and to combat migrant trafficking and human trafficking. The final declaration and action plan approved in Valletta reflect the success of this approach in advancing dialogue and cooperation with African countries. Let me stress, first of all, the high level of participation of European and African countries. A large majority were represented at the level of heads of state and government. This is a testament to the political importance that everyone in Europe and Africa is attaching to the challenges we are currently facing. Now it is a matter of ensuring that these political commitments also translate into such firm commitments in the implementation of the action plan. I would like to highlight the most innovative aspects of the documents adopted. First, the essentially pragmatic and operational nature of these texts based on a number of well-identified actions in each area of intervention. These actions aim to promote sustainable economic, social and environmental development. The summit agreed on the implementation of 16 priority initiatives by the end of 2016, as the first response.  Secondly, the action plan must be read in an overall logic. The implementation of the various measures must therefore take place in parallel. The five chapters of the action plan are the fight against root causes, irregular migration, legal migration and mobility, protection and asylum, the prevention of irregular migration and migrant trafficking, return, readmission and reintegration. These chapters form a package that fits our joint priorities. Advances in one area will allow progress to be made simultaneously in other areas. Thirdly, the content of the action plan is fully in line with the conclusions of the European Council and the Council on the importance of the return and readmission of irregular migrants. For the first time in the Euro-African dialogue on migration, there is a clear and joint commitment to implement specific measures to facilitate the sustainable return and reintegration of irregular migrants.  As stated in the summit's final declaration, cooperation on return and reintegration can only strengthen Europe's migration and mobility policy, making it more efficient and comprehensive. Finally, we are committed to allocating the appropriate resources to the implementation of these measures using all available financial instruments as well as the New Union Emergency Fund. We have also decided to use the existing dialogue structures, the Rabat and Khartoum processes, as well as the European Union-Africa dialogue on migration and mobility to monitor the operational aspects of the action plan.  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on the G20 summit, I would now like to report on the results of the summit in Antalya, to which the Union was represented by the President of the European Council and the President of the Commission. The G20 results are positive for Europeans. There are many points of convergence between the G20 and the European Union in assessing the current situation and the priorities identified. In its statement on terrorism, the G20 condemned the cowardly attacks in Paris and Ankara. He noted that terrorism cannot and should not be associated with a religion, nationality, civilization or ethnic origin. In fact, what was amply expressed this morning during the debate. The G20 also stressed its determination to work together to prevent terrorism by strengthening cooperation in full compliance with the central role of the United Nations and in accordance with Security Council resolutions and the UN's global counter-terrorism strategy. G20 leaders also took an interest in the financing of terrorism and called for the rapid implementation of the Financial Action Task Force's standards in all jurisdictions. In addition, they stressed the importance of a comprehensive approach based on the willingness to address the factors that promote terrorism. I will not dwell on the migration side of the work that I have just referred to on Valletta, so I will focus on the economic issues that have been discussed at the G20 or, less, on some of them. In Antalya, leaders focused their work on the G20's priority objective of achieving strong, sustainable and balanced growth. They reaffirmed their commitment, expressed in Brisbane last year, to increase the overall GDP of G20 countries by an additional 2% by 2018. At the root of this ambition is the fact that global growth is uneven and still below expectations, despite positive prospects in some major economies, including the European Union. At this stage, half of the commitments in the G20 growth strategies, which include both demand support measures and structural reforms, have already been implemented, resulting in more than one-third of the 2% target. In addition to the commitments made in national growth strategies, I would like to emphasize the G20's focus on investment, particularly in the case of country-specific strategies for this year. These strategies bring together concrete measures to improve the investment environment. I am particularly pleased to see that in Antalya, special attention has been paid to private sector participation in small and medium-sized enterprises and financial intermediation and that Antalya's action plan has a direct reference to the investment plan for Europe. Investment is one of our top concerns. In this regard, I would like to welcome the fact that the European Parliament has approved the candidates for the positions of Executive Director and Deputy Executive Director of the European Fund for Strategic Investments. We can now look forward to seeing it become fully operational. On international taxation, which was also on the agenda of the leaders, they endorsed the package of measures concerning the erosion of the tax base and the transfer of profits. They recognized that broad and consistent implementation would be essential to ensure the effectiveness of this project, particularly with regard to the exchange of information on advance cross-border tax decisions. An inclusive framework for the implementation of the BEPS project will be developed by the OECD in early 2016. Taxation is another major common priority for the Eu and the G20 and the Presidency is actively pursuing its work to combat tax evasion and evasion and aggressive tax optimisation. In particular, the Council has recently reached an agreement on the automatic exchange of information on advance tax decisions and this directive will be adopted in December. In this context, the report of the SPECIAL committee TAXE will certainly be a valuable contribution to the continuation of debates in this area. Let me conclude by briefly mentioning the progress or rather the lack of progress in implementing the IMF quota and governance reforms, agreed in 2010. In this area, the top priority for the G20 as well as for the European Union remains the implementation of the reforms, but the United States has again been asked to ratify them as soon as possible, which it has, of course, not yet done.

The issue of migration is here to stay. Demography and economy tell us so. The first message that we shared in Malta was this: migration and refugee flows are a phenomenon that concerns both Europe and Africa, as we are all at the same time countries of origin, countries of transit and countries of destination, in Europe and in Africa. There are more migrants and refugees on the move within Africa itself than from Africa to Europe, and we are together in this: in Africa and in Europe. This is the basis of our partnership. Building walls on our frontiers is no solution, and it definitely is not an option in the middle of the sea. That is evident to everybody. It will not stop migration; it will only weaken our international standing and our credibility. The current migratory and refugee crisis has sparked strong emotions in recent months, including in Europe: good ones and bad ones, compassion as well as fear. But our duty as politicians is to act rationally. We must finally put in place a mechanism for human mobility fit for the 21st century, a mechanism that stems irregular migration and the exploitation of human suffering, including through return and readmission agreements, but also a mechanism that allows effective legal mobility to the benefit of both countries of origin and countries of destination, and their societies. Mobility can benefit both Europe and Africa. It must happen legally and safely, not by turning the Mediterranean and the Sahara into mass graves. This is the core message of Valletta and the basis of our partnership, of our common work, with our African friends. To do so, as the Presidency just reminded us, we focused on five clusters of actions in Malta. One: addressing root causes of irregular migration and forced displacement; two: legal migration and mobility; three: protection and asylum; four: the fight against irregular migration; and five: return, readmission and reintegration. We identified within those clusters nearly 90 individual broad actions that we will implement before the end of 2016. Let me be completely sincere with you today; you know me by now, I always tend to be so. The conversation – especially the preparation of the summit – has not been easy at times. It has been tense at times, not only between the Europeans and the Africans but also within the two different groups – among Europeans and among African countries. But I think our discussion has helped us a lot, as we managed to find common ground and an understanding on all the most relevant issues. As happens quite often in our work with our African friends, the preparation was sometimes tense, but the summit itself and the beginning of the follow-up on implementation were extremely positive and fruitful. Our approach to our African partners is not about putting money on the table and asking for readmission in exchange. I am also very clear on this here, just as I was with our African friends. It is not about using development aid as a bargaining chip in our negotiations on migration management. That would not only be against all our values but also against our own interests, because it would not work. The right approach – the approach we suggested to our African friends – is to develop common instruments and the related means, including financial ones, to effectively manage together a complex phenomenon that concerns both Europeans and Africans. We have a common issue to deal with. We have to develop useful and effective tools, and we have to allocate resources to have those tools effectively implemented. It is a partnership. Yes, there is a strong link between how we invest our development money and how we manage migration. That is clear. In the long run, migration will only be manageable if we favour Africa’s growth and stability. This is why in Malta we signed the Constitutive Agreement of a Trust Fund for Africa. As President Juncker mentioned this morning, this has already been on the table as a Commission proposal for some months. But in Malta we actually signed the starting point of this Trust Fund, which is an additional tool to tackle the root causes of poverty and irregular migration. The Commission is putting EUR 1.8 billion into it and Member States have started to top up that figure, and I encourage them to continue to do so consistently – and I underline consistently. It will finance job opportunities, especially for young people and women. It will prop up projects focused on addressing the root causes of forced displacement. It will reinforce the resilience of communities touched by the transit of migratory flows, build capacity in management of refugee flows and migration flows (which are in nature quite different one from the other) and focus too on support to internally displaced people, which are all things that our African friends tell us they need support on, because they themselves are hosting on their territory hundreds of thousands of refugees and migrants, something that as Europeans we hardly realise. At the same time, we have started to draw up a new system to discourage irregular flows and develop dialogues on legal mobility. This includes more cooperation from our African friends on readmissions as well as on the capacity of host countries and host communities to reintegrate returnees. I myself have been in Ethiopia to a project that we finance on facilitating the reintegration of returnees, not in that case from the European Union but from a different region, and I have seen with my own eyes that young women and girls especially – but also young boys, very young ones – if supported, and if their communities are supported in offering them a decent and an open perspective for the future, are not only glad to be back but are also passing on a message to their fellows citizens that embarking on dangerous trips across the desert or across the Mediterranean is not necessarily a good idea. Again, I stress in parallel that we have to strengthen the legal and regular channels for migration, because that is the safe way of tackling mobility among us. The fight against the smuggling and the trafficking and the work to strengthen resilience must go hand in hand. This is the reason why we agreed to implement in parallel the actions of all five clusters; together, not one before the other. The next steps will build on the Rabat and Khartoum Processes – we do not need to reinvent mechanisms, we have to use correctly the existing mechanisms – through a number of meetings at senior official level but also by identifying already now, together with our African partners – not only national governments but also local authorities and NGOs – concrete projects to be financed by the Trust Fund in partnership with all our African friends. In this respect I have engaged in these months in high-level meetings with African partners, from countries of origin and transit, and also themselves of destination. I can quote some numbers that are really impressive. I have done so in Ethiopia, in Niger, in North Africa – all of their countries – and last week again in Chad, where, let me say with a certain pride, for the first time the European Union was invited to the G5 Sahel Summit – just one week after the Malta Summit – which is, I believe, testimony to the fact that the political partnership among us is strong and is getting stronger. We are trying to build a stronger partnership with Africa, a partnership that is fit for the huge challenges ahead. Let me be very clear on this: while we focus on the challenge of migration, we have to keep in mind that we have plenty of other common issues. We need to build a partnership with Africa, because our partnership with Africa is not limited to migration or the management of refugee flows. It is part of a much bigger picture. In the current crisis, governing migration is among the interests we share, Europeans and Africans alike. But again, we have security on our table, we have climate change on our table; we have development, energy, counter-radicalisation and job opportunities for our youth, in Europe and in Africa. We have a proper political – and not only political – partnership that includes plenty of other issues, one in which migration management is one of the pieces of the puzzle that brings us together with them. On all of these issues – and especially on security, but mainly on migration, which is the issue of today’s debate – we can only deal with these different challenges together. Valletta was a first step. We have started building trust between us and also rational solutions that can stand the test of time. This is the challenge of our generation, and the cooperation of this Parliament and of Europe as a whole will be crucial to its success. Also because again, and I stress this, our partnership with African countries is not limited to institutions at governmental level. We also need to look beyond that. The refugee crisis was also part of the discussion at the G20 Summit in Antalya, as was mentioned. The European Union called on the G20 to contribute to a coherent international response to the crisis in the spirit of international solidarity. Our G20 partners acknowledged that the current crisis is not just an issue for Europe but a global one. They agreed to support efforts to protect and assist refugees, including through increased humanitarian aid and resettlement, and to improve the capabilities of international organisations, which is key for us as well. The statement also underlines the need to address the root causes of these unprecedented refugee flows, I stress again, all over the world. Of course, the summit focused very much on the response to the terrorist attacks in Paris. The G20 leaders have unanimously condemned these terrorist acts and pledged to increase their cooperation in the fight against terrorism. As you know and as was mentioned, a separate statement was adopted on this issue. They also stressed the importance of a comprehensive approach to countering terrorism, founded on relevant UN Security Council resolutions, and the UN Global Counter-Terrorism strategy. They undertook specifically to tackle the financing channels for terrorism and foreign terrorist fighters, which we know very well is going to be key if we really want to put an end to this. Let me also address briefly the economic and financial outcomes of the summit. The overall focus was on the continued but uneven global recovery. The euro area was not in the spotlight, thanks to the progress we have made on our own economic policy strategy. The summit focused on developing economies, stressing the risks that raising inequalities posed to economic growth. In particular, the leaders focused on youth employment and pledged to reduce by 15%, by 2025, the share of young people at risk of being permanently left behind in the labour market. G20 leaders reaffirmed the objective to lift the G20 collective gross domestic product by an additional 2% by 2018. Updated national growth strategies were set out in the Antalya Action Plan, which endorses several European initiatives, including the Investment Plan, the Single Market Strategy and the new Trade Strategy. New country-specific investment strategies were adopted to improve the investment climate and policy recommendations on small and medium enterprises financing. This complements our efforts under the European Plan for Investment and the Capital Markets Union. The G20 agreed on a loss-absorbing capacity standard for global systemically-important banks. This is important to ensure that taxpayers do not have to bear the burden of global financial stability in the future. A crucial step forward was made towards a fairer global business tax regime so that companies pay taxes where they make their profits. Leaders adopted the G20 OECD-based erosion and profit shifting package of measures, including mandatory exchange of tax rulings to counter harmful tax practices. I will stop here. I am looking forward to hearing the views of this House, which I always value a lot, but I will have to ask to be excused for now. I have just seen that the scheduled time for the debate is two hours and 40 minutes and as we are late, I am afraid I will have to leave you before the end of the debate. I have asked Commissioner Stylianides to be here for the reply, as I will have to join all my colleagues, not only from the European side but also from the Mediterranean side, as tomorrow we will celebrate together the 20th anniversary of the Union for the Mediterranean. You will understand better than I how relevant this meeting will be, at this particular moment, to send a message of unity across the Mediterranean, across our cultures, across our societies, standing together in front of the many challenges we have migration-wise, but also security-wise. So I apologise if I am not here to respond to your observations, but I will be here most of the time to listen to them very carefully.

So let's be realistic. The reasons for the crisis are clear: war, poverty, climate change, hunger, disease, lack of opportunity. Any of us would do our best to get to Europe if we were in one of those situations. As long as these problems remain across our borders, the unstoppable flow of migrants and refugees will not end. That is why the Valletta summit has been so important, because, for the first time, Europe and Africa have looked each other in the eye and told the truth: if we do not change the terrible reality of Africa, it will be impossible to maintain the comfortable reality of Europe. On the other hand, we all share a priority, As Mrs Mogherini has already said: to do what is possible, to save the lives of those who are at risk, by the circumstances in which they live or by the long journey to which they are subjected by human traffickers. And we must congratulate ourselves on the reach of important agreements at the Valletta summit, such as the fight against mafias or cooperation with countries of origin and transit. This summit has also served to approve a trust fund for Africa, which is a major step forward. But let us keep in mind that, without sufficient euros — and the Member States must put them — the results of the Valletta summit will become wet paper. And the same will happen if development aid is left by intermediaries and does not meet their objectives. Let us be realistic, no country in the European Union can stand up to this crisis on its own. We have common problems, but also common capabilities. If we don't use them in common, we'll fail. Ladies and gentlemen, we are a community of solidarity and shared values. For us the words \"dignity\" and \"human rights\" have a high meaning. That is why we must make clear, once again, an issue: we cannot mix immigration and terrorism, because those who knock on our doors do so by fleeing terrorism. Just as Europeans spend the twentieth century fleeing Nazism, communism, fascism or war, now many citizens come to Europe persecuted by those same enemies. Refugees are not terrorists, they are their victims. Refugees don't hide terrorists, they run away from them. To be afraid of refugees by terrorists is to make them pay for terrorism twice. With the attacks in Paris, London or Madrid, Europeans are in an extraordinary and exceptional situation. Well, this situation is the daily lives of refugees knocking on Europe's door. It's unbelievable that there are those who don't understand it yet. Still, let's be realistic. We must strengthen our external borders so that no one is tempted to build new internal borders. Schengen is a collective success that we cannot put at risk. States with external borders have a great responsibility to others, and those without external borders must be involved in their protection. There is no country in the world that does not defend its external borders, and if the European Union were to leave its external borders, it would not last a week. In short, Mrs Mogherini, Mr Minister, we have a lot of work ahead of us. This crisis is not going to end tomorrow, nor is it going to end in a year. It is, as has been said, a crisis for an entire generation. Therefore, what we need is not single-summit measures, but a real common policy of immigration and asylum. That must be the effort of the entire legislature.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1794, "date": "2015-11-25.json", "name": "Gianni PITTELLA", "mepid": "4436", "text": "  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Minister, Madam Vice-President, world peace is under threat at this time. We must do everything possible to ensure that tensions between Russia and Turkey do not degenerate. An international investigation is needed to understand what has happened, but in the meantime the Russians are refraining from retaliatory action. If anyone thinks that through this incident we can sabotage the construction of a broad alliance against Daish, they are very wrong. We will be united against terror. The European Union's action is decisive: to mediate and to reach common ground, to facilitate an understanding. This is our mission and it is the real weapon against terror. And this is the excellent work that Vice-President Federica Mogherini is doing.  The alliance with muslim countries must not be limited solely to the fight against Isis. In recent decades, mainly because of the bush administration's misconceptions, the area of instability has spread like wildfire and now affects not only the Middle East but also Central Asia and black Africa. Having contributed to the current disaster, the West – and I am referring to our American friends – must not retreat into splendid isolation.  We need an offensive, first and foremost a diplomatic one. We must make it clear to our partners in the region, but also to ourselves, that the time from ambiguity is over. You cannot sanction Daish in words and then tolerate your citizens ing it. We must be clear, even with ourselves. In the past, we have made mistakes in our relations with many Arab countries. The time for double standards is over – it must be over – so radical Islamists are bad except those with whom we do business. On the Valletta Summit, I do not hide our only partial satisfaction, I say this frankly to the Vice-President. We said this yesterday in our group. Progress has certainly been made. However, the tacit exchange between African and European rulers that has characterised our nations in recent years has been re-proposed, at least in appearance. In exchange for some funding, African governments pledged and pledged to slow migration flows. The Trust Fund for Africa is a good thing but currently has little financial resources. You're right. We do not need to make a do ut des but to make a political and economic pact with Africa. That's what it takes! Not a utilitarian approach for us but an approach aimed at enhancing cooperation, with equal dignity, between us and Africa.  I will end on a note that I think is true: we must not be afraid of terrorism. This continent, our Europe, with its history, with its strength, with its resources, has the capacity to annihilate a handful of fanatics and bastards. In order to do this, however, we must remain calm, be united and avoid the mistakes of the past that we are still paying for.

Whilst migration may not have dominated the news in the last week or two, that does not mean that the challenges we face have faded away. Valletta highlighted the need for more international cooperation, but it also illustrated that Europe needs to harness all of its political will and political persuasion to find solutions for the humanitarian crisis before us. Valletta was an important step, but I believe that, in many ways, there were also a number of missed opportunities. Valletta should be seen only as a starting point for the more ambitious agreements we must arrive at in the future. The missed opportunities I referred to include the need to find agreement on readmission policies. Readmission and returns must form a central focus of our long-term cooperation with our non-EU partners. It is a fact that our asylum systems simply cannot work if these agreements are not in place. Merely having more avenues for legal migration and for more EU funds will not solve the problem. Those legal avenues will never be able to satisfy the demand and the desire to come here. I agree that the economic development of African nations is an important long—term goal for the EU. Development in African countries will provide opportunities and a real future for young people in their own home countries, avoiding skills shortages there and developing those countries as future trading partners for ourselves. But Europe needs solutions now, and Europe needs to stabilise the current situation. Returning those who do not qualify for asylum has to be part of the solution. By reducing the number of economic migrants entering the EU illegally, we increase the opportunities we are able to offer the most vulnerable refugees caught up in the conflict.

And I would say to Mrs Mogherini: helping and cooperating with Africa – yes, but outsourcing our problems to Africa – no. Not at all! I happen to know – and I gave the figure a few minutes ago – that the estimation is that there are between 12 and 15 million refugees in Africa – between 12 and 15 million! From time to time they do a better job there than we do. In Ethiopia, to give that example only, nearly 300 000 refugees have come into Ethiopia from neighbouring countries since the beginning of this year. So helping them, cooperating with them – yes. But seeing them and saying ‘Oh it is now your problem and you have to stop migration’, I say that is not serious. We have to take our own responsibilities. I think at the summit maybe it would be better to do other things rather than trying to discuss readmission agreements that never happen. I have negotiated readmission with Prime Ministers – not one but at least three or four readmission agreements – and they were signed but never implemented in reality. It is a waste of time. For example, I see this afternoon Jean Louis Borloo. Jean Louis Borloo is out of politics now, but he has started a very important initiative – ‘Energy for Africa’ – to try, with private and public funding, to build up something that is absolutely needed for that continent: a huge investment in energy so that every family and every company in Africa has this possibility of having an energy supply. That is the way forward, not outsourcing our problems; not saying: ‘Ah, I tried to take them back’. The way forward is to help them not only by public means, but also, for example, with initiatives like Energy for Africa, where there is a huge programme that is key for the future of that continent. The second thing that we can do and which we do not do – and I am very pleased that the Commission has now published a scoreboard – is to simply do what we have said. Implement what we have pledged. We are the champions of pledging worldwide, but we are maybe the last in the ranking when it comes to paying. There is an enormous difference in Europe between pledging and paying. I shall give you a list I have taken from the scoreboard – and I am pleased that the Commission has started with the scoreboard. We have a shortfall of EUR 1.7 billion in the African Trust Fund. Pledged but not paid. We have a shortfall of a half a billion euros in the Syria Trust Fund. Promised but not paid. Then, concerning the refugees: there are five countries which have taken refugees from Italy and Greece – not more than that. We have been discussing this for months here, but there are only five countries which are doing their job. There are 129 refugees relocated from the 39 600 that have to be relocated from Italy; well, 130 have been relocated. The same in Greece. There are 66 400 refugees – or more, naturally – there who are officially to be relocated. There have been 30 relocated. It is not I who am saying that, it is the scoreboard of the Commission. Maybe it is not all the fault of Luxembourg, certainly not. I am a very big champion of the Luxembourg Presidency, but it is your responsibility to put that to the Council. Finally, let us work on a migration strategy in the European Union, which we do not have, and also on this European border and coastguard. I hope in the December Council that this European border and coastguard can finally be decided by the heads of state and government.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1799, "date": "2015-11-25.json", "name": "Kostas CHRYSOGONOS", "mepid": "125061", "text": "  on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. Mr President, the results of the Europe and Africa Summit in Malta on migration, as well as that of the G20 in Antalya, on global development were poor. Both resulted in general declarations and greetings without specific commitments due to the disagreements of the participating States.  In fact, the only practical result came from the informal summit, immediately after the Malta summit, concerning the granting to Turkey of an amount of EUR 3 billion as a contribution by the European Union and the Member States to the needs of the numerous Syrian refugees residing on its territory. It was a justifiable decision, given the facts of the moment, since Turkey is home to around two million refugees and their maintenance is a major economic burden.  However, yesterday's development of the downing of the Russian aircraft by the Turkish air force retroactively reinforces suspicions about Turkey's role in the Syrian problem. Since it is obvious that this makes it even more difficult for a broad consensus to fight the criminal Islamic State. But unless the Islamic State is fighting, it is impossible to bring peace to Syria and end the refugee drama.

A summit in which Member States were not at all prepared to pay money. A summit where we actually turned over money. We've moved free with jars that already existed.  European countries hoped to strike deals with African countries to take back migrants, to set up asylum procedures outside our borders, to strengthen border controls. And in search of quick solutions, Member States seem willing to turn a blind eye to human rights situations in countries with dictatorial regimes such as Eritrea or Sudan or countries with military regimes that are almost indistinguishable from a dictatorial regime, such as Egypt.  People fleeing violence and oppression and buying off the oppressor can stop a refugee for a short time, but in the long run the situation becomes unworkable.

The Europe that showed itself at that summit is still a broken Europe and, let me say, frankly hesitant. I all believe that we all agree – or at least almost all – on the need to tackle the tragedy of the migration crisis, cooperating precisely with third countries and transit countries. But if we then look at the reality of what we are putting in place, we have to note that there is only EUR 1.8 billion in this Trust Fund. How many have the Member States of the European Union given? Seventy million euros: nothing! A small tip that can't even clean up a shred of the dirty conscience of their respective governments.  And the doubt, unfortunately, that many States want to interpret this aid for the umpteenth time, in the sense of turning it into a simple stimulus, a sting for repatriation agreements without really addressing those root causes: the fight against hunger, poverty and exploitation, is a doubt that unfortunately remains well founded. Think that as far as I know, Malta has contributed EUR 250 000! I think that the cost of the summit borne by Malta in organising it was far greater than the donations it made.  Nor is there any proper distinction to be made between the other states: perhaps we will find Eritrea compared to Tunisia or very bad examples equated with examples that are virtuous, which, despite a thousand difficulties, are fighting for the affirmation of the rule of law. If we then compare this aid to the EUR 3.1 billion given to Turkey alone for fear that it will again open the taps of the migratory flow in order to put pressure on European policy, as it has done so far, I would say that the comparison is disheartening. I think he was right, Macky Sall, the Senegalese President, when he said that this aid is not enough, that we must instead combat fraud and tax avoidance, which takes eur 50 billion from African countries every year. But if I then consider that we cannot even solve the problem of tax avoidance in our own home, given what we saw yesterday, as far as the TAXE Committee is concerned, since we cannot be credible in this area either, since we still do not even pay the right compensation for the sale of natural resources, the distress is growing. , also taking into account the Schengen Agreement which, in the meantime, as an emblem of European integration, becomes a symbol of a mad race towards implosion, between walls, barbed wire, beatings and clashes between the Member States. I'd say we still don't learn from the past.

I think the message from Valetta and Antalya was as clear as it was right. In order to meet the global challenges of our time, the international community must come closer together and share responsibility. Of course, we Europeans must shoulder our responsibilities, as has been pointed out today. However, it is not only the European Union's turn to tackle irregular migration, for example. In this way, the African countries themselves can also make their contribution. It is about better governance, it is about economic growth, it is about creating prospects for young people in their home countries and better involving civil society. As the European Union has been highlighted, we in the European Union are helping to do this in a very concrete way, for example through the Emergency Trust Fund to support African states. In any case, one thing is certain: Valetta is only the beginning of a longer process of systematically tackling the challenge of migratory flows. I would like to make one further comment on the Antalya Summit. This is where the firm signal has been sent that the G20 countries are stronger than terrorism. And this challenge cannot be tackled militarily alone. A large number of measures are now needed. Indeed, the European intelligence services must cooperate better than they have done so far. So-called foreign fighters returning to Europe must be monitored more closely. At European level, including here in Parliament, we must work to complete the current data-related projects, such as the PNR Directive, and also the Data Protection Directive, quickly, and our European agencies, such as Frontex and Europol, should be strengthened.

It is about better living conditions there and about concrete aid for good governance, aid for the economic development and development of the states for the people who live there – including for refugees. You can't do it without money. I very much hope, Mrs Mogherini, that the Member States will not let you down again, that they will replenish the fund you mentioned with additional payments. Because we have to make our own share, otherwise we will end up getting the bills all at once, and that is what we call the refugee crisis. I also very much agree and believe that the colleague from the EFDD who is just leaving has been wrong. Yes, Turkey must also get money from us. But it is not money for Mr Erdogan to be able to build a new palace, but for the people there – the refugees – to have better living conditions than before, and so that they do not all continue to feel that they must continue to travel to central and northern Europe.

It is a pity that those calls are usually missing from Council conclusions, unfortunately. It is indeed a very noble call, but what do we see happening in practice? In practice, there is hardly any legal way for refugees to enter the European Union to find the protection that we actually want to give to those people. Refugees still have to risk their lives crossing the Mediterranean in very small boats, and one of the very few legal possibilities for refugees to come to Europe in a safe way is now under attack. That is family unification. We all should be able to sympathise with family unification. No one wants to be separated from their family, and to be together with your family is also a vital part of integration. But now several governments are attacking the possibility for refugees to be reunited with the family they had to leave behind – that they lost on their way to Europe. I think this is outrageous, and it is absolutely inhumane. We should never stop family unification – the right of children to be together with their parents, the right of parents to be together with their brothers, sisters and their children. Currently we do indeed have a lot of refugees in Europe, because there are a lot of reasons why people have to flee. But if we all stood together as the European Union and acted in unison, we could easily face this challenge. Therefore, I want to ask the Council what initiatives it is planning to get all Member States on board to help in facing this challenge in a humane fashion.

But, in its panic, the Union has just made two mistakes in the wake of the Valletta and G20 summits. The first is Turkey. The EU gives it three advantages so that it agrees to keep on its soil the 2 million Syrian refugees there, 3 billion euros, visas to allow Turks to enter Europe and the relaunch of the process of accession to the Union. It's too expensive to pay and it's too naively trusting a state that has betrayed us, playing a double game with Daesch. We will lose our 3 billion and we will have in the Union, the Turks, the Syrians and Turkey. The second error concerns Africa. The EU is giving it 1.8 billion euros to help it manage its migration flows and its 15 million refugees. It has thus succeeded in the feat of offending Africans, who have not failed to compare this sum with the 3 billion offered to Turkey. A partnership with Africa of a completely different magnitude should be entered into, including aid for its economic development to secure its populations.  Weak with its false friends, arrogant with its potential partners, the Union proves, alas, once again that it is unable to manage the migration crisis.

What do these two summits have in common? First of all, the key message at each of these meetings is about the migration crisis and its consequences, including the security implications. The EU-Africa Summit aimed primarily at mobilising neighbouring African countries and integrating them into countering both the causes and sources of migration, and was combined with the Decision on financial assistance to African countries of EUR 3.6 billion from the Union in the form of a trust fund. This is a good start to building a policy that is supposed to dry up the sources of migration. At the same time, it is a sad truth that the UN World Food Fund lacks money for food aid. This exacerbates the problems where there are large concentrations of refugees.  Secondly, we are under pressure from events, migratory pressure and acts of terror, such as in Paris. With the protection of the Union's borders still weak. Unfortunately, whether we want it or not, the citizens of many Member States combine security threats with migration. Borders need protection and this is effective, especially in the eastern Mediterranean. Although there are good examples, such as Spanish, where borders are effectively defended and migratory pressures are reduced. We have repeatedly said that legal channels of migration are needed, but these legal channels of immigration are impossible to open if we do not have secure border protection. This is an important task for the Member States, and no one will do this for the Member States, even in cooperation with Frontex. Thirdly, effective cooperation between the security services and the exchange of information is needed in order to effectively counter any negative phenomena, including smuggling, terrorism and money laundering.

It has been in the past: just a couple of decades ago, by hundreds of thousands, sub-Saharan migrants arrived on or died trying to reach the coasts of Spain or Italy. It will continue to be so because two of the four major humanitarian crises are located in Africa – Central African Republic and South Sudan. It will continue to be because there are other African crises, such as Mali, in Nigeria, in general, throughout the Sahel. It will continue to be because climate change will affect Africa more than any other continent, and it will continue to be because if no one can stop those escaping war, it will also not be able to stop those escaping hunger and disease.

You who have said for so many years and still today continue to say that immigration is a great opportunity for Europe. You who have not yet understood that we cannot take in more immigrants. You who continue to say, despite the massacre in Paris, that we must welcome, integrate and love us.

My group and I have been saying this for many years: unheeded. Your fine words are ridiculous and, unfortunately, you are not credible as Europe is not credible.

We are vulnerable because we are unable to protect our external borders and our internal borders are no longer there. Illegal immigrants and Islamic terrorists are quietly circling. Schengen must be suspended immediately without ifs and buts.  A question, Mrs Mogherini: but had you not decided that 160 000 refugees should be relocated immediately? As a result, 150 refugees have left Italy and Greece. And then a courtesy: you have Renzi's cell phone number. Call him and explain to him what country Saudi Arabia is, where he went on 8 and 9 November. It's not a business partner. It is rather a country that finances terrorists; it is a country where Shari'a exists; it is a country where four people were beheaded on the days of his visit! While Renzi had his picture taken with the interior minister, the prince and the king, four people were beheaded. A disgrace to Renzi, but I think it's a shame for her too.

Today, two-thirds of Africa's population does not have access to energy and light. Access to energy is access to water, access to clean water, access to health, education, employment and security. Yet Africa has real potential for renewable energy development. What it lacks is the capacity to invest. So what to do? The G20 has recognized the urgency of limiting global warming to two degrees in 2100 compared to the pre-industrial era, but will COP 21 be able to resolve the funding issue?

Yet this statement, this position, has not been made, at least in this House, and I regard it as a very serious and very significant fact.

There is nothing concrete about the re-dents: yet there is the Cotonou Agreement which should safeguard our rights and see them respected. The High Representative keeps talking to us about his African friends; I'm glad he's got all these friendships, because friends are clearly spoken of. So African leaders need to be clear about re-dents. Because this is an obligation to which they are also bound by agreements concluded under the aegis of the African Union. But no one says that. No one, speaking of Africa in this House, spoke of the waste that in these decades of post-colonialism has been made by multinationals on Africa's goods, mineral and natural resources, which is the cause of immigration.

It will not be enough for us simply to repeat: 'there is no link between terrorism and immigration' to change this perception and then to be true to the end. We explain this by saying, for example, that many of these terrorists are European citizens who were born in our cities, who grew up in our neighbourhoods.  Yes, it is true: but if we have not been able to integrate these citizens who have arrived, who have grown up here, how are we going to welcome these many who are coming and that we should welcome and integrate? What? By what model? We have to take a reality bath because we have tolerated the intolerable. We tolerated shari'a practicing and applying in our neighborhoods.

We are still shocked by the brutal attacks in Paris, the new threats of terrorism. If we don't react together, if we surrender to fear and start railing with walls, it won't protect anyone. Countries have already built more than 235 km of fences on the Union's external border, and we have paid more than €175 million. That didn't stop people, it just diverted them to other routes, the Balkan route, where the situation is boiling today! Today, at the initiative of Slovenia and Croatia, the leaders of the Western Balkan countries meet in Zagreb. In recent weeks, Union leaders have taken a series of measures, including in Valetta, raising funds for emergency aid, establishing safe and legal routes to Europe, moving, registering people. But where are these promised actions today? The chaos on our borders is getting bigger every day. Many countries, including my Slovenia, feel that they are left to themselves.

Countries no longer trust each other, we place our responsibility on each other. We'll all pay the price.  The refugee and migrant crisis is an exceptional challenge for the Union, but it is far from being a threat to its existence. If they could manage immigration, they'd also be able to identify security threats before they even happen. If we do not know, countries will continue their own policies, which lead to very dangerous isolation rather than integration. Then Schengen will be seriously compromised.

Nor are the Valletta actions the way forward. What is taking shape is a regime for holding back refugees, making African countries a buffer zone, making them responsible not only for holding but even for stopping refugees. The focus on smuggling, on fighting irregular migration, on returns, on cooperation with dictatorships such as those in Eritrea and Sudan, are proof of this. This is not the way forward.

We are past the Valetta Summit, and the difficult weeks of the migrant crisis in itself are now overshadowed, to say the least, by the terrorist attacks in Paris, but I can say that it is being overshadowed. I believe that it is necessary now to talk about the lines behind the intremies of popular movements. I ask you, have we been struck by lightning in this series of events that we are witnessing or expected? The experience of the Arab Spring was clear in terms of the extent to which democracy can be exported to areas where presumably the conditions are not yet met. It also follows from this failure that social theories about Western prosperity, which enter the spiritual mainstream, and the popularity of these theories have led to the current migration of people. My fellow Members, I would like to thank you for your support. We are now at the fortn running a race against time for Schengen, for the rescue of Schengen. I heard with a bad taste in my mouth that we were starting to talk about mini-Schengen, as if we had given up on this competition in the first place. You can't give up a race, you have to fight to the very end. Schengen, free movement, is the part of European integration that we can say every citizen feels within the European Union. This is an achievement that, if it fails, fellow Members, everything can fall! We must therefore use all means to protect this EU symbol. It is a regrettable fact for me that the European political elite always defends its dead-end policy by saying that terrorists, terrorists in Paris, are not fresh migrants, but second- and third-generation immigrants, so the policy of open doors is not dangerous and does not need to be changed. But the point is that the generational explanation is that Muslims who settled in the 1970s were looking for jobs and prosperity, but not the current migrants. I ask that we review our theory so as not to put the EU acquis at risk.

I greatly appreciate that it was our own former colleague, Prime Minister Muscat, giving such European leadership, and I was inspired by efforts to find solidarity between Europe and Africa in tackling the refugee crisis. We do need more, not less political will, and we must not be deflected by the terrorism outrages. Refugees are the victims of violence, not its perpetrators. Did the summit fall short? Of course. My Group argues for safe legal routes for migration as an essential part of combating illegal migration. We are in favour of a more-for-more approach but do not see sufficiently more. We are opposed to tied aid conditionality and insist there must be genuine new money, not recycling of existing development assistance, if new cooperation from our partners is to be expected in return. We need high numbers to be resettled when developing countries already house over 86% of the world’s refugees. In seeking readmission agreements, Europe must be far more robust in standing out against any suggestion of forced return. The long-term solution to the refugee crisis can only come in conflict resolution, sustainable development and good governance, which prevents people from wanting to leave their homes in the first place. Last month I met refugees, not in Africa but in Lebanon, but all were parents seeking to save the lives of their children. There are no waves, no walls and no watchtowers high enough that would prevent those families from fleeing. Which of us would do differently? We meet today as the fragile European unity on this issue, including from my own country Great Britain, appears to be approaching a breaking point. There are those opposite who celebrate European disunity and who would close European borders altogether. The way we resist those political pressures on this side is through respect for international law and by appealing to the basic humanitarian instincts amongst the people we represent and which we feel ourselves. There must be order, there must be fairness within our societies, there must be integration, but above all there must be humanity. That is why we say ‘refugees welcome’.

Now, the causes of migration are poverty and conflict. Africa and the Middle East languish in poverty because of their endemic corruption. Some parts have the added problem of centuries-old murderous conflicts between rival factions of the religion of peace and love. The summit’s action plan could be boiled down to two main points: to give another EUR 2.5 billion to these countries, and to open up migration to yet more millions of people. The idea of giving aid to impoverished countries is not wrong in itself, but the last thing that we should do is give money to their irredeemably corrupt leaders and governments. Aid should be spent on programmes that directly help poor people in health schemes, infrastructure development, and encouraging economic development. As for opening up what are called ‘regular channels to migration’, this is a betrayal of the peoples of Europe. Living standards are already declining in Europe for various reasons: wage depression because of never-ending waves of cheap migrant labour; the economic idiocy of the eurozone and its austerity policies; competition for social benefits from people who have never paid in a penny in contributions; and the unaffordability of housing because of an artificially-fuelled and never-ending demand on a finite supply. The EU’s response is to open up the borders to yet more millions of poverty-stricken people. It is ironic that Valletta is named in honour of Jean de Valette, the Grand Master of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem, who led Malta’s successful defence against the Turkish invasion in 1564.

Now we're there. The Valletta Summit clearly set a milestone in international cooperation on migration, for the implementation of joint and multidimensional policies. This must mark a point of no return in a more regular and balanced dialogue with our African partners, but also with other key partners in the Mediterranean and the Middle East, to meet our shared responsibilities. The revision of the European Neighbourhood Policy is also a good opportunity to do so.  With this action plan, the challenge of adopting a multidimensional approach was met. It is a very comprehensive document, but most of the commitments made reflect objectives that have been the european development policy for years. Eleven EDFs and our results were not enough to stem the massive departures. Our development policy can become more economically effective. I would also like to point out that this is an imperative in view of the revision of the Cotonou agreement. Three things I want to emphasize. First, regional integration and capacity building of partner organizations such as the African Union and Africa's regional economic communities. The European Union must support regional mediation efforts and do more in conflict prevention, including through the African peace facility, an instrument we do not know enough about. Second, the promotion of the potential of links between migrants and their community of origin. As outlined in the action plan, remittances must be effectively used for the development of countries of origin. Which brings me to my last point: circular migration. We cannot prevent people from leaving situations of conflict or misery, but we must think in the medium and long term of the incentives for return, because the development of the African continent also depends on the development of human potential, which is indeed the continent's first economic resource.

Yes, there is an urgent need to allow significant funding related to migration. It is true that in Valletta, the heads of state and government laid the foundations for an unprecedented management of the migration situation. This amount of 1.8 billion euros is planned to create a fund for the development of Africa. Yes, it is necessary, but it is not enough, Commissioner, Minister.  It is clear, as Commission President Juncker said recently, that much more needs to be done, namely doubling the stakes. In addition, 78.2 million euros have been put on the table so far. Once again, unfortunately, we feel that words trump deeds. However, we know what is at stake in our aid in Africa's development. We need a Marshall Plan for Africa. It takes 250 billion euros of work to electrify Africa. So it is a program in eight to ten years that we have to allow. It is 5 billion euros of public subsidies a year that we have to find for Africa.  The European Parliament, the European Commission and the European Council must therefore mobilise, not only to combat this migration, to enable the development of Africa, but also to fight terrorism. When we see Boko Haram in Cameroon a few days ago, when we see Mokhtar Belmokhtar being the author of the Bamako killings a few days ago, that is the need that on the occasion of COP21, all of us as much as we are, we are there to allow a resolution to take into account this important funding, this Marshall Plan for Africa.

On the one hand, I welcome the fact that Europe is starting to talk to the countries where the greatest flows of refugees come from, whether refugees on the basis of economic needs or refugees driven from their homes by war. On the other hand, when I look at the conclusions of this summit, then I am relatively disappointed and I agree with my colleagues who point out that these conclusions are not sufficient and that, in my opinion, more and more intensive action will be needed with the countries where the most massive flows of refugees come from. We have spoken so far and have only dealt with the consequences in Parliament. We have spent a lot of time pushing for and debating so-called quotas, and I do not think the quotas are working and will not work. It is also clear that the return policy, the monitoring of the external borders and so on are not working very well. For example, if return policy is to work, then we really need to have partners on the other side, countries where economic applicants will be returned.  The idea of a trust fund, which was also raised here today, is, in my view, correct, but the amount that has been earmarked for the fund is, in my view, very small. It can hardly solve the economic problems of several states. It is also a question of whether this amount can be collected at all, and, above all, there are not very clear rules on how that amount will be controlled and how it will be distributed.  Personally, I would advise the Commission to debate more about greater cooperation with the countries of Africa, to support them, for example, by breaking down certain customs provisions, by supporting trade and by adusborting trade and a way for these countries to develop more. They will raise money through their own business, not through projects that threaten to steal the money often, dismantled.

Neoliberal globalisation makes this very difficult to achieve. Actually the European Union lacks the tools needed to help generate sufficient employment opportunities in Africa to make economic migration unattractive. Worse, many private projects in Africa, spurred by globalisation, have not served to increase job opportunities in the economy as a whole. Corruption, waste of resources and greater social inequalities have spread, so desperate people go far from home to find work. Europe may be too distracted by the crisis to take the lead in what is really needed: a Marshall Plan for Africa where public agencies take full charge and do not simply delegate initiatives to the private sector or wait for the latter to take them.

What I would like to make clear here is that the fight against terrorism by European countries and, in particular, the European Union must be an unrelenting fight. We must give a clear external response, with military action and with military cooperation with France, with the United States, with the coalition countries, with the Islamic State, and we must also take some measures, such as the approval of the PNR, internally, and others, including a strengthening of schengen's external borders in the context of the European Union. And I think it is very important that we have a great opportunity here to strengthen European cooperation and to strengthen the European Union's presence in security and defence affairs. In particular, I believe that it is essential that we move from the Frontex and other programmes to the creation of a genuine European border guard, which can, with the composition of all European countries, protect the external borders of Schengen and the external borders of the European Union.  It is essential to take this step — without it, we will not have effective control, we will not have an effective defence of our security and we will be vulnerable, we will be exposed to terrorist attacks.

The EU showed no willingness to tackle the root causes of migration, such as poverty, conflict, a lack of employment, vigorously. And African leaders were therefore unwilling to agree, for example, on the mandatory readmission of rejected asylum seekers in Europe, something that EU countries insisted on.

These two questions need to be well answered by us from the European Union. Likewise, it is good that the G20 addressed all issues: from terrorism, through refugees, to the economy and inequalities in society to climate change. These are really questions of both our generation and future generations.  This crisis is a truly large-scale crisis and we must face its course and its consequences.

Now we have an implementation ahead of us. The European Union, the Member States, must fulfil financial commitments on development aid and contributions to the Africa Fund.

The causes are serious human rights violations, autocracy, political persecution, lack of rule of law, endemic corruption. That's why I don't think we should be so afraid of a clearer definition of the conditionality of development cooperation.  Another question to answer better is the effectiveness of our development cooperation. Better coordination between Member States in programming is needed, but we also need a better work framework based on measurable results. With limited funds, it is important that we get value for the money being invested.  Finally, it is also important to take into account the recommendations of the European Parliament. A few weeks ago, all political groups within the Development Committee reached a consensus and sent a recommendation to the Committee of the European Development Fund, chaired by the Commission, to reject the adoption of a proposal for a national development cooperation programme with Eritrea.

Of the five priority areas of action, two seem crucial to me. First of all, the need to address the root causes of this crisis, because we can no longer be content with temporary solutions. The Union needs to play a more active role in resolving and, above all, in preventing conflicts in its neighbourhood. Finding a political solution to the Syrian conflict is, in this context, of paramount importance. The second priority area of action is the fight against illegal immigration and trafficking of all kinds. The lack of political agreement on a government of national unity in Libya questions our ability to effectively and sustainably combat this illegal immigration to the Mediterranean.

The action plan with the African countries was also emphasised and the importance of such a development policy – so far, so good. On the other hand, however, there is now also a trade policy which undermines everything that development policy is about to do. Any perspective is taken away from those countries that want to build an independent and prosperous economy. For example, a European agricultural policy that is heavily focused on exports has the disadvantage of destroying local markets there.

We have also seen African governments demanding more investment and aid, so-called development, for kleptocratic and oppressive regimes, and therefore prolific manufacturers of refugees and migrants, such as those in Sudan, Eritrea and Ethiopia, among others. Let us be clear: the European Union, under the primary responsibility of its governments, has failed to wage wars, conflicts, terrorism, oppression and economic exploitation at its doorsteps or further away in Africa, to which it is bound by historical and human ties. Despite all the rhetoric, the European Union has privileged relations with governments, however corrupt they may be, and does lip service in support of the organization of African citizens who fight against oppression and corruption. As we have been asking here in the European Parliament for a long time, opening legal and secure channels of access for refugees and migrants is fundamental and is the main way to protect the lives of men, women, and children so that they do not have to surrender to the hands of traffickers and throw themselves into the sea. This is also the only way to effectively control our borders and ensure that criminal organisations, including terrorists, do not take advantage of the mess that are hot spots and other arrival points, where there is no resources to make any serious control of who arrives. It is also the only way for the European Union not to continue to feed the human traffickers' business. This is a path that governments sitting on the Council have not wanted to explore. They resist for lack of political courage and strategic vision and, in particular, the importance of synergy in supporting those who are responsible for human rights and good governance in Africa.

I would like to thank you for this frank and dense debate on our partnership with Africa and on the global partnership necessary to manage migratory and refugee flows in Europe. We clearly need to take stock of the Valletta process and, of course, of the talks in the G20 and pass to implementing our commitments, starting from action agreed in the Valletta action plan. This is our task from here to the end of 2016, and we need to engage immediately with our partners to make things happen. Let me take on a few of your questions. Firstly, on readmission and return agreements. As my colleague the Vice-President explained, this is an important part of our strategy, but it is only one part of our strategy. It cannot be decoupled from our other actions. The objective in the medium and long term is to make this phenomenon more manageable. This includes discouraging irregular flows, fighting the smugglers of human beings, working on the readmissions, but also working on the reintegration of returnees. Only if those who get back can find a place in their own societies will they pass on the message that embarking on a dangerous journey towards Europe is not worth the risk. At the same time, we need to work to strengthen and implement the legal channels we have already agreed on. But first of all we need to invest in the future of Africa. The continent has a huge potential; our aid can help unleash such potential. The Commission is doing its share, and we will keep pushing for national governments to follow up on their commitments. I would encourage you all to pass on this message that you have voiced here today, also back home. Secondly, many of you rightly highlighted that saving lives must remain our focus in implementing Valletta. I completely agree. Protection is and remains a key element of our partnership with Africa, both in terms of supporting the huge effort of African partners in offering humanitarian relief to refugees and the internally displaced in Africa, and in terms of a wider and more consistent effort from the EU in terms of resettlement, in close cooperation with UNHCR. Yes, this is a crucial part of our effort to save lives and avoid hazardous journeys. Another key component of our discussion in Valletta has indeed been legal mobility: opening legal, regulated ways and facilitating mobility for bona fide travellers, starting from students, researchers, academics and business operators. It is part of our commitments in the action plan and we will make it happen. This is very important, as you know. As Federica Mogherini said in her introduction, helping Africa’s growth and development is in our own interests. If we disinvested from the continent’s future, we would be hurting our own future. It would be against our values and our interests. This is not an idealistic approach, it is a very pragmatic approach. We need a strong cooperation with Africa, which addresses Europe’s interests and African interests at once. There is no ‘horse-trading’; we are redrawing our partnership on new bases. This includes how we deal with migration, but also our cooperation on peace and security, on development and on counter-terrorism. This leads me another point, raised by Mr Verhofstadt. Yes, a new partnership with Africa is not just about managing mobility, but also tackling the root causes of forced displacement. And yes, investment, industrialisation, opportunities for private actors to engage in a partnership for development in African remains very important. Next, the security aspect of our cooperation. As many of you said, recent events only confirm that we cannot underestimate the threats we are facing. But let us also be clear on something: of course we must improve the checks on our external borders – it is obvious. But, as the attacks in Paris demonstrate, the threat to our own security mostly originates within our own borders. On the external side, the call for more cooperation on security comes directly from our African partners. Cooperating with Africa on security is consistent with our interests: think of the work we can do to control their borders, to fight international criminal networks and to investigate terrorist suspects.

Mr President, we cannot expect everything from a summit, but I believe that the Valletta summit has launched or perhaps relaunched a process and, as the Commissioner has just said, a process towards a new partnership between Europe and Africa. They are natural partners and not supporting this partnership is ultimately doing ourselves a very bad service.  However, we know that migration and development are two sides of the same reality and that it is not possible to achieve better management of migration flows without involving the countries of origin and without also integrating, in such management, mobility, that is, legal migration. Cooperation, which we have talked about a lot, may need to be reoriented, sometimes reoriented. We need real projects - we also talked about this this afternoon - that improve people's prospects, and that projects in the deep regions of Africa are being carried out for the benefit of the people, because these are the incentives that will convince people to stay put.  But better managing migration also means working with African countries. There are examples of projects where it works. I remember very well, since I was for a few years Minister of Immigration, that we had at one time a big problem of illegal immigration from Senegal to the Spanish islands. Well, it is thanks to cooperation with the Senegalese and Spanish authorities that we have been able to more or less control this illegal migration. New forms of cooperation must therefore be found.  Of course, we also have to live up to our financial commitments. We talked about a Marshall Plan for Africa and probably we will have to come. We do need to have resources, but we also need to make better use of them. The final point will be about conflicts in Africa. I believe that conflicts in Africa produce immigration, produce migrants, produce refugees. But we must never forget that the largest part of the refugees is in Africa itself, and that African countries sometimes also need to be helped to deal with these refugee problems at home. Next week there will be a meeting of the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly. I believe that this will be a new opportunity to revisit this common plan of cooperation, partnership between African countries and Europe.

My primary experience is that we fundamentally need peace and local solutions to manage migration. I am convinced that the European countries that once colonized do not have to deal with economic advantage at all prices in this situation. Investments and aid programmes should focus on the resources that are actually available. We need to focus all our efforts on programs to help us stay at home. This is primarily in the interest of refugees, because there is no reason why these ancient communities should migrate thousands of kilometres away, at the mercy of criminal networks, rather than living in their own culture.  My very specific experience is that we need to help internally refugees in two ways today. One is to provide education and the other is to find employment opportunities. In these two areas, there is a clear need for help as soon as possible, and these are also the keys to staying in place. It is a very serious problem that our decision-makers did not recognise the need for these steps much earlier.

It is equally important to do everything possible to resolve the current armed conflict and prevent new crises.

At the same time, this should not be a blank cheque: the EU must strictly monitor whether the Turkish Government adequately takes care of refugees and acts in compliance with its international obligations.

There have been a number of emergency debates and resolutions on Burundi in the last year. Sadly, the situation in the country remains extremely grave, and we believe it is fully justified that we address this issue once again this evening. Both the European Union Ministers of Foreign Affairs and the United Nations Security Council have expressed themselves on Burundi in the last ten days. On the negative side, there is a broad recognition that, on a daily basis, violence in Burundi has reached an extremely dangerous level and that it has been exacerbated by the use of inflammatory and irresponsible language. Regrettably, we have had to condemn once again human rights violations and, of course, to express our solidarity with all the victims and families of the victims. Among those who have suffered is Mr Pierre Claver Mbonimpa, the human rights defender who is well—known and well—respected in this House. The humanitarian community has not been spared either, with the death recently of a staff member of the International Organisation for Migration. I repeat the EU’s absolute condemnation of human rights violations and of violence, whoever is responsible. More positively, we believe there is now a strong international consensus encouraging Burundi to get behind African-led processes which, in the assessment of the EU, provide the only viable way out of the crisis. Most important among these are the implementation of decisions on Burundi already taken by the African Union and the East African Community, and cooperation with the mediation efforts being undertaken by Uganda on behalf of the East African Community. The decision of the ruling party to nominate President Nkurunziza as a presidential candidate earlier this year created a serious division across society and across politics. That division needs to be addressed urgently and comprehensively. I would like to say a word on UN Security Council Resolution 2248, which is, of course, welcomed by the EU. There are three elements in this resolution which I want to stress tonight. Firstly, the resolution calls upon the Government of Burundi and all parties to reject any kind of violence, and demands that all sides in Burundi refrain from any action that would threaten peace and stability in the country. Secondly, it calls upon the Government of Burundi to respect, protect and guarantee human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, in line with the country’s international obligations. Thirdly, it urges the Government of Burundi to cooperate with the East African Community-led mediation to enable it to immediately convene an inclusive and genuine inter-Burundian dialogue in order to find a consensual and nationally-owned solution to the current crisis. You are all aware of the humanitarian situation, and in particular the pressure on facilities in Rwanda, Tanzania and the Democratic Republic of Congo. To date, we have allocated EUR 9 million to respond to the Burundian refugee crisis in the Great Lakes region. At a time when there are many conflicting priorities, we must ensure that attention is not diverted from the very real needs which the current crisis has caused. But at the same time we need to address root causes, and in particular violence and the rule of law. We announced in the summer that we would consider the adoption of individual restrictive measures against those linked to human rights abuses or to obstructing the search for a political solution. We have followed up on that by adopting measures against a number of individuals and will consider broadening the list if circumstances require it. We also undertook to prepare for the special consultations which are foreseen under Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement. We have also followed up on that, inviting the Burundian authorities at the end of October to participate in a first meeting, which we hope could be held in December. There are a number of points I wish to stress about Article 96 consultations. Firstly, we want them to focus on the areas where we believe there has been a breach of the Cotonou Agreement and, in particular, human rights and the rule of law. Secondly, the talks are time-limited. We should focus on objectives which are achievable in a three- to four-month period and which lead the way to a longer-term strategy to exit the crisis. Thirdly, the consultations will support the activities of the African Union and the East African Community, encouraging as much as possible implementation of the decisions already taken by those bodies and encouraging cooperation with them in mediation, observation and facilitation activities. Finally, and most importantly, we will enter the talks with a positive spirit. The aim is to find a mutually-agreed solution and not to punish. The Cotonou Agreement allows for appropriate measures, including the cutting of aid, but the EU will take all steps to avoid actions which could put at risk already vulnerable populations. This is a point which Commissioner Mimica has stressed to this House before, and it remains true today. To illustrate this, while the EU has needed to make some changes to its assistance package, suspending its electoral support of EUR 8 million in June, withholding budget support payments and putting on hold the finalisation of the Annual Action Programme for 2015, at the same time we are committed to preparing major programmes on health and nutrition, ensuring that funding on existing actions, including those of the 11th EDF 2014 Annual Action Programme of EUR 60.7 million, is used for the purpose it was intended for. I mentioned earlier focus on the rule of law and human rights. This means in practice that we need to concentrate on some specific areas, which I know to be of concern to Members of this House: the media environment, the situation of civil society and human rights defenders, the justice system and disarmament. Arising under these are a number of specific cases of concern, which have been raised in previous debates here. The EU has been supporting Burundi in its efforts to entrench democracy since the Arusha Agreement put an end to years of civil war and laid the foundations for a new era. The spirit of these agreements is for us at the heart of the search for a solution to the crisis. I look forward very much to hearing the views of honourable Members.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1914, "date": "2015-11-25.json", "name": "Joachim ZELLER", "mepid": "96762", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Mr President, I would like to thank the Minister, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report, which is The conflicts in the Middle East and Africa affect us directly. The debates today have shown that all day. This is the third time this year that we have to discuss the situation in Burundi. After President Nkurunziza secured office in July by breaking the constitution, abusing elections, the horrors of this country are not abating. Opposition activists, journalists are being persecuted, more than 200 people have already been murdered and more than 200 000 have left the country. Refugee camps in neighbouring countries, particularly Tanzania, are already overcrowded. People there are already suffering hardship because care can no longer be maintained. That is why the resolutions have now been written enough, and we must finally act! According to the consensus of eyewitnesses, the Arusha trial is no longer effective on the ground. Others have already imposed sanctions: the President of the United States just yesterday or the day before yesterday, he issued sanctions against leaders of the Nkurunziza regime. The UN Security Council – as the Minister mentioned – has adopted a unanimous resolution condemning not only the persecution of people and the murders, but also the revival of the Blue Helmets mission, which was in that country until 2005 and helped to end the civil war. I think that the negotiating mandate that the Commission had is also slowly coming to an end. Of course, we want to help the people on the ground, but all support for the Nkurunziza regime should be stopped.

Public executions and silent killings continue. We saw that also during the last three weeks. I welcome the UN Security Council Resolution finally adopted on 12 November calling upon the Government of Burundi and all parties to reject any kind of violence and to immediately convene an inclusive and genuine dialogue with the ruling party and the opposition, both inside and outside of the country. But the sad thing today is that we could see this coming for years, and so it could have been prevented, but the international community chose to look away for way too long, even deciding to close the United Nations Office in Burundi (BNUB) six months before crucial elections. Now it is our duty to act so that a full-blown civil war in the country is prevented.

He is convinced that he deserves a third presidential mandate, and he is actually going against the will of his people, who elected in 2005 and voted for an inclusive and democratic constitution. In the working-class districts of the capital, fighting is taking place against the police, between supporters and opponents of the president, and the hateful messages of burundian leaders are pouring oil on the fire. The crisis is seriously affecting the fledgling democracy, fragile peace and difficult development in Burundi. The situation is dire for the entire Region of the Great Lakes. Burundi is just a dot on the African map, surrounded by Congo, Rwanda and Tanzania. The flow of refugees is increasing humanitarian pressure on neighbouring countries, leading to increased ethnic tensions. I draw particular attention to the problems of the refugee camps. Due to the start of the rainy season in Tanzania, the tents and toilets in the camps are in danger of being flooded, with all the consequences that entails. And a new flow of refugees threatens to make the situation even worse. We must not repeat the mistakes with the Syrian refugees. We must help to take in burundians in humane conditions in the region, with a view to their return later. International players saw Burundi too much and for too long as too little of geostrategic importance. Too small, too little influence.

This is truly horrific. I thank the Presidency-in-Office for following up the consultation process under Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement by inviting the Burundian government to a dialogue on human rights. Impunity indeed is a huge problem in Burundi, as perpetrators of violence often do not have to face the consequences of their acts. The Burundian authorities must swiftly act here if they want to stop the spiralling of violence, and I believe it is a very appropriate move that the EU, like the US, has introduced personal targeted sanctions against those who are known to be perpetrators of violence. So I very much agree with the United Nations’ intention to consider all possible options against those in Burundi whose acts and statements contribute to the ongoing violence and hamper a peaceful solution.

The risk is that the situation will deteriorate for reasons that my fellow Members have already mentioned.

The tragedy could happen again and the threats are real and real.  The President of the Senate of Burundi even spoke of the pulverization of rebel districts and the Minister of Public Security reminded the Tutsis of their minority status, making it clear that the Hutu people could easily be incited to take action against tutsi.

The people have voted for change, expressing a strong desire to live in a new, free and democratic Myanmar. They have given a clear mandate to Aung San Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy, with a solid majority in both houses of parliament, to take Myanmar’s democratic and economic reforms to the next level. We are pleased to say that the European Union has been at the forefront of international support for democratic transition in Myanmar, and we very much appreciate that the European Parliament has played a very important role in this respect. On 16 November, the High Representative called Aung San Suu Kyi personally to congratulate her on her election victory. She highlighted the crucial role that our 150-person-strong election observation mission, led by EP Vice-President Alexander Graf Lambsdorff, had played in the holding of peaceful and competitive elections. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Graf Lambsdorff for his commitment and his excellent work as EU chief observer. Myanmar’s democratisation process is, however, not yet completed. The disenfranchisement of the Rohingya and other ethnic minorities remains a matter of concern. In this election, unlike previous elections, the Rohingya could not cast their vote or stand as candidates. None of the big parties fielded Muslim candidates, apparently bowing to the strong influence of radical Buddhist monks. In some ethnic areas no election took place, on security grounds. The EU EOM preliminary statement points out that further constitutional, legal and procedural improvements remain necessary if totally fair and fully inclusive elections are to be held in the future. Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of the largest party in Myanmar’s new parliament, is barred by the Constitution from running for President. The military will continue to occupy 25% of parliamentary seats, and, regardless of who forms the next government, three key ministers will come from the army. In that context, all political actors will need to engage in dialogue and work towards a peaceful transition in a spirit of national unity and reconciliation. Despite these challenges, we believe that we have witnessed landmark elections, offering a great opportunity to strengthen democracy in Myanmar. The next critical stage will be the election of the new president in mid-February 2016 and the formation of the next government by the end of March 2016. Although Aung San Suu Kyi has yet to reveal the priorities of the new government, we can expect that democracy, human rights, the rule of law and economic development will be high on the agenda. While Myanmar can count on our support, there are still issues of concern on which we will continue to constructively engage with Myanmar. These include the discrimination against, and the statelessness of, the Rohingya minority. The EU is also worried about Buddhist radicalisation, which has resulted in legislation on the protection of race and religion that is not consistent with the country’s international human rights obligations. EU-Myanmar relations have come a long way since 2011. With the exception of the arms embargo, sanctions were suspended in 2012 and then lifted in 2013. Everything But Arms trade preferences was also reinstated that year. An EU-Myanmar task force, with the active participation of the European Parliament, was set up in November 2013. The EU and Myanmar have stepped up cooperation in the area of human rights. Two rounds of human rights dialogue, led by the EU Special Representative for Human Rights, have taken place since 2014. Myanmar ranks high on our democracy support agenda, and we will look into appropriate follow-up with a view to implementation of the recommendations of the EOM, which will be presented early next year. In recognition of our assistance in the peace process, the EU was invited to sign the nationwide ceasefire agreement as an international witness on 15 October 2015. With other donors we are setting up a joint peace fund to further encourage the process. Last but not least, the EU and Myanmar are currently negotiating an investment protection agreement, and the EU is also part of a labour rights initiative, together with other partners. The EU defined its strategy and priorities in support of Myanmar’s transition process in the comprehensive framework adopted by the Foreign Affairs Council on 22 July 2013 and confirmed in the Council conclusions. The main priorities for engagement, democracy, peace, trade and development and Myanmar’s re-engagement with the international community continue to be valid. Our bilateral development cooperation programme under the 2014—2020 multiannual indicative programme for Myanmar amounts to EUR 688 million and features four focal sectors: rural development, education, rule of law and peace-building support. This is fully in line with the country’s transformative agenda. The EU is also a key provider of humanitarian assistance for vulnerable populations, in particular stateless persons and displaced populations. As Myanmar steps into the future, the scope of our engagement underlines the EU’s strong commitment to further supporting the country’s democratisation. The EU stands ready to play its part in helping to bring Myanmar’s transition process to a successful conclusion.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1933, "date": "2015-11-25.json", "name": "Lars ADAKTUSSON", "mepid": "124990", "text": "  On the other: Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating Mr Together with six other parliamentary colleagues, I was part of the European Parliament's election observation mission to Myanmar.

The turnout was estimated at around 80%. Since the elections, the current government has declared defeat. Opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi and her NLD party received nearly 80 percent of the vote and negotiations are now underway on the formation of a new government. Having said that, it is essential to see the elections in Myanmar in its entire political context. Despite successful implementation and political progress in recent years, the country cannot yet be regarded as a democracy. The current constitution contains elements that are deeply problematic, such as the fact that Myanmar's military power is guaranteed a quarter of the seats in parliament. According to another part of the constitution, Aung San Suu Kyi is prevented from holding the important presidency. In addition, human rights violations are a serious problem. The number of political prisoners is increasing, as is discrimination against minorities. Among the worst affected are rohingyas and other Muslim groups, which have long been subjected to serious abuse and persecution. The challenges for the new Parliament are therefore great.

But it was elections that took place in a legal, institutional and political context that does not correspond to the international standards required by democratic elections.  The constitution imposed by the military junta in 2008 reserves to military 25 % of the seats in the chambers of the national assembly, regional assemblies and sectors of governance, the National Election Commission had doubts about whether it would be independent, the accreditation of candidates and voter registration were manipulated before, during and after the vote. Not to mention the millions of citizens, particularly ethnic minorities, not registered and prevented from voting. Having pointed to the shortcomings, progress must be pointed out, namely that it is the result of the acceptance of the defeat by the party associated with the military, a sign of its decisive role in the organization of the transition, and also to the progress promised by the undisputedly winning party, the NLD of Aung San Suu Kyi, which has promised to commit itself to change for democratic governance, dialogue, national reconciliation and peace. It will not be an easy process, in a country where generals are installed in power and control the administration and major natural resources, and the interethnic conflict and contempt for minorities, especially Rohingya Muslims, who, as has been said, have been prevented from voting and being elected, is frankly rooted, and very worrying is the exploitation by ultranationalist and xenophobic Buddhist forces of this trend.  The NLD therefore has a tremendous responsibility here to counter the racist and discriminatory messages that these forces have conveyed and to show that democratic governance and reconciliation will be truly inclusive and respectful of human rights. We, the European Union, have a strategic interest in supporting the democratisation process, monitoring the peace process, but above all supporting civil society, including political parties and including the NLD itself, because we absolutely also ask for a change in the Constitution.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1935, "date": "2015-11-25.json", "name": "Charles TANNOCK", "mepid": "4521", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Group. – Mr President, the National League for Democracy (NLD) victory in Burma/Myanmar’s election this month is certainly an historic milestone, but it is the peaceful acceptance from the military and its politically-backed Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP) which must be truly celebrated. A marked difference on what happened in 1990. The democratic transition over the next few months and years will be difficult, and it is important that the European Union offers all advice and support where appropriate and necessary. But much power is still vested in the National Defence and Security Council, which is outside of the elected government’s control. The military still retain 25% of reserve seats in the parliament, and Aung San Suu Kyi’s moral victory as leader is somewhat undermined by her bizarre legal inability to take office as President as the late wife and mother of British citizens. So keeping the roadmap to democracy on track will be a challenge. There are also concerns as to the plight of the minority Muslim Rohingya people in Myanmar, numbering around a million people. They have been denied voting rights in the latest election on the basis of being unable to prove their citizenship. Aung San Suu Kyi has said little on this issue and it appears that there is little appetite from the NLD to prioritise the fate of the Rohingyas, instead preferring to focus on state- and democracy-building in Myanmar. In achieving these goals there is still a long way to go. But Myanmar may yet prove to be a good example of a transition to pluralist democracy, a process that must be measured in decades, and not in years.

Anyone with even a bit of political flair noticed what hope this election was all about. In this respect, it was good that the European Union was able to make a constructive contribution here – both in advance and also through this observation mission.  Two things were particularly pleasing: one is that there has been virtually no electoral violence – neither before nor afterwards was this a problem. Secondly, many of the problems that were expected before the ballot did not appear on election day itself. The biggest problem, the biggest fear, was on the electoral roll. The people were by and large well found in the lists, so there was no restlessness there either. This result – Charles Tannock has just pointed out a strange constitutional situation, which we have already discussed in our preliminary report – is now putting the country in a very delicate transitional phase, and I would like the European Union to remain involved with all its institutions, to remain committed to helping the country in this. Let me say one thing here: there is often criticism of the crunch in the building when it comes to cooperation between the various European institutions. There is no reason at all to do so this time. The European Parliament, the Chief Observer, the delegation, Judith Sargentini, who, as permanent rapporteur, will continue to accompany the country on its path to democracy, have worked excellently with the European External Action Service. We have worked excellently with the Commission, the foreign policy instruments and, in particular, with the delegation under the leadership of a really very good ambassador, which fortunately we can have there, Roland Kobia.

However, it is also clear that the legal environment, the legal context and the pre-election processes have left much to be wished for. Discussions with NGOs, representatives of ethnic minorities and the media highlighted a number of such shortcomings. The most obvious of these, of course, is the fact that a quarter of the seats automatically belonged to the military. Overall, however, Myanmar, which has a dictatorial history of many decades, took a huge step towards a democratic establishment on 8 November.

The High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy / Vice-President of the Commission, Federica Mogherini, paid a successful visit to Georgia on 10 November. We also held our second Association Council meeting in Brussels on 16 November. Commissioner Hahn will be in Tbilisi tomorrow. Our high-level engagement has thus been continuing almost weekly this November. The EU-Georgia Association Council looked at the progress made in the implementation of the EU-Georgia Association Agreement that was signed in June last year.  It also looked at some of the challenges remaining. Regarding progress, we welcomed the good implementation of the DCFTA so far and, of course, the Eurostat reports showing an increase in Georgian exports to the EU. The approximation of Georgian laws to EU standards is progressing at a good pace. At the same time, it is important to make businesses in Georgia aware of the functioning and benefits of the DCFTA. Let me turn to the challenges. There is a need to guarantee a political environment that is calm and respectful.  Steps or statements in the opposite direction need to be avoided. We have stressed in all our contacts that democratic momentum needs to be maintained, in particular regarding the parliamentary election in October 2016, and that we expect the independence and effectiveness of the institutions – including, of course, the Constitutional Court – to be fully respected. The same applies to institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights in Georgia. The forthcoming election campaign will be the first with the Association Agreement in place. We share and support the Government’s stated goal of having free and orderly elections, with an outcome fully recognised as legitimate. It is essential to guarantee media freedom, implying that opposition parties must be given proper access to the media. We also appreciate Georgia’s progress in implementing judiciary reforms. The independence of the judiciary is at the heart of our association. Although the EU does not pass judgement on the merits of individual cases before the courts, we monitor whether our shared principles are being respected. This applies to the so-called high-profile trials, as well as to recent cases such as the private lawsuit against Rustavi 2 and the pre-trial detention of three opposition activists. We will continue to assist Georgia in its efforts to reform the judiciary, to safeguard the rule of law and strengthen the independence of the judiciary. At the Association Council, Federica Mogherini, High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy / Vice-President of the Commission, and Commissioner Hahn welcomed the progress made by Georgia towards visa liberalisation, with many benchmarks already being fulfilled. These efforts need to continue. Though the final decision cannot be anticipated at this stage, we see positive signs for the process ahead of us. Developments in the breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia were also on the agenda for the Association Council. Vice-President Mogherini and Commissioner Hahn reiterated the EU’s firm support for the territorial integrity of Georgia, within its internationally-recognised borders. The EU remains firmly committed to peace, stability and conflict-resolution, and our policy of non-recognition and engagement in Georgia. The EU Special Representative for the South Caucasus and the crisis in Georgia, the EU co-chairmanship of the Geneva international discussions, and the EU Monitoring Mission are visible and substantial signs of that commitment. The EU has also expressed appreciation for Georgia’s contribution to EU-led crisis management operations and missions in the Central African Republic and Mali, and to the EU Advisory Mission in Ukraine.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1952, "date": "2015-11-25.json", "name": "Jaromír ŠTĚTINA", "mepid": "124702", "text": "  for the PPE Group.

It will be difficult to get out of this inheritance for a long time to come. Examples of this include attempts to reincarnate Josif Stalin's memory, new construction of his monuments, worship at demonstrations. Selective justice and the criminalisation of former political structures are also a burden from the past. We were able to observe it very strongly a few days ago. It was to Stalin that the Minister of Justice of Georgia compared former President Saakashvili at a meeting of our Committee on Foreign Affairs. Even unhealthy tensions between the ruling GD (Georgian Dream) and the opposition UNM (Unated National Movement) are a burden from the past. An example is the current unacceptable events surrounding the independent television station Rustavi 2. After all, pluralism of information and freedom of expression is one of the fundamental values of a democratic society. A few years ago, as a journalist, I filmed a television report on Yevgeny Yugashvili. He is the grandson of the aforementioned Josif Stalin. He lives in Tbilisi. We may think that the marginal Communist Party he founded is ridiculous and not dangerous. But the specter of the past bypasses Georgia and can seriously damage the country. Ladies and gentlemen, last December, we approved an association agreement with Georgia at this point. The agreement is based on strict respect for the principles of democracy, respect for the law, protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms. I wish Georgia a lot of courage and strength for this.

Its aim is that of revitalising and making more effective relations with the EU’s neighbours. In this context, we should give a new boost also to our Eastern Partnership or, at least, based on a differentiated approach, to the countries showing their readiness for developing relations and cooperation with the EU. Georgia is today a frontrunner from this point of view, and we need to bear in mind its importance for us and the need to stand by a country and people who have shown a clear pro-European attitude. Georgia is a very important partner for the EU in the Black Sea region and, I will also underline, a faithful one in the current dramatic context. After the signature of the Association Agreement, Georgia showed its commitment by making significant progress in the reforms, including in the framework of the visa liberalisation action plan. I hope that the next progress report will confirm all the efforts made by Georgia and that Georgian citizens can be rewarded with the free visa regime. Having said that, I would also like to underline that we cannot take Georgia’s stability for granted; we need Europe to provide all necessary assistance for the reform process, but also to support and reaffirm Georgia’s right for its independence, territorial integrity and sovereignty, keeping in mind the destabilisation process started by Russia in 2008 and recently continued with the signature of the so-called treaties with the breakaway regions of Abkhazia and Ossetia. At the same time, let us be clear, Georgia itself needs to ensure its internal stability, with a fair political environment, cross-party political support for key reforms and also a fair atmosphere in the electoral campaign.

Russia was, and still remains, an important strategic partner for the European Union. This reality has been emphatically apparent at this time when cooperation with Russia is essential in the fight against ISIS.  There is therefore no reason to continue the rivalry between us by using Georgia as a vehicle in this direction.

Indeed, if we strengthen Georgia's efforts for democratisation and economic development, we will certainly contribute to the creation of a better Europe.

Most of the changes came unfortunately with the high cost of an economic and energy blockade from Russia and armed conflicts in South Ossetia and Abkhazia.

It is the only country in the region that managed a peaceful transition from one government to another – a transition effected in the electoral booths rather than on the streets. Furthermore, Georgia is one of the three countries in the eastern neighbourhood which have stated that they want a closer relationship with the EU. The Association Agreement is the fundament of this – a relationship based on values. The rule of law, human rights and media freedom are at the core of these values. Therefore it is crucial that even the perception of political interference with the judiciary and a free press is avoided at all times. In this regard, to put it diplomatically, the case of Rustavi 2 should have been handled differently. But it is likewise worrying how former President Saakashvili tried to instrumentalise this case to instigate unrest, which is the last thing Georgians need right now. Georgia has to deliver on reforms. Furthermore, there so much instability around the country that it cannot afford deep internal divisions. The threats are external. Three years after the democratic change of government, it is high time for the political forces in the country to unite. An important tangible result of EU-Georgia cooperation might be the abolition of visa requirements for all Georgian citizens, but that could come under threat if the unhealthy political rivalry in the country continues. Are there still problems in Georgia? Yes, certainly. To name a few: the winner-takes-all mentality continues to prevail; the most influential political actor in Georgia is not accountable to anyone; and radical groups keep popping up, although it is a mystery who is financing them.

Georgia's position has improved in virtually all rankings, both in terms of media freedom, the internet, compliance with the law, the quality of civil rights management. These are facts. It is also a fact that pro-European and pro-democracy political sentiment and parties may be threatened by rising populist, anti-European groups. The strength of populist parties comes not so much from the seductive programme proposal to voters, but from the mistakes of the ruling elites, present and past, disillusionment with their attitudes revealed in the eavesdropping scandals. Opposition to the ruling is also aroused by brutal methods of dealing with the political opposition and the opposition media – as was the case recently with Rustavi 2 television. The overlapping problems with the separatist provinces of Abchaya, South Ossetia are causing concern as to whether Georgia will be able to maintain its Western course and the pace of democracy and economic development.

Visa-free travel between Georgia and the Union would benefit both sides not only for political reasons, but also for economic reasons and in the context of the development of the Bologna Process, which Georgia is pursuing in an exemplary manner. Georgia also needs more Union activity in the media and public relations fields, so that Russian propaganda does not have such an easy field to act.

During her visit, the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy/Vice-President of the Commission, Federica Mogherini, was encouraged by the constructive tone taken by the government and by the parliamentary faction leaders in Georgia. They acknowledge the need to maintain the focus on reforms and to create a safe space for campaigning ahead of next year’s parliamentary elections. There was a question on the issue of visa liberalisation. The visa liberalisation process is based on the outcome of evaluation missions carried out at the end of September/early October and with information provided by the Georgian authorities. We will be reporting on the state of play in December, i.e. next month. Once a final report is issued, the Commission will be in a position to present a legislative proposal to lift the visa obligation. The decision to do so will then lie with the European Parliament and the Council, and the time that would be needed to decide upon such a proposal is difficult to predict, as you know. Let me conclude by saying that the EU-Georgia Association Agreement is a concrete way to activate the full potential of our relations. The focus is on support for core reforms – which are essential – and, of course, on economic recovery and growth, governance and sector-based cooperation, for example in the fields of transport, energy and the environment.

Several events have taken place since the debate of last year, including parliamentary elections in November 2014 and, of course, a succession of two short-lived governments. All of you have followed the developments in Moldova since then, especially those concerning the big banking frauds, amounting to around USD 1 billion, which is around 12% of the GDP of the country, and the large protest movements and demonstrations which culminated at the beginning of September with a big gathering in Chișinău. While the banking scandal was at the centre of the demonstrations, people have been expressing their discontent more widely, demanding sustainable governance for the country and calling for corruption to be decisively tackled. Despite a decrease in intensity – probably in the expectation of political developments – these protests are still ongoing. The protesters are demanding the resignation of the President and the dismissal of the Prosecutor General and the head of the National Anti—Corruption Centre. They are also asking for the launch of a referendum on the direct election of the President. Recent developments – namely, the arrest of former Prime Minister Filat on 15 October and the subsequent dismissal of the government in a vote of no—confidence on 29 October – dramatically demonstrate the deep divide that has developed between the political parties that were coalition partners. As the EU, it is not our role to interfere in the internal political processes of a sovereign country. It is for the Moldovan political forces to put aside personal and group interests and to work together for the sake of their country. It is for them to make the political choices that take into account the welfare of their citizens, to help modernise the country and make the economy grow. These are the political choices that the European Union wants and is ready to support. We will continue to call for dialogue among the parties. In order to find sustainable solutions to the governance crisis and certainly in order to address pressing needs, we hope that a new government will pursue, as a matter of priority, the implementation of much-needed key reforms. Vested interests and corruption practices currently hinder development in the country and have a heavy impact on citizens’ everyday lives. Moldovan society expects these challenges to be tackled seriously. That was the message of the EU-Moldova Parliamentary Association Committee in its debates and Statement on 21 and 22 September 2015. I am also aware of the frank exchanges the Committee on Foreign Affairs had with the Speaker of the Moldovan Parliament Mr Candu at the beginning of last week. We have to remind our Moldovan partners that our support is conditional upon the implementation of key and genuine reforms and policies. This should contribute not only to regaining the trust of citizens but also to building a more resilient country and offering a democratic and stable business environment. Any new government will face the challenge of dealing, as one of its first actions, with the banking frauds through comprehensive, impartial and effective investigations, with the goal of recovering the diverted funds. Moldovan society will expect any new government to take clear and effective steps against corruption and to proceed with reforming the banking sector, the justice sector and, at the same time, public administration. Moldova is obviously in a difficult economic and financial situation and will need the support of the IMF. This will mean fulfilling certain conditions on energy tariffs, on the restructuring of the banking sector, and on the management of the National Bank. These are also essential preconditions for a possible resumption of EU budget-support disbursements, as well as for the implementation of our ambitious Association Agenda. The situation, as I have already described, reflects problems in the political system and, of course, the gap between the political system and society. This is, unfortunately, the situation, and this is why we need, together with this Parliament, to apply all those preconditions which I have already mentioned.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1981, "date": "2015-11-25.json", "name": "Elmar BROK", "mepid": "1263", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has I believe, Commissioner, that you are right in the current description of Moldova.  We must see that the three pro-European parties won the elections – albeit narrowly – but that they have not been able to build trust since the elections and have not been able to advance with credibility the stated objectives of modernising the country, the rule of law, and the fight against corruption. On the other hand, there are many in these parties who are prepared to achieve these objectives. As a parliamentarian, I can say that these political forces should be supported in finally setting up a decent, pro-European government, because the alternative is a disaster. For this reason, I believe that the European Union, the political families of this House, who are associated with parties there, should organise the necessary cooperation here and help Moldovans to make their decision on the path they are going, which government they form, but that we have an offer of cooperation and that we hope for this reason. , that there is also the responsibility of all those involved to do so in such a way that it is in the sense of a good development. This is no longer a time for personal gain, this is no longer a time for party political games of the past, this is a moment for real commitment in the interests of the Moldovan people. I hope that the talks that are taking place in these days will lead to such decisions and that this should not fail because of the political characteristics and dependencies, because the result will then be unaltered.

In doing so, this House acknowledged the reform efforts and ambitions of the Moldovan authorities. A lot of progress had been made, and the ratification was a strong sign of recognition. Moldova was the uncontested front runner of the Eastern Partnership, our favourite success story at that time. Dear colleagues, if we are meeting today in this Chamber to talk about Moldova, it is not to celebrate one year on from, or the first anniversary of, the ratification. To put it quite bluntly, there is nothing to celebrate. In these past 12 months I have met four different prime ministers. The fifth is on the way. The Co-Chair of our Parliamentary Association Committee, a former prime minister, has been arrested on corruption charges; a banking scandal involving all three major banking institutions has made USD 1 billion vanish – this is almost 50% of Moldova’s GDP – and now, more than ever, the country and its people need the political class to offer resolute action and strong vision. Parties are not even able to propose a new executive. The situation in Moldova is grave – so critical that the immediate temptation is to get angry because the process is no longer delivering. It is just disappointing us. The wonderland has turned into the dark side, but we should and will resist that temptation for the sake of Moldovan citizens. They deserve better; they deserve our engagement, our encouragement, and we will be at their side more than ever before. Moldova’s political class has simply failed its citizens, and we are very worried. The political process has no predictability. The political situation is in a perpetual state of instability, a chronic state of crisis. This means only one thing: the needs of the population are not being addressed, reforms are not being implemented and citizens are paying the bill. Moldova needs political leaders to take responsibility. Moldova needs transparent institutions. Put quite simply: Moldova needs a political class which is able to restore citizens’ trust. A new executive confirming the ambitions of the Association Agreement and effectively implementing the reforms needed could finally deliver, and that means the rule of law, an independent and efficient judiciary, a bold fight against corruption and a thorough investigation into banking fraud, bringing those responsible to justice. This is the last chance for the outgoing governing coalition. Once again: this is the last chance for the outgoing governing coalition. The deadline has passed, and there is no alternative to continuing on the path of the current reform agenda. We can see it, and Moldovan citizens can feel it.

Moldova has been given all the political tools that the European Union can offer to boost its Europeanisation. There is nothing more that the EU could have done for Moldova. But things started to go wrong – totally wrong – day after day, with the unprecedented banking scandal with no full investigation until now and the clear evidence of corruption throughout all political segments and layers with, I am afraid, no visible efforts made to fight it. The reforms are stuck. Let us be clear about that. That is no surprise, as governments are changing at the same speed as the seasons of the year. In a situation like this, it is probably natural to see people on the streets for several months. It is just a question of when the tension will explode. Today I am sorry to say that, from being a front runner, Moldova has become a symbol of political chaos. Today I call on the political elite of Moldova to please wake up. It is time.

Mr President, I would like to thank the In just seven years, four parliamentary elections, five governments, numerous changes in the filling of leading state offices, endless diadochen struggles of the political elites and repeated corruption, this puts even Moldova's well-intentioned analysts in need of explanation. Since the recent government crisis, the image has now been taken of the image that the former model student of the Eastern Partnership has become a state in the stranglehold of corrupt oligarchs.  Let me underline that this is the real problem, because nothing has just happened in Moldova, but we have not looked closely for a long time. What analysts have recently characterized as \"systemic failure\" has always been the case: despite elections, the political system is unstable and corrupt, and despite widespread liberalization, the economy still depends largely on external aid. Of course, a lot has also been done with the help of the EU. But what is the value of regular elections when political and economic power not only goes hand in hand, but is virtually one? What is the value of expensive reform consultations for the administration of justice if one continues to violate basic norms and, for example, simply locks up an opposition leader and active peaceful protests against the corruption of the ruling oligarchs for months, exposes them in some cases to high health risks and severely restricts their rights?  The population is increasingly questioning both the direction of the planned reforms and the integrity of the political class that drives them, a class that, while formally and verbally committed to EU values, then operates according to the oligarchs' own rules.

We are on the Moldovan side, but we need, day by day, arguments to promote its integration with the EU.

We adopted the budget today, and when we adopted that budget we agreed one of the key demands of our resolution which we will adopt tomorrow, namely to increase the humanitarian aid budget for education in emergencies substantially – by EUR 26 million. This is a figure that we proposed in the Committee on Development, and I want to congratulate Arne Lietz, our rapporteur. It is a big step towards the 4% target that we all want to see as part of the EU’s overall humanitarian aid budget, and I know that this is a cause close to the heart of nearly everybody in this room. Certainly, I know that for Commissioner Stylianides it is a big priority, as it is for for my own political group. I know that colleagues from the EPP, the Greens, the Liberals – all those I see here, and our colleagues in many Groups – have shared this view, and I thank you for your support. It was when I went to Turkey with the Development Committee earlier this autumn that I got a real sense of why it matters that we put money into education, because I visited a refugee camp of 17 500 people. I also visited some of the many families in the community and I got a real sense of what it means to the families who come to have to leave their homes and everything else behind and to start again, and also of what it means to a country to have to receive hundreds of thousands of refugees and try and offer education. We saw some excellent projects run by UNICEF and other organisations. In the refugee camp in Kahramanmaraş we saw UNICEF organising schools, paying Syrian teachers a stipend to offer education to the children, and providing a school curriculum. What was offered to those children was not just an education but a sense of normality, and the school was a happier place in that camp. We met children who were orphaned and had been through enormous trauma, but in the school they had a sense of normality: it was a place where they could be like other children. The Commission was providing kites and games and toys, as well as an education. There is one issue, however, which I am concerned about, and that is what happens when children get to the age of 16, 17 or 18 and want to go on to higher education. I think that is where we need to do more – because we met young people in southern Turkey who had lost their sense of hope for the future. They had had plans to go to university, to study and to train, and yet, at 17 or 18, they did not see any outlet. Those are the young people who are getting on boats, risking their lives crossing the Mediterranean, and we have to find a solution for them. I think we could do this with our universities and colleges, by offering scholarships. I am sure there is something more we can do. The message from our resolution was very clear. I know, Commissioner, that you are aware of the problem of the barrier between humanitarian aid and development funding. The Commission is trying to break that barrier down, and we welcome that. We have the new global goals now, on the basis of which we can work to consolidate education, particularly in countries which are precarious and fragile. Our figures show that up to 1 billion children are living in conflict areas in the world today. We will also soon have the report that my colleague, Enrique Guerrero Salom, is preparing for the World Humanitarian Aid Summit, and at that summit, Commissioner and colleagues, we will have to argue to get other players to back our increase in funding for this type of education.

I strongly believe that education for children in emergency and conflict situations is paramount. It is the most powerful tool we have to protect children and to ensure that they can have a better future – a secure future. Education in emergencies is a top priority for the Commission and for me personally. I know that it is a top priority for this Parliament, as Linda has already mentioned in a very strong way. Your actions speak loud. We are together in this and I am truly grateful for your support. Thank you so much again. We all agree: education is the foundation for everything else. It is the strongest shield for vulnerable children, protecting them from radicalisation, protecting them against forced recruitment, protecting them from falling prey to terrorist and other extremist groups, protecting them also from forced marriages, from taking dangerous migration routes. Education is therefore a primary need. I have seen it on the ground during my field visits in emergency and conflict areas and most recently in refugee camps in Jordan and Lebanon, and at the borders with Syria. My point is crystal clear: these people do not need aid only to meet their basic needs. They do not need just food and shelter. They also need dignity. They need hope and a real future for their children. As you rightly stress in your resolution, less than 2% of global humanitarian budgets goes to education, at a time when the number of 60 million refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs) is unprecedented. Today more than 34 million children are out of school due to humanitarian crises: 34 million children! This must change. We cannot continue with business as usual. New approaches are needed, definitely. Education is not a secondary issue, to be dealt with only in the second phase of an emergency, because education, by protecting children, also strengthens security, and it addresses one of the main causes of migration. Parents and children are not fleeing their homes just to get food and shelter. They are leaving because they also want access to education. In the last few years we have increased our allocation from the EU humanitarian budget to this sector. From the symbolic EUR 2 million in 2012, we reached this year EUR 11 million. This is roughly 1% of our humanitarian aid budget. Now we have to do more: much more. Earlier this year I committed to tripling this allocation in 2016 and reaching the UN target of 4% by 2019. I am really pleased and proud to announce today, in this Chamber, that I will reach the 4% target already from next year. This achievement is not my achievement; it belongs to you as well, because we could not reach the target without your strong support and without your proposal to allocate an additional EUR 26 million, as Linda mentioned, from the EU budget for this specific purpose. Sincerely speaking, your leadership and your actions have made a real difference. Thank you again for that. I am grateful for your crucial help to secure the necessary funds. Let me reassure you from my experience on the ground. Every euro invested in education and emergencies, is an investment for peace. I am working together with my colleagues Johannes Hahn and Neven Mimica, who are doing a great job in this field to meet this challenge, to make sure that children in emergency and conflict situations can benefit from projects in education, as we know through the Madad Fund in Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey and the Western Balkan corridors and in the other Trust Fund for Africa, and of course by establishing formal and informal schools through our experienced implementing partners on the ground. This is very important. All of you know very well the real impact of the informal schools, in particular in the Bekaa Valley. We have a collective responsibility to give every child a bright future. This is crucial.

And we often say that education is a passport to a better future. So what is the future ahead for these children and what is the future of their countries? Children can't wait for wars and crises to end. If we don't put the book in their hands right now, someone else will give them a weapon. In addition to education being the basic right of every child regardless of circumstances, education is also the most effective means of promoting peace, prosperity and stability, thus representing one of the most important investments. That is why for the EPP group, the education of children in emergencies and protracted crises was a priority in the humanitarian aid portfolio. On behalf of the club, I welcome the efforts of Commissioner Stylianides, who has continuously advocated an increase in funding for the area.

The European Union does not have a strong army to deal with conflicts at different ends of the world, but the European Union and European countries are the largest donors of humanitarian aid in the world. This money, if properly spent, gives a much stronger long-term result than weapons and armies. And channelling funding to the education of long-term children in crisis is our effective weapon against poverty, against crime, against terrorism. Quite statistically, around one billion children live in different types of conflict-affected areas. A quarter of them are under the age of 5. 10 million children are refugees, with a further 19 million displaced in their home countries.  The conclusion can only be one – it is not normal, it needs to be corrected. Consequently, I welcome the increase in the European Union's financial assistance from 4.4 billion to 4.7 billion by 2020.

Mr President, it is estimated that sixty-five million children live under emergency conditions and thirty-seven million are deprived of basic education due to adverse living conditions. The fact that such a large number of children lack education shows that there is a violation of basic human rights in countries experiencing crises. This is true in African countries, and is much more true in refugee camps in Jordan, Lebanon and on the Syrian-Turkish border.  Lack of education is also a problem in developed countries, such as Greece, which is experiencing the policies of austerity and memoranda and where the education budget is increasingly reduced. In addition, Greece is rapidly deteriorating in terms of children's living conditions, while child poverty is now also having an impact on education and has increased by more than fifty per cent since 2008.

I have noted your perspectives and suggestions, including the last one about informal education and the one about distance learning. We have already discussed some initiatives through UNRWA for Palestinian refugee children. I would like to thank Parliament very much again for this very special discussion. I am truly glad that we have such exemplary cooperation in this very difficult field. I would like to say a few more words on two issues. One is informal education, which is a practical solution in exceptional circumstances in countries whose formal capacities are overstretched. Lebanon is an example of this. I visited the region again a few days ago and saw the practical value of such alternative mechanisms on the ground, in particular in the Bekaa Valley. Informal education is also the necessary first stage for the integration into formal education of a child, or even an adult, who has been out of school for a very long time. This has, for example, been the case for children who were actively involved in conflicts in Africa and the Middle East. Secondly, on linking emergency assistance with the EU’s long—term assistance, linking relief, rehabilitation and development, the so-called LRRD: this is very important, and I strongly welcome the fact that you referred to this extensively in the resolution. Education ultimately requires a long—term perspective which humanitarian aid alone cannot provide. This is why, together with my colleagues Commissioner Mimica and Commissioner Hahn, we are working to ensure the complementarity of our instruments, as I have already mentioned, through new trust funds in Africa and the Middle East, to help in the Syrian crisis. This is something which is already ongoing with many instruments, and there are several instances where EU Children of Peace programmes have been continued or scaled up by development instruments. I would like to say something about the engagement of the private sector in this respect. Members know that a lot of money, for example in some Gulf countries, has unfortunately not been utilised until now for the very specific purpose of education in emergencies. It is very important to see new global instruments, such as the new Global Fund, which may manage to utilise this money through private means. It is very important to allow this way to make a difference and to find solutions on the ground. It is not a dispute between the public sector and the private sector but something more than this. I would once again like to thank Members for their strong leadership, especially my dear colleagues from the Committee on Development – Linda and other colleagues. Let us continue our efforts together. I would like to say that the real practical impact of these initiatives for education in emergencies is very important in showing the real benefits on the ground in conflict areas, such as the Bekaa Valley and the Zaatari refugee camp, and inside Syria. My next initiative is to find solutions for education in emergencies in the region around Aleppo. Thank you so much again for your collaboration.
