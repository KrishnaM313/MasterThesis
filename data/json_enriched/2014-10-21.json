This issue is considered to be a priority issue by the Italian Presidency, in line with the conclusions of the June European Council, which identified growth and employment as priority themes for the Work of the European Union over the next five years. This issue remains very topical in view of the particularly high unemployment rates: 11.5% in the euro area in August, with marked differences between Member States and worrying points with regard to youth unemployment: 23.1% in the euro area, over 50% in some Member States. In this context, also on the basis of the indications of the extraordinary European Council in August, the Italian Presidency organised the High Level Conference on Employment in Milan on 8 October, as a follow-up to the conferences held in Berlin in July 2013 and in Paris last November, which focused on youth employment. The main aim of the work of this last edition was to reflect on the need to provide new and coordinated responses for the revival of growth and employment, including through appropriate investment policies. During the work of the Conference, in which 16 Heads of State or Government took part, the conditions necessary for the creation of new jobs and for improving the correspondence between supply and demand for labour were examined. First of all, it was agreed on the crucial ity of structural reforms, which were seen as crucial to restarting the labour market and promoting employment. It was noted, however, that these conditions were necessary but not sufficient and should be supplemented by action on the application. In addition to the reforms, a growth environment is crucial, which inevitably leads to a revival of investment. The need to provide shared and coordinated responses at EU level was therefore discussed. The Conference was divided into three sessions: an opening technique for the directors of public employment services, followed by a working lunch of ministers dealing with employment issues and in the afternoon the session at the level of Heads of State or Government. The Breakfast of Labour Ministers focused on direct measures and instruments for promoting employment, particularly youth employment. In this regard, ministers made a request to the Commission to strengthen the Youth Employment Initiative, which should become a structural scheme of the European Union with a request to significantly increase the amount of pre-financing of the funds dedicated to it. The need for more effective procedures for implementing the Youth Guarantee was also mentioned, a programme which is successfully taking off in several Member States, as illustrated by the directors of public employment services at the opening technical session. As regards the implementation of direct employment programmes, the contribution of the European Investment Bank was recognized, among other things, in stressing the importance of investment in human capital and training. The transition from school to work and dual training have been cited as a virtuous model and the role of employment services has been mentioned. The actions of the Heads of State or Government in stressing the importance of national reforms to increase the efficiency and transparency of the labour market underlined the need to identify instruments to accompany the growth of the real economy and promote investment within the framework of the rules governing the governance of the economy in the euro area and in the single market. Equally important is the identification of strategic sectors with high growth potential on which to focus the attention of the institutions. Finally, sectors of the digital economy, transport and energy were mentioned as priorities.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "NI"}, {"id": 2, "date": "2014-10-21.json", "name": "László Andor", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "  Member of the Commission. - Madam President, the meeting of Heads of State and Government last week in Milan reconfirmed their determination to make the Youth Guarantee a reality. As you know, the Commission under the leadership of President Barroso has taken a number of initiatives to improve the employment situation and the life prospects of young people. The Youth Guarantee is a key structural reform of our time. Its implementation is at the core of the EU coordination of employment policies and it is therefore central to the European Semester and the country-specific recommendations.  The Youth Guarantee is a comprehensive policy which includes the modernisation of vocational training, strengthening of public employment services, greater support for apprenticeships and traineeships, as well as financial incentives for job creation and business start-ups. All these measures need to be combined in order to ensure that every young person under the age of 25 receives a good quality offer of a job, continued education, apprenticeship or traineeship within four months after leaving school or becoming unemployed. The Youth Guarantee focuses both on improving the quality of labour supply, for instance through training, and on stimulating demand for young people’s labour, for instance targeted wage or recruitment subsidies and apprenticeship grants.  The Youth Guarantee is being implemented across Europe. Some Member States have amended their legislation, others have introduced new policy instruments to scale up labour market-related measures for young people. For example, in Spain, the number of vocational education in training (VET) centres of companies involved in dual projects and of VET students has doubled since 2013. In Slovakia, hiring subsidies are proving effective in supporting long-term unemployed young people. The Youth Guarantee has already resulted in 12 000 jobs in Slovakia, mainly in SMEs, and most of them sustainable.  In parallel, vocational education is also being modernised. Just last week I visited a second-chance school in Turin, Italy, where young people are learning various crafts such as baking or brewing, and cooperative enterprises play an important role in offering them first employment.  The EU budget provides important financial support for the roll-out of the Youth Guarantee. The first instrument to be used was obviously the European Social Fund for 2007-2013 from which Member States have planned to finance human capital investment up to 2015. On top of that, we have the EUR 6.4 billion Youth Employment Initiative, whose implementation has been frontloaded to 2014-15 in terms of budgetary commitments. As I already informed you in September, we expect that operational programmes covering 85% of the Youth Employment Initiative will be adopted by the end of this year. Importantly, expenditure on Youth Employment Initiative projects has been eligible since 1 September 2013. This means that many Member States have been spending their money from this envelope for more than a year and the expenditure will be reimbursed after the operational programmes are adopted. In addition, the Member States have proposed to allocate more than EUR 4 billion from the European Social Fund 2014-2020 to the investment priority specifically supporting young people’s labour market integration. Considerable further resources from the ESF are also being programmed for general job search support measures, entrepreneurship support or vocational training investments from which young people will also benefit.  The Youth Guarantee has a cost, but it should be considered an investment. Investing in the Youth Guarantee’s implementation here and now is crucial for preserving the EU’s future growth potential. As you know, the economic value of the Youth Guarantee has been highlighted by the OECD, the ILO and Eurofound. More recently, the G20 strongly supported it and invited countries to step up implementation. The economic value of the Youth Guarantee is related both to building up the human capital stock and to improving the flow of this human capital into and within the labour market. In other words, it pays off to ensure that young people quickly find relevant jobs where their productive potential can be realised. For this we need not only education and training, but also active labour market policies, high-performing public employment services, as well as measures stimulating demand for labour, such as targeted hiring subsidies, all embedded together in the Youth Guarantee Schemes. These investments and their returns are harder to measure than, for instance, infrastructure investments, but they are very important, both to strengthen the human capital stock and to improve labour market flows and transitions. That is why the Youth Guarantee expenditure should be considered as an investment. Heads of State and Government and Ministers meeting last week in Milan reconfirmed that the Youth Guarantee is – and should remain – the framework for our efforts to improve youth employment across Europe. I am therefore confident that the value of these investments will be recognised also in the EU’s future plans for investment. Some Member States still seem to be facing constraints when it comes to their ability to pre-finance the implementation of the Youth Guarantee measures from their national budgets. As you know very well, the EU structural investment funds provide only very limited pre-financing in the 2014-20 period, namely 1% in the year 2014, which can be increased to 1.5% in cases of the Youth Employment Imitative for countries that had recently been subject to a macroeconomic adjustment programme. We may all agree that this level of pre-financing is low, but unfortunately it is closely linked to the overall design of the multiannual financial framework and in particular to the very low payment ceiling for the first couple of years. The EU budget, as you know, is suffering from a severe shortage of payment appropriations, which also means that there was no room to envisage higher pre-financing rates for the Youth Employment Initiative, at least not in the absence of a change of attitude from some Member States. However, the European Investment Bank has been offering to Member States the possibility of bridge financing, with their investments to be later reimbursed from the Youth Employment Initiative. In this way the EIB could help to resolve this liquidity problem. A couple of Member States have already discussed with the EIB the possibilities and I am sure the bank’s doors remain open to all Member States. I reiterated the same messages last Thursday during the formal EPSCO meeting attended by the Employment and Social Affairs Ministers. Honourable Members, the Milan Summit delivered one important message: if we want to have more employment in Europe we need to combine structural reforms with support for aggregate demand. The Youth Guarantee is a structural reform and it also helps in boosting demand for young workers. Successful delivery of the Youth Guarantee supported in a timely way by the relevant EU funds remains a priority for the Commission. I am sure that it will continue to be treated as an urgent and important issue also by the incoming Commission.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 3, "date": "2014-10-21.json", "name": "Elisabeth MORIN-CHARTIER", "mepid": "38596", "text": "  on behalf of the EPP group. Madam President, Commissioner, thank you for your very enlightened and just intervention in more ways than one. For my part, I would like to remind the Council that there are six commandments to remember. I give the short version, you will not have ten, you will only have six. But remember these six commandments to successfully integrate young people into the job market. The first commandment is to combat unse qualified exits from training systems. A large proportion of young people coming out of training - almost 20% - have no qualifications and find themselves directly unemployed. This is the first point on which you must make a real effort: to fight against exits without qualifications. The second commandment is to modernize training in general, not just vocational training. Indeed, we are now in a situation where young engineers are also unemployed. It is the training that needs to be modernized, by hanging it in a much more operational way in the world of work. The third commandment is to give back to learning, alternation and internships. Internships have been misguided throughout Europe, and apprenticeships and alternation, in most European countries, are considered to be smaller training. These are essential training courses that correspond to a form of spirit for young people. The fourth commandment is to have a vision of \"new skills, new jobs\". We have worked on it and you know very well that in the coming years, by 2020, 15% of low-skilled jobs will disappear again. We have to be prepared for that, otherwise we will continue to run after time. The fifth commandment is to have no longer only knowledge, but also skills and abilities. Finally, the sixth command, for the Council, is to put in place operational programs.

My message here today is that the eurozone is going to be there. Instead of curing the economy, the Heads of State or Government and the European Commission are trying to save the euro. In the meantime, my country, Germany, is also infected by this disease. In all the hearings i attended when it came to the Commissioners, I have noted that it has been pointed out everywhere that restoring competitiveness in the euro area is the great priority. In order to save the euro, the exact opposite is happening: instead of advocating subsidiarity in Europe, centralism is now being preached – it is also necessary to save the euro. Instead of maintaining ownership of public and bank debt in one country, this responsibility is now being socialised. In other words, if everyone is responsible, then in the end no one is responsible. Instead of creating competition in Europe, the opposite is now being called for. Commissioner Andor, in particular, has excelled here with proposals for the socialisation of social security systems.

It is much too slow. Yes, we know that six or nine billion – whatever it is – is not enough; it is not nearly enough for the youth guarantee. On this point I agree with Angela Merkel: spend the money before you look for more. But at another level, we all know the inflexibility of some Member States when it comes to ensuring that the EU budget is fit for purpose. I suppose for many Member States the real question is: do they have the resources or the freedom to use those resources for job creation? You yourself referred to this, Commissioner. In that context I am more inclined to agree with Prime Minister Renzi, who said that the current rules were designed for the Europe of many years ago, as he said, for another world. Our governments must have the ability to respond to change. To be stuck in a moment, to believe that one size fits all, to believe that there is one and only one solution to the on-going crisis, that is budget consolidation, that is a negation of what Europe is about. We say time and time again Europe must respond to change. Yet history, fear and, in some cases, distrust keeps us stuck in the same rut. Just before the job summit, the IMF warned the EU to beef up its investments in public infrastructure, which will boost demand in the short-term and help potential output in the medium-term. In Europe, those countries who want to spend are not allowed to and those countries who can spend have decided not to. It is a recipe for stagnation, deflation, flat growth and, sadly, for an erosion in citizens’ belief that the EU can work effectively to tackle its problems. Finally, what structural changes do we need? Yes, we need to align skills and training with market opportunities and we need to invest in sustainable technologies, eliminate red tape, etc. But structural reform cannot be a code word for an opportunity just to provide cheap labour. At a seminar at Parliament last week, a young unemployed Portuguese person said that firing parents to employ their sons and daughters at half their wages is no solution. And yes, while we all need to serve our internships and our apprenticeships, the Youth Guarantee cannot be an opportunity to use and abuse young people. I agree with the Swedish Prime Minister: we need decent jobs.

So what shall we do to improve the situation of youth and bring youth back to the labour market? My first answer is labour market reform. All of those countries which have dared to make labour market reforms, even if difficult, even if unpopular ten years ago, their economies are stronger and more resilient and more competitive now. All of the countries which have postponed labour market reforms are in a more difficult situation. Too often youth is the victim of a rigid labour market which protects those who are already employed but takes away the opportunities for young people to enter the labour market.   My second answer is that we need to provide a framework in which the private sectors feel confident to invest, through competitiveness, innovation, research, solid public budgets and most notably structural reforms, because it is the private sector which mainly creates the jobs. Thirdly, Commissioner, I am a supporter of the Youth Guarantee Scheme because I think unemployment levels are so high in Europe that every measure which leads to bringing youth unemployment down is good. But we need to improve the Youth Guarantee Scheme. We need to tailor it to Member States, because we have it now in practice, and we have been talking about it for one, almost two years but we see that young people in Europe are not really finding many more jobs. What I would like to ask you is to make sure that you get the public employment services which are already meeting at European level more involved in tailoring the Youth Guarantee Scheme so that it responds to the needs of the people in various EU Member States.

Therefore, this is not only solved by improving the professional insertion of young people or with an improvement in educational and formative system, however important it may be.

One of the main causes of youth unemployment, as has already been said, is that it is still not possible to match the qualifications of young Europeans with the needs of the labour market: simply to match demand with supply. This disease – and let me use the word – prevents our young people from finding work after school, simply because they have not been able to acquire the skills that businesses need.  If this inconsistency between education and the profession is not resolved as soon as possible, the Europe of tomorrow cannot be healthy, competitive and cannot return to growth!  However, we need concrete action. Let me tell you one: I am now launching a project in the Czech Republic aimed at bringing together successful entrepreneurs and young people through traineeships that will enable young people to get in touch first-hand with successful production realities. The aim is not to create yet another traineeship project, but to give opportunities to motivated young people and make them understand what the real needs of the labour market are.

First, I am afraid that my generation could be a lost generation and second, a lot of the young people of today will decide not to realise their potential here in Europe.  Programmes like the Youth Employment Initiative and the Youth Guarantee, borne out here in this agenda, have ambitious goals backed by substantial funding, and while there is much talk about their aspirations, we know very little about their achievements. I would very much like to know how many young people have benefited from the Youth Guarantee so far, and what trends we are observing in the reduction of unemployment as a result.   I do understand that perhaps the achievements might be difficult to assess and that there is a sound reason for that, but we need to adopt a fundamentally different approach, one that goes beyond pledges and guarantees and devises a grand strategy for tackling the problems faced by youth instead.  A three-step plan proposed last year which is based on tax breaks, entrepreneurship investment and skill-based education was backed by the Council and the European Parliament. Providing such a model, as it tackles several key components simultaneously, is crucial. Providing security and stability for the young people on our continent requires more than individual programmes and initiatives. It requires an overhaul of old practices, a reform from the bottom up, a change of thinking, culture and decisive action. As the Commissioner said, investing in the Youth Guarantee is crucial.

It is important – I do not want to say wonderfully – but it is very important that these summits exist at all, that the issue of employment has been discussed in a sufficiently serious framework. However, the result is more than sobering. The EUR 300 billion investment plan has been discussed, but it is simply not enough for the Member States to wait for the concrete plans. It is therefore long past time to invest more and sustainably again. I say this also to the previous speaker. This is the only way we can boost employment, domestic demand and the economy as a whole. So it is always about the big picture, about the macroeconomic picture in which young people are embedded with their fates and which we cannot easily wipe away. To do this, the Member States need more flexibility in deficit rules. Sustainable investments, such as infrastructure, renewable energy or education and training, are to be excluded from the calculations. Saving at all costs is the wrong way to go. Even the IMF tells us this in the meantime. And you have all taken note of that. Youth employment was a central theme of this summit. I can no longer list the number of times we have discussed this issue here in this Chamber and how many times we have urged swift action. Nevertheless, the situation of young people is becoming increasingly difficult. because what good is it for a young person who has already completed his third postgraduate degree when there are simply no jobs? Once again, the macroeconomic environment must be right! In implementing the Youth Guarantee, some countries need to step up their efforts. Yes that's right.

However, the issue, which concerns us all, is crucial for Europeans and is obviously crucial for the unemployed who are concerned and especially for young people. I had simply said to myself, perhaps very naively, that this summit would at least serve to put on top the pile the terrible unemployment of young people, which is our top priority. But the tools that we have put in place, and which we have been talking about since 9 a.m. this morning, are slow to get started and are not being implemented. Only two Member States have actually implemented the Youth Guarantee. How is this possible, when 24% of our young people are unemployed in Europe? How can we imagine that the Commission is not pushing the Member States to implement this scheme which it often talks about and which does not materialize? Should we stand idly by and allow this despair, which is accompanied by extremist sensibilities, to rise and progress? So, beyond the financial aspects that we have talked about, beyond the tools, we need to move the whole system: mobility, the correspondence between studies and the demand for employment, infrastructure, support, especially SMEs, which are the only ones to create jobs.

The loosening and continuous precarization of working conditions means sacrificing people to solve the problems generated by financial speculation.

It will be essential for the next European Council on 23 and 24 October to sketch out specific proposals for jobs and job creation in Europe.

Indeed, there were reports about the progress being made and the Commission also keeps reporting about the results of pilot projects, as well as the actual Youth Guarantee implementation, on its own website.  Ms Paunova and others who were asking about this can find information about it on the DG Employment website, and I have also been reporting regularly to this House about the progress made. The Youth Guarantee is, as you know, an EU-wide initiative, but it is not a uniform model. It is tailor-made. Countries themselves were designing their own youth guarantee implementation plans according to common guidelines which were provided at EU level. This is something to be emphasised, because Mr Mureșan as well as Mr Arnott were asking about this aspect. Certainly, the Youth Guarantee is tailor-made in the case of each and every EU Member State. We took inspiration from the pioneers, Austria and Finland, inside the EU and all countries have to apply the common principles – the four-month deadline, for example, and the importance of quality jobs, apprenticeships, training or learning according to their own needs and capacity.   We have to clarify in such a broad discussion what the Youth Guarantee actually is and what it is not. The Youth Guarantee is primarily about the school-to-work transition. It is about improving school and training performance; improving labour market performance and the connection between the two, because this is where many young people, including the so called NEETs, have been lost – and not only at the time of the crisis. We are not only responding to the crisis with the Youth Guarantee, but also to the previous model of economic development, which was not inclusive enough and because of which Europe was losing significant growth potential. The Youth Guarantee is certainly not a tool against deflation because, again, on deflation it is the European Central Bank which needs to act, and the surplus countries of the euro zone, by boosting investment and also wages. It is not a tool to generally promote industrial competitiveness, because innovation has to be promoted for that purpose, and it is certainly not a tool to respond to asymmetric shocks in the monetary union, because for that we would need a counter-cyclical fiscal capacity.  The new financial instrument, the Youth Employment Initiative, is in a way an embryonic fiscal capacity to respond also to the cyclical rise of youth unemployment in the European Union, but it has to function according to the rules of the structural funds. The Commission has to observe these rules and we have to be held accountable according to the regulations. I am sure that is also what the House would demand from the Commission. Nevertheless, the Commission has been doing its utmost to help the Member States to accelerate implementation of the Youth Guarantee and the financial instruments supporting it. We have been helping to design the programmes; we have been helping to exchange experiences and also accelerating the adoption when necessary.   Those who are still not satisfied with the speed, like Ms Steinruck and Mr Ropé, obviously would like to see a different type of fiscal capacity, for example in the form of automatic stabilisers, because that would indeed immediately provide financial support, but under the current design of the EMU, such capacity does not exist.    I think Mr Kósa is right. Apart from the young generation, we also have to speak seriously and also act seriously about the unemployment in the European Union. The youth, those under 25, represent about a fifth of total unemployment in the European Union. Total unemployment in the last one year has been falling, contrary to what some Members of this House actually believe. The problem is that it has not been falling fast enough, it has not been falling everywhere, and very often the quality of the new jobs is not what we would like to see. Indeed the quality of employment has also suffered during the crisis years and the Commission’s initiatives have to respond to all these aspects: the speed of job creation, the balanced nature of economic growth and also the quality of employment. Where the overall macroeconomic picture is concerned – and I agree with Ms Regner, this is very important – it is obviously true that the youth guarantee alone will not create a job-rich recovery. We outlined an employment package in 2012 with a host of measures that need to be taken: shifting taxation away from labour, for example, which Member States are capable of doing just very, very slowly, but it also should be seen as a priority. Boosting entrepreneurship and helping enterprises to employ more people is indeed an important part of this broader policy. But certainly, when we are facing the risk of another downturn it is also important that fiscal as well as monetary policies use their existing room for manoeuvre to stimulate the economy and to boost investment, which certainly should not remain just a buzz word of our time. I do not think it is helpful when some blame migrants for the level of unemployment in the EU, including for youth unemployment. In fact the two countries that receive the highest numbers of migrant workers in the Europe Union, Germany and the UK, are doing relatively well. Germany has had relatively low unemployment rates during the crisis as well and the UK is experiencing one of the fastest falls in unemployment, despite having received relatively large numbers of EU migrants. Finally, on the question of decent work, because indeed this has been a priority for the Commission, not only inside the EU but also internationally, just in the last one year we rolled out a number of initiatives: the quality framework on restructuring, the quality framework on traineeships, a new health and safety strategy for the next seven years and the European platform proposal against undeclared work. All these initiatives are supposed to help boost the quality of employment and improve industrial relations in the European Union, but certainly they do not cover all aspects of the employment policy in the Member States because a large part of it is dependent on national law, for example in the case which has been mentioned, about Hungary. Indeed, the Commission finds it regrettable that some of these domestic measures have caused serious damage to the quality of employment, and the country operates with an inflated public scheme which is on the one hand quite costly and secondly does not help many of the participants reintegrate into the labour market at a later stage. But we have been promoting this as well inside the EU and we have been doing that also internationally, in the context of the G20.  Just yesterday we had a meeting with the representatives of Bangladesh, involving the ILO as well, because we cannot allow unfair competition to continue internationally which does not respect the rights of workers and does not protect workers from risks to their health and safety at the workplace. I hope you find all these initiatives positive and helpful. We remain committed to boosting the quality of employment in general, but also specifically for young people in Europe.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 2, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 61, "date": "2014-10-21.json", "name": "Benedetto DELLA VEDOVA", "mepid": "4739", "text": "  Mr President- in-Office of the Council. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, very briefly because I do not think there are any conclusions to be drawn.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me first of all thank my colleagues shadow rapporteurs from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for their good cooperation, as well as the rapporteurs of the opinions of the various other committees. It is not always easy to overcome the ideological contradictions that exist in this House in this dossier, but I think we have managed to write a very sound report. I also think it is important for this Parliament to be in a state of opinion on the European Semester. It is a very important policy instrument for the Commission and for the European institutions to enable economic coordination between member states. I therefore call on the whole Parliament to support this report by a broad majority in tomorrow's vote. We all know that our European economy has experienced its worst crisis since the Second World War. The very weak economic recovery that is now occurring shows that the crisis is still not over and that we will have to make further efforts. We are therefore making agreements here in the European Parliament with the European institutions and the Member States to come out of the crisis together. Budgetary discipline, national reforms, but also European investment must make it possible to re-create economic growth and create jobs. That is also the key message of my report. That is also the key message I will be putting here today on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. The work isn't finished. The crisis has shown that we have lived long at the expense of future generations and this needs to be restored. The crisis has also shown that our economies are strongly linked, whether we like it or not. We cannot therefore afford to just look at our own backyard, because if we do that we are in the risk of actually losing an entire generation of young people. Member States will therefore have to show more ownership of the agreements they make with the European institutions. Politically, it is not always easy to explain what needs to be done; the necessary reforms to be implemented in the various Member States. But the European Semester makes it clear that coordination is needed. We must make the best use of European funds to support innovation, research, infrastructure investment. But at the same time, member states must also realise that ownership is necessary to make economic coordination possible, with this report and with the European Semester. If we do not do this, if we tolerate that certain Member States do not take Europe into account at the expense of other Member States, what is the future of the European Semester and what is the future of the European Union? I also think it is important to continue to debate in this House and to ask for more democratic control over the whole process. Here too, my report is very clear. The work isn't finished there either. We must ensure that the European Parliament can play its full role as a democratic institution that exercises democratic control over European processes. The community method is, of course, the preferred method for this. For example, we must ensure that democratic control is exercised over all programmes proposed by the Troika. My report also sets out very clearly what tasks are ahead of us. Firstly, a number of tasks at European level to strengthen our competitiveness, to ensure that the Member States, but also the European Union as a whole remain competitive, conquer new export markets and also make full use of it to support the growth that needs to come from SMEs, the business community and the private market. Structural reforms must also be carried out, in the labour market, in the pension system, in social security, not in order to organise social degradation, which is certainly not – but to modernise our social security, and to ensure that future generations can continue to benefit from that social security. The conclusion is therefore very clear. All Member States must take responsibility. Only 10% of European recommendations are actually put into practice today. Policies need to be better coordinated economically to ensure that we can create growth and jobs. We must also ensure that the course that Europe has chosen is maintained. It will also deliver results in terms of growth, jobs and employment in the long term. I believe that the right policy mix consists of a combination of monetary policy, fiscal policy and structural reforms. I therefore ask this House to present my report tomorrow with fully support. I hope that this will send a clear signal to the Council and the Commission to ensure that the European Semester remains the essential policy instrument needed to create new economic growth in Europe and the Member States.", "language": "en", "original_language": "nl", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 77, "date": "2014-10-21.json", "name": "Benedetto DELLA VEDOVA", "mepid": "4739", "text": "  Mr President- in-Office of the Council. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am pleased to have the opportunity to take part this morning in the debate on the European Semester. I have carefully examined the draft resolution which forms the basis of this debate and I am impressed by the wide range of issues that are addressed and the importance of the issues addressed. In fact, this morning's debate goes beyond the mechanics of economic coordination. We are here to discuss how Europe conducts its economic policy, its employment policy and all the other policies that contribute to employment and growth. The resolution focuses on the implementation of the priorities for 2014: implementation is key; we already have strategic guidelines, at Eu ropean Union level, the conclusions of the European Council and, for each Member State, country-specific recommendations. The implementation of these recommendations requires bold structural reforms, including in areas of national competence, which are sometimes at odds with acquired rights. The benefits are slow to show up, which in turn increases political pressure. The Council is strongly encouraging the Member States to carry out these reforms. This debate is about priorities for 2014, but we must recognise that the European Semester is not an exercise and cannot be an exercise in which priorities change radically from one year to the next. Some details may change from one year to the next, but the priorities themselves fall within a longer time horizon. That is exactly what the Presidency is doing this autumn. Let us look at the European Semester in the wider context of the Europe 2020 strategy and its mid-term review. The review must also strengthen the link between all the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy and the European Semester. That is why the Presidency has launched a political reflection at Council level on the mid-term review of the Europe 2020 strategy. We decided from the outset that all stakeholders should be involved in this exercise, including, for example, those involved in sectors such as agriculture, culture and cohesion. The exercise is still ongoing, but I would like to take this opportunity to highlight some of the initial results. Firstly, all the debates held so far have confirmed the importance of keeping the focus of the Europe 2020 strategy on employment and growth.  The second message is ambition. Despite the significant progress that has been made, especially with regard to energy and education, we must recognise that we are not yet on the right track in all areas. Employment, in particular, is a matter of grave concern. But, although progress is insufficient, we must not pursue less ambitious objectives. The third message concerns the strengthening of governance. Policy guidelines issued in the context of the European Semester can sometimes be bitter pills. But I am pleased to say that no one wants to weaken the semester. In fact, we must try to streamline the process and improve its results. We must also ensure that all those who have to implement the reforms are included in the process. This includes not only governments, but also parliaments and other stakeholders, both at national and EU level. Allow me to say a few words about sectoral contributions to this debate. With regard to competitiveness, the Council confirmed in September that the single market and industrial competitiveness must be firmly integrated into the Europe 2020 strategy. In the field of research and innovation, in particular, which play a key role in Europe's economic recovery, the quality of investment in research and innovation is just as essential as the level of expenditure. We must do more to promote a European research area. In the field of economic policy, the Council's approach is based on three pillars which represent a combination of measures to be implemented simultaneously and jointly by the Member States. The first is the structural reform, to which I have already referred and which is closely linked to the second. The second is investment, which is a key priority for the Italian Presidency, and the third is the need to consolidate confidence, through a differentiated budgetary policy geared to growth and respect for the Stability and Growth Pact, while at the same time making use of the flexibility inherent in its rules. The Council welcomes President-elect Juncker's announcement to present an investment initiative within the first three months of his term of office. Investment will help to relaunch demand in the short term, but will also contribute to increasing the long-term growth potential of the economy. With regard to employment and social affairs, the Council discussed the Europe 2020 strategy last week, and the Italian Presidency met the Heads of State at the beginning of October to find solutions to the problem of unemployment, but this concerns the in-depth debate we had at the previous point.  In this regard, I would like to draw your attention to the letter signed by 22 Member States, with the support of the Italian Presidency, which stresses the need for better integration of gender equality into the revised strategy. In conclusion, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have set out the main points of our work so far. The Ministers for the Environment, Cohesion, Education, Culture, Transport, Energy and Telecommunications will also contribute. We will then carry out a synthesis work, with the preparation of a report for the General Affairs Council in December. We hope that this joint political reflection will be of use to the new Commission when preparing its proposals for the mid-term review.

This report is a timely and important contribution to the topical debate on economic governance in the EU. The report touches upon a wide range of issues, many of which are related to Parliament’s expectations of the Commission in the future.  Provided that Parliament confirms the new College tomorrow, the new Commission can be in place at the beginning of November. So we are currently in the middle of transition. I therefore hope you understand that here today I will not be in a position to answer all your questions related to the future actions of the new Commission. However, I can assure you that this does not mean that we are not listening. On the contrary, we have taken into consideration the points you have raised in the report. I can also assure you that this will have the attention of the new Commission. I fully agree with you that the most pressing challenge ahead of us is to create sustainable growth and generate jobs. The European Semester has been an extremely useful exercise in identifying and coordinating policy responses to the challenges faced by individual Member States and the EU as a whole. The Member States are adjusting to the reinforced coordination process and common rules we built together in the depths of the crisis. The Semester has proven to be fundamental in presenting incentives for significant fiscal and structural reforms in the Member States. These are the very reforms that are essential to exit the crisis stronger and more united. The market turbulence of last week reminded us of the need to stay the course with reforms, in order to secure the confidence of the markets and, in doing so, unlock our growth potential and open up more job opportunities. This continues to be at the very core of the EU’s agenda going forward. There is clearly room for improvement. The next Commission will review the Europe 2020 Strategy and will present the upcoming annual Growth Survey at the launch of the next European Semester cycle. In the report there is, quite rightly, a great focus on the importance of implementing and monitoring the recommendations in the European Semester. The recommendations must be concrete. They must not only address fiscal consolidation, but also structural reforms that can create sustainable and socially-balanced growth. Jobs are making the EU market more competitive.  The success of the European Semester depends on implementation. This is why we monitor the implementation of reforms throughout the year and take action in case of insufficient or harmful policy development. It is important to recall that non-compliance with recommendations will not in itself trigger sanctions, but nor is it meant to. This is about policy coordination. Implementation of the country-specific recommendations ultimately relies on national policy-making at the national parliaments. In this regard, I wish to take the opportunity to emphasise three significant findings in the report. First is the importance of putting in place a comprehensive mechanism that promotes the exchange of best practices between all national and EU-level actors responsible for getting more young people into work. In this regard, it is essential to speed up the implementation of programmes such as COSME, Erasmus+ and Horizon 2020, with nearly EUR 80 billion of funding available over seven years.  The second point is to devote more attention to improving the quality of jobs in order to match peoples’ skills with the real needs of the labour market. Finally, I strongly support our fight against tax fraud and tax evasion and to shift the tax burden away from labour towards other forms of taxation that are less detrimental to growth and employment. One such example is environmental taxation.  I see much agreement between the report and the Commission’s own position. I hope this will be highlighted in our constructive and fruitful debate today.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 79, "date": "2014-10-21.json", "name": "Nils TORVALDS", "mepid": "114268", "text": "  rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Budgets. - (C) A policy is only as effective as it is implemented. This also applies, of course, to the financial semester.  The global financial crisis clearly showed how the Western world since the mid-1970s only in small steps, later with momentum, has lived above its means. The financial crisis also showed how the economies of the EU countries are connected. A country's economic concern is therefore not solely their own concern. Sooner or later, it will also be the whole of europe's concern. In the 1950s and 1960s, we had another idea that, within the national legislative framework, we were able to overcome the challenges of the past, but countless studies – the studies of Wolfgang Streeck, Joseph Stiglitz, Thomas Piketty – show that the golden time is long over, and as you can see from the list of speakers, I will continue from a slightly different perspective in a minute and a half.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sv", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 80, "date": "2014-10-21.json", "name": "Sergio GUTIÉRREZ PRIETO", "mepid": "103488", "text": "  drafts member of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. - Mr President, Commissioner, this is the third year in a row that I am in this debate and it is true that we have good reports as a result of consensus, but do you know what is really sad? It's just that today I could do exactly the same intervention as a year ago, that two ago and that three ago. I could repeat to you that excess austerity continues to suffocate us economically in the European Union and continues to cause the highest unemployment rates in our history.  I could tell you again that the wild wage devaluation strategy we are implementing to gain competitiveness is making us more dependent on outside economic situations, but it is also impoverishing us inside.  I could tell you again that, after the saving of public money that we have set out to bail out the banks, credit still does not reach businesses and families, and that what comes in is at very high rates, precisely because we never demand economic credit offsets to give that money.  I could tell you that some structural reforms that we have promoted, even if necessary — labour, health, pension reforms — have depressed our domestic demand and multiplied inequality between Europeans.  I could tell you again that only with monetary policy do we not come out of the crisis, that we need to be courageous with fiscal policy, with stimulus, with investment. That it is a shame that we only spend six billion euros to combat youth unemployment, but what is the greatest shame is that States have not yet used them, and that those who plan to do so only use them to promote precariousness.  I could tell you all this again.

But the rules must, of course, be followed in order for them to be effective. The country-specific recommendations made by the European Commission in 2013 show that Member States have implemented only 10%. That's not good enough, of course.  The economic forecasts show that the economic crisis is by no means over and that we need to step up to meet our challenges. From an ENVI perspective, which we are therefore trying to adopt this time, this is first and foremost about the use of resources. We need to provide better measurement tools to see how we use our financial and strained resources and our ecological resources.

Its key instruments are country-specific recommendations (CSRs) that aim at ensuring better coordination of economic policies and fostering crucial structural reforms in the Member States. However, the overall effectiveness of CSRs is still limited. Only 10 to 15% of CSRs have been fully implemented by Member States in 2013. As a result, macroeconomic imbalances still persist, progress in implementing badly needed structural reforms is slow and uneven and strong economic growth in Europe is still to come. In the report, the European Parliament calls on the Member States to undertake more effort to fully implement CSRs. What is at stake is the very credibility of the European Union and its ability to definitively overcome the current crisis. One way to improve the efficiency of the European Semester is to make sure that reasons and causes for unsatisfactory implementation of CSRs are properly analysed and eliminated and that the whole elimination process is more disciplined. Another way is to radically strengthen national ownership of CSRs in individual Member States in order to mobilise sufficient political capital in favour of reforms. More involvement by national parliaments could also help. It would also improve democratic control over the whole exercise. In the process of preparing this report, a wide range of proposals and amendments have been submitted and discussed. We eventually managed to come up with a draft that represents a reasonable compromise and which reflects most of the key priorities of major political groups.

I believe that Mr de Backer had made the right assessments of the member states' financial problems and also presented good solutions to them.  However, the problem with the report from the outset has been its federalist emphasis on concentrating power from the Member States on the EU institutions. In particular, there has been a desire to make country-specific recommendations more binding, even at the risk of punishment. In a way, this was to be expected, because ever since the European Semester began, there have been fears that here too we will do what is always the case in the federal development of the EU. First, a looser arrangement is created under the pretext of accepting and accepting a new preening of power in the Member States, but once it stabilises, this preclusive will be tightened up.  The federalism of the report was further underlined by the desire to create a single common representation in the euro area in international economic policy for a. In addition, the report wanted to record a kind of pre-approval of the third pillar of the Banking Union, which would include pan-European deposit protection.

The ECR Group believes that the economic policy powers of the Member States should not be reduced, but that the guidelines issued by the EU should be advisory in nature. In other words, similar to the economic guidelines distributed by the OECD to the various countries. After all, economic policy is at the heart of politics, and it is not conceivable that decision-making on it should be transferred away from the democratically elected parliaments of the Member States.

Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, Mr President of the Council, why are we here today? Sometimes, when you read this long document , and I thank the rapporteurs for doing a lot of synthesis work, you get the impression that you are putting everything and anything into it. It is a bit sad, because when we introduced the European semester into the six-pack - I was one of the rapporteurs at the time, alongside other colleagues present today - we had two objectives in mind.  The first was to make national parliaments aware that we had a common good: European prosperity, the single currency. It is something that Europeans have in common and yet it is something that is decided on two different levels. The debates that exist in countries like mine, as in Italy at the moment, or even in Germany from another angle, clearly show that this sense of interdependence and learningership - as they say in good French - common rules are unfortunately not always present. Our second objective was to facilitate the implementation of the commitments made by states to benefit from the best economic policy. This was reiterated by several auditors, including the Commissioner. I think we need to be aware of what is at stake. I would therefore simply like to say that we must be careful not to turn the exercise here in this Parliament into a self-centred exercise in which each political group tries to add what is dear to its heart. The real challenge is to include in the national debates as broad an acceptance as possible that the single currency is a common good, that European prosperity is a common good, that the Commissioner works in the general interest of Europe, that he is not a schoolmaster who comes to teach us lessons and that he is content to do what he has been asked to do.  Therefore, Commissioner, go back to Brussels feeling that Members here are asking you to take responsibility - the Italian Presidency, I believe, is taking its own - to ensure that The Member States respect the commitments they have made and that European growth comes not from a sterile debate but from concrete actions in favour of our youth.

Mr President, you are doing me a great deal of honour, Madam, thinking that I alone will have the solution. I can give you my feeling, nothing more. My feeling is that this parliament has already done a lot. Firstly, it included the European semester in legislation and gave dialogue with national parliaments its importance. Second, in the previous Parliament we auditioned the members of the troika and put them under pressure, as far as the law allowed us. Third, we made a report, which allowed Members to travel to countries that were under the programme. Of course, all of this is not enough. Personally - and whatever Mr Terho says - I believe that if we had an effectively federal Europe, we could go much further. It is good because Europe is not at all federal and because it leaves the Member States - without them always assuming their responsibilities - considerable leeway, sometimes in defiance of common rules, that we are now experiencing these difficulties. Let's not caricature, let's all try together to be constructive. However, the compromise should not take us away from the idea that we have a huge responsibility towards European youth.

There is talk of fiscal consolidation, we talk about proposals, but we never touch on the essentials. If we want real fiscal consolidation, the alternative is to tackle the real problem that we have, which is unemployment. There are suggestions about research, the environment and gender equality... I do not say that they are not important, they are important, but until we focus on the real problem that is unemployment, we will have no solution.  Unemployment is not only a side effect, it is not just a consequence, unemployment is the cause, it is the main cause of the unsustainability of public accounts. And what do the European institutions do about it? They continue to insist on deregulation of the labour market, while the periphery of the European Union is mired in unemployment and precariousness. But it's not just that. There are also goals that are never met. None of the objectives presented, either in economic policy or in the European Semester, have ever been achieved, and what do the European institutions do? They call it another name, they call it growth-friendly fiscal policy. In other words, a change of slogan to continue with the same policy that leads us to the destruction of the European economic fabric.

But, of course, this is a hugely important discussion in our Group as well and for all the political groups. I mean, it is very clear there is a pro-European majority in this House which is stressing the importance of the Semester and I think that is also clear from the report. This is also a very clear call to the Council and the Member States to take this process more seriously. This is not something that you say ‘yes’ to in Brussels and then go home and say ‘well that was decided over there by strangers’. This is our policy, and if we want to survive together we have to take seriously the economic governance we do together. That is in the report and is very important.  However, at the same time we do know there is a huge political division on the direction of the different structural reforms. And here let me be very clear also to Mr Katainen, who until now agreed with me, but now I would really like to stress that our Group is very, very critical of the way the Commission has performed the structural reforms. It is a one-sided way on austerity, it is a one-sided way where reform is mainly flexibilisation of the labour market, and then assuming that will save all. That is not the case so we need a more balanced approach. Fortunately, of course, we would have liked to see more critical remarks on the current structural reforms being proposed.  However, in the report we see that there is more room for a balanced approach. There is more room for social indicators thanks to the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs also. There is more room for environmental reforms. There is more room for investments, and I think that all together is a good direction indicating that the course of Europe should be changing and therefore in the end, in this consensus, I subscribe to the consensus, but really let us work on it.

When we vote on the new Commission tomorrow, it will, of course, also involve the demand for more commitment for the European Semester. The track record in the implementation of the country-specific recommendations is far too weak. It is precisely if Europe now wants to launch an investment programme that strengthened economic and budgetary consolidation must be the prerequisite for this. Growth only thrives when the soil is already prepared. The report is very clear here, pointing out the various obstacles to growth. Thus, growth is currently being hampered above all by too many failures in the modernisation of many economies, by too little flexibility in labour markets, by the far too low level of investment, especially in private investment, and by the lack of access to sources of finance. It is clear that these obstacles must be reduced. Of course, it is above all the Member States that are in demand. They need to be much more consistent in this regard, so that reforms are not only an announcement, but also implemented in the end. More calls for more public money, which are often put forward by colleagues from other groups, do not help either. Public injections of money cannot replace or reduce the need for reform. Public budgets are now significantly over-indebted, and The contributions of European taxpayers are largely exhausted. That is why the focus must be on significantly more private sector. European companies are looking for investment targets, European banks and insurance companies need solid investment opportunities, especially at the current low interest rates. They should find these opportunities again in Europe, in a Europe that is also becoming more competitive and thus improving the investment climate.

However, did it take months of reflection on macroprudential criteria to reach such mundane and pre-run conclusions? Since 2011, the Aim of the European Semester has been to harmonize the economic policies of the EU countries, but for what results? A \"eurodivergence\" between Germany and most eurozone countries, a \"eurodivergence\" of the unemployment rate in the euro area countries, inflation rates and nominal borrowing rates that discredit your optimal utopian currency area. The only convergence: growth, still close to zero in the euro area before, alas, the next entry into a structural recession by 2015 or 2016. To top it all off, eleven out of twenty-eight countries are in the process of excessive deficit, not to mention the European Union budget. What solutions do the EPP and the S and D offer us in this document? More Europe, of course. If this does not work, it is because there is not enough federalist Europe, as in the past the politburo for communism. Your recipes are always the same, ultraliberal, but they will lead to the same result: social austerity for peoples.

This shows that the issue of sanctions, probably against states that do not accept the recommendations, is an issue that will have to be addressed, because behind these recommendations there is a need to balance the books and to combine development with growth and, above all, with reducing the deficit. It is no coincidence that the states that have not adapted to the recommendations are those that have the most structural deficits; It is no coincidence that, unfortunately, Italy is also one of these states. Mr Barroso has recently asked the Italian Government to reduce the structural deficit by another half a point. We hope that the Italian Government will choose to do so, because behind a structural deficit there is a difficulty and an impossibility of growth and development.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 111, "date": "2014-10-21.json", "name": "Isabelle THOMAS", "mepid": "114279", "text": "   Mr President, I would like to bring to your attention points 122 and 123 of this resolution on the European semester and point 7 of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets, on the question of Member States' contributions to the EU budget.

The euro is not the problem, but it is the catalyst that highlights problems, because the veil of currency fluctuating has been lost, behind which many Member States have long been able to hide by trying to artificially gain competitiveness by devaluation. That is precisely the success of the euro, that this veil has been taken away from the Member States and that the mistakes have become apparent. Secondly, I often hear now that money could solve problems. We can still put so much money into training young people if there are no companies that employ these young people. In other words, in addition to competitiveness, it is also a question of strengthening entrepreneurship in the European Union, of creating a strong small and medium-sized enterprise that builds up decentralised value chains, which is able to provide jobs for young people, but also for other people, which also manages to provide decentvice jobs in the various regions of the European Union. You don't solve that with money, but you solve it with boundary conditions. Young people are not employed by providing them with money, but by equipping companies with jobs.

ECB President Draghi has repeatedly said in recent months that europe can buy time through its monetary policy, but that the eurozone's problems cannot be overcome. The eurozone's problems can only be overcome through member-state economic policy efforts, namely growth-friendly fiscal consolidation and structural reform measures. These actions will be coordinated within the framework of the European Semester. The Annual Growth Survey for the 2014 European Semester foresees a total of five priorities: growth-friendly fiscal consolidation, which has already been mentioned. Minister Della Vedova spoke today of a consolidation of confidence in this context. I would say that the budget plan that Italy has submitted will be the litmus test for this. Let's see. I hope you can do that. Secondly, restoring normal lending to the economy. That is primarily the task of the ECB. Thirdly, the promotion of growth and competitiveness. Once again, this is a task primarily for the Member States. Fourthly, the fight against unemployment. In the first item on the agenda of the debate on the Milan Employment Summit, it has already been pointed out today that not much is happening in itself. My impression is that more and more money is being demanded, but in reality the measures are not being taken. Fifthly, the modernisation of administrations. We see in Europe that the implementation of the measures is not working. Only 10% of the country-specific recommendations have been implemented, 45% little or no. Nor does growth-friendly fiscal consolidation work, the budget plans have been announced. Similarly, growth in Europe is not gaining momentum.

It is interesting to note that often the states, which also suffer economically for other reasons, unfortunately do not actually fully follow these recommendations in order to better implement the conditions of internal market law.

This will not solve youth unemployment as a whole, but it clearly helps.  There are many good employment and youth unemployment policy ideas at national level which can be applied in other EU Member States as well, not necessarily one-to-one – not all of them – but obviously a country in which youth unemployment is 50% or above might want to implement some of the successful measures from countries in which youth unemployment is 10% or below. Therefore, I propose to establish a European mechanism for the exchange of best practices for job creation and especially for youth unemployment. Parliament’s report on the European Semester also contains my proposal to create such a European mechanism. I look forward to working with you, Commissioner, in your new capacity as Vice-President for Jobs, to transpose this into reality. The second point I would like to make is linked to labour mobility.

Allow me to focus more on the European Semester and highlight an area that is really important and can also be an opportunity for us. This is the strengthening of the pillar of the internal market, a number of pieces of legislation have been adopted within the internal market pillar, but they are quite convoluted and very difficult to come by. We should focus on correct compliance with these rules, which most studies believe could actually lead to an increase. This is particularly true in the digital internal market, where we have many opportunities.  I would like to highlight another important area that has been touched on by several of my fellow Members, this is the range of country-specific recommendations. I think that country-specific recommendations are currently too general. They should be much more specific, more country-specific, as it is in its name. Unfortunately, this report does not include any reference to the inputs that should be specified here, nor do I miss the indicators that would be suitable for measuring the recommendations.

I will just take up a few issues which I would like to comment on briefly. One of the issues which we seem to more or less agree on is the implementation of country-specific recommendations. We can recognise that this has not happened as efficiently as it should have done and there we all must carry our own responsibility. The issues are, of course, in the hands of Member States and governments and national parliaments, but we can also encourage them to do what they had promised to do and what is good for the countries themselves as well as for Europe as a whole. My second point: Mr Cofferati and Ms Gall-Pelcz mentioned the internal market and the country-specific recommendations concerning the single-market-related issues. We all know that there are also lots of shortages in this field. For instance, in the implementation of the Services Directive there are lots of shortages. This is quite amazing because we – the Parliament, Commission and Council – have already decided on the Services Directive, for instance, and it has not been implemented yet. So we are lacking economic growth because of poor performance in various Member States in this field as well, so we need to pay more attention there in the future. The third point is about the structural reforms. Mr Eickhout said that the Commission has historically represented structural reforms that are too one-sided and our idea has been just to use structural reforms as a tool to reform austerity policy. Of course, it depends on the country as to what the problems are, but I would just like to raise a few issues and a few examples of non-austerity structural reforms. The first one is tax reform, for instance lowering labour tax and raising environmental tax, or raising dividend tax and at the same time lowering corporate income tax. Another issue is pension reform, which is necessary in many countries because the population is ageing – municipality reform, labour reform and things like that. So it is not only about austerity, but a change to society so that it is stronger and more sustainable.  The next point is gender equality. Many Members also raised this issue. I am very happy about this because it is a question both of equality and labour supply. So at the same time as we are reforming our societies to be more sustainable, they can be more growth-oriented. Gender equality – the Finnish Labour Party is based on this – is very crucial in this sense. My final point: Mr Pirinski and Mr Cofferati mentioned the role of research and development. This is one of the issues on which we have to concentrate more during the next European Semester – what we could do in order to strengthen R&amp;D activities in our Member States because this is the way to improve the potential growth of the Member States. There are good examples in various Member States where the universities and small- and medium-sized entrepreneurship have been combined in a very fascinating way and the universities have become a hub of entrepreneurship.

In the final conclusion I cannot go into all the remarks, but just let me say this: in the end it is very clear that every part of the European institutions, be it Parliament, be it the Commission or be it also the Member States, have to promise and follow through on what they have promised in the past.  Let me begin with the Member States. If you come to Brussels and within the European Semester you agree to implement certain structural reforms to make sure that your deficits are being reduced, that you implement the necessary reforms to modernise your economies, a 10% success rate is not enough. You will have to perform better. Also we, as a Parliament, will have to make sure that the scrutiny we apply through the process of the European Semester is stronger. Also at European level there is still a lot to be done. Mr Katainen has made a good point on completion of the single market, but also completion of the capital market, of the Energy Union and of the digital market will be a high priority for the next Commission.  It is also necessary to say that, with all these structural reforms, we do not have to do them because we are told to by Brussels; we are doing them because our citizens want them, because they understand that modernising our economies, making them more competitive, attracting private and public investment to make our economies grow and to create employment is the essence of the European project.

Particular attention should be paid to the need to continue reforms in countries that mark negative demographic trends threatening the sustainability of their health and pension systems.

A crucial point, therefore, will be to exclude sustainable investment from deficit calculations, so that states return to the growth path while not neglecting necessary investments.

The crisis has also led to an increase in inequalities and poverty levels, limiting people's access to good quality public services, which in the 21st century have been reduced. Europe should be the norm. The debate on the EU Semester provides an excellent opportunity to encourage Member States to act more intensively in areas where citizens are at risk of social exclusion. The phenomenon of social exclusion is worrying and is increasingly occurring among young people. For this reason, the European Union, like its Member States, must start to tackle unemployment more actively, especially among young people who are taking the first steps in the labour market. In addition, coordinated economic policies must take into account support at all levels in order to create more jobs. It is therefore worth considering a proposal that encourages the Commission to increase the focus on reforms needed to support the provision of high-quality public services, with a particular focus on health systems in the Member States.

This fund was set up as an expression of EU solidarity to provide additional support to workers suffering the consequences of major structural changes in world trade patterns.  The rapid decline in the EU's share of the global steel market for crude steel, a fall in steel demand from the automotive and construction sectors as a result of the economic crisis, and an increase in production costs have in recent years particularly affected many regions where employment is heavily dependent on traditional heavy industry.

The final report of the Second Barroso Commission is on the agenda. Under this item, the Commission will certainly give some kind of account to its conduct over the last five years. I would like to draw your attention to Article 17(1) of the TREATY of the EU, which essentially states that the Commission is the guardian of the Treaties. However, the Commission has come under massive criticism for having tolerated and even encouraged the breach of Article 125 of the FEU Treaty – the non-assistance clause – and Article 21 of the FEU Treaty – the prohibition of monetary public debt. Given the importance of these matters, it is totally inappropriate to allow only the group chairmen to speak today. The European Parliament must take seriously the inviolability of the Treaties and must therefore be able to hold a detailed debate on them. I would therefore ask that the debate be so that ordinary Members can also take a position on it, because they too are the elected representatives of their people.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ECR", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 509, "date": "2014-10-21.json", "name": "José Manuel Barroso", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "  President of the Commission. - Mr President, first of all I would like to thank you for the invitation to address this Parliament at what I think will be the last time I have this opportunity. In fact, now we are coming to the end of my second mandate as President of the Commission, and I am very happy to be here with you and my colleagues, to present to you our bilan, and of course, since this is my second Commission, I think I can also refer to the last 10 years. This time I did not bring a written speech. There will be a testimony online, a text I have prepared, and that is going to be distributed to all those of you who would like a copy, together with the main documents of the Commission over these last 10 years. I thought that instead of reading a speech to you, I would share with you my feelings, my emotions, on what I think about the way the European Union has responded to these very challenging times and what I think are the most important challenges for the future. First of all, I think you can agree that these have been exceptional and challenging times. Ten years: ten years of crises and the response of the European Union to those crises. Not only the financial and sovereign debt crisis, but let us not forget that at the beginning of my first mandate we had the constitutional crisis, when two founding Members of the European Union rejected, in referenda, the Constitutional Treaty. So we had a constitutional crisis, we had a sovereign debt and financial crisis and we had several geopolitical crises – but in most acute terms now with the crisis between Russia and Ukraine.  The constitutional crisis we had was in fact solved through the Lisbon Treaty. The reality is that at that time many people, some of whom we know, were saying that it would be impossible for the European Union to find a new institutional setting, and there were moments of ambiguity and doubt; but basically we were able to keep most of the acquis of the European Union, including most of the new elements of the Constitutional Treaty, with the Lisbon Treaty that was ratified by all Member States, including those that today seem to have forgotten that they have ratified the Lisbon Treaty. More recently – because I want to leave to the end the economic issues, because they are still with us – we had the very serious challenge and threat to our stability, stability in Europe, coming from the unacceptable behaviour of Russia regarding Ukraine. We took a principled position. We offered Ukraine an association agreement and a free trade agreement and in fact I am happy that, despite all the difficulties, Ukraine was there signing and ratifying the association agreement. I want to congratulate this Parliament, because on the same day, at the same hour, that the parliament in Ukraine was ratifying this agreement you were also ratifying the agreement, showing that you can offer hope to Ukraine as part of the European family of nations. Now as I am speaking to you, this crisis is not yet solved. We know that, but I think we can be proud that we have kept a position of principle, that we have condemned in the most unequivocal terms the actions of Russia, and that in fact there was an association agreement ratified; not only in Ukraine but also with Georgia and Moldova. I believe we have a duty to those countries that are looking to Europe with the hope of sharing with us the same future and also because they want to share with us the same values. At this moment we are still mediating – today in Brussels there is a meeting mediated by the Commission on Energy – with the Russian Government and the Ukrainian Government. We believe a politically-negotiated solution is possible, we are working for that, we believe it is in the interests of all the parties to have a political agreement, but a political agreement that respects the principles of international law, that respects the right of a country that is our neighbour to decide its own future and that respects the sovereignty and independence of that country. I think we should be proud of what we have been doing in this very challenging geopolitical crisis. We also had the financial and sovereign debt crisis. The reality is that the crisis was not born in Europe, but the fact is that because we were not prepared, because the euro area did not yet have the instruments, we were very much affected by it, not only in financial terms but in economic terms, in social terms and I would say also in political terms. I think this crisis was probably the biggest since the beginning of the European integration process in the 1950s.  Let us now put things in perspective. Let us remind ourselves what was the main opinion of most analysts in the economic and financial media, or even in many of our countries or outside of Europe, as to what could happen. Everybody was predicting a Greek exit, Greece exiting the euro, and of course that Greece exiting the euro would have immediate cascading effects on other countries, a domino effect that was indeed already felt in countries like Ireland or Portugal. But let us not forget. Spain was also under very heavy pressure and Italy too. We were on the edge of the abyss. I remember well what happened in discussions in the margins of the G20 in Cannes in 2011. I remember well when the analysts were almost unanimously predicting a Greek exit and at least 50% of them were predicting the implosion of the euro. And what happened? Not only was there no exit from the euro: now we are going to welcome the 19th member of the euro and Lithuania will join us on 1 January 2015. Not only did Greece not leave the euro: the euro area has enlarged and the European Union has been enlarging as well. That is a point which I think is very much underestimated in our analysis. In 2004, the year I had the pleasure and the honour of assuming the leadership of the Commission, do you remember how many we were? We were 15. Today we are 28 countries, so we have almost doubled the membership of the European Union during all these crises. Is there a better proof of our Union’s resilience and capacity to adapt? I think the fact that we were able to remain united and open during the crisis confirms the extraordinary resilience and strength of the European Union. This should not be underestimated. I know that for some this does not count for much. In a way they are idealising the past. They probably dream of a cosy Europe. They think Europe was better when half of Europe was under totalitarian Communism. I do not think that. I think Europe today is better than when half of Europe was under Communism. (Applause) I think that the fact that, even during all these crises, the European Union was able to open, consolidate and unite on a continental scale almost the whole of Europe around the values of peace, freedom and justice is a great thing. We should commemorate it and not be ashamed of it as some seem to be. I think this is also a reason to commemorate. Many people predicted – like those of you who were following these issues at that time – that the Commission would not be able to function and that it would be impossible. They were saying that at 25, 27 or 28 the European Union would be blocked. The reality is that the European Union was not blocked by the enlargement. I can share the reality with you now. Sometimes it was more difficult to put together some of the core members of the Union than all the 28 countries of Europe. So I think we should be proud of that as well – collectively – because the European Union was able to remain united and open during the crisis. When I say open I mean it in all senses, including having an open attitude towards the world. For instance, after the failure of the Doha Development Round and the global trade talks, we promoted a proactive trade agenda and we are now leading in that sense. I believe that trade can be one of the best ways to support growth globally and in the European Union. We – because it was the initiative of the European Union – went to the United States, to the former President of the United States of America, inviting him – indeed, convincing him – to organise the first G20 meeting at Head of State and Government level because that was a means of taking a cooperative global approach and avoiding a return to ugly and nasty protectionism, which could be a temptation in times of crisis. We were able to keep Europe not only united and in fact enlarging its membership, but also open to the rest of the world.  But now we can ask, are we stronger or weaker? I know that most people today, on the critical side, will say that we are weaker. But are we really? In fact, when the crisis erupted, we had almost no instruments with which to respond to it. We were facing – as was said at that time – an unprecedented crisis. For instance, we had no mechanisms to support the countries facing the immediate threat of default. What did we do? We collectively – the Commission and Member States, and always with the strong support of the Parliament, I have to say – created a new system of governance. Today we have a much stronger governance system than before, including with unprecedented powers for the Community institutions. We have done everything to keep the Community method at the centre of our integration. For instance, the Commission today has more powers, in terms of governance of the eurozone, than before the crisis. The European Central Bank today has the possibility to directly supervise the banks in Europe, something that would have been considered impossible, almost unimaginable, before the crisis. I remember, when we spoke about banking union and when I gave an interview saying that we need a banking union, I received some phone calls from capitals asking ‘why are you speaking about banking union? This is not in the Treaties’. I responded that it was not in the Treaties, but that we needed it if we wanted to fulfil the objectives of the Treaties, namely the objective of stability for growth – and today we have a banking union.  So, if we look at things in perspective and we think where we were ten years ago compared to where we are now, we can say with full rigour and in complete observance of the truth that today the European Union, at least in the euro area, is more integrated, has reinforced its competence and that we now have, through the Community method, more ways to tackle crises, particularly in the eurozone. Not only the system of governance in the banking union, but  legislation on financial stability, financial regulation and financial supervision that we have presented – around 30 new pieces of legislation that were all approved by the Parliament. Once again I want to thank you, because in almost all those debates Parliament and the Commission were on the same side of the debate for more ambition – not less – for Europe. So today I can say that we are stronger because we have a more integrated system of governance, we have legislation to tackle abuses in the financial markets and we have a much clearer system of supervision and regulation.  I think we are now better prepared than we were before to face crisis, if crises like the ones we have seen come in the future. Of course you can say, ‘but there are still many difficulties’. Yes, and I am going to say a word about this in a moment, regarding the prospects for growth, but please do not forget where we were. We were very close to the default – a less polite word would be bankruptcy – of some of our Member States, and look at where we are now. Out of the countries that had to ask for adjustment programmes, Portugal and Ireland have exited the problem successfully – Ireland is now one of the fastest growing countries in Europe – and in fact all the others that were under the imminent threat of collapsing are now in a much more stable mood. Spain has asked for a programme for its banks to also exit the programme successfully. So in fact only two countries out of all those – because we should not forget that the Central and Eastern European countries also had adjustment programmes even if they were not yet in the EU area – are still completing their adjustment programmes. On average, the deficits now in the eurozone are 2.5. This is much less than in the United States or Japan. In terms of stability, we are much better now than before.  The eurozone has a trade surplus. In the European Union in general we now we have a surplus in goods, in services and, for the first time in many years, in agriculture. I am saying that because very often the opinion in some political sectors is that we are losing with globalisation. This is not the case. Some countries in our Union are in fact not winning that battle but, on average, you can say that Europe is winning the global battle in terms of competition, namely in terms of trade and investment.  Of course, growth is still timid. I think that basically we cannot say that it is completely done, because threats remain. But we have won the battle of stability. Today nobody in the world will honestly bet on the end of the euro. The euro has shown that it is a very strong, credible and indeed stable currency. The reality is that our growth is still timid and clearly below expectations.  So what can we do for growth? This is the important question. For that I need to make a reminder, once again. I know very well that very often European Union policy, and mainly Commission policy, has been presented as completely focussed on austerity. I think this is a caricature. We have constantly asked at least for three important lines: fiscal consolidation, certainly, for the countries that were feeling the pressure of the markets – and it would be completely irresponsible if they could not frontload a programme of rigour to correct their poor finances – but we have always insisted with equal vigour, although probably some would not like to listen, on the need for structural reforms, for competitiveness, because the reality is that even before the crisis we were growing beneath our potential.  That is the reality: there were serious problems of lack of competitiveness in some of our countries, so that is why we did more ambitious structural reforms, but we have always argued in favour of investment. I have always said that what we need for Europe is more investment – public and private investment. Private investment will come, the more we can show that we have competitive economies and that we can attract private investment. Indeed, I am very happy to see that most of our countries, certainly at different paces, are pursuing ambitious structural reforms; strict reforms which would have been considered completely impossible before the crisis. The reality is, if we want to be honest in terms of analysis, that the countries that have suffered the most during the financial crisis were precisely those which had lost in terms of cost competitiveness before the crisis.  For instance, the reforms that have been made by Spain, by Ireland, by Portugal and by Greece are impressive and confidence is coming back precisely because of that. Apart from the fiscal consolidation and the structural reforms, we have always signalled the need for more investment: private investment, but public investment as well. You remember the debate about the MFF? President Schulz remembers, certainly. We were together in many meetings, asking the Member States to do more in terms of investment and the most important instrument we have had at European level for investment is the Multiannual Financial Framework, which is around one trillion euros. If there is not more ambitious investment, it was not because of the lack of ambition of this Commission or lack of ambition of this Parliament, it was because of the opposition of some capitals.  This is the reality: we are for solid investment, targeting investment for growth. This is the reality. Not only with the MFF. Remember the proposals that, for instance, I put forward here in the State of the Union speeches with you, the increase of capital for the EIB that was finally agreed? The project bonds that the Member States accepted but, oh yes, as pilot project bonds; the facility that we have created for SMEs with loans from the EIB and structural funds from our budget – unfortunately only two countries wanted to go along those lines. Or, for instance, the programme for a Youth Guarantee that we proposed and the Member States agreed on, but now with the Youth Employment Initiative only two countries have accepted a dedicated programme for youth employment. So, my dear colleagues, let us be clear that we are for investment. I wish all the best to the new Commission and to my friend and colleague, Jean-Claude Juncker, that they may have the support of the Member States for a more ambitious investment programme over the next years. I believe it is possible now. I believe there is much greater awareness today on this matter. But once again, this is part of a comprehensive strategy combining fiscal consolidation with structural reforms and investment and, of course, all the measures taken by us in terms of banking union and financial regulation for stability. This is the way, and I am saying that with vigour because I think it will be our mistake, after everything we have done, to give up, to show less determination, to abandon the road of structural reforms.  I think basically we have done a part of the job: stability is broadly there, so is growth, even if it is lower than we would have liked, but now we need the determination to complete the reforms, so that we have sustainable growth, not growth fuelled by debt, excessive public debt or excessive private debt, because this debt is artificial. It is a fictional debt and sooner or later we are going to pay the price. But sustainable growth: that I believe is possible, if we continue the courageous path of reforms and stronger governance for the European Union. I have not the time, because I respect this Parliament very much and certainly I admire your patience, to now go into all the other policies we have been developing over the years. But just let me now highlight one or two, because I think they are very much at the point of decision now, and this is important. I am extremely proud that it was my Commission in my first mandate in 2007 that put forward the most ambitious programme for climate protection in the world and that we are still leading in the world in terms of the climate agenda. In fact, we were able to join the climate agenda with the energy security agenda. I am saying this because this week we are going to have an important discussion in Brussels at Heads of State and Government level and I hope that the European Union will keep its leadership role. Not, of course, to be isolated but to be with others, because we have a responsibility towards our planet. Certainly, one of the great advances of these years is that the European Union was able to make the most important bold steps in terms of fighting climate change.  Another area where I think we could be very proud is that, in spite of all the restrictions because of the financial situation, it was possible in the MFF to get 30% more for Horizon 2020 for research and technology. I think there is a great situation now, with great opportunities for us to do more in that area, and also on the cultural side with our programme Europe Creative. So the reality is that in some areas it was possible, in spite of the economic and financial crisis, to increase investment at European level.  I am also very proud that in spite of the pressures of our budgets, we could always be there in terms of development aid and a policy for our neighbourhood. Whenever there was a big tragedy in the world, from the tsunami in Indonesia and now to the Ebola crisis, from the Syrian refugee crisis to Darfur, we were there. We were among the first.  I think we Europeans should also be proud of that, because together with our Member States, the European Union is still the most important donor for development aid in the world. That is something that corresponds very much to our values and I am happy that in spite of all the crises we did not abandon our obligations in terms of development cooperation.  I have already said a word about trade. I think it is very important to keep an ambitious trade agenda, an open Europe, but for free and fair trade. The Commission has concluded a record number of agreements, with South Korea, Singapore, Central America – the first region to reach an agreement – Peru, Ecuador, recently with Canada, recently with Western Africa, Eastern Africa and Southern Africa, and I could also mention some others that are not progressing like Japan, United States and an investment agreement with China. So we are the most important trade bloc in the world. We are the biggest economy in the world. I am saying that because today I know it is very fashionable to be pessimistic and defeatist about Europe – what I call the intellectual glimmer of pessimism – but I believe that we have a good record to show and I believe that together, collectively, we are much stronger and we can better defend our interests and protect our values. Dear colleagues – I call you colleagues because I believe we have sometimes been through discussions but we have been colleagues in this great enterprise, this European project – I think politically we have some lessons to draw. One is that we have shown great resilience. I think we can say that the forces of integration are stronger than the forces of disintegration. I believe that, day and night, sometimes in very dramatic moments, sometimes when I have to make dramatic appeals to some capitals, to the richer countries, asking them to show more solidarity, or to the poorer countries asking them to show more responsibility. Sometimes we have done it very discreetly, it is true. The European Commission is probably more discreet than others. I did not want the Commission to be part of the cacophony of different voices during the most acute moments of the crisis. It was extremely market-sensitive, that situation. But I can tell you, in my full conscience, that we have done everything we could with existing instruments to avoid the fragmentation of the euro and to avoid division in the European Union. I very often had to call on my colleagues in the European Council, Heads of State and Government, to show the ethics of European responsibility. But one of the lessons I draw from this is that, in the end, it was possible to come to decisions. It is true that it was sometimes extremely painful and difficult and took time, and we have also said – and I think it is something we can all agree on – that democracy is slower than the markets. So the Commission would have preferred, and I am sure this Parliament as well, for decisions to be bolder, more comprehensive and faster, but we are a union of democratic states, we are not a super-state, and we have to respect different sensitivities. One of the conclusions I draw from these 10 years of experience is the need to cooperate between institutions. I know sometimes it is more popular to put forward impossible ideas and criticise others, but I firmly believe that we need to engage with different institutions and that it is not a solution to put countries in opposition to the European Union. On the contrary, we have to show our countries that they are stronger if they are part of the European Union; that we are not diluting their national identity but on the contrary that we are asking them to share their sovereignty so that they can better project their interests globally. I am fully convinced of this. I am saying this to you now. I am leaving in some days, and my only interest is that these lessons be learned, so that we do not repeat the same mistakes in the future. At the same time I think we can say that it is not through confrontation, but through cooperation that we can attain the objectives. At the moment I am preparing to hand over this very challenging and interesting job to my good friend, Jean-Claude Juncker. I want to say here, on behalf of myself and all my colleagues at the Commission, that we wish the new Commission all the best. They have, of course, a great challenge ahead of them, but they can also count on our support and I am sure on the support that this Parliament is going to give to them.  Mr President, relations were not always perfect but I think you can agree that we were able to establish a cooperative relationship between Parliament and the Commission. I have been to this Parliament over 100 times. No Commission was ever so often in Parliament as my two Commissions. We have established this cooperation and I am so grateful, because this Parliament sometimes has very – shall we say – strong demands, but it has always supported the Community method. It always supported the Community institutions and I believe this is very important for the future of Europe. My dear colleagues of the European project, the way to solve the problems we have in Europe is not through revolution and even less through counter revolution. It is by compromise, it is by reform: evolution and reform. We have to reform to adapt to new challenges, but not with new clashes between the institutions, not with clashes amongst our countries. I believe that if this idea of strong cooperation, of putting the European common good first, is pursued, then my colleague and friend, Jean-Claude Juncker, and his new Commission will have success – based, of course, on the support that I am sure you are going to give them. Because – and this is my last time and also my last comment – the European Union is a Union of values. In these last days I have had to face many journalists and they have asked me, ‘What was your most emotional moment? Which moment did you prefer?’ I have many. I also had very difficult ones, to be honest. But one of my most emotional moments was when, on behalf of the European Union, together with Martin Schulz and with the President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy, we received the Nobel Peace Prize for the European Union. (Applause) I think this was a powerful reminder, sent to us from the global community, that we count in the world and that what we do is very important; that the values that were at the origin of the creation of our Union, namely the values of peace, are still of the essence today and that we have to fight for them. This is the moment I really said I want to share with all those in the different institutions, including this Parliament, who have been working for a united, open and stronger Europe. When I leave this office, with all my colleagues from the Commission, I can tell you we have not achieved everything we could or everything we would have liked to have achieved, but I think we have worked with the right conscience, putting the global interests of the European Union above specific interests, and I believe that now there are conditions to continue working for a united, open and stronger Europe.

It is a week of decisions for the European Union: tomorrow a new Commission and today the day of farewell to the members with whom we, as parliamentarians, have been able to work for the last few years. That is why I am pleased that my group is present and that we are celebrating this day with dignity today. As chairman of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I would like to thank the President of the Commission, but also all the other Commissioners who have contributed their work, their convictions and their enthusiasm for our common cause over the last five years. Thank you very much! (Applause) José Manuel Barroso has looked back on 10 years. If I may start in person, I would like to point out that ten years ago I was a newly elected Member of this Parliament. In these years, I have come to know the then newly elected President of the Commission as a convinced, strong European who puts his full effort into his cause, who is the driving force, who is the driving force, who has respect for us, the European Chamber, the European Parliament, and who, above all, is a human being, who talks to everyone, who is approached by everyone, whether officials or not. In this respect, we have had a good President of the Commission who has done his job. The record is impressive. We have heard some data today from José Manuel Barroso. The start at the beginning, the chance, the question of whether this will work with the enlargement to the east, with the reunification of Europe, will work in everyday life – it has worked. The constitutional debate that has made Europe more democratic. This year, we were able to implement the concept of the leading candidates on the basis of the Treaty of Lisbon, to make Europe even more democratic. Europe is at the forefront of climate protection. We do not need to hide at a global level. Then, in the second period of the Barroso term of office, the euro and financial crisis. Before the crisis, the eurozone states were alone in a storm of markets. Today we have the solidarity of the ESM. Before the crisis, debt-based growth was the center of this continent, and today we have more sustainable budgets. Before the crisis, unregulated financial markets were active, today we have a banking union and a strong European banking supervision. I would like to state explicitly that these crises that we have experienced were not, in fact, crises of the European Union, but mainly crises of the Member States, because mistakes have been made there at national level. The framework described by José Manuel Barroso was to solve the problem: stop making debt, instead strengthening competitiveness and investing more. The rescue route was right. This must be emphasised time and again. Ireland, Spain, Portugal are back in the markets, governance has been strengthened, and with Slovenia 2007, Cyprus 2008, Malta 2008, Slovakia 2009, Estonia 2011 and 2014 Latvia have adopted many new Member States as their currency. This shows, God knows, success. Some might sometimes have wished for a louder, more aggressive, more pointed President of the Commission in the public debate, even when it came to calling the national Member States to the rafters. I say to these critics: dear friends, in the most existential crisis that we as Europeans have experienced since the Second World War, the better way to work together, to make honest work, to approach each other, to work out the team approach, is probably the better way. Maybe less showmaster and a little more substantial work, that's, I think, the right approach. There are many other areas that could be mentioned that are important. I am thinking only of police cooperation, because I myself was allowed to work in this area. In recent years, we have made Europe safer for the citizens of this continent – and many other points. The coronation was certainly the Nobel Peace Prize in 2012, the speech in Oslo in which our President of the Commission described the history of our continent since the Second World War, and I quote it: 'Peace is not the absence of war, but peace is a virtue and a state of mind!' Barroso reminded us all of the minds of Europeans. We can also be grateful for that. The record is impressive, and if I were to conclude by summarising it, I would summarise the main message that Barroso and his term of office leave us with the message: we Europeans can do it. We Europeans can do that. If we have the courage, if we are creative, if we stick together, then we can use the storms of fate that the future will also give us. Serenity and courage. I would like to express my sincere thanks on behalf of the entire Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.

I will tell you quite frankly that my group's assessment of your Commission is a critical one. In this very House, ten years ago, you rightly called on us – and I will use your words – not to lower our guard in the face of the apathy and scepticism that affect European democracy. We share together, he said, an awareness of populist threats, we must not give them new arguments. Ten years later, our continent is plunged into unemployment, and I am sorry that you did not mention this word, which indicates the worst scourge we are experiencing today, the lack of work, and deflation will fade hope into the European dream, and the anti-European movements have never been as strong as they are today. Of course, I am well aware that there are internal and external causal factors that do not take account of your choice. I am well aware of this, but we must be honest in admitting that there have also been serious mistakes in economic policy. The original sin is called austerity, in the name of an ideological vision, investment has been reduced, productive expenditure has been cut, thus preventing Member States from betting on their future, from completing the necessary transition to the knowledge society, and now we are sick. Let's face it! Paradigmatic is the story of Greece, a country that is all too often forgotten, but which is the mirror of European unease. Greece suddenly realised in 2010 that Greece's accounts were not reliable. No one wants to deny the responsibilities of that country, but an attempt has been made to force the Greeks to put the accounts in order and this has not been achieved, but on the other hand Greek society has been debunked.  And also on the Stability Pact: stability and never growth have been insisted on, whereas this is a stability and growth pact. The two pillars must be kept together. I agree with Mr Weber that we must not give up budgetary discipline but at the same time increase growth and create new jobs, whereas in recent years we have focused only on the first pillar.  I do not want to underestimate the important things that your Commission has done: I am thinking, for example, of the fight against climate change, I am thinking of financial regulation, I am thinking of trade policy, I am thinking of the launch of an industrial policy, I am thinking of the rigour of competition, competition policy, and the boost to the European internal market. I would like to reiterate to you, Mr Barroso, to all your Commissioners, our esteem and recognition of the personal commitment that you and your fellow Commissioners have made.

While my Group has not always seen eye-to-eye with Mr Barroso on a number of different issues, with his Commission there have been times when we have been able to find common ground. So, Mr Barroso, as you look forward to your next role may I, on behalf of our Group, wish you all the best and your Commissioners all the best for the future.   As you yourself said, your Commission has been a Commission of crises, not all of them your fault. Your first term began with an institutional crisis, after the French and the Dutch voted to reject the European Constitution. But instead of listening to the very real concerns expressed by voters in two of the founding Member States, instead of lifting your eyes from the institutional navel gazing, the Commission resurrected and repackaged the Constitution as the Lisbon Treaty, under a new guise. Your second term was marked by a financial crisis and a banking crisis and then a currency crisis and a debt crisis. These changed the political agenda and consumed much time and energy. But despite a slew of financial regulation over the last five years, we are still in a position where some banks are considered too big to fail and we have not ended taxpayer bailouts. Given the scale of the eurozone crisis at times, it would have been better if you have could have been more open.  We know you can be open. After all, you have been very open with the British people in the last few days, and in the same way that you have said what you think about freedom of movement, in the same way that you have been clear what membership of the EU entails, will you now be open with the taxpayers of Germany, the Netherlands, Finland and other richer eurozone countries about what euro membership entails?  Will you be open that the only way to sustain the eurozone in the long-term is fiscal transfers from the richer countries to the poorer economies of the eurozone, probably forever? These crises are enormous and are not over and we will have long-term consequences for years to come, but these crises are a symptom of a larger crisis, and that is dealing with global competitiveness. But there are people who are deeply worried about being left behind; left behind as leaders come to Brussels to pursue political integration; left behind as our share of the world economy shrinks; left behind as too many of the political elite look back to the past rather than forward to the future.  At times we have agreed with you on the Services Directive, free trade agreements and measures to pursue the completion of the Single Market. But it is time that we look at how we help businesses grow. Instead of creating more red tape, ask entrepreneurs what stops them from creating new jobs. Instead of environmental targets, ask companies what makes them greener and more environmentally friendly. Instead of rules which ban investors from investing outside the EU, ask them what encourages them to invest in start-ups.  So while I think it is fair to say that your Commission has not always had the chance to look forward, I also think it is fair to say that we hope that the next Commission will be in a position to sometimes take a step back, focus on the bigger picture and face the challenges of the future.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "ECR", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 513, "date": "2014-10-21.json", "name": "Pavel TELIČKA", "mepid": "124706", "text": "  on behalf of the ALDE Group. – Mr President, first of all let me both personally and on behalf of the ALDE Group start by thanking the President of the Commission for all the efforts that he and his colleagues have put in throughout the years.  Mr Barroso, you have described to us today the track record of your Commission – in fact of your two Commissions – and, while it primarily focused on the successes with very little on the self-critical side, I would say that in general on many of the issues one would agree with you. So, once again, I offer you my thanks and appreciation. Let me also say a few words about what might have been missing during the past two periods. It is not easy to evaluate someone from the outside. One cannot fully comprehend and understand some of the bottlenecks and difficulties you are facing – some of the information that an outsider might not have – but it is equally not easy probably for the Commission, and even for the Commission President, to comprehend the serious aspects of the issues that daily life brings to our citizens and the difficulties that we sometimes face.  In this respect, one thing that I would like to highlight – something that I really missed – is a real lack of leadership. You have mentioned a number of issues where you took the lead and where you were in contact with the Member States, but the fact is that the Commission did not always use the power of initiative sufficiently in difficult times. Sometimes the initiatives were insufficient, weak or too late. I would even say that sometimes I felt that the right of initiative lay with the capitals. Sometimes we had the feeling that it was Paris and Berlin highlighting the issues and tabling them, and the Commission was somehow in the shadows. This is one thing that we surely have missed. Secondly, you have said rightly that we succeeded in stabilisation. That is absolutely true. You have contributed to stabilisation, but what we have not sufficiently achieved is that we did not come with growth, with structural reforms and with something that takes courage immediately after the stabilisation. We were weak on some of the policies. You mentioned climate-change policy. I could not agree more: that is important. But on industry, on energy, on the administrative burden – on some of these policies we should have done much more. That is where I would have expected the Commission to take the lead and for the rest to follow, really. I will finish by saying that we did win the battle on stability, but we did not win the battle on reforms, growth, competitiveness or recovery. Sometimes we need less regulation, better regulation, but we need more common policies. This is where I would have expected the Commission to take a much stronger lead.  Having said that, clearly there are policies where you have succeeded. Transport is definitely one of them. I think you had a very strict and very good record on competition policy and on some others. But, all in all, these would be the critical remarks that I would have to make on behalf of the ALDE Group.

Mr President, Mr Barroso, to hear you be satisfied with your ten-year record, it is difficult to understand why so many Europeans do not realize that they live in the best of worlds and why they now refuse to vote. In your plea, you talk about yourself, constantly about yourself, but very few of those millions of hard-working people, those who are overwhelmed by unemployment, poverty and austerity every day. In ten years, you have succeeded in making the European idea itself hate, as you have worked hard to deliver the major public sectors to the private sector, to deregulate rail, energy and the post office, and to bring the management of the single currency to the quasi-exclusive service of speculation instead of giving priority to work and productive and ecological investment. Not content with this, you have, together with the States, succeeded in turning private debts into public debts and pushed the audacity to call upon, to settle them, the International Monetary Fund and its shock therapies, whose youths and peoples of Greece, Portugal, Ireland, Spain and now Italy and France are now suffering the consequences with unheard of violence. We were told that the Lisbon Strategy was a resounding failure; Europe 2020 is also. You have refused to include any criteria for social progress and ecological progress in major European decisions. Only recently, you rejected the european minimum income project, the extension of the Maternity Leave Directive and a real positive change in the detached workers directive. Not content with the savage competition of workers and businesses within Europe, you have proposed to expand the field of exploitation with the activation of the project of a large transatlantic market. The future depends on the exit of these austere and regressive choices that lead any European project to a dead end. On the contrary, we must invent a humanist Europe. We must now imagine a policy of social recovery, replacing the relentlessness to bring down the cost of labour by a hunt for the waste of capital and attacks on the environment. To the rigidity of the European Central Bank we should oppose what we have stopped defending here: a new fund for social, human and ecological development and a great cooperative investment plan, otherwise there will be no future for our European project.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "GUE/NGL", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 515, "date": "2014-10-21.json", "name": "Philippe LAMBERTS", "mepid": "96648", "text": "  on behalf of the Greens/FTA group. Mr President, Mr Barroso, you are often portrayed as someone who follows rather than leads. I believe, on the contrary, that you are someone who is capable of deciding and making choices. The first choice I remember seeing you make was in 2003, before you bed president of the Commission. It was when you made the resolute choice to stand with Mr. Bush, Mr. Aznar and Mr. Blair to support the invasion of Iraq, but let's move on! It's ancient history. In your ten years in office, you have made a series of choices and I will point out three. The first was to respond to the crisis, on the one hand, mainly through the troika and, on the other hand, by revising the economic governance of the European Union of modes of action which are both deaf to inequalities, completely insensitive to ecological challenges and completely blind to the demand for democratic legitimacy, all while placing the rights of creditors at a supreme level.  You have also made the choice to refuse to make the bet that the European Union will regain its competitiveness and its ability to create value by deliberately choosing to be, on the planet, the continent that becomes the world champion of sobriety in resources and energy, the only way for us to conquer our strategic autonomy but also our competitiveness in a sustainable way.  Finally, you have chosen not to put an end to the permanent blackmail to which our democracies are subjected, blackmail by financial markets, by financial companies deemed too big to fail and by multinationals to which, through trade agreements, you want to give them rights that would give them legitimacy and sovereignty superior to those of our democracies.  The result of the races: today, 25% of Europeans , a figure I have often mentioned here- or one in four Europeans, are at risk of poverty and social exclusion. That's 4% more than five years ago. Twenty-seven million Europeans are unemployed, unemployed, and I am not talking about the working poor and the underemployment. That's three million more unemployed than five years ago. By the way, where is the growth? If anyone saw her, let him tell me, I did not see her. If someone has also seen a reduction in the public debt, let them tell me, it has eluded me. The result of the races: today, less than a third of our citizens still have confidence in the process of European integration, up from almost half five years ago. This is the result of the races! So it would be a bad trial to tell you that it is your responsibility and your sole responsibility. Everyone knows that this is not true. Nevertheless, Mr Barroso, I would have expected you to show a much stronger initiative to defend this article of the Treaty of the European Union, which reminds us that the Union places solidarity, especially between generations, and social justice at the heart of its project. That is why our citizens today no longer trust Europe, because this part of the treaties has been forgotten.  I would have relied on you as the guardian of the treaties to remind it, including to the heads of state or government and, including, from time to time, to the majority of this Parliament.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "Verts/ALE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 516, "date": "2014-10-21.json", "name": "Nigel FARAGE", "mepid": "4525", "text": "  on behalf of the EFDD Group. – Mr President. Well, Mr Barroso, for ten years we have been trading blows in this Parliament, and indeed I am the only person on today’s list of speakers who was involved ten years ago. I have found you – I have to say for the vast majority of that time – to be very civil, but often bemused by what I have had to say and by events in Europe as they have unfolded. In fact, I remember the first speech I gave. You presented your new Commission, and I pointed out to you that your nominee from France, Monsieur Jacques Barrot, was a convicted embezzler who had received a two-year suspended prison sentence and had been barred from public office. To my shock, at that moment you simply showed in your face that you had no idea that it was true, but of course it was. Perhaps that comes from your early days as an active student Maoist, when you believed in big ideas but did not perhaps have much to do with practical reality.  I have enjoyed much of what you have said over the years. Indeed, I particularly enjoyed you the day after Ireland – the only country indeed that had a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty – had voted ‘no’ to Lisbon. You stood up and said that the Irish did not really mean ‘no’. I particularly enjoyed that. I also enjoyed you saying that the European Union was the first ever non-imperial empire, because in that you showed so much of what this project has now become. I do not think that anybody doubts that those who got together in the 1950s after two ruinous world wars with the genuine intention of getting the French and Germans to sit around a table in order to talk together and to trade together were doing the right thing. But it has morphed and changed into something else, and it is your analogy to an empire that has led to the current failure. It is the expansion to allow in more and more countries; it is the expansion of the eurozone to let in Mediterranean countries which should have never have joined in the first place and which are now suffering so horribly. So I view you as a fantasist, but at no point have I ever, ever implied that you were dishonest. You are not. You are very honest indeed. I remember you telling Martin Callanan, who led the Conservative Group here for some time while the Conservative Party under David Cameron’s leadership became more Eurosceptic with each British parliamentary by-election, not to try to be like UKIP because the voters will go for the real thing. And you were right. We won the European elections. But thank you for last Sunday, thank you for appearing on British television, thank you for confirming that the real fantasist is not you – it is David Cameron. The British Prime Minister who pretends that we can restrict free movement and remain members of the European Union. You made it clear that he was wrong and that he was deceiving the British people. You made it clear that you were the boss and not him, and for that I thank you and wish you a very happy retirement indeed.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "EFD", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 517, "date": "2014-10-21.json", "name": "Gianluca BUONANNO", "mepid": "124869", "text": "    Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Barroso, I have heard your speech, I do not want to speak to you as an MEP, but I am speaking to you as mayor.

Mr President, you have already listened to me with great patience and I will not repeat my arguments. I would just like to answer a few questions from the speakers who have gone before me. First of all, I believe that the proof that the Commission that I had the honour of chairing was on the right track is that the criticisms come from the two extremes of the room and, very often, with the same tone which reveals a refusal to see, categorically, the difficulties and extraordinary challenges we have faced, and the same tendency to give , of course, no coherent response. The truth is that we have probably experienced the greatest economic and financial crisis since the beginning of our European integration, and that it was not the European Union that caused it. It is this truth that some \"sovereignists\" - to use their expression - do not understand or do not want to understand. Indeed, it is not Europe that has been at the root of excessive private debt and the lack of financial responsibility. On the contrary, it all happened under national supervision - or lack of supervision. Europe is the answer. Now we have one of the most ambitious, if not the most ambitious, regulatory and supervisory systems in the world. To say that Europe is worse because of the European Union is a lie. It is an absolute lack of respect and intellectual rigour. It was not Europe that caused the financial crisis, it was born in the United States. Of course, Europe was vulnerable, but the European Union only reacted, it was not the cause. And all of us who share the European ideal, whether we are from the right, the left or the centre, we must have the courage to say so, otherwise we will strengthen - and this is an opinion I give you when I leave office - the populisms of the extreme left or the extreme right. I have listened attentively to some of you saying \"populism is now stronger\" and blaming the European Union. My dear friends, this is not true. Populism and xenophobia exist very clearly outside the European Union. Look at what happened in Switzerland, against immigrants; look at what happened in Norway, with this terrorist - a demented man - who killed I don't know how many young people because he is against a multicultural Europe; look at the Tea Party in the United States. Is it Europe's fault, the existence of the Tea Party in the United States? In today's world, there is aggressive populism, sometimes with left-wing arguments, sometimes right-wing arguments, and it is difficult, I must admit, to tell the difference.  Therefore, to say that this is the result of the European Union is a lack of intellectual rigour as well as a lack of political honesty.  What we as Europeans need to do is to show precisely that it was not Europe that created the crisis, or even the public debts of the Member States. Europe cannot do much when a Member State, for example, falsifies its accounts. Europe has had to deal with that. The first initiative of my second Commission was to ask the Member States to give us more supervisory power over national statistics, because in the first Commission I chaired, this was refused. This was not refused by Greece, it was rejected by the large Member States who did not want to give more responsibility to the European Union. Therefore, if we really want to debate, let us be precise and be rigorous in terms of intellectual honesty and political rigour.  That's why, dear friends, I'm not going to waste your time. However, I would like to say something with great conviction. The team that I have had the honour of chairing has worked - and I now see some of you in this Parliament, and they know this well - with great dedication and rigour, always making the European interest a priority and I want to tell you, since we are an assembly of different political forces, always making the idea of the European common good the priority.  It was not colleagues from the EPP group, socialists or liberals who made up my Commission, they were men and women who worked for Europe. You know what my party is: it is the party of the EPP and I am proud of it. But as President of the Commission, my party has been Europe. This is a message that I would like to share with you, especially with the great forces of the pro-European centre-left and centre-right. Of course, differences must be expressed, but they must not weaken the European camp. Don't give more gifts to the far right and the far left. The pro-European forces must unite. They must have the courage to defend Europe. They must also do so in the capitals and not simply here in Strasbourg. We must be able to have this grand coalition for Europe because I believe that we have the energy to win the battles of the present and the battle of the future.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 521, "date": "2014-10-21.json", "name": "Martin SCHULZ", "mepid": "1911", "text": "   Thank you, President Barroso. Ladies and gentlemen! Before we conclude the debate, allow me to say a word to you, Mr President, and to the Members of the Commission. Mr Barroso, first of all to you personally. As chairman of a parliamentary group, I have been with you for seven and a half years, with more emphasis on beatings. I was president of a European institution with you for two and a half years. At the end of this debate, on behalf of this institution, without prejudice to all the differences that logically exist between Parliament and the Commission, I would like to say one thing to you, regardless of what is going on in terms of content: anyone who invests ten years of his life in European politics in the form you have done – I have seen it closely – can only be thanked for the enormous amount of effort that has been put into European policy. , which you have also personally put into your idea of Europe. As President of the other institution, I would like to say this explicitly with great respect and great recognition. (Applause) This also applies to the members of your Commission, who are here in large numbers, almost entirely, I believe. I would also like to thank you for your work, without prejudice to any differences that exist on the substance. A job that is not easy, a work that is often unfairly reviled. This is also a piece of responsibility for the policies of others, because the scapegoating function in the European Union works relatively well. Success is national, and failure is often assigned to the European institutions, including you as the Commission. That is not fair. However, it is therefore fair to thank you from the heart for your commitment at the end of your term of office. I would also like to do this on behalf of our institution. (Applause) Perhaps a point of order. The ladies and gentlemen who have now left the Chamber should perhaps know one thing for the future: the agenda will be set on Mondays. The motion that has been tabled here was a request to amend the agenda. It is also possible to table amendments to the agenda at nine o'clock in the morning on the day of the sitting. But then the President's approval is needed. As a rule, I give my assent to such requests. You cannot change the agenda in the middle of the agenda. I believe that this is understandable for anyone who has a minimum of parliamentary understanding. In that respect, that request was visibly inadmissible and also unfounded.

This is an extraordinary statement given that in Russia it is impossible to distinguish between organised crime and the so-called law enforcement agencies. Meanwhile, a respected internet security company iSIGHT has uncovered a massive Russian cyber-espionage campaign against Western governments and NATO.

The European Union is the world's economic zone with the greatest impact of the employment crisis. It has cost us the loss of more than 2.5 million jobs. Inequality, poverty and social exclusion have been triggered. Austerity has failed in Europe. While Obama bet on stimulus policies. The United States grows and creates more than 8 million jobs.

Today, we are faced with an EU that must urgently change course to restore hope to a European dream that has been abducted by the rise of populism and the far right and because of the devastating effects of the crisis and austericide policies that have led to the high level of unemployment and the impoverishment of European families.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 531, "date": "2014-10-21.json", "name": "Marian-Jean MARINESCU", "mepid": "33982", "text": "  in writing. – The Barroso Commission's mandate has been through a constitutional, geo-political and financial crisis.

The failures of this Commission could be seen from the outset. About a week after the official launch of the second Barroso Commission, on 1 December 2009, the Treaty of Lisbon was approved. However, already at the beginning of May 2010, just half a year later, aid was approved to Greece, in direct breach of the newly approved Treaty of Lisbon. Shortly afterwards, the violation of the Treaty of Lisbon reached systemic level, as it was first created temporary euro (EFSF) and later permanent euro (ESM). Systematic violations of the rules by the Barroso-led European Union were not the only negative of this European Commission. Of the 27 Euro-Commissioners at the beginning of her term of office, at least 10 had a communist past, or communist ideas are not rejected at present. Similarly, the response of the second Barroso Commission to the crisis was very unfortunate. The European Union has continued to push for more of the same, which has caused the current crisis – the redistribution of taxpayers' money and the issuing of a number of harmful regulations.

And assuming that Parliament approves the new Commission tomorrow, it will also be the last of the current President of the Commission, Mr Barroso. But it will also be exceptional from the point of view of substance: firstly, the European Council is called upon to reach agreement on the 2030 framework for the European Union's climate and energy policies. I do not need to remind the House of the importance of this issue. It is in the interests of all of us to develop a coherent European climate and energy policy that ensures affordable energy prices, industrial competitiveness, security of supply and the achievement of climate and environmental objectives. It is certainly not an easy goal, if our overall objective is clear, the individual Member States each have their own vision, which reflects a number of factors such as the accessibility of energy sources, their industrial capacity and energy demand and also the different environmental cultures.  This means that the negotiations currently under way to prepare for this week's meeting are complex and represent an important challenge, but we all know how essential it is to ensure an ambitious outcome, not least in view of the role that the European Union wants and must play on the international stage as a world leader. The agreement should be global and the essential point is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The proposal under discussion is an internal emission reduction target of 40% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels. To achieve this, six main chapters have been defined covering the EU-ETS – Emission Trade System – and non-ETS sectors, renewable energy sources and energy efficiency, the creation of a fully functioning internal energy market, energy security and governance.  I will not go into too much detail, as negotiations are still ongoing, while I am speaking to you, the General Affairs Council is discussing these issues as part of the process of preparing for the European Council meeting. The Presidency has worked hard to ensure that an agreement is reached.  A successful outcome of this European Council would allow the European Union to submit a contribution that meets the UNEFCCC's agreed timetable in Warsaw for the conclusion of a comprehensive climate agreement by the first quarter of 2015. The step that our leaders must take is therefore extremely important.  In addition to energy and climate issues, the European Council is called upon to discuss the economic situation. We know that it is fragile and the most recent forecasts remind us that we cannot afford any delay. We managed to overcome the difficulties immediately following the crisis, but now we need to relaunch growth, create jobs and develop competitiveness. Only in this way can we rebuild an adequate level of confidence in our economies. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me conclude by mentioning another extremely important issue: the deadly spread of the Ebola virus. You discussed this yesterday in the presence of the Commission. I do not need to tell you that we are in the midst of a serious crisis. We need a global response both internally and externally, which is why it was agreed that the European Council should take stock of the situation and, above all, highlight the strategic actions needed to bring this deadly virus under control.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 2, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "NI"}, {"id": 540, "date": "2014-10-21.json", "name": "Jyrki Katainen", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "  Vice-President of the Commission. - Mr President, I am honoured to be here today to present to you the views of the Commission on the European Council meeting this week. The summit will seek to agree on the 2030 climate and energy framework and discuss the economy and external developments, including Ukraine, and we will also address the Ebola epidemic. Let me start with a few remarks on the economy. This week’s meeting is not one for decisions in this regard. It will be for the new Commission to initiate the new European Semester in a few weeks from now. Throughout the crisis, yes, our comprehensive response has always been built upon the three pillars of fiscal consolidation, structural reforms and targeted investments. This is still valid today. While economic recovery in the EU is still fragile and uneven, we are seeing that the efforts are paying off. Those countries which downturned the most are now better off than those which are lagging behind in addressing the root causes of the crisis.  The reforms to European economic governance have been instrumental in making this progress possible. Together, we have changed the way that Europe’s economies and financial sector are legislated, supervised and regulated. The framework for that has been created. Now we need to stick to it and to fully implement it. This is very important for restoring confidence. Agreeing a new framework on energy and climate policies for the period up to 2030 at this European Council will show how credible we are in transforming our economies and societies towards a low-carbon future. The proposals in our current 2020 framework have been of strategic importance. They have put our Union firmly into a position of global leadership and were widely recognised as a key contributor in the global fight against climate change. Importantly, we came to these agreements by finding the right mix of ambition and realism. By combining two strands – environment and energy – consensus was possible.  There are economic advantages to climate-friendly innovation and investment and an economic case for cost-effective decarbonisation is clearer than ever. We also broadened the scope to include energy security. Recent challenges to our security and the strategic dimension have given energy security concerns even more impetus. Energy security must therefore be part of the climate agenda.  Yet sadly our European climate ambition is far from being matched by the two most important polluters globally – the United States and China. Public opinion in Europe accepted the targets of 20-20-20 by 2020, even if they were aware of the difficulties in implementing them. The EU felt let down when a comprehensive global deal did not happen, despite pressing others to follow suit. But developments afterwards have shown that the Union was and remains on the right side of the argument.  There is now a renewed momentum towards a global, binding climate treaty to be agreed in Paris next year. Agreeing on our own 2030 framework now will set the tone; it would provide our Union with key leverage in a crucial phase of the international negotiations. The Commission’s 2030 proposal from January is the frame of reference for this EU debate. Our proposals are clear, ambitious and balanced, with a 40% emission reduction target at their heart.  The ball is now in the court of the European Council. Leaders must assume their responsibility; we expect difficult discussions but we are confident that a decisive deal is within reach now. The third issue to be discussed at the European Council is the external situation, in particular the conflict between Ukraine and Russia. With the unsettled conflict in Ukraine we realise more than ever that to defend our values and protect our interests, Europe needs to take the lead and be active. We need to continue contributing to a political solution. At the same time, we need to demonstrate that unlawful and uncooperative behaviour brings with it heavy consequences. The situation in Ukraine is a clash of world views that touches the very heart of the European Union, its principles, its values and what it symbolises: freedom, democracy and rule of law. This is why the EU from the start took a principled position against Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea and the destabilisation in Ukraine’s eastern region. Since then we have done all we could to make the most of a bad situation. The political and peaceful solution of the conflict has always remained our first priority. Not any solution, but one that guaranteed the sovereignty, independence and unity of Ukraine. Our relations with our eastern neighbours are not detrimental to relations with the other neighbours. We never sought exclusivity in our relations. In fact, the European Union has invested a lot in the strategic partnership with the Russian Federation, convinced that it is in our common interest to cooperate. Developments are still unfolding. The European Union continues to work for a politically negotiated solution. The Commission has made every effort in this regard by taking the lead in promoting trilateral talks on sensitive issues such as trade and energy. Just today, the Commission is mediating another round of talks on the gas issue.  On the security front, priority needs to be given to full implementation of the Minsk Agreements. This is the basis for restoring and consolidating trust. The ceasefire needs to be respected and verified. Elections in the Donbas need to be held in accordance with Ukrainian law and the border needs to be controlled and monitored. We cannot give up on Ukraine. We cannot give up on reaching a solution. If we do not reach a solution, what would be at risk would be both Ukraine’s independence and also the security, stability and unity of the European continent. We must defend the credibility of a multilateral order based on values, equality and the rule of law.  At the same time, we are greatly concerned by the humanitarian and security situation in Syria and Iraq. It is deteriorating dramatically day by day. The rapid progression of ISIL is alarming. Military action in line with international law is necessary, but it is not enough. It needs to be part of the wider effort, comprising measures in the political and diplomatic, counter-terrorism and terrorism funding, humanitarian and communication fields.  The Commission has been active on the humanitarian part. To date, around EUR 2.9 billion has been mobilised to those in need in Syria and Iraq, but the security situation impacts negatively the delivery of aid. While military intervention will be the key to defeating ISIL, it is imperative not to link the delivery of humanitarian aid to military objectives. Humanitarian access should not be put at risk. Unfortunately, there is yet another crisis which the European Council will have to address, and this is Ebola. The Ebola outbreak is not just a problem for West Africa; it is a challenge for the international community as a whole and Europe has a responsibility to do its part.  The Commission and the Member States have provided assistance to the countries affected and to the humanitarian effort on the ground – more than EUR 600 million already, and it is not just money. Twelve Member States are providing medical and other equipment through the EU civil protection mechanism. But we need to do more to help the affected African countries and also protect our own citizens. The Commission discussed this issue at todayʼs College, and will feed into a discussion at the European Council. This week’s European Council will cover very telling issues as far as the need for European Union unity is concerned: what the European Union is for; what it should do and what challenges it faces. I look forward to hearing your views here today on how we can work together to tackle these challenges.

Mr President, Mr President of the Council, Commissioner, as you have said, the Council which will meet on 23 and 24 October will have to deal with important and highly topical issues. It will decide, among other things, on the objectives to be set for the new climate and energy framework, and it will address the key issues of strengthening energy security, Europe and interconnection needs. Let us make no mistake: our goal is not to wage an ideological war against climate change, which would leave the bruised bodies of our companies and their employees on the battlefield. It is really a question - and I say this forcefully - that Europe is committed to the fight against climate change while maintaining its competitiveness and ensuring its security of supply. The situation in Ukraine is a sufficient reminder of the importance of ensuring the security of our energy sources. Europe faces major challenges: energy prices are high - in some sectors account for up to 40% of production costs - national policies are not sufficiently coherent and the internal energy market is still fragmented. Finally, we have an obligation to move towards a decarbonized economy. In order to respond, we must diversify our sources of supply: renewable energies must be supported until they reach technological maturity. We also need to strengthen energy infrastructure. The interconnection between the Member States will be the key to building a genuine common European energy policy, an energy union, so dear to the new President Jean-Claude Juncker, who has made it one of his priorities. The objectives set by the European Council will be important in informing and guiding the investments of our companies. We need to provide them with a stable environment and visibility. Let's stop constantly changing our goals. I take here the example of the list of sectors exposed to carbon leakage: it should not have led to procrastination and our group, the EPP, has also been able to show its unity on this essential subject. The support of companies, in order to evolve their production method and the use of their resources, must not be a word in the air but a concrete act and a promise to keep. Today, many European industrial sectors are world champions of energy efficiency and emissions reduction. In building construction and transport, the potential for efficiency gains is enormous. On the other hand, carbon capture and storage technologies have not really taken off. Electricity storage must also mobilize us. It alone will make the development of renewable energy credible. Europe cannot lag behind in these key areas. The European Union must therefore strongly and first and foremost support our companies in their research and development efforts. This will enable them to use ever more innovative and less polluting technologies to meet the challenges of sustainable development. In December, at the Lima conference, we will have to engage with our partners with frankness, seriousness and pragmatism. We must not impose our objectives on others because acting unilaterally is not the answer. While the EU is now responsible for only 11% of global CO2 emissions, a share that will fall in the coming years, it cannot take the necessary decisions on its own. Europe must not be the great naiveness of climate negotiations. The Lima conference must therefore be a real preparation phase for the major conference in Paris. In 2015, we do have a good chance of reaching a concerted international agreement that is therefore strong and respected by all. You have mentioned many challenges, Commissioner, and there is an urgent need to solve the Ukrainian problem. There is an urgent need to fight terrorism. There is an urgent need to stem the spread of Ebola. We all need to be determined.

But if we want to take that turn, we have to look at the reality data and not stay blind to all the alarms that are going on. We would have to listen to the avalanche of analysis and recommendations from experts and think tanks and not remain deaf to this analytical coincidence, and we would have to abandon insensitivity about the social consequences of the policies that have been put in place. Looking at the data, we see that the latest OECD and International Monetary Fund reports agree that the growth outlook in the European Union in 2014 and 2015 is not at all optimistic; any perspective is worse than what has occurred before. We also see that, at best, we are in an economic relapse and, at worst, we are entering a third recession. But the intermediate scenario is stagnation, which the Monetary Fund has called \"secular stagnation.\" If we talk about inflation, we see that the best hypothesis is low deflation, and the worst, clear deflation, and that either limits our chances of reducing the deficit and increasing growth. At the same time, we have also not been able to reduce the level of unemployment. In view of this situation, the analyses, the Monetary Fund, the OECD, the think tanks, the German Institute for Economic Studies itself point out that what is happening to us is a consequence of the policies we have been putting in place. What to do about this situation? In view of this situation, the new Commission must be used to launch the 'fresh' and private public 300 billion euro programme, which encourages growth and employment. Where to do it? Taking advantage of the importance of climate change, mainly in infrastructure and in everything that means reducing emissions, supporting renewable energy, energy savings and also connecting between the different countries of the Union.

It is nonsensical to consider them separately. A healthy economy needs low-cost energy. Europe does not have it. Since 2005, energy prices in Europe have risen by 38%. In the USA, they have fallen by 4%, creating tough decisions for households, but also for companies, and stalling economic growth.  Climate and energy policy must be for the long term. It should not be based on short-term reactions. We need long-term thinking, and we need to work with industry, not against it. If we are to achieve a workable policy, it is time to put aside this ideological debate between whether or not you agree with one group of climate scientists or another group of climate scientists. Surely it is time to find common ground. Surely it is time that we find those areas on which we agree. Surely this is the sort of Chamber where different groups can come together. Surely we can agree on less pollution. Surely we can agree on less waste in landfill. Surely we can agree on less dependence on unpleasant regimes, whether in Russia or in the Middle East. But we can also agree on more. We can agree on more renewable energy. We can agree on more energy efficiency and more conservation, and we can agree on more energy security. So let us put aside those differences and work together. But we have to take a step back and ask the fundamental question: in a modern, digital economy, with high-speed rail and electric cars, what will provide that energy? Wind? Yes. Solar? Of course. Wave energy? Yes. But is that truly enough? Therefore the question – and my question particularly to your group, my green friends – is what fills in the gaps? Some people will say nuclear, but the Greens say no. Some say clean coal. The Greens say no. Some say shale, but the Greens say no. So we have to answer this fundamental question. Blue card me if you have an answer. If not, we will have an energy policy that might emit less CO2, but we will also have power cuts, companies moving production outside the EU  and even higher levels of unemployment. So surely here the key is pragmatism, not setting climate targets which are unreachable and which drive industry out of the EU. Let us not forget that the EU by 2030 will only account for 4.5% of global emissions. We cannot have a ‘little European’ mentality. We have to work with the rest of the world. A solution will not necessarily be from a multinational. It might well be found in someone’s garage by the Bill Gates or the Steve Jobs of the energy world. That is why we need to be pro-market, not necessarily pro-big business. Let us cut the red tape and arbitrary targets that crush these start-up companies at the start. Otherwise, we will never solve this challenge. It is time to reclaim the green agenda for those who believe that being green and pro-growth are two sides of the same coin.

It faces enormous challenges with regard to economic growth, the reindustrialisation of Europe and its complaceble with climate objectives.  Energy policy is of undeniable importance for both terms of this equation. If there are over-energy costs to be tackled, we cannot distort reality and focus only on mature renewable energies. We must have the courage to look equally at the aid provided to the fossil energy sector. If we want to focus on energy efficiency, security of supply and counterour dependence on the outside world, we must ensure a stable environment for investment in these areas.  As the Commissioner said, the ball is on our side. We must set ambitious targets for limiting greenhouse gas emissions and binding and ambitious targets for renewable energy penetration and energy efficiency.

To this end, the forthcoming European Council will have to ratify the obvious.  The European Council must also denounce Turkey's provocative actions and prevent the illegal directive of the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs that came into force on 20 October, in which it illegally detains areas south of Cyprus, thus violating the sovereign rights of the Republic of Cyprus, as well as the rights of the European company, EDI, which is currently conducting research drilling within the Cypriot EEZ.

Mr President, I must be a big naïve or a little optimistic on the edges from time to time, but I remember that in March 2011, after the Fukushima disaster, the very pro-nuclear Chancellor Merkel said to herself: \"Sapristi, the energy transition is an environmental requirement and an economic opportunity for Germany.\" And she went right into it. I was thinking that after the Ukraine crisis, it is all the European leaders who have come to the conclusion that this is not only an environmental requirement and an economic opportunity, but also a strategic imperative. I therefore expected that the Council, which will soon meet, would very easily adopt the position of the European Parliament.  I remind you of the Delvaux report, adopted at the end of the previous Parliament, which stresses the need for a three-way objective, both ambitious and binding. Because, as you know - I didn't find the equivalent French expression - \"What gets measured, gets done.\" And conversely, what is not measured is not done. We had binding targets for CO2 reductions and for the share of renewable energy, and we are meeting them.  We had a non-binding target for energy efficiency. And guess what's next? We don't reach it! Therefore, the only way for Europe to achieve what it thinks it needs to achieve is to set a three-way binding target. This is, as I recall, an environmental requirement. Climate change is already affecting the European Union; it concerns not only the Pacific Ocean, but also Italy or France. So soon you won't know the Bordeaux wines as you know them today. So it's an environmental requirement.  Of course, it is also a geostrategic requirement if we want to achieve energy independence. It is not by replacing dependence on Putin or the sheikhs of the Gulf with dependence on the United States or Africa that we will be independent. If we want to be independent, we have to turn to renewable energy.  Finally, it is an economic opportunity. As I said to José Manuel Barroso, if Europe wants to have something to offer in the world of the 21st century, if it wants to be ahead not only of technology but also of the business model and the model of social organisation, it must achieve an energy revolution. Therefore, I would like to urge the Council to do so with full heart.

Mr President, I believe that these are two absolutely crucial and well-founded questions. The first question, by Mr. R-big, concerns the industrial dimension. The construction of the energy transition is first and foremost an industrial project. It is an industrial modernization project, but the production of equipment is also an industrial site. The question, then, is whether we want to foster an industrial infrastructure inherited from the 19th and 20th centuries or build the industrial infrastructure of the 21st century. I agree with you that some sectors, which are in extremely limited numbers, would indeed be very exposed because of a transition that is too rapid and that these sectors need to be protected. We agree. But we must not put all industrial sectors in the same bag. As for the social question, it is again extremely well-founded. This is a real problem and it is true that, during the investment phase of the energy transition, we have an increase in the cost of energy which, in fact, affects the weakest. How are we going to do that? In any case, there must be a means to be used: the progressive pricing of energy, i.e. energy pricing, which favours the poorest households - fiscally. We wanted to experience it in Belgium and in some places where we Greens are in power. This would eliminate the impact of the energy transition on these people, but it also means increasing energy for households that can afford to pay. That's the first part. The second part is based on the long-term financing of the energy transition, which will save money in the future.

We already have the world's highest energy prices for electricity with Japan, twice the cost of gas in the UNITED States, three to four times that of Canada and the United States. The planned reduction commitments would also be unrealistic from these points of view and above all unfair, as can be explained by the example of the Austrian voestalpine Group. Thanks to good development, increasing production, the voestalpine Group is penalised – and this is a must be said – with the lowest CO2 emissions in Europe, and is being asked to pay for emissions trading as a net contributor and thus vigorously. An additional purchase requirement with additional costs of 800 million euros is expected by 2020, possibly even from 2.3 billion by 2030. This is how we kill our leading companies! In this way, we are forcing our industry to move abroad, to go to third countries. What we need are intelligent solutions, an allocation of free allowances based on current benchmarks and not on the 2008 or 2007 figures. We need a distribution according to emission intensity.

Will the new reduction targets allow m.in to rebuild jobs: the 5 million that we are talking about in the Europe 2020 strategy? Will they also allow industry to achieve GDP growth of between 16% and 20% through reindustrialisation? This is the aim of the new Commission. Will the new reduction targets not result in carbon leakage – the relocation of production and also emissions outside the Union, and thus perhaps also a reduction in the capacity of individual Member States and their economies?

This means that we should have, from now on, more time to reduce public deficits; we should have more room to make public and private investments; we should have better coordination of economic policies to sustain demand, and we should adopt another approach to reforms.

Then Europe cannot say, we take responsibility, and ask other parts of the world – I am thinking of China and the United States – to take that responsibility as well. So now that responsibility has to be taken. We set out important lines in the European Parliament last year, February this year. It is not about the line of one group, because our group could be even more ambitious. It is the line of a large majority in the European Parliament. And it deals with three enforceable objectives at European level. You know them: the 40% reduction in CO2 emissions, the 40% energy efficiency and the renewable energy. And on Friday in the Council – we have heard that say – about half of the Member States would be prepared to move to a reduction of at least 40% emissions. And that 40% and at least 40% is extremely important – because that is also what the European Parliament wants – and that gives us some flexibility if we want to remind others of their responsibility on the international stage. So please let's go down that road. But of course it doesn't stop there. It's a total package. In Europe, too, we must not continue to subsidise fossil fuels and unconventional fossil fuels, and we must also meet these two other objectives.

But it seems that no one has the courage to assume as binding the objectives linked to the reindustrialization of our continent and our countries.  So, the strong question that I am asking for is taken up by the Council, but that it should become the climate in which we are also thinking in this House, the question is: who do we believe can restore hope to Europeans? Who do we think will give hope and work to our fellow citizens? On the basis of what model of economic development we believe we can give a real signal of confidence to all those who have historically taken responsibility for giving jobs, jobs and generating value. I believe that when we set ourselves the goal, by 2020, of generating a GDP that at least 20% sees the presence of the great manufacturing tradition of our continent and our nations, well, at that moment we set ourselves a binding target.

To promote the free market here, but to do the opposite at home, which, I must say, is truly brazen and untruthful. What is it all about? The market, industry and climate protection can be combined. I am firmly convinced of this. We need investment security in Europe so that companies can take money into their hands to invest in low carbon industry to invest in renewable energy. For this we need a functioning emissions trading system. For this we need a working framework. That can work. In the field of renewable energies in particular, we have growth rates, and as far as jobs are concerned, we are actually only dreaming of this in other areas. We must continue to move forward consistently along this path. However, this can only be done with strong emissions trading. We currently have a price of EUR 6.15, EUR 30 was estimated.

A fully functioning internal energy market connected to the global market is the key to security of supply and to the long-term competitiveness of our industry.  The resources we need for infrastructure cannot be covered by public money. We need to attract private investment, making better use of the financial instruments we have put in place.

In recent years, thanks to the work of the Commission and Parliament, all existing instruments, measures and action plans have been named, which can serve to increase security of supply in Europe. Many of these have now been realised. In many cases, however, Member States are behind in implementing and enforcing legislation. For example, mandatory physical bidirectionalisation or the development of simplified infrastructure licensing processes are progressing slowly. As a consequence, the focus should be on much more effective implementation in the coming period. Two areas would be highlighted separately. One of the most important previous Commission initiatives was to take coordinated action against external strategic partners and suppliers. That is why it is welcome that the High Representative candidate for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy has set a goal of creating the conditions for proper coordination between Member States.

First of all, a clear line versus Russia and its war in Ukraine. This is the most fundamental task for the European Union: to preserve and defend peace. The aggression we see today from Russia is a threat to the peace order of today. This needs the support of all Member States and it must be clear and consistent.  Secondly, we need to attract investment into the European Union. That means that we need to fight red tape, to use the new opportunities of having a Vice-President of the Commission responsible for better regulation and fighting bureaucracy. We can only attract investment if there is an opportunity for companies to profit, for companies to develop. We need capital markets that are liquid all over the European Union. So we need to ensure that our regulation and legislation is not hindering liquidity-making and investment. Thirdly, we need to secure credibility and the stability of public finances in the European Union. How we face developments in those countries which are not living up to the Stability Pact will be crucial and decisive for the future. If we make new derogations for some countries just because they are big, we are making a big mistake. We did it in 2003; we must not do it now because it will damage the credibility of the whole of the European Union. Fourthly, the ambitions, the targets for reducing carbon dioxide emissions, are more important than the number of very many different targets. We need to focus and give priority to reducing carbon dioxide emissions, not try to steer the Member States to where they can do things better.

As for energy, three years ago the EU Heads of Government decided to set the current year, 2014, as a clear deadline for the completion of an internal energy market. By the next year, they planned to leave no isolated areas which depended only on supplies from third countries. This applies in particular to the Baltic States and Finland. Well, all is on track. The Commission action plans have been published and updated. However, the end of the year is close, while we are still talking and preparing plans. Therefore, I call on the next Council to face the new realities. Any delay in completion of the internal energy market will directly undermine our common security.  As for security, Russia’s systematic military provocations in the Baltic Sea area have to be addressed efficiently and with convincing determination. Sanctions remain the most reliable means to stop and prevent further Russian expansion. Therefore, it would be most counter-productive to cherish any illusions about relaxing sanctions. The fragile Minsk ceasefire agreement is not the only criterion. Sanctions can be eased only if the Kremlin is able and willing to fully withdraw from the occupied territories and to fully respect the sovereignty of its neighbours.

This unfortunately means that Russia is no longer a stable and reliable partner of the European Union on this issue. It is therefore vital that the European Council raises Europe's energy security policy to the highest level. Firstly, the improvement of the European Union's energy networks needs to be accelerated, so that Member States are safer, that energy supply can flow between Member States, thereby also freeing the Baltic States and Finland from this energy issuan. Secondly, there is a need to move rapidly towards an energy union so that the European Union can speak with one voice with Russia as a supplier.

I am, frankly, very surprised that Commissioner Katainen has not put forward precise views in this area and has not demonstrated the ability to make a real compromise.

It was very wide ranging, touching upon various issues on the agenda of the European Council. Many speakers paid attention to climate and energy policy, which is an extremely important thing for Europe but also for the rest of the world. I do not know whether I should say too much about it, because Commissioner-designate Cañete would be a better specialist in this field. But, if I just mention that this area is, if I should mention one, probably one of the biggest source of competitiveness – if we just manage to deal with climate policy and energy policy together and the most effective way. First or all there is an endless demand for clean technology solutions; there is also endless demand for non-food biofuels, renewables and, if we manage to regulate right things instead of wrong things, we could create incentives for the private sector to innovate and create new solutions to save energy, but also produce cleaner energy and cheaper energy. So, at the end of the day, here in Europe we would have better energy for a better price and also technology to sell to other parts of the world. So, basically, as Commissioner-designate Cañete said in his hearings, we need a better energy market, fewer subsidies but a more unified market and we need better energy connections in order to allow energy to flow across the borders in order to maximise the efficiency of energy production. We also need better regulations for renewables in order to let them come into the market. Unfortunately, at the moment we are suffering, for instance, some trade barriers within the European Union, meaning that not all the Member States allow the best and newest technology to come into their market because they want to protect their own market. I am sure that this House will not accept this kind of behaviour and it is surely one of the issues which will be on the agenda of the next Commission.  But before there is a next Commission there is a European Council meeting. I would just like to stop here and say that I will pass these messages from the Members on to the current President of the Commission, and I am sure we can come back to the industrial renaissance, which is very important for the Speaker of the Parliament who is the father of this concept in Europe, and it is also one part of the climate and energy policy with which we are going to deal in the next Commission.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 589, "date": "2014-10-21.json", "name": "Antonio TAJANI", "mepid": "2187", "text": "   Mr Vice-President, thank you and good luck in your job, which is not an easy one.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE-DE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 590, "date": "2014-10-21.json", "name": "Benedetto DELLA VEDOVA", "mepid": "4739", "text": "  Mr President- in-Office of the Council. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have listened carefully to the debate we have had with a view to the Council of 23 and 24, particularly with regard not only to the energy dossier, which will be at the heart of the assessments of almost all the people, almost all the Honourable Members who have spoken.

Madam President, normally the report on the draft amending budget No. 2/2014 that I am presenting to you should have been a formality. Indeed, as stipulated in the financial regulation, the Commission presents an annual draft amending budget which aims to budget the surplus resulting from the previous year's budgetary year, i.e. in this case 2013. Normally, I said. Unfortunately, things are not normal. Anyone who follows the Union's budgetary situation is well aware that the payments situation is becoming critical, if not dramatic. Based on the information available, at the end of 2013 there were more than 23 billion unpaid and they would now, if nothing is done, approach 30 billion. When I talk about unpaid bills, I mean very concretely that they are proper invoices that are waiting to be honoured and cannot be honoured because the payment credits are not sufficient. This situation is totally abnormal. It is in fact a real debt, real but hidden, when the Union's budget must be in balance. This situation is also intolerable and I would like to ask the Council if it remembers that it adopted, not long ago, a directive which was addressed to the Member States and which instructs them to request that the invoices be paid within thirty days. Does it measure what the current situation means for Erasmus students, who will not receive the agreed money when they are entitled to receive it? Is the Council measuring what it means for a state, for a local authority, for a regional authority, already facing a difficult budgetary situation, not to have its bills repaid? Does it measure what it means for an SME or research team not to receive the agreed amounts, when the staff has been hired, is in place and must be paid? The situation has become so critical that the Commission has decided to present the budgetary authority with an amending budget no. 3, in which it is seeking additional payment appropriations for a total amount of EUR 4.8 billion. At the same time, it has tabled several other draft amending budgets, in which it proposes, for the most part, to include in the revenues the proceeds of fines and late interest for a total amount of about 5 billion euros. It is clear that Member States should not put their hands in their pockets to finance the additional payment appropriations in the event of an honourable agreement between the two branches of the budgetary authority. Taking all these elements into account, the Committee on Budgets has taken two important strategic directions, which it asks our assembly to support wholeheartedly. Firstly, we want to deal together, that is, as a whole during the negotiations with the Council, all the draft amending budgets introduced for the 2014 budget year. The aim of this bulk treatment is to prevent the Council from rejecting or scrapping requests for additional appropriations, but retains for the benefit of the Member States the additional revenue which has added, almost miraculously, the initial revenues planned for the year. It is precisely in order to be able to deal in bulk all the draft amending budget that this report asks you to approve an amendment to the draft amending budget No. 2 presented by the Commission. If this amendment is not approved, the Council will have the power, due to the overspending, to get its hands on the surplus of the 2013 financial year, to the benefit of the Member States, thus depriving the EU budget of the possibility of using it to loosen the noose of unpaid bills. The second important direction adopted by the Committee on Budgets has already been expressed today in the organisation and on the agenda of our work: it is a question of getting an agreement with the Council on the 2014 amending budgets before starting negotiations on the 2015 budget. This strategic choice, which has been supported , I would like to stress - by all the political groups in the Committee on Budgets, is necessary for us for two reasons. The first, as I said, is that there is an urgent need for additional funding. This urgency concerns both the beneficiaries, who are waiting for their bills to be paid, and the Union itself, whose credit will be hard hit if it is not able to honour the commitments it has made. The second reason is that the 2015 budget, which we will vote on tomorrow, will not hold up if the 2014 budget, unchanged, leaves it with a slate of unpaid debts weighed down by billions. An agreement on the 2014 amending budget is therefore both a necessity and a prerequisite for the adoption of a 2015 budget that holds up. It is for these reasons that I ask you to approve the report I am presenting to you today.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 598, "date": "2014-10-21.json", "name": "Enrico Zanetti", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "  Mr President- in-Office of the Council. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, it is a pleasure and an honour for me to take part once again in a sitting of the European Parliament, which has among its items on the agenda some relating to the subject of the Community budget. Specifically, the subject we are dealing with now relates primarily to amending budget proposal No 2 for 2014, which was already approved by the Council at its meeting on 14 July 2014.  This budget, as you know, is part of a procedure which is duly codified in the Financial Regulation, which, once the result of the previous financial year has been defined, requires the necessary budgetary changes to be adopted for the current financial year. In line with the forecasts in the Financial Regulation, the Commission therefore proposed to account for the surplus of around EUR 1 billion in the 2013 budget in 2014.  We note that the European Parliament is preparing to adopt amendments to this purely technical budget, providing for a new budget line on which to set aside this amount pending its use for unforeseen payments. This approach – as we have been told clearly – is affected by the more general discussions we are having on the 2014 amending budgets and the 2015 draft budget.  It goes without saying that the amending proposal itself cannot be accepted by the Council, but therefore clearly inevitably, it will be taken into account in the more comprehensive debate that we will have in the conciliation procedure, and I am sure that in this area we will be able to find the right balance for a decision that meets the various demands in accordance with the rules laid down in the current legislation.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 599, "date": "2014-10-21.json", "name": "Jacek Dominik", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "  Member of the Commission. - Madam President, the Commission proposal for this draft amending budget was tabled in April 2014, in accordance with the Article 18 of the Financial Regulation. It concerns the budgeting of the 2013 surplus. As pointed out by the rapporteur, Mr Deprez, the amount of the surplus is one billion, five million euros, and it mostly comes from the additional revenue from competition fines received towards the end of 2013.  Only a very small part of the 2013 surplus – somewhere in the region of EUR 275 million out of an executed budget of almost EUR 144 billion – comes from the expenditure side of the budget.  At the same time, the Commission has also presented amending budgets requesting additional expenditure of EUR 4.7 billion since the end of last May. Last year, the reinforcement of payments in amending budgets 2 and 8 of 2013, totalling EUR 11.2 billion, had been fully used by the end of 2013. This year again, the situation of payment is tight; it started with a backlog of EUR 23.4 billion. We simply have no possibilities for redeployment, and several budget lines have been fully exhausted. Overall implementation stands at the level of 82%. It is in light of this scarcity of payments across the budget that the Commission understands the amendments proposed by the Parliament to create a reserve for payments in the 2014 budget with the same amount as the surplus.  Out of the seven amending budgets, six are still outstanding. Two of them concern the mobilisation of the EU Solidarity Fund. Together with the Council, we will need to find a compromise on all draft amending budgets on the table – including the three for this year – which reinforces payments amounting to EUR 4.7 billion. The Commission considers that all of the elements needed to do so quickly are available. This year, we have a unique opportunity to cover the additional expenditure with the revenue mainly coming from funds. This means that we can cover it at no cost to Member States’ budgets. Taking this decision will only increase the EU’s credibility and allow us to gain control over the EU budget.

Amending budgets - these budgets are to pay for investments, programmes, projects already carried out and duly authorised, for SMEs, young people, scientists, local authorities, NGOs.

It is true that on the agenda we are talking about the second amending budget, but it is clear that what is on the table and focuses the debate we are currently having in the Committee on Budgets and in the European Parliament is how we solve the payment crisis that we have been dragging on since 2010.  I get the impression that when we talk about payments, we often already repeat obviousness, but it seems that the Council's position is not so clear in this regard; therefore, we still have to keep repeating obviousness and be patient to see if we can get the Council to change our position once and for all. And the first no-brainer, which we keep repeating in this Parliament, is that we have to pay what we owe. I think it is quite simple to explain to our citizens that, in the European Union, the Council, the Commission and Parliament have taken decisions and reached agreements; that many companies, NGOs, public institutions, private institutions and universities have relied on the proposals we have made have participated in European programmes and now what we have to do is simply pay the bills they have sent us in relation to those agreements that we have reached with them. And so that is a no-brainer that we will tire of repeating, but that it seems that on the part of some countries, at least in the Council, it is not so clear. That's an unacceptable situation. We cannot continue to delay the settlement of defaults.  We have been on the table since 2010 and the situation is becoming increasingly worrying, reaching around 26 billion or 30 billion euros, because we no longer even know what figure we are talking about. And I'm going to say two more obvious things: first of all, that not paying is not to respect those agreements that we've reached. And secondly, that, moreover, not paying what we are doing is not respecting the agreement on the financial framework either, and what we are really doing is cutting the budget through the back door. As the Commission has told you, you have a golden opportunity, it will not cost you a euro to reduce these defaults by at least FIVE billion euros.

Madam President, we are at the beginning of the Parliament and I want to denounce two dysfunctions. The first is the appearance of a sneaky debt due to a growing gap between commitments and payments. Those who have just spoken have made it clear what the position of the Committee on Budgets is and we intend to maintain a strategic line for it to be remedied. The 2014-2020 Multi-Year Framework does not take into account outstanding payments, which at the end of 2013 amounted to $23.4 billion. I thank Commissioner Dominik for his clarity on this issue. The second dysfunction is related to the internal market because we see new resources accumulating with the fines decided by the Court of Justice. This means that the functioning of competition is imperfect: 1.331 billion additional resources at the end of 2013, including late interest, but probably 3.5 billion fines for 2014. This dysfunction of the internal market seems to me to be serious because a poor functioning of competition is detrimental to growth and thus to the reversal of the unemployment curve. It is important to remedy this because the Court of Justice needs four years , I say four years - to deal with competition cases. The Court of Justice had requested additional resources in March 2011 but the Council was unable to find a solution to appoint the judges because it asked for twelve additional judges. For three years, the Council was unable to meet this expectation. So we are probably heading for the appointment of twenty-eight additional judges because that number corresponds to the number of member countries of the European Union.  I hope that this dysfunction will be resolved quickly, firstly because it is detrimental to growth and secondly, because by not making a decision, we delay the collection of these fines.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 603, "date": "2014-10-21.json", "name": "Liadh NÍ RIADA", "mepid": "124987", "text": "  thar ceann an Ghrúpa GUE/NGL. – A Uachtaráin, dar leis an gCoimisiún ag deireadh 2013 bhí easnamh i mbuiséad an Aontais de níos mó ná EUR 23.4 billiún i bpolasaithe comhtháthaithe.

We have a unique situation: to solve the problem at no expense to the Member States. That is a really unique situation as far as I know; it has never happened in the past.  The Commission has this money, it is on the account – EUR 5 billion. Legally, we are not able to use it; we have to give it back to the Member States. So now, the reply awaited from the Council is whether the Council and the Member States prefer to put this money in their own pockets and ignore the commitments they have made in the past, and ignore the payments they have to make, or do they want to really address the problem, show their European will and pay the bills?  The problem is that what we observe is an increasing reluctance by the Member States to pay their bills, to contribute to the European Union budget as such. There is an ongoing tendency to cut as much as possible without any rationale, while at the same time taking on new obligations, new commitments. We have commitments which were taken on during the multiannual financial framework (MFF) negotiations which have not been respected within the first year of its implementation.  This all creates a nightmare for the budget negotiations. We spend days and days trying to figure out whether the Council is going to respect its commitments or not; instead of doing simple calculations to see how much money we have to devote to paying the bills.  The decision on the whole set of amending budgets could be made very easily; the calculation is simple: more than EUR 5 billion available, a little bit less than EUR 5 billion to be paid. The outcome is positive and yet still the Council hesitates. It is an unacceptable situation.  If we do as the Council is proposing – postpone as many decisions as possible – it will not be possible to implement the MFF properly. We will create additional tensions in the budgets for 2015 and 2016. We will probably need a major reform soon and have to make it publically known that the European Union is not able to implement its own decisions from the past and is not a credible partner for researchers, small and medium-sized enterprises and European citizens.

Today we are debating here and tomorrow we will vote — I hope by a large majority - on the draft budget for 2015, and I can say that our position is absolutely responsible and consistent with the situation we are experiencing. We have been in deep economic crisis for seven years, austerity policies have brought nothing but suffering, and not only are we not coming out of the crisis, but we are facing a high probability of a third recession and, therefore, it is more than clear that we need to change the course of economic policy and, above all, activate demand through the public sector. And that is where the European budget can play an important role, because with only 1% of gross domestic product, the European budget activates public investment by complementing national budgets and also boosts growth and employment. In recent months we have talked a lot about new investment plans, new strategies, focusing on priorities. I would like to remind you that we already had a Lisbon Strategy which failed because of a lack of political will and which, now, even if some have been forgotten, we also have the Europe 2020 Strategy, which will also fail if we do not put on political will and, above all, the necessary funds. In addition, we have just approved the Multiannual Financial Framework, which is nothing more than a table in which we see the political and budgetary priorities for seven years. So we don't have to invent the wheel every year, because of great strategies and White Papers are the drawers full. But here we have the 2015 budget and the financial framework with a number of potentials that we must exploit to the fullest, and that is what we have done in our draft budget, because we propose a budget to the maximum of its capabilities to channel productive economies, so that Europe competes in the world in quality and knowledge, and that we return to be an example of a welfare society that takes care of its people. And that is why we have decided to concentrate our efforts on the core programmes of the Europe 2020 Strategy which are aimed at promoting growth, research, employment and competitiveness; we improve access to funding for small and medium-sized enterprises or put more money into Erasmus scholarships or Marie Curie grants; we also want to allocate funds to energy infrastructure, nor have we forgotten about farmers and fishermen, nor for the damage caused by the Russian veto to our products. We have designed a budget that fights inequalities, supporting the most disadvantaged regions, but also helping the people who are having the worst time, within and outside our borders, with the European Aid Fund for the Most Needy or with policies related to asylum, migration and internal security. And we have also earmarked more money for neighbourhood policy items, development cooperation policy and, of course, essentially, humanitarian aid to be able to deal with all the humanitarian crises we are currently having, all at once, in an unprecedented fact. Nor can we forget about aid to refugees and increasing unRWA's money so that we can continue to help Palestine's refugees. These are all the priorities of the European Parliament; many priorities which, as I have said on other occasions, are the same as those of the European Council. The problem is that your budget, your figures tell a very different story from ours, because you have political priorities, but you don't seem to have budget priorities, and we don't agree with that position, because we can't say we're betting on research while cutting the budget.  Because you, once again, treat the European budget as a heading that is cut as you please. And this is not only the fault of the economic crisis and how the national accounts are, but sometimes also a lack of an absolute vision for the future and a shared project. And we just saw this in the payments debate; it is seen by the attitude we have in not minding to drag a debt of EUR 26 billion which, as has been said, lags the credibility of the European Union and which also has devastating effects on the economic recovery. We have proposed extraordinary measures and I hope that the Council will be ready to negotiate and discuss these extraordinary measures and that together we can find a solution.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 620, "date": "2014-10-21.json", "name": "Monika HOHLMEIER", "mepid": "96780", "text": "  Rapporteur. - (DE) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for the excellent work he has First of all, I would like to express my sincere thanks to my colleague, Mrs Eider, for making her words very clear about the priorities that the European Parliament is setting. At the beginning, I want to put a little bit of my frustration, to say so clearly and so loudly. Outside, we are discussing EUR 300 billion in investment aid, while here in the European Parliament we are seeing that we are not even in a position to set up Horizon 2020 with a billion in such a way that we can help small and medium-sized enterprises in terms of innovation and research in the long term, that we can promote innovation and research in the European area. Outside, we are piling up buildings where we do not even know where to pay the small bills. I have to say quite soberly that a little consistency in financial and budgetary policy would make some sense. Before I build all sorts of towers, perhaps I should at least put into practice what I have decided on programmes for further development in the European Union. We are currently in a state where we are sitting on 25 billion bills that we do not want to pay, which the Council does not want to pay. We now have some checks outside to change the criteria afterwards so that the bills become a few fewer. Even the most serious carriers are now stinky, and in some countries, some of which are waiting for a lot of money, which they have properly spent, where the promoters are entitled to the disbursement, there is now a growing suspicion of this European Union, simply because the Council is spending the money in its countries, but at the same time the invoices that are now being sent to the Commissioner. , does not want to pay. I consider this system to be completely unspeakable. When we talk about growth, when we talk about further development, then I would like to make it quite clear that we must also consistently do something about it and not make speeches on Sundays, nor do we use huge projects before we have been able to fill the fine print that we ourselves have given ourselves, so to speak. In addition, I also believe that if you go to the big print, you should also consider, is the money being spent wisely and does it actually make a lasting difference? Horizon 2020 is a very well thought-out programme with very long discussions in advance. I am deeply disappointed that the Council is cutting back on precisely these areas, particularly in the area of humanitarian aid and, in particular, in the area of development aid. This is something I have no understanding for at all. Now to the European Parliament's budget; it looks rather harmless. The European Parliament's budget is in a completely normal way. We have been able to press ahead with our cooperation with the Economic and Social Committee and cooperation with the Committee of the Regions, but there are two children of concern in the other institutions. One is the European Court of Justice, where we currently have to wait up to four years for the judgments, because there is not adequate equipment to make the judgments in a timely manner. This is becoming more and more a budgetary problem or a budgetary risk, because companies are suing the Court of Justice against the non-judgments, but at the same time they have to make security deposits, because they can be potentially condemned accordingly. The second is the European External Action Service, which is currently expected to carry out many tasks, particularly in the time of foreign policy crisis, and in the same breath, but the means by which it is supposed to do so are simply not enough. You don't want much, but it should at least be consistent, and it shouldn't be every negotiation that the foreign representative will conduct in the future on YouTube, but perhaps the IT systems that are at the level of 1980 should finally be brought up to the 2014 level, otherwise the whole thing makes no sense.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 621, "date": "2014-10-21.json", "name": "Enrico Zanetti", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "  Mr President- in-Office of the Council. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, on 16 September, in this very House, we already had a first opportunity to discuss the draft budget for 2015, when I had the honour of presenting to you the Council's position. Because there is clearly a Council position here. I take note of the various amendments to the Council's position which the European Parliament is debating today and which it intends to vote on tomorrow. These amendments considerably increase the draft budget approved by the Council. Globally, the gap between our respective positions is EUR 1.3 billion in commitments and EUR 6.1 billion in payments. Furthermore, the amendments proposed by Parliament are higher than the European Commission's proposal of more than EUR 700 million in commitments and around EUR 4 billion in payments, even going beyond the ceilings of the multiannual financial framework. This involves the activation of contincengy margins on payments for 2015, with the obligation to recover in subsequent years. While the Council understands that the European Parliament wishes to support the Union's main spending policies with an ambitious budget, it considers the demands for an increase in appropriations, both commitment and payment, which are difficult to meet even in relation to the actual capacity to implement expenditure, that is, linked to the actual implementation of the underlying interventions. Therefore, the Council does not agree with the increase in appropriations that the European Parliament intends to vote on, since it considers these forecasts to be unrealistic, precisely with regard to the issue of the actual implementation of the underlying interventions, and not in line with the need to maintain adequate margins to deal with unforeseen expenditure during the year. In its position, moreover, the Council has left room for around EUR 2 billion in commitment and payment appropriations, which can be activated if the Commission considers that it is necessary during the financial year, in the face of both unforeseen circumstances and faster implementation of budgetary expenditure. This position represents, from the Council's point of view, a balanced compromise between the shared needs to support growth and employment and the equally important priorities linked to the sustainability of public accounts to which all Member States are subject and which involve generalised expenditure restraint, especially for administrative ones. It is precisely in this regard that I would also like to point out that the interinstitutional agreement provides, among other things, for a reduction in the staff of all the institutions, bodies and agencies by 5% until 2017. The Council hopes that the European Parliament will also take this requirement into account, both for the agencies and for parliament's own administration. I am sure that the work in the Conciliation Committee will, as always, be based on a constructive spirit of mutual trust between the institutions, with a view to reaching a balanced and mutually satisfactory agreement on the 2015 budget, in the interests of the European Union and its citizens, without in any way underestiming the sensitivity of the present moment, the wide gap between the starting positions and therefore the need for an absolutely extraordinary commitment on the part of all the actors involved. , starting with the Council.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 622, "date": "2014-10-21.json", "name": "Jacek Dominik", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "  Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the EU budget for 2015 is the second budget under the multiannual financial framework for 2014-2020, which was agreed less than a year ago. We must put all our efforts into making this framework fully operational, fully respecting all the terms of this agreement. We must achieve the political goals set by the Member States and by this Parliament in the agreed legal acts. We must also honour our obligations and pay outstanding bills stemming from past commitments, thus avoiding an unnecessary burden on beneficiaries.  All this has to be achieved within very tight financial circumstances and very tight budgetary ceilings. This is only possible, therefore, if we use all the flexibility that we have. We must maintain the EU as a credible business partner for small and medium-sized enterprises and regional authorities, as a provider of opportunities for students and researchers. Sustainable economic growth, competitiveness, the creation of jobs and the fight against youth unemployment are other urgent priorities of the EU policy and should be reflected in the orientation of EU expenditure for 2015.  We must do this under a clear and agreed framework and provide the necessary predictability and security for our investments and our partners.  All that is reflected in the Commission proposal for the budget 2015.  Last month I expressed before this House the Commission’s concern about the position taken by the Council in its reading of the 2015 Budget. Both the substantial reductions proposed – the commitments of 500 million and the payments of over EUR 2 billion – on the very policies which are at the core of our common objectives are not in line with the political objectives we have set. I therefore welcome the proposal of the Committee on Budgets of the European Parliament which proposes to restore most of the appropriations proposed by the Commission in the draft budget.  I also see that Parliament is proposing a further increase in commitment appropriations to reinforce actions in support of competitiveness for growth and jobs, and for external actions including humanitarian aid. The increase proposed for a total amount of EUR 750 million is within the existing margins under the MFF commitment ceilings. However, even if further reinforcement contributes to increasing investments, we should try and find the right balance with the implementation prospects and the payments availability.  The level of payment appropriations remains the paramount concern that we need to address at this budget conciliation. We must ensure that the legal obligations arising in 2015 are met, and put a stop to the snowball effect of shifting an ever-increasing amount of unpaid bills into future years. Now is the critical moment to achieve this just by approving the amending budget for 2014. It has no additional costs for Member States and recognises the valid needs we have in payments for 2015. We cannot afford to have the EU budget paralysed. We need to bring it under control and we have at this moment a unique opportunity to do so.  In its draft budget, the Commission has proposed using the full amount of payment appropriations under the MFF ceiling for 2015. I thank Parliament for proposing that, for the vast majority of the budget lines, the levels of payments proposed by the Commission should be restored. I understand from Parliament’s position on the draft amending budget and the budget for 2015 that it has taken very seriously the issue of the backlog and that it wishes to solve it as soon as possible. I fully agree that we must act responsibly and address at this stage the needs that we have in payments.  In its amending letter No 1 to the draft budget of 2015, the Commission proposed redeploying EUR 448 million in payment appropriations for programmes that are expected to face payment shortages in 2015. The redeployment of payment appropriations is possible because of the additional assigned revenue accruing to the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund.  The reinforcement of payment appropriations proposed by the Commissionʼs amending letter No 1 go in the same direction as a number of amendments proposed by Parliament where the needs are most pressing, and in particular with the aim of reducing the backlog of unpaid bills and allowing the proper launching of the new programmes.  This is necessary given the tight budgetary situation and is fully in line with the budgetary rules. Please treat this bold move as a sign of the Commission’s determination to stabilise the situation through redeployment too. We must avoid artificial under-budgeting in future as we are now all aware of the problems that such an approach brings. We can work within the overall budget context but we need to make full use of the elements of flexibility agreed in the Multiannual Financial Framework.  We are discussing the budget for 2015, but it remains clear and absolutely indispensable that the first step must be to stabilise the growing backlog of unpaid bills at the end of the year and the adoption of Draft Amending Budget (DAB) No 3 for 2014 which has been on the table since May. I fully share the Parliament’s sense of urgency to make progress on this proposal. As you know, favourable developments on the revenue side in 2014 provide an opportunity to find agreement in this direction. Exceptional additional revenue from fines stemming from the enforcement of competition policy means that the additional payment requests for 2014 will be, in total, at no cost for Member States. We should seize such an opportunity to address the shortage of payment appropriations in 2014.  I would conclude by assuring you that the Commission will do its utmost to act as an honest broker to help increase the efficiency of the budget, ensuring the credibility of the EU and gaining control and stabilising the budget.

All our regions benefit from EU structural funds. For example, most infrastructure and training schemes in Wales are at least partly funded by the European Union. Therefore, EU regional funds play an important, indeed vital, part in trying to improve economic prosperity right across the EU. I therefore find it difficult to understand any proposal to cut European structural funds.  The Committee on Regional Development was particularly concerned about the EUR 23 billion backlog in payments and the impact this will have on local authorities, businesses, universities and young people. In the UK alone, there is GBP 1.2 billion of backlogs in terms of payments.

We have seen prices fall, particularly for fruit and vegetables and for dairy products. This is not a market disruption caused by the farmers themselves, but a politically staged crisis. As a result of the Russian embargo reactions, agricultural producer prices are falling. Our farmers must be helped. For example, our milk producers in Estonia, Lithuania, Latvia and Finland need our immediate help at a milk price of 19 cents per litre. To do this, we need annual repayments to the agricultural budget. It is farmers' money for farmers. The Commission's decision to take the money away from us farmers, so to speak, is not appropriate, it is not effective, and is quite simply a naughty thing that we cannot tolerate.

In fact, the means have to be up to the point of ambition. The multiannual financial framework, its programmes, funds and priorities is required to be rapidly operational.

The Council has cut this draft by EUR 2 billion, and now the majority of Parliament's Committee on Budgets is proposing an increase to EUR 164.4 billion. That is, after all, 8% more than the original 2014 budget – against a backdrop of high- and partly over-indebted Member States. They have no money to spend on these increases. Another important point is that the EU has already entered into payment commitments worth EUR 222 billion. Of these, EUR 23 billion is currently due, and the bills are on the table. However, the EU has no money to pay these bills. This is a scandal! In a solution to the problem, the 2015 budget must also be designed accordingly. Therefore, the allowable commitments must be well below the payment budget until the budget gap is closed. Those who refuse to do so will help the EU to break the treaty. In fact, the draft now before us does not include commitment appropriations as high as payments. This means that this bill will not be borne in the future.

Because the way that the Council depicts the budget reality would certainly have impressed Big Brother when it comes to propaganda. The Council wants to make us believe that everything is fine; that the Council is enhancing EU competitiveness, thus countering the effects of the crisis and making Europe ready to face further tough globalisation challenges.  In reality, thanks to the Council, universities and research stakeholders will have to wait longer and longer in order to receive their EU funds. Even more SMEs will go bankrupt because EU funds for their projects do not arrive and NGOs will face even tougher bureaucratic hurdles as the Commission will do everything possible to delay its payments as it simply does not have enough money to honour all its contracts – well ʽm.  The result is clear. The EU institutions will become even less credible; maybe some in the Council actually want this. The quality of EU research will go down and our SMEs will become less competitive. This is to say nothing of the victims of natural disasters and civil wars throughout the world. The Council is telling them: do not count on the European Union.  On the other side, Parliament has assumed its responsibilities and I would like to congratulate our rapporteurs for the excellent work they did. They can count on our Group’s support in tomorrow’s vote, except for a few points where we have different views. For example, on the necessity to finance a very cost-intensive fusion energy plant which will only produce results in 2050, if at all. However, I am happy that thanks to the efforts of the Green Group the EU budget will be a little greener by reserving more funds for renewable energy, recycling activities and green entrepreneurial innovations.

On the one hand, the Council is trying to manipulate European citizens to retain power over them.

There are two camps in this house. Some complain that the EU is too expensive, and others – including myself – assume that the EU has tasks to perform. In the budgetary procedure, we are constantly faced with the difficult situation wherethe Member States are to assign tasks to the EU on the one hand and, of course, the EU should also carry out these tasks – most of the time, the Member States have thought something about it being done at European level – and then the Member States say: yes, but we do not pay for the task. Now, as a budgetary controller – and I am also – we can certainly think a lot about how to make payments more effective in the European Union. How do we get a little better grip on our budget? We have to say that the management and control systems of the same Member States are not in order and are often used to use European money. We are therefore in an intensive discussion with the Council on how we can get a grip on the European budget and how we manage it better. But, Mr Zanetti, we cannot do that with cuts. And Mr Kölmel, we probably cannot do that by lowering the commitments, because they are not taken out of the air, but are derived from the tasks that the European Union has to perform. With the other institutions concerned, we have a situation in which the European Parliament must increase its budget. This goes back to two special effects that have to do with the end of the legislature. For the first time, larger parts of our colleagues are retiring in accordance with the Members' Statute, and the European Parliament has to pay for it.

We all agree, for some time now, that after ten years of so-called austerity, we have finally had a Europe that is once again aiming for growth and aiming to invest in research, development, the environment, training and employment. It aims to invest in Europe. It aims to invest in its future. There are so many tools to achieve this. The Juncker plan, whose proposal we look forward to. Our rapporteur said that there is a revision of the multiannual financial framework and there is also the budget among these instruments. The budget can also be one of the instruments, as the Commission believes, as this Parliament believes. The question is whether the Council also believes in it. If the Council also believes that the budget can be an instrument for arriving at a new situation, a new condition and the conditions for taking a new direction are all there. There is a new Parliament, there is a new Commission that is about to take office, there is a european semester guide that is a vital guide. The question is – and therefore the question I am asking – whether this guide wants to put passion and courage into it, because growth, if one objective is shared, is because also through the budgetary instrument we can achieve this objective in which we all believe.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 657, "date": "2014-10-21.json", "name": "Christian EHLER", "mepid": "28226", "text": "  Question about the procedure of the \"blue card\".

The disadvantages are large, it reinforces the picture of overspending, although in fact spending has fallen since 2013. Moreover, the European Commission is, almost secretly, building up a debt, which should not be allowed. Accounts remain, putting investment in knowledge and research at risk. This is not a strengthening of the European economy, especially at a time of low growth and few jobs. It's a conflict with no winners. That is why I am pleased when the European Parliament takes a clear stand and reverses the cuts to heading 1A.

This increase in payment appropriations is still only a partial solution to the problem of the backlog of payments, which, as we have heard, is already over EUR 30 billion and eur 10 billion must even be paid out of hand. Secondly, I would strongly warn Parliament against supporting the Commission's decision to fund the fight against Ebola in 2015 from the crisis reserve created under the common agricultural policy. The Commission's decision to allocate nearly €450 million, or most of this reserve, to the fight against the virus is irresponsible if we are confident that Russian sanctions on EU food will also be maintained in 2015.

Last year, we, the European Parliament, accepted the reduction of the European Union's multiannual budget for the first time, although, perhaps more than ever, it needed to increase it, particularly in areas such as research, innovation, infrastructure investment, in order for Europe to become more competitive, to better cope with global competition. By accepting a reduction in the budget, we, Parliament, have taken into account the concerns of the net contributors. To these reductions, however, there is also the non-payment of the European Union's debts to those who have provided services to the European Union and rightly expect to be paid. This reduces the outlook for economic growth at Member State level. The Council's attitude is unacceptable and unjustified. The negative consequences for the real economy are significant. The council's breach of commitments has negative effects on the economic recovery at European Union level. Investment in infrastructure, research, innovation is the engine of economic recovery.

This outlined proposal, which we are likely to vote on tomorrow, corresponds to the dramatic payment situation, which has been very carefully outlined for Parliament's use in the presence of the Italian Presidency by Commissioner Dominic. This proposal also corresponds to the Council's conclusions, because the Council continues to look for measures that can finance growth and jobs, and indeed the European budget at this scale is a partial answer to the conundrum of how to finance growth and jobs in a context of fiscal consolidation, so it plays its part and is a way of leverage private capital on a wider scale.

First, we are faced with a growing deficit of the budget partly due to faster than planned implementation of many EU-financed projects, but also partly because of late payments by Member States. As a result, the Commission still has a lot of invoices unpaid from previous budgets. This is a dangerous situation which destabilises the investment process in Member States and critically undermines the credibility of the European Union. Therefore, I support Parliament’s call for Member States to respect fully their financial obligations with respect to the EU budget.  Second, the proposed reduction of payments appropriations in Heading 1A – Competitiveness for growth and jobs amounts to more than 1.3 billion. This means that almost two-thirds of all payments cuts suggested by the Council will negatively affect innovation, research and small and medium-sized enterprises, areas with the largest potential for growth and jobs.

It is not true that this letter consists of cuts of any kind to direct payments. The crisis reserve is established by law on an annual basis by simple application of financial discipline. This crisis reserve was created to solve crisis problems in agriculture and that is what is being proposed by the Commission: to apply the crisis reserve to the crisis situation. However, it does not have a direct impact on the level of direct payments for farmers. As you know, Heading 2 for agriculture is one of the biggest in the EU budget. It consists of almost EUR 45 billion. At the end of every budgetary year, calculations are done to see how much is left in additional revenues after fulfilling all the obligations to the farmers.  When you look at the history of this heading in the past there were savings in every annual budget – savings amounting to at least half a billion euro, sometimes even a billion. This money was usually used to top up any direct payments that were legally eligible. So this will also be the case in 2015.  What the Commission has proposed in the Amending Letter is simply to improve the liquidity of the EU budget due to the scarce resources for payments. The only impact it will have is that some headings will have additional payment appropriations available at the beginning of the year when they are most needed, but it does not create any additional restrictions to Heading 2. This Amending Letter does not change either the level of commitments under Heading 2 or the level of payments available under Heading 2.  So what many of you have indicated – that the Commissionʼs decision immediately reduces direct payments to farmers – is not true. You will see the result by the end of the year. We have produced the same type of Amending Letters every year in the past and it has never created such tensions. The same instruments were applied in every EU budget. The additional revenues that were indicated in Heading 2 were transferred to all other headings on an annual basis because farmers are not able to use more money and resources than they are eligible for. Heading 2 has the biggest margins of all headings. So we should not really concentrate too much on this situation. I can assure you that the Amending Letter does not create any reductions in direct payments for farmers and it does not have any direct influence on the level of direct payments that the farmers will have received by the end of the year. If I may make a few comments concerning the budget for 2015 as such. We have to remember that the EU annual budget is just an implementation of commitments taken previously in the MFF; so if someone is arguing about why we spend money, we spend money because that was what was promised by Member States. The Commission is simply asking, or first indicating in its draft budget, how much money we need for a particular year – taking into account the commitments that were made by Member States and taking into account the fact that 90% of the EU budget is spent in the Member States by the Member States – and not the Commission, as we have to remember. It is not the Commission that is trying to find new ways of spending money. Ninety per cent of the budget is decided by Member States. They have the projects to be financed and decided domestically. They launch the projects, they spend the money and they send the bills to the Commission to be refunded. So the Commission’s role is only to collect this information and then present to both arms of the budgetary authority how much money we need to fulfil their obligations or to refund money they have spent.  So this whole process of discussion now as to whether we should cut more or less is actually about whether we should fulfil our obligations or not, whether we want to pay our bills back or not. That is the whole debate we are having here now.

I have heard less, however, that they were concerned instead about the quality aspect and, when using it, about the impact that resources actually have on spending programmes; I fully agree with Commissioner Dominik that a very large part, the absolutely predominant part of this budget, is then spent through the Member States in the Member States, but that is precisely why the questions about the need to make efficiency as efficient as possible are questions that the Council is asking itself.  And I believe that Parliament should also include them more in its debate, together with the more purely quantitative part. I am absolutely convinced, as has been said several times, that this budgetary procedure should not be treated as usual, as usual; I am convinced of this, but this is true not only as far as the Council is concerned, it is also true as far as Parliament is concerned. And I do not believe that a proposal from Parliament, namely to increase commitments and payments significantly in relation to the Commission as well, goes in the direction of an innovative approach, it seems to me, if anything, to be a closer and more usual approach, at most the difference lies in quantity once again rather than in quality. Of course, when I say this, I am fully aware that the Council is also participating too flexibly, too slowly in relation to the positions of the 2014 amending budgets, to make the composition less simple at this early stage, on the understanding that it is precisely in conciliation – and here the approach that Parliament has proposed can only be shared – that we are going to treat all the matches together in an overall framework. What the Council did, however, in its proposal – even when it proposed reductions in relation to the Commission's proposal – was certainly not to proceed with linear cuts, on the contrary, a very careful operation was carried out which, among other things, was based on a fundamental premise and which seems to me to be extremely shared by all the institutions, namely the problem of backpaying. That is why, in the logic of calling for reductions in relation to the Commission's proposal, we have focused more on item 1A–Growth than on item 1B–Cohesion.  The reason for this was precisely that, at the heart of the problem of payments, a problem which mainly affects item 1B in a much broader way, and so, with a view to maximising the financial efficiency of the budget, the cuts have been proposed on payments mainly under item 1A, since they consist of many investment plans, many investment programmes and the , which in this first two years will lead to fewer occurrences of payment, certainly of commitment but less payment, than we already have in the past on item 1B. It is precisely there that we immediately saw a greater need for financial resources. However, I would like to end by reiterating my conviction that both the council's belated stance on the 2014 amending budgets and a quantitatively – as we have said in our opinion – which is not sustainable on the 2015 budget by Parliament will be able to find in conciliation the overall assessment that is required here, which we share and which we are convinced will ultimately lead us to find precisely a solution to the problem. , also for this year in the awareness of everyone that it is certainly a year in which things are a little more difficult than usual and it takes an extraordinary commitment.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 687, "date": "2014-10-21.json", "name": "Eider GARDIAZABAL RUBIAL", "mepid": "96991", "text": "  Rapporteur. - Madam President, I wanted to begin my last speech by thanking most of the political groups in this House for supporting the proposal which we are presenting here today as a European Parliament and which we will vote on tomorrow, and in particular to thank all the shadow rapporteurs of the political groups who have been very active in making this proposal a very majority proposal of the European Parliament. Mr Zanetti in his first speech said that our proposal was very difficult to defend, and the truth is that during the debate we had this afternoon, in which around sixty Members will have surgery, I believe that there have been two or three who have criticised Parliament's proposal and the rest have given the Council plenty of reasons to support our position. He also said that it was an unrealistic proposal, and it is clear that this is a matter of positions, but what seems unrealistic to us is that with 26 billion unpaid invoices on the table, the Council still cuts the Commission's proposal by 2 billion. We have put all the tools on the table; that is why we are asking for this increase of 6 billion euros in payments, because it is the maximum that the laws allow us, because our goal in this negotiation for 2015 is not to solve — because we do not have enough room to fix it - but at least to alleviate this crisis of unpaid bills that we have on the table and that we have been dragging since 2010.

However, I would also like to make a rather clear one – I would almost have said that I would make an announcement to the Council that some of the statements are simply not correct. Not only is this Parliament advocating simply more money, but this Parliament is advocating that we should perhaps also start the seven-year financial framework that we have just adopted and start the programmes accordingly, that cuts in innovation and research in particular are not the smartest, and that cuts in humanitarian aid at this stage may not necessarily be in line with the optimum level of prudence. Then I would also like to make it very clear that the European Parliament has long made an offer to the Council with regard to the agencies. We have offered that, in our view, we would also be prepared to discuss priorities of changes in the agencies together with the Council, to comply with the 5% reduction, but to redeploy staff and change tasks so that the agencies can carry out their tasks. Unfortunately, the Council is open to those who do not want to talk about it, because there seems to be no agreement anywhere. Parliament must not be accused of things that Parliament is not responsible for. And if it is not to be linear cuts that have been made, then frankly I do not understand the abatement rate at the European Court of Justice. Because if you know that the Court of Justice is using 99.5% of its staff, then a linear cut over all the other institutions in the abatement rate, especially at the ECJ and the European External Action Service, does not make much sense in view of their situation. We are not the ones who generally demand a great deal, but we are simply asking for compliance with what we actually agreed with each other a few months ago.

However, I cannot see any added value for the citizens of Europe in the work of the large number of agencies that would justify a further burden. Without any tangible added value, such agencies must be closed immediately. On the one hand, many of these agencies are meaningless, because their remit is already regulated by other European institutions, or because their activities relate to areas in which the European Union has no exclusive competence. However, there are also overlaps in the remit between the agencies.

The Council is aware of the concerns expressed by certain groups in Parliament on this matter. Although he did not discuss the matter in detail, there was no proposal to invoke a procedure involving the Council on this issue. Let me be clear on the general issues of this issue: fundamental rights are the cornerstone of European integration and the defining element of European democracy and our shared identity. If these values are part of the same raison d'er as the European Union and are the basis of our being together, all the European institutions and the Member States are called upon to work to ensure that full respect for fundamental rights and the rule of law are always guaranteed. I know that this House fully shares this view. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the fundamental rights of the Member States are enshrined in the constitutional traditions of the Member States, in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and in the European Convention on Human Rights, to which all the Member States of the European Union are party and to which the European Union itself will join in due course. All Member States must therefore ensure that national law, whether primary or secondary, respects EU law. Where there are doubts or doubts about this, it is primarily up to the Commission to deal with it and not to the Council. However, I can assure you that I will pay particular attention to what you have to say on this subject in the course of this debate. These considerations will certainly be useful to the Italian Presidency, which, just in these days and starting from the Commission communication of 11 March last, is considering the possibility of organising a debate in the Council on strengthening the rule of law in the Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "NI"}, {"id": 697, "date": "2014-10-21.json", "name": "Martine Reicherts", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "  Member of the Commission. Madam President, as guardian of the treaties, the Commission enforces EU law, including the Charter of Fundamental Rights, through infringement procedures, under the control of the Eu Court of Justice and, of course, in addition to the role of national courts working with the Eu Court of Justice to enforce charter rights in the Member States.  The Commission's role is not limited to ensuring the protection of fundamental rights in the application of EU law. The Commission has also made a political commitment to protect the union's values. To this end, in March 2014, it adopted its communication on a new European Union framework to strengthen the rule of law. Communication has the dual purpose of ensuring equal treatment between Member States and promoting political dialogue in the event of a threat to our common values. In the event of a systemic threat to the rule of law in a Member State, the Commission plans to engage in a political dialogue with it. This dialogue must be based on fair cooperation and allow solutions to be found before the situation worsens.  This process is in place to fill the gap that has existed until now between infringement procedures and the use of the mechanisms provided for in Article 7 of the Treaty. The framework for strengthening the rule of law will seek to ensure the proper functioning of all judicial and constitutional mechanisms and safeguards aimed at protecting democracy and fundamental rights in the Member States. If these guarantees are jeopardised, the Commission will not hesitate to take the necessary measures to ensure compliance with EU law and values. The Commission will act within its powers as conferred by the treaties. On the other hand, it will not hesitate, if necessary, to launch infringement proceedings for violation of European Union law and to provoke a political dialogue with the Member State whose national mechanisms to ensure the rule of law are seriously compromised, regardless of that Member State. The European Union framework for strengthening the rule of law applies to all Member States in the same way.  Our debate today, Madam President, is about the rule of law in Hungary. In recent weeks, there has been a disagreement between the Hungarian and Norwegian authorities on the issue of granting grants to certain NGOs. In view of the information available at this stage, the subject matter of this dispute does not appear to fall within the scope of EU law. Indeed, the management of EU funds is not directly affected in this dispute. Furthermore, we have no evidence at this stage that can demonstrate a dysfunction of national mechanisms aimed at protecting the rule of law, nor a dysfunction of the Hungarian judicial system. The NGOs concerned have the opportunity to appeal against the decisions that have been taken. However, the Commission has used all its political clout to encourage the parties to resolve this dispute and we are following this process carefully. Let me now return to Hungarian media legislation. In 2011, the Commission's services indicated that several provisions of the Act did not comply with the provisions of the Audiovisual Media Services Directive, the treatment of the functioning of the European Union and the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Following discussions initiated by the Commission, Hungary adopted amendments in 2011 and 2012 to correct the points highlighted. These amendments now ensure that Hungarian law complies with EU law. The compatibility of Hungary's new tax legislation on advertising revenue generated in the media with EU law is under review. The impact of this tax on freedom of expression and its compatibility with the freedom of establishment guaranteed by the treaties remains to be assessed. We are in the process of examining this situation and we are continuing the dialogue with the Hungarian authorities. Of course, if this review shows a breach of EU law, the dialogue already under way will have to lead to the establishment of new national provisions in Hungary. If this were not to be the case, the Commission will not, of course, hesitate to use its powers in the area of infringement procedure. I would also like to inform you of the conclusion of the case concerning the independence of the Hungarian national data protection authority. Following the Court's ruling of 8 April 2014, the Hungarian authorities acknowledged the violation of EU law and fully compensated the National Commissioner responsible for the authority, who has not indicated his intention to resume his duties. In these circumstances, the Commission closed the infringement procedure. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this evening's debate is an opportunity to remind ourselves that what makes us European is our commitment to this community of values, principles and rights enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights. The Commission, as the guardian of the treaties, has an obligation to ensure that they are respected, whether the Member States are small or large, founders or not.

It saddens me that today we are talking about Hungary again precisely because of these accusations. We are witnessing new events of concern and discomfort, let me mention only in the area of media freedom.  The taxation of the advertising revenues of large media adopted by the Hungarian Parliament poses a threat to independent journalism. The measure will hit the very popular foreign commercial television, which has often been critical of Orbano's government in its programme. Similarly, the authorities have strongly interfered with the functioning of a number of independent organisations, non-governmental. The worst blow was again experienced by those most critical of the authorities. I am not only talking about Hungary, but let me also mention the events in Slovenia. A journalist from a prominent journalist in my country has found herself being prosecuted for publishing allegedly classified information about the links of a far-right neo-Nazi group to an opposition party. Prosecutors accuse her of endangering national security, while the journalist acted in the public interest in her conduct. Her prosecution is intolerable.

In return, when I express my views, I do not want to be accused of being excessively ideological and attacking, or being part of a left-wing conspiracy, as I keep reading in the Hungarian media. Let us first make very clear that we are not talking about Hungary here tonight. We are talking about Europe – our European Union and our shared values. It is true that we have talked about the situation in Hungary before, but that is because the situation gives reason for concern. Is Hungary the only country where we have reason for concern? No, it is not, but it happens that in Hungary the problem is not just one law where Hungary or the Hungarian Government is not respecting the European treaties. The problem is that there is a whole set of laws which probably do not violate the treaties individually, but the overall impact is stifling. It causes a lot of pressure on pluralism and freedom of speech. We are talking about opposition political parties, the media, the judiciary, the education sector and civil society. The measures are never laws telling people that they cannot speak their minds, but they are fiscal measures, procurement rules and budgetary measures. I think that it is very important that we have this debate because this is as important for the future functioning of the European Union as the debate on the Stability Pact. I hope that the next Commission is going to be more active, more courageous and less legalistic, because this is about the future of the European Union that belongs to all of us.  Finally, to be fair, something was brought to our attention last weekend and that is the entry ban imposed by the United States against certain unnamed Hungarian Government officials.

Madam President, we are living in somewhat surreal moments here and the word is weak. What is happening in Hungary is one of them. He now wants to build an illiberal state. His models are China, Russia and Turkey, and he wants to break with the dogmas and ideologies of the West. Unfortunately, the facts accompany the words: NGOs are foreign-paid political agents, accused of \"spying for the benefit of the Vikings\", as Kehi, the government's supervisory office, says. At issue: NGOs fighting corruption, for LGBT, Roma and human rights in general, funded by a Norwegian fund for civil society, hence the \"Vikings\". In the crosshairs: NGOs such as Amnesty International and Transparency International. At the same time, the media and the judiciary continue to be put on the line. RTL Club, a subsidiary of a large Luxembourg company, finances 65% of the new media tax, while its audience does not exceed 15%. While the election results are there, the electoral law has been amended to better serve the interests of the majority party. Fidesz has been ubiquitous in the media and the OSCE - excuse me a little - says: \"The elections in Hungary are free but not democratic\". And what are the European institutions doing? Nothing. Mr Juncker proposed giving the portfolio of culture, education and youth to Tibor Navracsics, the minister who led the reforms challenged by the Council of Europe and our European Parliament.

I do not give an economic explanation, but i understand a state that does not emancipating the principle of freedom for the individual. I think Orban's on his way. I think the facts are clear: judges with early retirement, data protection regulator replaced, media muzzled, NGOs compromised. Then the European Commission can say 'they have turned some of it back', but those judges are not back in their duties, neither are those data protection supervisors, and those NGOs and the media are still under pressure. And then the Council can say 'this is not up to us, we have only discussed fundamental rights in generalities and the Commission has to solve it', but that is not how we get there. It is also a bit of a pity that we are talking to the old European Commission here tonight. I would like to discuss this with the new European Commission, with Frans Timmermans, the new Commissioner for Fundamental Rights who says 'I need to study again'.

The state in which human rights are found in Hungary is symptomatic of the blindness and hypocrisy in which the citizens of the European Union find themselves: a great union of markets and total disunity of rights, often even the most basic ones! The Hungarian Government has repeatedly mocked the recommendations on freedom of the press and the independence of the judiciary – and it is not the only one – given that, when it comes to freedom of the press, it has been followed freely by Italy, where, unfortunately, the level of free information is embarrassing to say the least, being managed by a couple of Freemasons who do as they please and decide who is good and who is bad. But that doesn't seem to interest anyone.  As an Italian and as a European, I am concerned about the way in which we endorse the attitude of the Orbán Government, which over the years has caused restrictions on political and civil liberties, seriously undermining respect for human rights within the Territory of the Union. What does the European Union intend to do? We make recommendations and then put our heads in the sand like ostriches?  He has been appointed Commissioner for Culture and Education, fundamental challenges for the future of Europe, Navracsis, a highly questionable figure who, in addition to denying common European values, has been the author of laws considered liberticidal. Today, to try to take off the mask that Delors was talking about in front of the Hungarian people would be a courageous gesture at last and would serve as a warning to the other countries.

You are attacking Viktor Orban, because he believes that the burden of the crisis must be borne not by the little people, but by the capital-strong companies. It imposed taxes on banks, financial transactions and the advertising market. Hungary was one of the first to come out of the crisis, with zero per cent inflation, four per cent economic growth and the fastest fall in unemployment. All this without hungary's one cent of debt being released, we did not ask for the free money of the taxpayers of another country.  You say that freedom of the press has been damaged, but you mean that the Hungarian state has uniformly taxed the advertising market, and the tv channel that has so far escaped the public burden with tricks has not escaped this. You say that the Hungarian Government is harassing civilians, but you mean that foundations that share your views can violate financial rules with impunity. You are saying that Viktor Orban does not respect human rights, but what is really wrong with him is that he is a Christian Democrat, not a liberal, which even the Communists are calling for here. There is a problem with freedoms in Europe. Several governments are considering how to prevent the union's fundamental freedom, the free movement of labour. This would really be worth a debate in the European Parliament.

And yet: the lack of independence of the judiciary and the media, insufficient rights for the parliamentary opposition, targeted incitement against minorities – we have been hearing all this for over four years. Viktor Orban has openly promoted this systematic infiltration of European values before the eyes of Europe. How can it be that, in the middle of Europe, a government is first putting the public media on the chain and is now trying, through high taxation, to force the remaining private media out of the country, that NGOs that promote the rights of civil society and receive money from Norway, a friendly state, suddenly become opponents of the system? We must finally recognise that the current curtailments of fundamental rights are not isolated isolated cases and draw conclusions from them. Technical infringement procedures aimed only at the transposition of individual directives cannot put an end to the systematic erosion of European fundamental values.

Recently, Orbán took his statements to a new level when he simply stated that the world's greatest political leaders, according to him, are Putin and Erdoğan. At the same time, he wanted to put down the concept of liberal democracy as a principle. It is clear that Hungary's disintegration is taking place in area after area. In this House, we have repeatedly adopted resolutions which have not yet been heard by the Council of Ministers, which have shown unimaginable cowardice in this. The Commission claims to follow developments, but while the rights of the citizens of Hungary are being violated, so far we have seen only words and very little action.

I am pleased we have a broad and firm understanding that Europe has to stand by Ukraine by granting the unilateral extension of the autonomous trade measures (ATMs). As we speak, Ukraine continues to struggle on all fronts at the same time. The ceasefire is not being respected; Ukraine is continuing to defend its territorial integrity against attacks from outside; it faces enormous economic and financial difficulties; and it has to undergo deep internal reforms. Europe has made a commitment to help Ukraine – and with today’s decision we will turn our words into deeds. This should help Ukraine to withstand the pressure from Russia, which is willing to obstruct the implementation of the Association Agreement between the EU and Ukraine and to interfere in our bilateral relations and sovereign decisions. There was a time in history when Europe abandoned one eastern European country: 75 years ago Poland was left on its own against aggressors, despite previous statements offering great support. We all know what happened later. What could have been stopped at Poland’s borders finally engulfed the whole world. Ukraine is today’s front, and strong statements and words of support are simply not enough. The extension of the Regulation is part of the EU commitment that was made at the same time as it was decided to postpone implementation of the deep and comprehensive free trade agreement (DCFTA) for 15 months – in the hope of peace. The Ukrainian side favours the ATMs and says that they have helped to increase Ukraine’s exports to the EU and, indeed, to compensate for the fall in exports to countries in the Customs Union. The ATMs provide a much-needed opportunity for Ukrainian producers and businesses to divert their exports away from the increasingly restrictive Russian market, and also an incentive to bringing their operations and standards more into line with those of the EU. I would note too that Member States have already supported the extension of the Regulation, so there is every chance of ensuring that it will remain in effect without any break. Taking into account the call from some colleagues for close monitoring of the implementation of the ATMs and for more reassurance on deadlines, I will urge the Commission to continue to monitor the effects closely. These ATMs have been in place since April 2014, with Parliament’s approval, and we know exactly what they mean in terms of entitlements. All the relevant calculations have been done. Moreover, as Parliament ratified the Association Agreement last month it was expected to come into full force immediately, meaning that the tariff agreement would have been in place since last month. Given the current situation, our timely decision will prove that the European Parliament can act swiftly and decisively. It will also be proof of our political will and recognition of our moral obligation: we are ready to help the Ukrainians and we are not leaving them alone. Colleagues, I count on your firm support for this decision.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 752, "date": "2014-10-21.json", "name": "Martine Reicherts", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "  Member of the Commission. - Madam President, honourable Members of the European Parliament, at Parliament’s plenary session of 16 September, Commissioner De Gucht explained in detail the content and context of the outcome of the trilateral consultations between Ukraine, Russia and the EU on 12 September. The Commission agreed, as part of the outcome, to propose to the Council to delay the provisional application of the trade title of the EU Association Agreement with Ukraine until 31 December 2015, and this in the event that Ukraine ratified the Association Agreement. The proposal by the Commission for such a delay was based on a clear request from Ukraine to take an initiative that would allow ratification of the Association Agreements to go ahead while leaving more time to discuss ways of addressing Russian concerns arising from the implementation of the DCFTA. This outcome must be seen in the bigger political context. It is part and parcel of a comprehensive peace process in Ukraine and secures a commitment from Russia to maintain its preferential trade regime with Ukraine. Four days later, on 16 September, Ukraine went ahead with the ratification of the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement, which was endorsed simultaneously by the European Parliament here in Strasbourg giving its consent. Many of you, honourable Members, expressed satisfaction when the Association Agreement was ratified. It was truly historic, as it was the first time in the EU’s history that such a simultaneous vote had taken place. As part of the 12 September outcome, the Commission also agreed to submit a proposal to extend, until the end of 2015, the autonomous trade preferences currently granted to Ukraine, as they will otherwise cease to apply as of 1 November. Let me recall the basic elements of these autonomous trade preferences. The unilateral market access granted to Ukraine corresponds to the first year of application of the schedule of concessions negotiated under the DCFTA. The current proposal simply extends the duration of those autonomous preferences by 15 additional months, thus maintaining the same preferences. Suspended duties would present an amount of up to nearly EUR 500 million. Preferences are granted to Ukraine subject to its effective cooperation in customs matters and require Ukraine not to change in any way its tariffs towards the EU. In addition, safeguard controls are in place to prevent market-distorting surges impacting adversely on European companies and industry, including the agriculture sector. EU phytosanitary rules remain fully applicable to Ukrainian products. In order to address concerns expressed by Parliament, the extension of the autonomous trade preferences is subject to Ukraine’s respect for the essential elements of the Association Agreement. Most importantly from an economic point of view, the autonomous trade preferences have a very limited impact on the EU markets, and yet at the same time they represent a gesture of tangible economic and political support to Ukraine in a difficult situation, helping to address Ukraine’s difficult economic, political, security and territorial challenges. I would like to thank Parliament for the efforts already made to pave the way for a swift conclusion of the legislative procedure for this file in order to ensure that trade flows are not disrupted. Parliament is therefore asked to endorse the Commission’s proposal so that these important preferences for Ukraine continue to apply after 1 November.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 753, "date": "2014-10-21.json", "name": "Salvatore CICU", "mepid": "124854", "text": "  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, i.e. the european Union, we must not Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I think it was important that we had the opportunity to have a debate in Parliament on such an important issue.

The proposal today, therefore, is not for new measures but for an extension of existing measures, and that is why my Group has been able to support an accelerated procedure and why we will not support any amendments to this text. If we do not approve this on Thursday, there will be a gap in preferences when the current trade regime with Ukraine expires at the beginning of November.

At their root is the choice of the Ukrainians to seek stronger ties with the EU. Choosing rules-based trade and a movement towards an open society will require difficult reforms. The deep and comprehensive trade agreement which is part of the Association Agreement is set to enter into force on 1 January 2016. Meanwhile, preferential trade measures were already adopted in April 2014 as part of the support package for Ukraine. Since their implementation, trade between the EU and Ukraine has increased drastically. Ukrainian exports to the EU increased by 25 % in May and June of this year compared to the same period last year and during the first six months of 2014 exports from Ukraine to Russia fell by 24 %.  These figures show the importance of the autonomous trade measures for the Ukrainian economy. Not extending them would not only seem a political statement but would have a very real economic impact on the country and its people. Given the economic asymmetry between the EU and Ukraine, the increase in exports from Ukraine is economically important for the country but it has relatively little effect on us in the EU. In principle, the autonomous trade measures do not allow illegal products onto the European market. All products must conform to EU standards, but the increase in trade may make it harder to control them. However this should not lead to products coming onto the European market which would otherwise be illegal and which could harm European producers. The regulation before us prolongs the autonomous trade measures and amends the existing regulation to make access by Ukraine to the preferential conditions conditional upon respect for democratic principles, human rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as respect for the rule of law. This is also mentioned in the Association Agreement. It is now important that these conditions are met and that the timeframe is kept.

We must continue to support ukraine's economy, help it to grow from the inside and ensure its stability. We need to send a clear signal to the Ukrainian people, including to business, that we are supporting the Ukrainian economy and its integration into the processes of the European Union.

On this occasion, however, the timeliness of the initiative to avoid a regulatory vacuum with regard to the removal of customs duties for imports from Ukraine must be viewed positively. Firstly, because we believe that trade policy interests must be consistent with those of foreign policy and that at this stage we must send out a strong signal to a people in difficulty. Let us hope that in the not too distant future the Ukrainian people will be able to identify with the founding values of our Union. Decisions such as these show that we can and must have the courage to put common interests before those of the individual. It is clear that there is a problem with an emergency procedure and that this may indeed be a matter of concern, but – in balancing with the damage that would have occurred if there had not been an extension – the assessment of proceeding in any case prevailed.  This is the best way, in our view, to give Ukrainian producers the opportunity to divert their trade to the European market, giving them the opportunity to survive and at the same time encouraging them to adapt to Eu ropean standards. In addition, we think it is a good thing that Article 2 is included, which reaffirms the obligatory respect for fundamental freedoms, the inviolability of borders and the fight against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. It is important to stress that autonomous trade measures are not an indiscriminate opening up of the Community market to Ukrainian products competing with Community production, since in the agricultural and agro-industrial sectors the levels of protection remain higher than in other sectors, with quotas and minimum prices that do not distort the competitiveness of local products. In short, we hope that this extension can be perceived as an act of goodwill on the part of the European Union and a stimulus to bring the crisis to a conclusion as soon as possible and certainly not as a way of wasting time, let alone a custom, and we also hope that the real trade treaty will enter into force by 1 January 2016 at the latest.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 761, "date": "2014-10-21.json", "name": "Kaja KALLAS", "mepid": "124697", "text": "   Madam President, we all know that the Ukrainian conflict has resulted not only in more than 3 600 military and civilian casualties but also in major economic costs.

Ukrainian exports to the EU increased by 25 % in the first half of 2014 and will keep increasing if we open our market while Ukraine respects our sanitary and phytosanitary standards.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 772, "date": "2014-10-21.json", "name": "Anja HAZEKAMP", "mepid": "125023", "text": "  Written. – Today we are debating the abolition of customs duties on Ukrainian goods. Or for fullness: the proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EU) No 374/2014 for the reduction or abolition of customs duties on goods originating in Ukraine. We all know that the intensification of trade relations with Ukraine - and thus the increase in European influence on Ukraine - can have major geopolitical consequences. So I will not go into that now. However, I see another problem: battery cages are banned in the EU and battery eggs are not allowed to be sold, while Ukraine simply allows those unfriendly battery cages. And what turns out? This proposal simply allows animal products from Ukraine, regardless of the living conditions of the animals. How can the EU state with dry eyes that it will put an end to dieron-friendly production methods if we simply allow these products through the back door? Thanks to the European Commission, which has already authorised a large Ukrainian egg producer to export to Europe, there will soon be battery eggs in our shops. I find that incomprehensible! I believe that international security, human rights, democracy and respectful treatment of animals are more important than short-sighted trade policy. That is why I will vote against this report.", "language": "en", "original_language": "nl", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "GUE/NGL", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}]
