It will be dedicated to migration and economic issues and yes, of course, I will also refer to the outcome of Monday’s meeting of EU Heads of State or Government with Turkey. First, on migration: in our relentless efforts to stem the flows, Monday’s meeting was an important one. Progress has been made. We will continue to further a European solution to the crisis and this is – and will continue to be – crucial, as underlined by President Tusk in his latest address in this Chamber, since the only way forward is a comprehensive European plan.  First of all let me outline the outcome of discussions with the Turkish Prime Minister. Monday’s meeting was a timely opportunity to look at where we stand on the EU—Turkey agenda and assess the progress made so far. Our view was clear. Progress is being made in the implementation of the joint action plan but, if we are to put an end to the flow of migrants, both moves are needed: to close down people smuggling routes and to break the business model of the smugglers. In that context, the additional proposals put forward by Turkey are a welcome move.  We agreed to work on the basis of a number of principles: first, the return of all new irregular migrants crossing from Turkey into the Greek islands; second, the acceleration of the implementation of the visa liberalisation roadmap; third, the speeding up of the disbursement of the EUR 3 billion and additional funding for the refugee facility for Syrians; fourth, the preparation for the opening of new chapters in the accession negotiations; five, the possibility of establishing in Syria areas which will be safer; and finally, sixth, to resettle Syrian refugees on a one-for-one basis.  Clearly more work is needed with Turkey on the details of their proposals and President Tusk will ensure that this work is taken forward before the European Council meeting on 17 and 18 March. If Turkey delivers on a commitment to take back 100% of the migrants arriving on Greek shores we really have a chance to break the business model of the smugglers and to end the human tragedy that is taking place in the Aegean Sea. We would be able to replace the current pattern of uncontrolled irregular migration with a controlled mechanism of humanitarian resettlement.  I have to stress that it is still way too early to declare success. As always in these issues, everything will be depend on implementation, but if at the next European Council we can conclude the agreement with Turkey along these lines, it would signify a possible breakthrough.  Clearly this is just one element of our common strategy. Beyond plans with Turkey, our cooperation with third countries is key – and will continue to be key – to stem the flow of migrants attempting the perilous journey to Europe.  Obviously, strengthening the protection of our external borders remains a priority as well and work in the Council on the proposal for a European border and coastguard is progressing fast. I know that in this House you have started discussing the proposal in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) and we look forward to a fruitful cooperation with you to make sure that the new system is operational as soon as possible. As you are aware, the European Council has called for a political agreement between our two institutions by the end of June. Yesterday I had the opportunity to speak with your rapporteur, Mr Pabriks, and I sense a true willingness on both sides to reach this objective.  Let me now turn to the situation along the Western Balkan route. In February the European Council agreed to gradually get back to a situation where all members of the Schengen Area apply fully the Schengen border code. The flows along the Western Balkans route have now come to an end. The practice of wave-through is no longer applied. Yes, restoring Schengen is essential but it will be difficult. It has consequences on the ground which require rapid action.  First, if we are to avoid a humanitarian crisis, we need to make sure we rapidly provide assistance to those affected, especially in Greece. Following the call of the February European Council, last week the Commission put forward a proposal on emergency support within the EU and we welcome this initiative. Work on the proposal has already started and we are doing all we can to ensure its adoption before the March European Council.  As you know, this will also require Parliament and the Council to adopt an amending budget for 2016 in order to create the budget line needed and yes, we stand ready to work with you to ensure that Greece gets the financial support it deserves in a spirit of true European solidarity.  Secondly, we need to act in a coordinated way to restore the proper functioning of the Schengen Area. The Commission Communication ‘Back to Schengen’ that you discussed yesterday identifies the steps that need to be taken to achieve this objective. It is an important contribution to guide our actions in the months ahead.  Things are moving fast. I think it is clear to all of us that the situation requires us to act rapidly and to act jointly. The March European Council will have a comprehensive debate on all these aspects in order to set orientations for the months to come. In other words, all these developments are getting our full attention.  At the same time we cannot lose sight of other challenges the European Union is currently facing. The March European Council will therefore also address jobs, growth and competitiveness. As usual in spring, the European Council will discuss the economic situation and there are positive signals. Europe is experiencing a recovery. Unemployment, although still at a historically high level, has been falling. We are slowly emerging from the crisis but nothing can be taken for granted. In many ways the recovery is still fragile and we must not ease up but strengthen our efforts.  The Annual Growth Survey launched the 2016 European Semester and the implementation of the country—specific recommendations is at the heart of the European Semester. Therefore the Presidency has put particular emphasis on their implementation in several Council conclusions. The joint debate that we had at the mini-plenary in Brussels two weeks ago was a useful contribution.  The European Council will provide guidance on the economic and social priorities which should guide our efforts this year. When we talk about growth, jobs and innovation clearly the internal market is our most important asset to deliver lasting economic benefit. We are happy that currently much work is being done with regard to the single market strategy and that concrete proposals under the digital single market strategy are now being discussed. Clearly at this very moment a large part of its potential remains untapped.  In this light our Presidency is pleased that the European Council will mark the importance of the internal market with a view to further boosting delivery of its agenda and full implementation and enforcement of the existing acquis. We hope that the June European Council will provide an opportunity to discuss this issue.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Liberals and centrists"}, {"id": 2, "date": "2016-03-09.json", "name": "Valdis DOMBROVSKIS", "mepid": "28618", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission. – Mr President, today I am speaking on behalf of President Juncker, so allow me to underline a message that he has conveyed many times to this House: ours is a political Commission that delivers a political response to the major challenges of our time. Nowhere is this more true than in our vision for the European economy. Just as the euro represents a political project that requires political governance and democratic accountability, so our economic strategy demands a political debate at all levels, European and national. In the end, we will be measured by our ability to improve the prospects of our people, today and tomorrow. This is why the European Semester is not a technocratic exercise but a political process, shaped by dialogue and debate. This is why this Parliament and our national parliaments play a central role. Not only do you strengthen our legitimacy; you also hold the policymakers to account. This year’s European Semester takes place in a complex global environment. As our Winter Economic Forecast observes: ‘While growth is continuing at a moderate rate in Europe, significant parts of the world economy are grappling with major challenges.’ These challenges include a slowing down of the emerging economies, including China, geopolitical tensions in our neighbourhood and volatility in global markets. 2016 will be the fourth year of recovery for the European Union as a whole, and we expect a growth of 1.9%. Confidence is returning, and the euro area is no longer a bad pupil in the class. Employment has risen to its highest level since 2008. Yet these signs of progress are not enough. Twenty-two million Europeans are still without work, and 4.5 million of these are below the age of 25. When this Commission took office, we put in place a clear strategy to deliver growth and jobs – a virtuous triangle of investment, structural reforms and responsible fiscal policy. This strategy drives everything we do, and it has social fairness at its core. When it comes to responsible public finances, average budget deficits in both the euro area and the EU as a whole are clearly going down. In the euro area we expect a budget deficit going down from an average 2.2% of GDP last year to 1.9% this year.  Cleaning up our public finances and reducing national debt are essential. Not only for ourselves – as the markets remind us – but also for future generations. Today, for the first time in years, our levels of debt have begun to fall. Let us continue the good work. Structural reforms are in the hands of our Member States. Our latest country reports send a clear message: those with the courage to reform make progress. They show that we now have a window of opportunity to modernise our economies. When this Commission took office, our first major initiative was to respond urgently to one of the greatest weaknesses of the European economy: a lack of investment. With the help of this Parliament we launched a major offensive to boost investment across the European Union. Today we see the first results and they speak for themselves. In its first six months, the European Fund for Strategic Investment has already mobilised more than EUR 60 billion of investment in 22 of our Member States. Around 80% of this new finance takes the form of new private capital – exactly what we wanted to achieve. In short, we are making progress, but this is precisely the moment to redouble our efforts and continue what we have started. Now is the time, as the recovery takes hold, for Member States to act. This brings me to the European Semester – and a political process that this Parliament is shaping. The Semester helps us to identify new risks, increase stability and encourage the reforms that deliver growth. By focusing on its most urgent priorities, each Member State strengthens the European Union as a whole.  Last month we published our latest country reports. These reports are vital to the quality of our policymaking. Each one analyses the economic and social developments in our Member States. Each one ensures that the national programmes are properly debated and prepared. This year’s reports paint a varied picture. Overall, our Member States are tackling their imbalances. They are making progress with the country-specific recommendations we issued last year, although that progress varies from country to country. As a whole, these efforts will strengthen the European recovery and help our economies to converge. Yesterday, we discussed the winter package of the European Semester and we finalised the decisions under the Macroeconomic Imbalances Procedure. The main conclusion is that there are now fewer Member States with macroeconomic imbalances than last year. This is encouraging, because it means that we are making progress in reforming our economies, and that the conditions for renewed convergence are gradually being restored. Of the 18 countries examined in depth, six were found to have no imbalances, seven show signs of imbalances, and five are experiencing excessive imbalances. The situation differs across countries but, in general, the main reasons for concern are the persistence of very high levels of indebtedness – be it public, private or external – vulnerabilities in the financial sector or deteriorating competitiveness. A clear reversal of these trends requires a decisive policy response.  High debt levels are a drag on growth and make the economies vulnerable to shocks. They need to be brought down. This is also crucial to keep up structural reform efforts to address long-standing weaknesses. It is not always easy, as reforms have political costs. But this is the only way to unlock the growth potential of our economies, make them more competitive, create more jobs and reverse the deterioration in social conditions. But overall, the system of closer monitoring and stronger coordination is bearing fruit, which should convince us to go further in our efforts. We will now take this assessment into discussions with Member States this month and next.  The Semester is still in its early years, but we have already made changes that make it more effective, more transparent and more accountable. There are changes big and small that will make a difference, from a new focus on employment and social performance to a streamlining of the process as a whole. But more than anything we have created time and space for dialogue, and focused on the urgent priorities that will deliver growth. By publishing our country reports earlier, we now have a more open and substantial discussion. Our country-specific recommendations are more targeted. We focus on a limited number of priorities that require the government’s attention in the coming 12 to 18 months. And we published the recommendation for the euro area at the start of the Semester. This keeps our eye on the bigger picture, and helps us to develop a common understanding of the challenges we face together and the policies that will serve us all.  The European Semester is the lifeblood of our economic governance. Its credibility depends not only on the quality of our analysis and judgment, but also on the transparency and accountability of the process. That is why we improve the Semester at every opportunity. We have made changes that ensure a truly political debate at all levels. We have built bridges between all the actors, starting with this Parliament. This is how we build ownership and partnership. This is how we strengthen the legitimacy of economic governance. But above all, this is how we ensure that our economic strategy delivers the growth and jobs that our people want. Let me conclude with a few words about the meeting of EU Heads of State and Government with Turkey, which took place on Monday this week. As you have seen, both sides agreed a number of steps that will significantly limit the flow of irregular migrants to the EU. An agreement in principle was found with Prime Minister Davutoğlu that Turkey will readmit quickly all irregular migrants who do not qualify for international protection, and who arrive in Greece. Turkey will thus anticipate the entry into force of the EU-Turkey readmission agreement. It was also agreed that Turkey will readmit Syrian nationals returned from the Greek islands under the logic that they can apply for asylum in Turkey and on the understanding that for every Syrian readmitted, one will be resettled to the EU directly from Turkey. As President Juncker has said, this is a ‘game-changer’. The new plan will help us to break the business model of smugglers who exploit human misery. There will no longer be an incentive for Syrians to pay criminals to smuggle them across the Aegean. It will make clear that the only viable way to come to Europe is through legal channels. Meanwhile, to ensure that Syrian refugees can benefit from decent conditions in Turkey, the newly created Facility for Refugees in Turkey is already starting to finance the first projects. The initial EUR 3 billion put into the Fund could also need to be supplemented after 2018. Regarding the proposal to liberalise the EU’s visa regime with Turkey, let me underline what President Juncker has said. The Commission will ensure that Turkey fully respects its commitments and upholds the standards we have agreed. The same principle applies to the opening of new chapters in Turkey’s accession negotiations. Details of Monday’s deal will need to be worked out in time for the next European Council on 17-18 March. European Union leaders also welcomed the Commission’s new roadmap which will restore Schengen to its proper functioning by the end of this year. This means strengthening our external borders, putting an end to the so-called ‘wave-through’ approach, and coordinating all temporary border controls at European level. As EU leaders recognised on Monday, this roadmap requires more support for our frontline Member States, starting with Greece. Last week, the Commission adopted proposals for a new Emergency Assistance instrument, whose first priority will be to relieve the situation in Greece. EU leaders called on the Council to adopt the new scheme before next week’s March European Council. Parliament, as an arm of the budgetary authority, will play a central role in filling this proposal with life. That is why the Commission will urgently propose an amending budget for 2016 to create the budget line for the instrument. The estimated needs for 2016 are EUR 300 million with a further EUR 200 million each year for use in 2017 and 2018, respectively. Funding would therefore not be diverted from existing external humanitarian aid programmes outside the EU. The Commission is working in order to ensure a strong and coordinated European response and we count on this Parliament to help us in making it so.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE-DE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "PPE-DE"}, {"id": 3, "date": "2016-03-09.json", "name": "Manfred WEBER", "mepid": "28229", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Mr President, Mr Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his work and for the work she has It is good that we have a minister here with us. I would be interested to know what it is like when you sit in front – you get coffee served, and you can talk as long as you want. I think that's a good place up there that you have. But we can talk about this afterwards and compare our places. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report, which First of all, on the part of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I would like to say that it is good that we had the summit last Monday and that, for the first time, a concrete and comprehensive solution is in sight, that we are talking to each other, that Europe, together with Turkey, is on the way to finding a common solution, because only that is a sustainable solution. Putting the smugglers through, stopping the wave- and stopping illegal migration from Turkey to Greece – all these are the right answers. I would also like to make it very clear that it is important that we now support Greece. We cannot accept the pictures that have come from Idomeni in the last few days. We must try to help the people on the ground. That is the first point: positive that we had the summit, and positive that a result has been come out. I would like to make it clear that when we talk about Turkey, we want to express respect first. Turkey has taken in 2.5 million people in recent years, providing nine billion of its own money to help Syrian refugees on its own territory. And we Europeans must admit that we have looked away for too long, that we have not been too busy with this development and that we must now become all the more active. These are the two points to be addressed. Nevertheless, we must make one thing clear: the partnership with Turkey is about partnership; it is not a question of dependence on Turkey. When we talk about Turkey, it is not acceptable that in future Turkey should continue to put pressure on Europe on the question of how many refugees it is letting into Europe or not letting them in. It is not acceptable for Morocco to say in the future: well, if we open our borders to Spain in the future, then perhaps we can negotiate the same conditions as Turkey for us. It is about partnership, not dependency. That is why it must be clear to us that Europe must first of all be able to secure its own borders, and that also means applying technical measures, including building border fences when it is necessary to secure Europe's borders accordingly. The second thing that is clear is that when we talk about Europe's self-confidence, we then look very critically at it when it comes to visa exemption. The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is ready to talk constructively about the visa issues. But I do not want to hide the fact that there are many concerns about this visa liberalisation. Turkey must first comply with all standards. In particular, when I imagine that a data protection law has only recently been agreed in Turkey, which in turn has not made it possible to have an independent data protection authority, it shows that the ball is not with us, but the ball is mainly in Ankara if we want to meet the deadlines. I would like to make it clear that, from our point of view, there is no blank cheque, and I would like to make it clear that the European Council should also be somewhat reluctant to legislate for detail. The question of how we are doing visa liberalisation is the responsibility of the interior ministers and the European Parliament, not the European Council. Fourthly, when we talk about partnership and not about dependency, it must also be clear that the financial resources we are now providing are actually where we want it to be. I strongly support Johannes Hahn in considering that we are really investing the money on the ground in the camps on a project-by-project basis and not transferring it directly to the Turkish Government. Partnership, but not dependence on Turkey – that is the message that is important to us as the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. I would like to say one final thought: we must separate matters. The migration issue is a common task that we want to solve. But the enlargement of the European Union, Turkey's full membership, is a completely different issue. These are two separate issues. My group is very sceptical about membership, so there is no doubt about it. We believe that Turkey's full membership is not positive for both sides. Nevertheless, we must make it clear to Turkey that if it wants a partnership with us, it must not move further away from Europe. The Attacks on the media in recent days are unacceptable! Zaman, the newspaper under surveillance and supervision by the Turkish authorities, belonged to the opposition and, on the first day after being placed under state supervision by the state, published a front page with a large photo of Erdogan on it. In other words, the turnaround in putting these media under government supervision is obvious. And that is why you are appealing and asking the President of Turkey to show the partnership with Europe. Therefore, please stop attacking the media, stop building an autocratic state in Turkey! Please do not lead Turkey further away from Europe! Finally, a brief reference to the actual subject to be discussed next week, namely the question of semesters and the euro, which Valdis Dombrovskis raised. This should actually be the focus of the European Council's planning. We believe that Europe is on the right track because we have pushed through reforms. In the EPP-governed countries in particular, we are doing well, with falling unemployment rates, less new debt and growth. We ask the European Council not to leave this course during the discussions. In all the countries where we are on the right track, this course has been taken. Let us continue along this common path: self-confidence and not dependence!", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 4, "date": "2016-03-09.json", "name": "Gianni PITTELLA", "mepid": "4436", "text": "  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome Mr Jeanine. I would have liked to comment on the agreement, but the agreement is not yet there. And this is the sign, let me tell you, of a Europe of governments that can no longer decide. In order to save Europe and, above all, the thousands of Syrians fleeing war, the agreement with Turkey is a necessary step, provided that all ambiguity is avoided.  Those people – I am thinking in particular of girls and boys – are men and women, not numbers, not commodities. I say this clearly: this agreement cannot be bartering or haggling on the skin of refugees, on human rights, on freedom of the press and freedom of expression; we are not negotiating and the closure of the Zaman newspaper, the treatment of the European Parliament's rapporteur, Kati Piri, are all facts that President Schulz was right to condemn at the summit. The attitude towards the Kurdish minority is a negative sign of the negotiations.  We must also keep the plans separate and not confuse the dialogue on the refugee crisis and Turkey's accession negotiations, as well as visa liberalisation, and turkey must first do the things it needs to do in order to allow the European Commission to make a proposal that Parliament will examine and then decide on. It is right that the Eu ropean Union should make financial efforts to support Syrian refugees by funding NGOs for project management and not the Syrian authorities. But this is not a blank cheque: we need sincere cooperation which, with full respect for human rights and international law, in particular the Geneva Convention, will allow a dignified solution for migrants and refugees.  And I cannot forget Greece, which is in danger of becoming a cage for refugees, a gateway with no exit doors. The Greek people and authorities must be supported by concrete actions, by humanitarian aid, as the European Commission is doing, and by the relocation of tens of thousands of refugees to the other Member States, as has already been decided. When the first relocation of refugees from Greece begins, all clandestine routes, not only those in Macedonia but also those passing through Albania and Bulgaria, will have to be closed.  And then there is the root of the problem: Syria, which is now europe's periphery. What is happening there has a huge impact in our countries. It is therefore good to cease fire in Syria. Work is now being done on a political agreement with a leading Europe with Federica Mogherini.  The refugee challenge is first and foremost a European challenge. However, we must look to the Mediterranean and Africa if we are not to live in an eternal and painful emergency. Whether it is Turkey, Russia or any other country, we are against the relocation of European problems to other countries. It is not the others who have to solve our problems. It is time for the Member States to assume their responsibilities through binding decisions.  We do not expect others to do what we have to do.

Finally, a European leader was trying to break the link between getting on a boat and bypassing legal migration channels, because stemming the flow of irregular migrants will allow our countries to focus on helping the refugees who need and deserve our help directly from the conflict zones. But let us be clear: our enemies are not the refugees who are fleeing from war, conflict and persecution. Our enemies are not the irregular migrants who come from safer countries and who may use the conflict to understandably seek a better life in our countries. Our enemies are the people traffickers who prey on innocent and desperate people, who care little for the lives of their human cargo and who deserve to be taken out of action. So, on Monday, EU leaders agreed the outline of an agreement with the Turkish Government and I hoped, like Gianni, to be standing here today welcoming a deal, but instead I have to admit I have a number of reservations and questions. Firstly the process: yet again we see one or two leaders going off to negotiate with Turkey on behalf of the EU without really consulting the other countries. Secondly, I struggle to see how much of this is either legal or practical. Even in desperate times, should we just tear up our own rules and international conventions? Thirdly, I am very concerned that we are replacing one series of pressures from economic migration with another by granting Turkey visa liberalisation in a matter of weeks, without thinking through the implications. Fourthly, how will the EUR 6 billion be delivered? Will it be tied to clear targets that must be met? Or otherwise would we not be better off and safer spending that vast sum of money here on reception, processing and returns? Turkey itself is testing the EU. Those of us who believe in freedom of the press should be concerned about the actions of the Turkish government against the Zaman newspaper. But if we are to work with Turkey on migration as friends then, as friends, we should also be honest with them about whether EU membership is realistic, and with our concerns over freedoms in their country. Whatever our views, we must all realise that we will not begin to control this crisis until we all realise there is no one silver bullet to solve this crisis. We made that mistake last year with the relocation scheme. Let us not make that same mistake again. While we may not be able to stop the flows altogether, we can show that our borders are not a free-for-all. In the short term, we can work on finalising readmission agreements and speeding up returns; we can fingerprint upon arrival and find resources to speed up the processing of applications; we can put NATO ships in the Aegean to target the traffickers. In the long run, we can talk about reform of Dublin, but should we really be reinventing Dublin in the midst of a crisis? Or should we find a way of making a system we have work effectively and helping those facing the greatest pressures? Dublin has failed because countries stopped implementing it. Yes, Greece does have a significant humanitarian crisis, but EU politicians would be making a huge mistake to try to launch a hostile takeover of Greece under Article 78 of the Treaty, as I see some politicians are proposing. Guy, I see you looking at me. I imagine you are going to attack me again this week. The number of times you mention Mr Kamall in your speeches really is flattering. I just hope for your partner’s sake you do not mention my name in your sleep. But on an issue as important as this, I ask you and others here today not to seek to score cheap political points but to agree how all of us can work together to find effective answers – not undeliverable silver bullets, not initiatives designed purely to grab the headlines, but practical solutions to save lives and help refugees. Because we owe it to our citizens and the refugees that desperately need our help, to stem the flow of those who are not refugees, to help frontline states take responsibility and to provide a refuge for those genuinely fleeing for their lives.

I do not deny that we need practical and technical arrangements with Turkey as part of a global approach, but this is not a practical or technical arrangement. It is a deal with Turkey in which we outsource our problems. It is a deal in which we are, in fact, giving the entrance keys to the gates of Europe into the hands of Turkey, to the successors of the Ottoman Empire, to Erdoğan – should even say maybe to Sultan Erdoğan. He shall now decide on the entrance into the European Union.  Because what is the deal in fact? The deal is that we are blocking, collectively, entrance to the European Union for Syrians and for other people, and it is Turkey which shall decide, on an individual basis, who is a refugee who can enter, in a trade-off, one to one. Some Syrians will maybe enter but, for example, Afghanis who are fleeing from IS in Afghanistan, may not. A Kurd who wants to leave Iraq or maybe another country shall certainly not be allowed to enter under that scheme. I have to tell you I am on the same side as Mr Kamall for once. I find this deal hugely problematic because it is a type of collective refoulement and, in my eyes, this is forbidden by the Geneva Convention.  Moreover, you have to know, dear colleagues, that Turkey is a very poor member of the Geneva Convention. It has ratified a number of protocols. One example is that Turkey does not give political asylum to Syrians; it only gives political asylum to refugees from countries belonging to the Council of Europe. Secondly, it does not give asylum, for example, to victims of internal civil conflicts, such as the conflict raging for the moment in the south—east of Turkey. So I think it is hugely problematic to ask a country which has not fully accepted all the protocols of the Geneva Convention to do the business. It is like the Americans saying to the Mexicans, you manage the borders in the future. That is what we are doing. I think it is hugely problematic.  Secondly, while I understand the reasoning – which Mr Dombrovskis and Mrs Plasschaert  repeated this morning – that this is the way to stop the smugglers and the only way to stop human trafficking, I am absolutely not of that opinion. I think the opposite will happen. By reducing the entrance points to the European Union in such a narrow way as we are doing now, by giving only Turkey the possibility on an individual basis to grant entry to the European Union, desperate refugees are going to look to alternative routes and in a few weeks we will have again a debate in this Parliament about the revival of the Lampedusa route. We are going to have a debate about a new route in Albania, a new route via Malta, a new route in Bulgaria and it will not solve the problem because the problem cannot be solved by others, by third countries, but it has to be solved by us, the European Union. That is what we lack at the moment.  My plea to you, Mr Dombrovskis and Mrs Plasschaert, is to now do what is necessary on the next count. First, take a decision on the European border and coast guard. It is fantastic that you tell us we are making progress, but we have been making progress for months. Why not use Article 78, paragraph 3 of the Treaty? Article 78 gives you the possibility to take emergency measures in case of an influx into the European Union of refugees and of migrants, but you are not doing it. You do not need legislation from this Parliament and the Council. You can do it based on the actual Treaty. Do it. Start with this border guards on the border with Greece and Turkey. Secondly, as for the EUR 3 billion, how many times are we going to decide on the EUR 3 billion? Can the Member States perhaps pay the EUR 3 billion for once and pay it not through the Turkish authorities, not through Turkey’s NGOs, but directly in the camps to the refugees so that they no longer have to live with USD 7 per month. That is the reason they come to us, because they have to survive with USD 7 a month. We have to put this EUR 3 billion into direct financial aid to the refugees.  Finally, what we also need to do is to strengthen our asylum system, and change the Dublin system. You know what we are doing, in fact? We are not changing the Dublin system now. No. We have put Turkey inside the Dublin system. That is what we have decided, instead of changing the Dublin system definitely and making a fair share between the Member States of the European Union.  So, in the beginning I was of the opinion that maybe this deal could help, but the more I look at it, the more I am critical of it, and the more sceptical I am. I have one plea to Mrs Plasschaert: ask Mr Tusk to redo and remake his copy and to go for real European action.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report and for the way in which What a shabby picture we, as the EU, are giving at the moment! On Monday, the representatives, the heads of the governments of the 28 member states, sit in a round and look at what the Turkish prime minister is offering. They are prepared to accept a poisoned offer, because they have agreed in principle and only want to negotiate further. However, it must be made clear that we are not acting with people and with fundamental rights. No one should act on it, not even the EU! What has now been proposed, however, is very reminiscent of a trade in indulgences: those who define and exchange refugees, asylum seekers and protection seekers according to national, regional origin are in breach of international agreements, international agreements and international law. I am thinking only of the images of the people in Idomeni waiting for them to have access to the European Union, for them to be able to move on, and to whom this right is being denied. Never – and I say this very clearly to all those who want to tell us here that we have a European solution on the table – have we never been as far removed from a European solution as we are now. Nothing you found on Monday is intended to be a European solution. The questions, the doubts raised by individual Heads of State, were only to questions that affected their own interests as a state. It wasn't anything else. The penultimate summit included an agreement not to close the borders. The day after, the borders were closed. On Monday evening, at night, in the early morning, the heads of state left, and the first thing that was was the announcement was that the next state would close its borders. Then I look to Greece: it is nice that the Commission has put forward a proposal to create a new instrument and to provide humanitarian aid, in particular to support the activities of organisations. But that does not change the problems. Nothing changes in the real burden on Greece and on the unsolidarity of the other Member States. In my biography, I know exactly what it means to build walls and close borders. I can only tell you that if the phrase suddenly applies: 'Nobody has any intention of making Greece ungovernable', that sounds ridiculous to me. If, for example, Mr de Maiziére says on Monday that Greece should not be like this, they must endure it, they must be able to do so, then I can only say that this is pure cynicism! That is the rejection of the common ground of the European Union. On Turkey, anyone who goes into Turkey's hands is giving up on himself – at least with this Turkey, with this government. We have always been in favour of negotiating membership with Turkey. However, we are strongly opposed to all the criteria, all the requirements, all agreements, everything that applies to accession being simply set aside.   We are making a deal with a country that is prepared to kill people at home, which is prepared to throw bombs at Kurds in Syria, which has contributed to the Syrian war, to the refugee crisis, by supporting Islamist fighters.

Mr President, moral bankruptcy, these are the words that come to mind following Monday's European Council. Moral bankruptcy, when instead of sanctioning it, the red carpet is rolled out to a regime that subjects justice and the police to the will of a single man, who muzzles and imprisons all free press, who disqualifies all democratic opposition and who, in order to win an election, revives the civil war and bombards its own populations. Moral bankruptcy, when we want to measure the reception reserved for Syrian war refugees in terms of the number of those who will try to enter the European Union by less legal paths, net, of course, of those who will have died along the way. Money, visa, relaunch of the accession process, nothing is too much to seduce the Putin of the Sublime Gate, all because a majority of The Member States of the Union, unlike Germany, took the side of \"not this, not these barbarians in our country\", some in the name of a thunderous defense of the myth of a white and Christian Europe, others, more prosaically, to defend the tourist season at the Vlaamse Kust, not to mention all those who hide cynically and cowardly behind it. There is still time, ladies and gentlemen, heads of state or government, to pull yourself together and adopt next week measures that bring the European Union up to its responsibilities, both moral and legal. You are right, we must create a safe and legal path to the European Union. But this path cannot be reserved only for Syrians - as far as I know, Iraq, Afghanistan and Yemen are just as many war zones. It cannot be dependent on the number of failed asylum seekers returned to Turkey. I would like to remind you that under the Geneva Convention, every refugee or asylum seeker is entitled to an individual review of their claim. If you are able to find billions - three, six or more, whatever - to encourage reception in Turkey, I think we, the rich Europe, should be able to do at least the same for the reception here. I would remind you that the European Union last year took in refugees to the tune of 0.25% of its population. That's 100 times less - 100 times less! - that the number of refugees taken in by a fragile country like Lebanon, a country that, like Jordan and much more than Turkey, needs our help. So yes, to put this policy in place, we will have to talk with Turkey. But the stronger our common determination to face our responsibilities, the stronger we will be facing Erdogan, because, you face, Turkey is geopolitically and economically weakened. It needs at least as much of the European Union as Turkey's Europe. The primary condition for the success of such a policy assumes that we Europeans act together. \"Zusammen schaffen wir das.\" I would like to address two countries in particular. Mrs Hennis-Plasschaert, you are from the Netherlands and you are currently the President of the Council of the Union. I would like to remind you that your country is the home of political liberalism. When Europe was confronted with absolutism and religious wars, the Netherlands was able to transform itself into a land of welcome for all European refugees. As for France, rather than displaying a façade solidarity while letting its Prime Minister teach the Chancellor a childish lesson, rather than lose her honour by handing over the legion of the same name to the crown prince of the Islamic State — I mean, Saudi Arabia - I would like her to assume her responsibilities to deserve the title of \"homeland of human rights\", which she drapes herself a little more often than in her turn, that she takes her fair part in welcoming refugees and that she assumes her share of leadership that is so lacking. Finally, and I will end with this, Mr President, in the face of the Kaczynskis, Orbon, Fico, Morano, Pegida and Le Pen who are constantly invoking a Christian Europe to build our continent into a fortress, I want to recall the words spoken here, eighteen months ago, by Pope Francis. He told us that it is necessary to tackle the migration issue together. The Mediterranean Sea cannot be tolerated as a great cemetery. He told us that Europe will be able to deal with immigration-related issues: first, if it can clearly define its own cultural identity and implement adequate legislation capable, at the same time, of protecting the rights of European citizens and guaranteeing the reception of migrants; second, if it adopts fair, courageous and concrete policies that help countries of origin resolve their internal conflicts, cause of the phenomenon, instead of the self-serving policies that fuel these conflicts.

These two issues are very different in nature and dynamics, but they are necessary to our attention at the same time for their urgency and importance. We must now recognize that they are also necessary because of the ineffectiveness of the solutions adopted so far.  Despite all the efforts to combat the economic crisis, we have not succeeded in substance in ferrying the majority of our fellow citizens to waters that are neither safer nor calmer; On the contrary, the example of insufficient solidarity, which is insufficient, especially in the method, which has been given to the Greek people, cannot reassure those of our fellow citizens who are in a particularly weak situation.  The migration crisis, then, even finds us uncovered by those instruments and mechanisms on which the response to the financial crisis has been able to count. In fact, we have seen governments which, in view of the not-so-huge numbers of migrants, have called for the removal, or even abolition, of rules given by all to be acquired and presented to the world as irrevocable achievements of the process of European unification. The results of the last Council still confirm a situation of substantial paralysis: without prejudice to the usual statements of principle and the slightest progress, everything is postponed to the next meeting.  This inability to design in the face of known problems has even put the European Union in the position of having improper conditions put in place by a government, the Turkish government, which, just a few days after egregious actions contrary to the values that the Union claims, such as freedom of the press, is demanding the acceleration of accession negotiations.  It is now clear to anyone who wants to see that the governments of the European Union are at a standstill in the face of the current challenges. It is up to us, who have direct representation of our fellow citizens, for issues that affect the whole continent, to show that it is possible to think, plan and want a different and even more effective approach to crises that pose challenges to us. So what to do?  First of all, call back the values. The European Union has told the world that it wants to offer an area of freedom, justice and security. Let's start from here. Freedom: we are aware of the effort turkey is making to take in Syrian refugees and we have already allocated considerable resources; But we cannot agree to exchange this welcome, which is also a duty for the Turkish Government, with the continued denial of freedom of expression and the press. This is improper negotiation and those who apply to join the European Union must be clear about this distinction, in principle and in actions.  Justice: we have more than 500 million inhabitants in the European Union. In 2015, we took in 1 200 000 asylum seekers and it is not acceptable for our governments to go into crisis for such numbers. We have other capabilities and it is not right to accept humanitarian situations, such as those we are seeing these days, on the Greek-Macedonian border.  Security: acting with justice also means knowing how to distinguish and give one's name to things. It is necessary to tell our fellow citizens clearly, in words and deeds, who will be welcomed and why, how it will be managed and integrated, who cannot be accepted forever and how this decision will be enforced. And we need clear, enforceable and certain rules for the whole of the European Union.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the truth is cruel! In the last negotiations between Turkey and Europe, President Erdogan launched a diktat to this european Union, which is inherently weak, it must be said, and failing. I had called it once the big soft jellyfish, and I think I had just typed it. After having obtained, last November, three billion euros to dry up the flow of migrants, a promise obviously unfulfilled, he is now demanding six billion to do so. The evidence of broken promises can be seen in the figures: in January 2016, twelve times as many migrants from Turkey landed in Greece, compared to January 2015. Erdogan rolls you in the flour, Erdogan makes you sing. It even goes so far as to demand today the abolition of visas to allow its nationals to join the European Union and, finally, the acceleration of Turkey's accession process to the European Union, as a reward for its non-cooperation. The proof is that the European Union does not make any stronger. On the contrary, it generates a permanent blur and a mortal weakness, which Mr. Erdogan benefits greatly from. He shows you every day how little he does with your moral lessons, because because of your irresponsible choices, you have made him super-powerful. For example, a major Turkish opposition newspaper was invaded last week by police, who drove out journalists with water cannons and tear gas, the Turkish army is bombing the Kurds in Syria - I remind you that the Kurds are the fiercest opponents of Daesh and Al-Qaeda - Turkey has fired on a Russian plane, it is involved in smuggling oil from Daesh - which you refuse to watch; and, finally, it is destabilized by multiple attacks on its soil, caused by mr Erdogan's major domestic and foreign policy errors. Is this the country you want to integrate into Europe? Finally, a country has found an effective solution to stop migration crises. This is, of course, Australia. A wide-art advertising campaign was carried out in all emigration countries to prevent illegal immigrants and boats from being systematically returned to their countries of origin, and this is the case. This clear and firm policy has produced indisputable results. So let's be pragmatic, responsible, let's adopt it. Let's create as many filters as we can by putting in place strong national boundaries! Let us create, under the aegis of the United Nations, protected refugee camps in Syria or in countries close to Syria, to secure war refugees in decent conditions.

I would like to remind you that yesterday, on International Women's Day, we spoke for a long time about the situation of migrant women and highlighted the dangers and risks that women and children in particular are exposed to if traffickers and smugglers are not put to work here. An agreement with Turkey is now being considered, in which this very problem is also being addressed. I can only tell you that I welcome these negotiations, I welcome the progress that was made on Monday. It is not yet a breakthrough, but we must face up to the facts, and we will only get a solution if we involve Turkey. We must, of course, support Greece, but that is not enough. People are coming across the sea, so we do not need to lie in our pockets. Without an agreement with Turkey, we will not be able to deal with smuggling. For me, what is crucial is the price we, as Europeans, have to pay for this. I would like to make it clear that there must be no accession rebate. For us in the European Union, there are clear rules for membership, clear conditions, which also apply to Turkey. Many Members have already discussed this: the accession negotiations are one thing, and the question of how we solve the problems in the refugee and migration crisis is another matter. The other point I would like to raise is the issue of visa facilitation. I am very, very critical of that. I think that we in Parliament will deal with this issue in the most intensive way.

Turkey's assistance is humanitarian and expediency.

The historic error made by Chancellor Merkel last year by saying all can come has led directly to this mess and now we are being blackmailed by Turkey.  First they came for EUR 3 billion in a promise to reduce the numbers coming into Greece and the rest of Europe and, of course, when the numbers increased many-fold they came back for another EUR 3 billion. And they will keep on coming back for more and more and more, as the British poet Rudyard Kipling observed of the Danish incursions into England. That was called paying the Danegeld, but we proved again and again that if once you have paid him the Danegeld you will never get rid of a Dane.  And now they have got us over a barrel, this new deal where for every one illegal migrant we send back, if our human rights laws allow it, they will send us another one from Syria. So the argument is that we paid them a fortune not to reduce numbers, and yet we have given in. And we have said yes to visa-free access for 75 million Turks from June of this year. In theory, they can stay for 90 days. In practice, many will disappear or, of course, claim family reunion. The numbers will go sharply up. And in return for all of this, we are now going to fast-track Turkey as a full member of the European Union. My goodness me, I wish that David Cameron was as good at negotiations as the Turks are! So we are going to go into political union with a country that has got borders with Iraq, Iran and Syria. We are going to go into political union with a country that is poorer than anybody else in the European Union and give free movement to 75 million people and join up with a government that is increasingly Islamist and authoritarian.  The Turkish Prime Minister said this week that Turkish membership will be a turning point. Too right! The British Prime Minister has long supported Turkey being a member of this Union. In fact he has fought hard over 10 years for them to join. He does not bat an eyelid at the extra GBP 500 million we will stump up to help fund this crisis.  Well this referendum in Britain is all about what is the safest option, and given that the boss of Europol says there are already 3 000 to 5 000 Islamist terrorists that have come into Europe using the migrant routes, it is pretty clear to me that a vote to remain is a vote for Turkey. A vote to remain is a vote for massively increased immigration into Britain and a vote to remain is a vote that makes Britain more vulnerable to terrorism.

I have long said that it is necessary to establish cooperation with regional partners such as Turkey, but also with north African countries. At the same time, however, it is necessary to internationalised this process, including the inclusion of the UN. This is not only a regional problem, but also a global problem, both in terms of the consequences and the possibility of tackling the sources of migration.

Not all countries are also complying with their commitments in this regard, although my government confirms these commitments.  Turkey can do a lot by fighting smuggling networks, which, after all, make their fortunes by preying on migrants who are transported illegally to Europe, while at the same time lying about the opportunities these migrants will face here. But by protecting Europe's borders, we cannot rely solely on external partners. It is also our part to restore control, to bring about theciliation of the migratory stream. Nor can we stop working to eliminate the sources of migration: above all, war, attacks on civilians, war crimes and genocide.

This means that the door is to be kept open in Europe. This means that billions of European taxpayers' money will continue to be moved to Turkey. This means that, from June, visa-free travel for Turks in the EU will be made possible here. And that means that Turkey should continue to be led towards EU membership. This behaviour of the SPÖ and ÖVP will be discussed in Austria and is an internal Austrian problem. However, it is not only a problem of domestic politics that is what is happening in Germany. For the behaviour of German Chancellor Merkel, which threatens to drag an entire continent into the abyss, is something that affects Europe as a whole. If The German Chancellor Merkel wants to show more heart for people in Arabia and North Africa than for her own compatriots, then it is okay, then perhaps she should go to Arabia or North Africa as a refugee worker. As Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany, she is no longer sustainable because her decisions affect the entire continent. This summit must be rejected.

One more! The outcome of this summit, like the previous eight, is not only disappointing, but very worrying. This must be of concern to us because the European Council on 18 and 19 March will be crucial, because we will have to choose between, on the one hand, a Europe of union such as the one that was conceived 60 years ago and, on the other, a Europe of one's own own. At a time when Schengen is under threat, this Europe of selfishness is not the solution to the migration crisis. As always, our position with regard to Turkey is totally ambiguous. The negotiations with Turkey last Monday are probably the worst we have seen in a long time. Europe negotiates with Turkey by being divided as never before and without an elaborate strategy, without consultation among all. Europe, distraught, surrenders itself to the hands of the Turks, it throws itself into the mouth of the wolf. Madam Minister, what you are proposing is irresponsible. Every week Turkey comes up with a new list of claims. It's climbing. With regard to visas, 72 criteria must be met before Turkish citizens benefit from them. However, the European Council has committed to authorising these visas by 1 June. Madam Minister, you forget that this is a competence of the European Parliament, which intends to fully exercise its power of co-decision in this matter. The Council is committed to paying an additional $3 billion, but it is a market of dupes, since you were not able to pay the $3 billion promised last October. How much control will you have over the use of that six billion? The hypocrisy is total, finally, with this sea snake represented by Turkey's accession to the European Union. We know that such a prospect is unrealistic and will not come true. What we want are actions, because Europe cannot constantly discard its responsibilities over others.

The deal with Turkey could be a breakthrough as much as a failed opportunity for our Member States to face, united, their common responsibility in the face of a very difficult crisis. That being said, Turkey needs to be praised for its efforts in dealing with a very large number of Syrian and Iraqi refugees, and for its willingness to welcome an even larger number. I also welcome the agreement on taking all necessary measures to close down people-smuggling routes and equally to break the business model of the smugglers. Turkey is a candidate country, but the refugee crisis and the accession path have to be dealt with separately and criticisms have to be part of the enlargement process. Here the Commission is completely shy. Therefore I condemn the seizing of the Zaman newspaper by the Turkish police this weekend. Finally, I would like to ask Turkey to refrain from any actions that could undermine the Syrian ceasefire and the international peace talks on Syria.

My fear is another miracle solution which fails will overshadow all the other important and sensible actions which are being taken. But a EUR 6 billion mistake is a big mistake. Stop looking for silver bullets because some time you might end up with a nuclear bomb. Direct resettlement, sticking to the rules, border controls and faster processing are what we need.

Firstly, there is one principle that we must not forget: this situation can only be tackled from a common action, and that puts the European Union in value more than ever.  Secondly, regional partnerships, such as Turkey or the Countries of North Africa, are essential in situations like these, as much as we have big differences. Good agreements have to be made, but the principle is that these regional alliances are essential – in this case, of course, with Turkey.  Thirdly, I think it is important to ensure mechanisms for aid for refugees to actually reach refugees and not to risk being part of them along the way.  Fourthly, an issue which I believe is linked to this further: more than ever, the strengthening of the European economy is essential because it is a factor in dealing with the situation of uncertainty, the crossroads and the challenges we face and which will help a great deal to make this possible.  In this context, strengthening the internal market is essential, but also the free movement of people, because it is not only the free movement of goods and services.

We are dealing with the vital interests of Europe, and these investments can create many new jobs for Europeans.

Unfortunately, in the face of this phenomenon, politics always appears to be a step backwards in terms of the rapid evolution of migratory flows and the events that have caused them and which unfortunately continue to provoke them.  We are talking here today about an agreement which, let us face it, we do not like. We do not yet know it in detail, we will know it after the Council of 17-18 March, but we do not like it. It is also clear from what has been said today: there are many different doubts among the 28 States. The sad feeling is that we are now faced with an obligatory step given the emergency and we have to admit that someone or something has made a mistake. Because we have known a different Turkey. There was a Turkey that was truly a country committed to modernisation. Today we are at the negotiating table in a different country, and I believe that we have also made some mistakes. But let me say something that I am really sorry about, even as an Italian. Because, for some time now, we have been talking exclusively about the Aegean Sea. The agreement between Frontex and NATO to patrol the Aegean Sea is a good one; well ships coming from Britain. But why is there no more talk of the central Mediterranean and the routes from Tunisia and Libya? In Libya we know that ISIS is there and we know that the revenue of traffickers is one of the greatest income of these terrorists.  Well, I believe that we really must get away from the logic of emergency response and the logic of a short-term policy. We need to recover the capacity for a common long-term vision.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report, which is a very high-key one. A preliminary remark: I have no catching up to do with criticism of violations of the rule of law or human rights violations in Turkey, and I have been and remain opposed to Turkey's accession to the European Union. Nevertheless, I find this debate today appalling, and I say that. Because since we have been discussing the refugee issue, I have heard a wide variety of complaints here, but only complaints about what is going wrong. We were right to discuss Hungary and the fences, and I think we were right to criticise when we waved through or blocked in Austria. Some criticize Merkel's overly humane policies. In any case, there is always a rumbling, and today the vast majority of speakers have even criticised it, although I believe that this model, which is now before us, could, for the first time, be a solution that goes a little further, ensures that refugees have secure access, that we have a limit in Europe to those who are really persecuted. That is what we always wanted, and we have always said that. We may also be well on the way to finally getting the smugglers, the smugglers, under control, at least from them a bit of demand. It won't be perfect, there's no hundred percent solution. But if this works as it is now prepared, then there can be a real breakthrough, a step forward, on the refugee issue. This is a great opportunity; I would like to use them. And I would like to thank those in the Council and the Commission who have worked on it. Rumbling, which is not possible, is relatively easy, but let's finally take a step forward! This Council, too, has finally brought common ground. We have criticised the fact that there are only egotists sitting around who cannot agree. And now they have come to an agreement. The number isn't perfect, it's not even finished yet! With regard to visa freedoms, I also have a few questions. But for me, this is more hope, more opportunity, and I would like to say to the Council and the Commission and to those who work there: please, please, continue to work properly! Incidentally, not only to the Council and the representative of the Presidency, but also to Mr Hahn personally: what has the man invested in time to make a little further progress with Turkey? We could also say: keep going! We are taking another good step – finally another good step. That is why I am an optimist, despite all the problems I see with Turkey, and that remains the case!

As Vice-President Dombrovskis said, we make political decisions and the consequences of our political decisions are appreciated by our voters. That's all right. It is important to know what our constituents think about the issues. We are living in an age of successe crises: economic crisis, demographic crisis, 4.5 million unemployed under the age of 25 in the European Union, and the migrant crisis. I think that there are good examples, things that have been solved, managed well – such as the economic crisis. When I think of the next subject of the Council, the European Semester, I think that this is a good tool for getting a look at the state of the countries. And I am proud that Hungary from the extremely difficult, near-bankruptcy situation of 2010 to the fact that it is performing well economically, that our macroeconomic indicators are sustainable, that we can show growth. Moreover, in connection with Women's Day, I can say that the pay gap between men and women has decreased the most in Hungary. Then we get to the migration issue, the migrant crisis. I think that the agreement that was reached on Monday is not a perfect agreement. But I agree with Congressman Reul, we do not have to complain, we have to find a solution. Steps must be taken towards a solution. These are strengthening border protection, such as closing borders, as Leader Weber said, with fences if necessary. But there are still open questions. Such an open question is what we need to talk about, how we think about visa liberalisation for Turkey. Why aren't we talking about Ukraine? How do we think of a one-on-one exchange? What do we think of the three billion with which we value Turkey's efforts? And that's going to be six billion, then ten billion. Where is the guarantee, Commissioner Hahn, that we will use this resource well, that this resource will be targeted? It is not a short-sighted solution, but a common solution. In order to achieve this common solution, I think we have taken a good step forward.

This is a very dangerous strategy at a moment of a major crackdown on press freedom and rule of law in Turkey and at a time the 355 000 Kurdish citizens of Turkey had to flee their houses because of the violence that re-erupted in the south-east of the country.

The money that we should give to the refugees in Turkey is important and is justified if it is distributed properly. We should not forget that our agreement with Turkey is only part of the plan as, most likely, with the closing of the Balkan route, the other routes will be used more frequently and we must be ready for that. Secondly, let me talk a little bit about the economy as was mentioned by Commission Vice-President Dombrovskis. I guess that the situation in the global economy is very important, and obviously we must be concerned at what is going on, concerned at the situation in China, but what is the most important for the huge and the rich economy of the European Union – the economy of the part of the world that is close by – is the domestic situation , the stability of domestic demand and investment.

For the more moderate, he gave birth to a mouse. For many others, it is, on the contrary, the height of shame. I'm one of the runners-up. Since the next European Council on 17 and 18 March will decide, we must face the impact of the guidelines resulting from Monday's discussions. I can only talk about a few of them. The effects of the closure of the Balkan route, first of all: the Member States are miscalcating here, because, in one movement, Greece is being put on an infusion, but at the same time it is asphyxiated. Explain to me how we can proclaim the Schengen bailout, while endorsing unilateral decisions to close borders in and around the Union. Cooperation with Turkey, then: it is certainly an essential partner in the region, and cooperation between the EU and that country is necessary, but if solutions are to be sought elsewhere, they should also and above all be found within the Union. In this case, we are not only complying with the requirements of this partner, but we are outsourcing the management of the crisis, with an increase in auctions. Member States are clearing themselves of their responsibilities, the principle of solidarity and, ultimately, their principles. This is evidenced by the principle modestly entitled 'resettlement of Syrians in the EU, on a one-for-one basis'. This undignified barter in fact that a Syrian must risk drowning in order for another Syrian to enter the Union. I never imagined that the demand for legal avenues would take this sordid form. The legality of such a scheme and its applicability also remain to be demonstrated. In the quest for an agreement at all costs, the EU is losing itself in the name of realpolitik, Member States seem ready to sit on a number of principles and turn a blind eye to the power in place in Turkey, its control over the media, the imprisonment of academics and threats to the judicial system.

This means, first of all, that we have to make a huge humanitarian welcome, we have to give great support to Greece.

This is the first step towards European security and European defence. I would like to remind you that in the last survey of the Bertelsmann Foundation, it is said that 79 % of Europeans are in favour of setting up a European border and coast police force and advocating a common policy on immigration and asylum, not a national policy and not a shared policy, a common policy in Europe, and that they advocate the redistribution of refugees across the 28 countries and not just for a , by two or three. There are majorities of 70 and 80 % across Europe and, even in those countries that are more reticent, such as the Visegrad countries, this survey says that the majority is around 55 %, 60 %.

The problem is that our Member States – many of the Member States – are unwilling to abide by the existing European law that they themselves have co-decided. They refuse to comply with international law, they simply ignore it. That is why we are in the situation with the refugees we are in now. In this situation, we are dependent on Turkey's offer to withhold, withdraw and exchange refugees. Is this a diabolical plan? Is this in line with international law? And what image will the European Union itself give, should this deal come about? A pathetic picture, definitely. But this pitiful picture has to be attributed to the Member States, which refuse to share a common policy of solidarity with refugees: first of all, to mention Austria today, which has triggered a whole cascade with its refusal to take in the vulnerable. This is a denial of international law. Of course, Turkey is asking for compensation, and that is quite clear. That is what we would do in such a situation. But what is another EUR 3 billion? That sounds a lot. But when you think about how much money has already gone to Greece, six billion euros are not against it. Six billion euros is nothing at all if we oppose the fact that we may also be able to bring all these refugees to us. Yes, it is not a nice solution to pay for keeping the refugees out of Europe. But obviously it is no different. The right-wing populists, who are also speaking the big word here in this House, have pushed many governments in the European Union so far. And the horrible thing is that they are already putting the government somewhere. It is the right, it is the extremes that are partly responsible for our Europe being in such a crisis that I am ashamed of it.

Also welcomed was the appeal of Donald Tusk, who told refugees or those who are about to become one: \"Don't come to the European Union, don't trust criminals, don't trust smugglers.\" However, dear colleagues, dear colleagues, this is about men, women, children, this is not about numbers. So it is time to welcome this agreement, which I would not call trade, but this agreement has yet to be concreted at the next summit and at the next summits, and I hope that we will finally succeed in doing so.  However, we should not consider this agreement a bianco check because it is not a bianco check, since we know what is happening in Turkey. So negotiations should be separated for Turkey and entry into the European Union from this refugee crisis because if we don't separate that then we will accept all the bad that is happening in Turkey, and we are talking about jeopardizing freedoms, especially media freedoms. This is something we have to appeal to here today and I believe that will be our condition for Turkey.

We want to offer support and succour to those from other areas who are worse off than ourselves.

It is regular rather than irregular. It is safe rather than dangerous, and I think that must be taken into consideration. 17 March, incidentally, is the Irish national holiday, St Patrick’s Day. He himself was a migrant or a slave coming from Wales to Ireland. He might inspire the leaders on that day to come up with a good solution.

This European Council must solve an economic equation, but it must also be an opportunity for a call for solidarity, which implies a capacity to borrow to finance this solidarity.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 116, "date": "2016-03-09.json", "name": "Lefteris CHRISTOFOROU", "mepid": "26837", "text": "  PPE). Mr President, I believe that this European Parliament, which represents the peoples, must speak clearly, without twists and turns and without incomprehensible theories and without ambiguities, both on the refugee issue and on Turkey. We must all admit that the refugee issue is not only a predominantly European issue, it is not only a matter for the Member States of the European Union, but it is an international issue, so the other countries, internationally, must also support and support the European Union in this effort to resolve it. As for the contractors of destruction and Euroscepticism who want and believe that the European Union can be enthused with the refugee crisis, I am convinced that Europe can also find solutions to this issue. For Turkey. What has Turkey done all the way to the refugee camp? Let me remind you that Turkey was part of the problem, because with its attitude and behaviour and policy in the region it created the refugee crisis. Let me remind you that the previous agreement to limit flows to Greece not only did not respect it, but also increased flows, and I would remind you now that a country that is acceding and even wants to speed up accession processes is behaving towards the European Union as a brute cynical blackmailer, putting the humanitarian issue forward and using it as a spear. , so that it can serve its own interests and get rewards.  I must remind you once again that there are rules in this European Union. Turkey cannot today call for the opening of funds in order to move forward with its accession process, when all countries know the principles, values and process that exists for accession to the European Union. The Council must not again agree to the opening of Turkey's capital if Turkey does not implement the agreements with the European Union, the Ankara Protocol and if it does not recognise the Republic of Cyprus.

It is clear that a satisfactory solution must also include a cooperative Turkey. But unlike Greece, which is honouring its commitments, Turkey has not implemented the existing agreement and is constantly making new demands in an oriental bargaining chip, except that this bazaar concerns souls and human rights. So how should Europe respond if it wants to remain united and in line with its fundamental values?

Mr President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has said. Thank you for the dedicated debate, especially to those ladies and gentlemen who have taken part in this debate all the time. I would also like to join the ranks of those who say that we need something. Yes, we need a political solution in Syria, we need a global solution to migration flow, we also need sustainable and functioning protection of our external borders. But I believe that 'face reality' is also important, and that means that we need a short-term solution. And for a short-term solution, it is necessary to conclude a working agreement with Turkey as well. That is what we need to work on. Monday was a very important step towards moving closer to this agreement in a sustainable and effective manner. But it was also a day that showed that only a European solution is possible, including all those involved. This solution must be developed by everyone, decided by everyone and, finally, implemented by everyone. This is the only way it works. Going it alone will not get us to our destination. We must be clear about this; Monday showed that. I would like to comment very briefly on a number of key points that have been raised time and again, both in terms of possible visa liberalisation and the accelerated opening of accession negotiations. I can assure you – at least on the part of the Commission – that this is not at the expense of standards, principles, respect for human rights, the independence of the judiciary and cetera. That will be the subject of the assessments. Anyone who wants to follow the European Union must accept our rules of the game. It's not like we're shopping around here and saying, \"Become a member, there's a special tariff here.\" No! Anyone who wants to do so must have serious and proper negotiations with us. Incidentally, in the case of visa liberalisation, which is not so much in focus, part of such an agreement is also a readmission agreement, which includes turkey having to take back migrants from all the Member States of the European Union if no asylum can be granted. This, too, is a step forward in Europe's interest. Now to the eur 3 or six billion. Honestly, I can no longer hear Turkish representatives in particular saying that they have not yet seen a penny. You won't see a penny either, because the money is managed directly by us. However, we have not only already provided funds, but have already paid for it. I was myself in Eastern Anatolia, Gaziantep and another city on Friday, and I looked at a refugee camp there myself. I must pay respect here to the Turkish Government, but also to the international organisations, for the way in which the refugees are housed: in a human environment, in a refugee camp where everything is available – supermarkets, schools, even high schools, where there are 3 800 tents for 18 000 inhabitants, but which are properly accompanied. I can tell you that, for example, by providing 'only' EUR 40 million, we have ensured that 300 000 refugees in Turkish camps are cared for for six months. We have made sure, with EUR 55 million, that 200 000 children and young people will be able to attend school for a whole year. So, you see, with comparatively little spending, we can make sure that the people in the region have a safe home. And I can also tell you, by the way, that I have spoken to many Syrian refugees in eastern Anatolia. They all want to return to Syria as soon as possible, they don't want to go to Europe. Therefore, we must a) work on a political solution, but b) also ensure that they can live on decent conditions where they are at present and, above all, that children and young people, in particular, have a perspective by having a proper education. I took something from this visit with me: that we also need to do more to promote economic activities so that jobs are created there and the refugees also have an opportunity to take action. Monday was an important step. But it is clear that President Tusk has the task of finalising the negotiations here.

Details count so not all questions can be answered in detail at this stage. Let there be no mistake, European Heads of State and Government insisted – and have said explicitly in their statement – that work on the proposals will respect European and international law. I fully agree with Mr Weber that all this should be taking place in partnership with Turkey, so no dependency.  Let me be clear that the aim is not simply to stop refugees from coming. The aim is to move from irregular to legal controlled migration. The aim is to put an end to people dying at sea. And to be clear once more, we are not selling out on our values. We are speeding up, but not compromising, on the roadmap for visa liberalisation. The conditionality remains in place and the same goes for the accession negotiation chapters. So let me stress once again that accession and visa liberalisation are both condition—based processes, based on well-known conditions. So whatever arrangements we agree with Turkey, it will have to respect EU and international law. The statement of the European Council of 7 March states this clearly. We cannot – and will not – cut corners when it comes to our legal obligations.  At the same time, I would like to underline that the moral high ground is a luxury we cannot afford. As Mr Reul said, there is no such thing at this very moment as perfection. Already, under the existing Greece—Turkey readmission agreement, as well as under the EU—Turkey readmission agreements, Turkey is expected to readmit all irregular migrants not in need of international protection that have transited through Turkish territory. The EU and Turkey have to agree to skill up and accelerate the implementation of these commitments, which have started already with the transfer from Greece to Turkey of over 300 irregular migrants. We will expect Turkey to live up to international obligations, such as the principle of non-refoulement, and let us not forget that currently over 2.5 million refugees already enjoy protection in Turkey.  Finally, to those who invoked the Geneva Convention, I understand your concerns but, as I said, we will not cut corners when it comes to our legal obligation. There is no such thing as a trade—off. I would ask at the same time whether you truly think that the current situation, in which people are forced to make a dangerous journey in a little boat, is in line with international law? Are the dead bodies washing up on Turkish and Greek shores in line with national law? I do not think so. We need to do everything in our power to break this preferred model of the people smugglers. That is our moral obligation and Mr Kamal is right that the real enemies are not the refugees. The smugglers are our enemies.  To conclude – because it is a bit crowded in the Chamber right now – I would like to end with some words on the takeover of Zaman by the Turkish authorities. Our concerns were clearly raised in the meeting with the Turkish Prime Minister which my Prime Minister and Chancellor Merkel had on Sunday, as well as the meeting of the 28 on Monday. Media freedom, the freedom of speech, is not negotiable and clearly Turkey will need to improve its track record in this field. There is no such thing as turning a blind eye. To conclude, and in reply to Mrs in 't Veld, I would thank you so much for reminding me of my own statements years ago. I continue to stand by them. I would say, with the benefit of hindsight, that it was quite visionary. I asked for European solutions back then and I will continue to ask for European solutions.

The EU is not only under the illusion that Turkey can stop those fleeing war and persecution to save their lives, but persists in dealing with a country that has entered a spiral of authoritarianism and repression that undermines the fundamental rights of its citizens and migrants and gags the freedom of the press. The European Union, not least because of the predominancing of the national self-interest of the Member States, continues to have little international impact on the real causes of the migration problem, but risks reneging on the principles on which it is based and showing itself to be an accomplice of a state accused of serious human rights violations.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "EFDD", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Eurosceptic conservatives"}, {"id": 152, "date": "2016-03-09.json", "name": "Eider GARDIAZABAL RUBIAL", "mepid": "96991", "text": "  in writing. – In the face of the next Council, we need to raise our voices in this Parliament to tell the heads of state and government that the men, women and children who roam in the European winter have the same status as the men, women and children who escaped the Spanish civil war, the Second World War in their various scenarios , fascist and communist dictatorships, wars in the Balkans.

In addition – and I consider these arrangements crucial – the EU will open channels for legal migration for asylum seekers in exchange for an end to irregular migration.  This kind of exchange is aimed at regaining control of the crisis and stopping the criminal activities of human traffickers, smugglers and document forgers who have created a profitable and inhumane empire of pathological business more profitable than the arms or drug trade.

Since the start of intensive negotiations between the EU and Turkey, one of the main demands for Turkey has been to suspend the illegal migrant smuggling network. So far, however, we have seen no more serious action by Ankara in this direction: although at the beginning of the year the migration through the Aegean Sea was lower than in the same period in 2015, a new wave of migrants and up to 100,000 migrants are predicted to be affected by the weather. new arrivals by the end of March. The scale of the war in Syria is not diminishing, and russia's dictation of conditions and the in principle inciting conflict do not reduce the flow of refugees to Turkey, with around 2.7 million people already in Turkey. refugees and migrants. Perhaps that is what Ankara is not taking to shut down the road to Europe? There is no recipe for a recipe for the arrivals already in Europe today, and there is doubt about the commitment to accept every illegal migrant returned to Turkey as a refugee. These are new hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers. Europe promises Turkey a great deal: visa-free travel, a huge financial injection, the opening of new chapters on EU membership, although the situation of civil rights and freedoms in Turkey is deteriorating.

There has been an incident in this House this morning which I believe the European Parliament cannot react, but must respond. I am now giving you the sentence which, firstly, I consider unacceptable and, secondly, absolutely penalisable. It is the phrase of Mr Synadinos who, in the debate on the EU-Turkey Summit this morning, said the following. I quote: \"As Ottoman scientists have written: the Turks are spiritual barbarians, despised by God, swindlers and dirty. The Turk is like the dog playing the savage, but when he has to fight the enemy, runs away. The only effective way to deal with the Turks is the fist and determination.\" This, ladies and gentlemen, is a sentence which, within the meaning of Rule 165 of the Rules of Procedure, constitutes a serious violation of the values and principles of the Union.

Numerous important factors come to play to determine price of medicines: taxes and import tariffs, distribution mark—ups, lack of an efficient procurement system, etc. Scientific and technological innovation has significantly improved the treatment of human diseases. Intellectual property stimulates pharmaceutical companies to invest money to develop and produce new and better medicines. Bringing a medicine to market is a long and complex process that is very costly and takes many years to complete. Without the prospect of return on their investments, pharmaceutical companies will not allocate large budgets to more research and development. Patent protection can lead to higher prices by delaying the supply of cheaper generic alternatives. Hence, the argument is often made that patents on medicines restrict access to treatment for citizens in low—income developing countries.

Essential medicines are those that are necessary for certain serious diseases, such as ISIS and tuberculosis, and which the countries with the most economic difficulties are not able to acquire. For this reason, different prices are set for those medicines for the least developed countries. The Regulation aims at the implementation of control mechanisms, fines and sanctions to prevent countries or the pharmaceutical industry from taking advantage of this price differentiation, reselling them and generating profit in this exchange.

Price differences in developed and developing countries' markets are evident, so there is a need to ensure access for developing countries to basic medicines for the treatment of communicable diseases at an affordable price.

The advantage of such a policy is that it encourages manufacturers to distribute certain key medicines to targeted countries at the lowest possible price, while offsetting R&amp;D expenditure with higher prices charged in developed countries (OECD). This approach promotes the sustainability of stocks and the continuous distribution of medicines to help eliminate those diseases that rule these areas: HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.

The Regulation addresses the diversion of essential medicines to the European Union and the implementation of the necessary control. Essential medicines are those that are necessary for certain serious diseases, such as ISD and tuberculosis, and which the countries with the most economic difficulties cannot acquire. For this reason, different prices are set for those medicines for the least developed countries. The Regulation aims at implementing control mechanisms, fines and sanctions to prevent countries or the pharmaceutical industry from taking advantage of this price differentiation, reselling them and generating profit in this exchange.

Stopping the spread of infectious diseases is one of the United Nations' millennium goals, and the European Union will contribute to this goal with this Regulation. Mortality caused by AIDS could be reduced by practicing antiretroviral treatment, but the necessary medications are either unavailable or too expensive. Price segmentation is the only fair solution that provides assistance to the inhabitants of the African continent. I support the proposal for a regulation as it introduces a differentiated pricing obligation which means that the price would be set according to the wealth of the country to which the medicine is distributed. No one is at a loss because residents are given medicines that keep them alive, medicines must be constantly produced, and a shortage of money is offset by a higher price of the same drugs in richer countries.

There is a huge democratic deficit running through these bodies and moreover, a number of legal concerns have been voiced. The bodies have very fragile legal foundations and a number of legal experts have stated that the setting up of such bodies was done outside of the confines of EU Treaty law.  To explain simply, when an EU body is being set up, you have to first go back to the primary treaties which founded the EU and look at the Treaty provisions. If there is no provision in the Treaty to set up such an initiative, then it can be declared as ultra vires i.e. being outside of EU law and having no legal foundation.

Harmonisation of rules is important to strengthen trust between states in cross-border judicial cooperation. In particular, the Directive provides children with the right to information – important for the exercise of other rights – to a compulsory defence, to the protection of privacy, to the protection of personal freedom, to a timely and proper hearing of the case and others.

Although EU policies should provide the necessary resources to address the major problems facing the current European situation, no concrete solution is proposed in the 2017 budget guidelines.

The aim of this report is to determine the general guidelines for the 2017 EU budget. Four main lines stand out from the text.  First, the demand to increase the ceilings of the multi-year financial framework (MFF 2014-2020), which does not withstand the surplus of funding caused by migratory pressure, and the granting, in this context, of 6 billion euros to Turkey.  The second request is to increase Member States' contributions to the EU budget, which forces them to reduce the size of their national budgets.

While the Russian embargo is driving down fruit and vegetable prices, this program is a major incentive for agricultural producers as well as consumers to adopt healthy habits.

Let me recall the joint declaration by the three institutions under the 2016 budget that reducing youth unemployment is an important common priority. I certainly welcome this binding statement, but I wonder why, therefore, no new commitments have been made for additional funding for the YEI for 2016. According to a recent Eurostat survey, youth unemployment is expected to fall in many Member States - especially those with the highest rates. At EU level, it was 1.5% lower at the end of last year. This is a sign that our past efforts have been successful. I believe that the Yem Employment Initiative is one of the main factors for this success.

Secondly, this agreement represents new and more serious limitations to the democraticity of the legislative and decision-making process. The door is open to a greater concentration of power in the European Commission and to limit the capacity of co-legislators to intervene, especially members.

Without asking the question of the very content of texts that increasingly promote competition and call for more austerity, an agreement facilitating cooperation between institutions may seem logical. However, the \"better legislation\" in the Commission's language is all too often summed up not to legislate when it comes to social progress or the defence of workers, and above all to leave an ever greater place to interest groups and ever more upstream. The consequence is a Commission that is increasingly attentive to the lobby, especially on the very opportunity to legislate, which kills any social initiative, and which relies on them to co-write certain texts. Suffice to say that the rules already define the meaning of laws before they are even considered by citizens' representatives.

With the establishment of a WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, Parliament believes that the EU no longer needs to link up with Philip Morris to fight counterfeiting and prefers to put its action with WHO, whose convention is incompatible with agreements with tobacco companies, ahead of its efforts.  With this vote, Parliament announces that it is abandoning its cooperation with tobacco companies, the agreement with Philip Morris being the first of four agreements with the four largest tobacco companies in the world.

The main argument for extending the agreement is that the direct cooperation of investigators at national and European level with the tobacco company in the fight against cigarette smuggling and counterfeiting has led to numerous cases of arrest and indictment of suspects, as well as the detection and dissolution of international organised groups. However, it should be pointed out that there is no evidence of a link between cooperation with the tobacco company and the resolution of these cases (behind which, above all, olaf's quality work must be sought). By negotiating this type of agreement, the Union risks sending a negative signal to the third countries with which it cooperates in the fight against trafficking that it considers bilateral agreements with tobacco companies to be a priority in cases of smuggling and counterfeiting, which in turn may lead to a threat to the ratification of the Protocol on Illicit Trade.

It is an honour for me and it is a pleasure.  ‘It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair.’. These are the opening lines of Dickens’ ‘A Tale of Two Cities’. He is describing Europe at the end of the 18th century – but he could just as well have been talking about our own times. We have indeed weathered a winter of despair: of terrorists and extremists attempting to attack our fundaments; of Russia continuing to try to move European borders using armed force; of our Union not being able to cope with youth unemployment, social hopelessness and the global refugee crisis.  But there are also some rays of hope in the world. The global climate agreement, the new sustainable development goals, and a large part of the African countries rising from poverty: these all show that we live in a time when global cooperation really can make a difference.  And the EU also has a chance at a spring of hope if standing strong and united against external threats, if tackling common challenges with the collective strength required to resolve them, if clearing away the last ruins of the financial crisis and starting to build strong societies again. I was born in 1957, the same year as the Treaty of Rome. My generation was given vast opportunities and had great hope for the future. To many of us, the world seemed to be ours to explore and to make into a better place.  Now I cannot see a greater duty than to give the same opportunity and hope to the young generation of today. And I know that the European Union can be a driving force for that, if we stand up for three central values of our Union: that is democracy, cooperation and also added value for our citizens. Let me start with democracy. We are currently strengthening our joint action against terrorism following cowardly and appalling attacks against our society. Many of these actions that we are taking are tough, but they are necessary. But the work to defend democracy is a much greater task.  Defending democracy is standing up for the safety of our Jewish citizens at a time when anti-Semitic threats, hatred and violence once again echo throughout Europe. It is never accepting or spreading populists’ and extremists’ demonisation of Muslims, even if it scores cheap points with the electorate. It is working for the rights of the Roma and of all minorities who are held back by prejudice and poverty.  Defending democracy is also defending free and independent media, freedom of reporting and freedom of the press, because we know that politics always benefits from hard scrutiny. Defending democracy is respecting every person’s right to meet, to be tried in free and fair trials, to move freely in society and to love whoever they want. If we do not defend these democratic values, we will lose Europe as we know it. That brings me to my second point, which is cooperation. Rarely have so many people been displaced in the world as they are right now, but rarely have so few European countries stepped up and been prepared to act. During a two-month period last autumn, Sweden took in some 80 000 people at a rate that is equivalent to 25 million asylum seekers annually in the European Union as a whole. This brought our reception system to the brink of collapse and, in the absence of working European solutions, it forced us to take unilateral action. Now the Schengen Agreement and the free movement it creates is a foundation pillar of the European Union, and crucial for our economies. But if we do not act, and act fast, we might lose it. I see a lot of words and plans to move forward, but far too little action. I therefore urge all the Member States to take their responsibility. It is time to act, to ensure control of our external borders, to enhance our cooperation with Turkey on the basis of international law, to implement the redistribution of refugees within the European Union, fight human smuggling and also strengthen our common foreign policy to put a stop to the causes of the refugee crisis. So we must move from chaos to control, otherwise we risk European cooperation as we know it. And, looking ahead, it is time to admit that the Dublin Regulation is not working and needs to be replaced. If we do not create a new, common and sustainable asylum system, more countries will be forced to act unilaterally, which will hurt mobility, trade and – most of all – it will hurt the human beings who are fleeing. Sweden is ready – and will act – for a new asylum system in the EU that is based on equal distribution, and in which asylum is sought in the EU – not in an individual country. Quite simply, to put it shortly, if we are to share an external border and have free movement between our countries, we must also share a system of asylum reception. To be honest, I cannot see how countries that do not participate in the common asylum system can participate in Schengen cooperation either. This brings me to my third point, and that is the added value for our citizens. Now we have shown that we are ready to work hard to keep together, as we have recently done to help to keep the United Kingdom within our Union. But the complaints against the European Union all over our continent should not be brushed aside. These complaints show us the dire need to emphasise that special something that keeps us together – the European spirit, the shared value of cooperation for our citizens.  We need to demonstrate the value of 28 countries and 508 million inhabitants joining together: to address challenges such as climate change that no country can manage alone, in this time of global interdependence; to create an even larger common market, in this time of global competition; and to generate greater security for our people, in this time of global unease. But if EU cooperation is to truly gain the broad popular support that is needed to stay strong in the 21st century, we must have a Union that works much harder for the wellbeing of the people, the citizens. In a world where 62 people own as much as 3.5 billion people, in such a world, we need a European Union that works for equality and everyone’s chance to pursue their innermost hopes for a good life. This is why we need to build a social Europe that strengthens people through more secure jobs, better living conditions and strengthens enterprises through more secure access to citizens with purchasing power. Because when people and enterprises are strengthened, economies grow. In a social Europe, the EU is a prime advocate for good terms and conditions for everyone working in the Union, making sure that workers are never forced to compete against each other through lower wages or poorer working conditions. Ensuring that in a tricky world of global subcontractors, there is always someone who is responsible for ensuring that you are safe at work. In a social Europe, the EU should work to unleash the energy of a growing labour force. If women were employed to the same extent as men in the European Union, GDP could grow or increase some 12% by 2030.  So the EU must not only act as a sentinel for sound finances, it must also act as a driving force for women’s entry into the labour market and a truly equal world of work. This is as ethically right as it is economically smart. In a social Europe, the EU should take a collective stand against the youth unemployment that is breaking down the youth and also breaking down our economies and our societies’ faith in the future.  So we should prioritise investment in education, expand exchanges of European students between not only higher education institutions but also upper secondary schools. And create the jobs for the future for young people via social investment, ambitious free trade agreements and a digital internal market. This is the kind of social Europe that can win the hearts of the people in Europe. The Commission’s proposal for amending the Posting of Workers Directive and the development of the social pillar show that the work is finally and truly under way, which I welcome. Taking steps towards more decent working conditions and social progress is paramount. So let us continue onwards and upwards. Let us come together for a summit and draw up a strategy to move this idea of a social Europe forward, and I would be pleased and honoured to host such a summit in Sweden next year in 2017. (Applause) We are working for an EU that works hard for the size of the market, yes, but even harder for the wellbeing of its people. I see Parliament and the Commission as key actors on all three issues. I can feel in this very Hall and in our Union that we carry the ability to create the same hope that I felt as the generation of 1957, for the generations of 1997, 2007, 2017, and many generations to come. So Europe’s winter of despair has been long and hard. But if we stand up for democracy when democracy is tested, if we cooperate and turn words into deeds to address the migration crisis, and if we create a social Europe that increases the wellbeing in people’s everyday lives, then we will be able – in these best of times and in these worst of times – to create a new spring of hope in Europe.

Yes, it is the best of times and it is the worst of times but, above all, it is the time for us in Europe to stand up for our values and be counted. Prime Minister, I am very honoured to welcome you in this Chamber, where you have just done exactly that. Thank you. Sweden is a country that has shaped its own destiny with values and the conviction that we can live and work together and provide for a fair society. You have also influenced those beyond your borders – the rest of us in Europe. I will just recall that, together with your Scandinavian partners, you were the first to understand the value of free movement: it was the then Nordic Council which, in the 1950s, launched free travel and the original labour market for the first time. Your achievement has served you very well and it is serving Europe very well. Today, on behalf of our President, I would like to pay tribute to Sweden’s response to the refugee crisis. Your country has long received the highest number of people seeking protection, way before the current crisis started. Your solidarity is a shining light. When a country so far north in the Union is affected so directly by events to the south, we know we are in this together. No country can manage this crisis alone and no country should be left alone, be it Greece, Sweden, Austria or Germany. No country can carry the weight on its own. Together we have to protect our borders. Together we have to help people who depend on us for their survival. We recognise the effort Sweden has made and we have suspended the relocation of refugees to Sweden from Greece and Italy. That is pragmatic and fair.  Today, as you have said, in most parts of Europe we need to restore order. We need to restore the Schengen system. Your country knows the cost of life without Schengen. I was struck by how costly it is to have border controls on the Øresund Bridge between Sweden and Denmark – the costs run into hundreds of millions of euros a month. Last Friday, the Commission published a roadmap setting out the steps to restore Schengen to full health and lift all internal borders by December 2016 at the latest. This gives us an opportunity to make Schengen more resilient. We have to learn from the crisis that the system works only if we all participate: otherwise it does not work at all. That is why, obviously, we all have to pull together. At the Commission we are not interested in pointing the finger. We are interested in solutions and in helping Member States – all Member States – to bear a shared responsibility for restoring and protecting Schengen. Prime Minister, let me turn to a second topic which you touched upon and which also has to do with values in Europe: Europe’s social model. It is one of our greatest achievements. Far more than a way to organise our economy, it is part of who we are, it is part of our treaties and it is part of our identity. Sweden has written entire chapters in this story. Listening to you and your government, you are holding the pen and still writing. Thank you for that.  What we have demonstrated to the rest of the world is that our social market economy can have prosperity and social justice going hand in hand. My former employer, the World Bank, called the European Union a lifestyle superpower because of the standards we have established for our citizens – standards in gender equality, in public health and in the environment, and above all in our welfare system. Our challenge is to adapt this model to a world which is changing much faster than in the years that you and I were born.  With this in mind – the need to constantly adapt – we at the Commission have launched a proposal for a European pillar of social rights. It sets out principles and practices to ensure that work is decent and fair and that we meet our goals of equal opportunity, fair conditions and proper social protection. It is about delivering fairness for individuals and also building resiliency into our labour market and our economy. By revealing the gaps in the current legislation, the pillar will show what measures we still need to take. Let me make one final point.

It is good to hear a Social Democratic Prime Minister, as well as other representatives of Sweden, so clearly emphasize that Sweden is behind European cooperation, strong and stable.  We live in a time when the crises come from outside – Russia, Syria, Russia in Syria, ISIS, terrorism, the climate issue, the refugees – and present the fundamental values of our society to great challenges. It is only through a strong Europe that we can deal with this, and that is why I would like to say never: 'We have to solve all these problems next week, otherwise cooperation will have failed'.  We will need this cooperation for a very long time, because the problems we face are greater than the existence of a simple solution and a decision. Instead of always asking ourselves what europe can do for us, we have to ask ourselves what we can do for Europe. I know that wording has been used in the past, but that is what we have to do. On social issues, do not weaken European cooperation by taking them from the national parliaments to the European Parliament. Then we have the conflicts, then we get the over-regulation, then we get the bureaucracy that people around Europe turn against.  What is first said in the British debate, and which many of us in Sweden also share, is that there is too much bureaucracy. We are going to cut red tape and we are going to make things easier from here by removing a jungle of national regulations that hinder the development of the economy. A free trade agreement with the United States, stable public finances. I would like the Prime Minister to talk to those in his own groups who believe that you get more money by spending more money than you have. The refugee issue: our country has taken a very great responsibility there. We must ensure that there is a burden-sharing. We have to make sure we follow the rules. This also applies to the Öresund Bridge. When we introduce controls, we should follow the rules and not impose a carrier liability. As far as refugees are concerned, we must ensure that the other countries take responsibility, ensure that borders are complied with and ensure that the necessary responsibilities are assumed throughout Europe. With regard to Turkey: clear demands for democracy and freedom of the press. In this cooperation, we must make Turkey more democratic and more legally state-owned if we are to protect the people whose fates are at stake.

Well, I believe that the real battle for the future of Europe is not about military action. In Syria as elsewhere, the battle for Europe is first and foremost a battle for values. We must show that we can adapt the European Union to the global transformations of recent decades, without having lost, indeed strengthening, our values. Above all, there is a value that is above all: the value of solidarity, a word that in this Europe torn apart by nationalism and selfishness may no longer be fashionable but remains the foundation of the European Union. Solidarity and dignity were two values dear to Olof Palme, whose 30th anniversary we remembered a few days ago. I like to remember one of his sentences. Palme said , \"for us democracy is a matter of human dignity and human dignity is political freedom\". Dignity and solidarity. Solidarity means, first and foremost, solidarity with those who are oppressed and flee from wars. You mentioned impressive numbers: 80 000 refugees from Sweden. Thank you, Prime Minister!  It is clear that, faced with the new international context, states alone cannot cope and Europe is needed. Sweden, Germany or Italy or another Member State cannot do everything on their own. We need a common European asylum system in addition to a review of Dublin, as you have indicated. Solidarity today means fighting for the social Europe that you rightly mentioned: not a Europe that divides workers, but a union that unites them, giving them the same protections. This means recognising that all workers, whatever their nationality, are paid for the same work.

Mr President, I would like to thank the Three weeks ago in Strasbourg, we were talking about two Members who were talking about firing orders outside the House. I wanted to tell you that yesterday the group leadership of our group decided to encourage these two Members to leave our group by 31 March. (Applause) Prime Minister, this is the first time that I have received applause from this side of the House, and probably the last time, Prime Minister, you have mentioned twice that you were born in 1957. In 1957, as a hamburger, I cycled to Gothenburg for the first time without gear shifts and was enthusiastic about your country. Today I must also shout to you three times: happy Swede!  For the first time, because your government steadfastly refuses to adopt the euro. In 1998, as President of the Federation of German Industries, I was invited to the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce to promote the euro. Well, the Swedish people were smarter than Swedish industry and, I have to say, wiser than I was. In Sweden, the population was allowed to vote on the euro – in Germany, people are allowed to vote on a railway station. Whether it's unemployment, economic growth or public debt, Sweden is doing much better than the eurozone.  You, Prime Minister, are showing not only the social democratic party friends here, but all the Euromantics in this Parliament, that a currency must correspond to the fiscal cultures of the country and that we should stop subjecting the different fiscal cultures to the needs of a currency. You also show that small can be beautiful, and you also show that Europe suffers not from too little, but from too much.  Second, you have chosen a responsible refugee policy in Sweden. As a long-standing member of Amnesty International, I know how difficult you have been to control your borders now. Prime Minister, that was not irresponsible, as many here accuse you, that was responsible. Of the asylum seekers or applications registered in Europe last year, 72.3% were men. What this can mean for some municipalities in terms of social policy, I do not want to say here – Cologne, for example. But I want to talk about something else. Has anyone here ever thought about what it means for these men to leave their wives, their daughters, their mothers, their sisters alone and unprotected? By the way, most of these refugees came from areas that are not currently contested, but from undoubtedly precarious but safe camps. Has anyone ever thought about how many people put their lives in danger or lost because they accepted the invitation of the German Government and believed in the promises of irresponsible smugglers? This brings me to the third reason to say 'happy Sweden' here today. In the euro and refugee policy, the German government has driven not only its own people, but also Europe, into a dead end with its policy of attitude. By contrast, the Swedish Government is pursuing a policy of responsibility.

It's nice that you're sharing this afternoon with us. As you know, Sweden is a medium-sized Member State of the EUROPEAN Union, and I would urge the Prime Minister to take advantage of this. I know that you in the Swedish Government agree with me that the Dublin Regulation, that is, the cornerstone of a functioning European asylum policy, must be reformed. I will lead that work here in Parliament and look forward to our continued cooperation on this. But now I ask you, Stefan Löfven, to take the lead in the Council of Ministers and convince the other governments of the need to create a solidarity-based, sustainable asylum policy in the EU. That is the only way we can jointly bring about real change that is needed now more than ever. Unfortunately, Sweden has gone from being a country that has dared to take battles in the Council of Ministers, and which with weight and credibility in asylum and migration issues has been able to influence other Member States in the right direction, to the fact that nowadays is increasingly regarded as a country that is rather passively following the current and repeats the mantra: \"people on the run are the responsibility of someone else and not ours\". That is not how we lead the work towards common European responsibility. The agreement with Turkey on Monday will not resolve the situation in the long term. There is much evidence that the essential elements of it are contrary to the Geneva Convention and also to the EU Treaties. Even if many of the people who are now trying to get to europe are stopped, they will find other ways to get to Europe and not everyone can stay in Greece. If we do not have a European asylum policy in which everyone participates, no Member State will be able to do this. We will see repeated examples of the Greek tragedy taking place across europe. Instead of outsourcing our responsibility for the refugees to Turkey, the EU should now secure its own external borders, create legal safe routes for refugees and secure an asylum system in which responsibility is shared fairly among all 28 countries. Migration cooperation with Turkey can only work if there is a common border guard and a common asylum policy.  Stefan Löfven, take the initiative now and build good coalitions with the other countries. Show leadership and tell us which countries in the Council are putting a spanner in the works. Now the happy days in the Council of Ministers must be over, because we have a good Swedish practice of openness and transparency that should guide the Council as well.

Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating Mr Prime Minister, welcome to the European Parliament!  Sweden has taken great responsibility in 2015 for receiving people on the run. That is right and good, but then something happened in the autumn and you made a case with the right-wing opposition parties about closing our borders. I think that was the wrong decision, but that is not what we are going to debate here.  The important thing today is that we face the same situation and the same challenge at European level. Should Europe accept refugees and organise a dignified reception, or should we argue that europe too needs breathing space and closing its borders? What role will Sweden play in that choice? For me, the answers are obvious, Prime Minister.  The EU as a whole has received a prosely small proportion of the people who are on the run today. We should, of course, share and receive more, dignified, and I believe, of course, that Sweden should be a leader in this development, in a political change of course for the EU that ensures that we do not close our borders.  Unfortunately, I do not see enough of that role in the Council. Let me be clear, a new superborder police with extraordinary powers to forcibly reject and act in third countries and intervene without consent in a Member State is not a solution. NATO patrols in the Mediterranean are not a solution and, last but not least, the deal with Turkey with mass expulsions is not a solution. Refugees are not fishing quotas that we unload and unload. It is people of flesh and blood who have fled and left everything in conflict.  Prime Minister, I'm not naïve. I see that it is not possible to get Orbán and some other countries on board. The EU-28 has reached the end of the road, whatever people here say, both morally and politically. That is why you need a plan B based on a coalition of willing Member States, which wants to take the lead in close cooperation with the UNHCR, who was here yesterday and spoke very wisely. You can use the European institutions even in a smaller coalition.  Finally, it is not worthy of a Social Democratic government here in Europe or in any country to set refugees against welfare. It only plays into the hands of the racists, and you cannot work with them. We do not yet know what 2016 will be, but it is pretty much up to us here and up to you in the Council.

A little thought about what else there are besides the refugee question, I think that is very, very necessary for us. I would also like to thank you, Sweden, your country, because I believe that you have been doing better refugee policy in the European Union for a long time, not just in the crisis of last year. And when you returned to border controls, my impression was: Aha, that is now the wake-up call from Sweden. The Swedes say that we can no longer, we are resorting to a means that we do not want, but we want a European solution. However, the search for this European solution has continued ever since, and this closure of borders has developed almost in the snowball system. I do not know how much time we have left to deal with it. We are dealing with global changes and global challenges, and in the European Council it looks as if we are thinking that we have a lot of time. I would like to know from you whether it is not time at some point to say that a group of states is moving forward in certain areas of refugee policy and saying that we are the group of states that is actually prepared to provide solidarity with each other in terms of taking in more refugees. Everything we discuss with Turkey is to be criticised. It is partly a small step forward. But where do we end up if we cannot distribute refugees behind management on an external border between Turkey and Greece? I believe that what you said in your speech is incredibly important, that we in the European Union manage to turn against new fears and against fear-mongers. Mr Henkel, if you apologise now for your achievements in introducing the euro, I do not want to know what kind of sin register you have as the chief lobbyist of the Federation of German Industries. But a sin that really is not plead is the founding of the Alternative for Germany, because you have thus laid the foundation in Germany for the fact that this climate of fear and incitement has also become much worse for us. Europeans must then start to fear when they are no longer able to act together in the face of the global challenges that the refugees have brought to us, which we have tried to displace time and again. And we need to talk about this common action. The demands on the richer and more stable countries of the world will not diminish, but will become more. Yesterday, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees actually gave us another good global overview. In the face of the escalation by Putin and Assad in Syria, we have clearly seen that this war will not end quickly. As Europeans, we will only get out of these catastrophic intensifications well together, we will only show solidarity if we also show solidarity with others.

Mr Prime Minister, building a wall or closing a border does not end the migrant crisis. All it does is more inhumane the desperate flight of men, women and children, and it dehumanizes us Europeans. We Europeans are equal in difficulty and we must be, it is true, equal in responsibility. That is why we support a common immigration and asylum policy here, which is why here we support a common management of our external borders, in order to protect the Schengen area. National solutions do not solve European problems, on the contrary. That is precisely why Europe exists; because, at present, national solutions do not even solve national problems. For example, his Government unilaterally decides to reintroduce border controls, including forcibly for private transport companies to conduct examinations, to identify those they transport. For example, your Government has approved the possibility of suspending Schengen for three years, when the rule only allows a two-year suspension. These, Mr Prime Minister, are national, popular, defensive solutions, and they are insufficient solutions which, surely, in your opinion, are good for Sweden. The Socialists of this House, like the greens of this House, like us, are defending a Europe without borders. Even this morning they spoken very harshly against the agreement with Turkey. His Government, however, has once again erected barriers to the migrant crisis in the face of the refugee crisis. Which one of us is the real socialist discourse? Which one of us is the real green speech? Europe must be built little by little because, when we stop building Europe, nationalism grows again, and with nationalism always xenophobia, with nationalism fanaticism always grows and populism grows. Europe's motto is \"United in Diversity\", but today it must also be \"United – not separated – in adversity\". Mr Prime Minister, you have asked for a more social Europe, but it draws my attention that, at the same time calling for a more social Europe, when faced with the most social of problems, which is the flight of refugees, it once again raises its borders.

It's good and it's important. You hear how the walking legends and all the completely unreasonable claims fly through the air. They often do in this House, and that's why it's so nice to have you here. I would like to return to talking about inequality, the one that is growing throughout Europe. We currently have 23 million registered openly unemployed and we know that in reality there are many more. All over Europe – and yes, even in this room – there are those who think that, in this situation, we should face this crisis, this unemployment with low wages and worse conditions and that we should have a labour market that is segregated both between European citizens and the new arrivals who come here, who at the same time should have even worse conditions. This is despite the fact that it leads to even greater inequalities and even more unequal, unfair conditions in the labour market. We Social Democrats want to put an end to social dumping, of wage dumping. After all, competition with poorer conditions and low wages is dragging down everyone, not just those who are at the forefront. Commission President Juncker has put it as 'no social dumping - equal pay for equal work'. It must be a given, but I feel this way: can we really trust That Juncker can make this a real deal? I'm sure he believes it, but does he have the power to make it a reality? Today, there are too many who lack confidence in the ability of politics. They turn to extreme parties, ones that you hear noises and rumbles up there – they are like the AIK heel, if I suddenly think about what it looks like at home, and sometimes it is worse. They turn to extreme parties, voters who do not think they are getting answers to their questions. If we do not manage to push back unemployment and stop social dumping, we run the risk of even more people giving up on politics and turning to the extremists. It can't happen. Yesterday, the Commission presented various proposals to strengthen a social Europe. It was about a change in the posting of workers directive, about giving back power to the social partners, about jobs and education.

You come to us at a time that is quite difficult for the European Union. We have been grappling with a climate challenge where we need to find our solutions for the future. We are grappling with a migration challenge where we must also find our solutions, and we are also grappling with an increasingly fractured Europe marked by a Brexit debate and an increasing number of populists spreading across the European Union. That is why I am glad that you are here and that is why our debate today is very, very important.  I would like to begin by praising the Prime Minister, because I have rarely heard you as clearly as you were just now in your speech on migration policy. You were clear that if we have taken joint decisions, there must also be consequences if we do not follow them. I think it was very honourable for the Prime Minister to take the leader's jersey there, because I have asked for that many times, most recently in recent days in the media. At the same time, we have seen quite clearly how the Council has taken decisions on several occasions with which nothing is happening. This risks making the Council an impotent part of the European Union. What difference does it make what decisions we take here or in the Council if it is not actually the workshop of those decisions? The area of migration is just one of the areas where we must ensure that the decisions taken also receive political delivery. What I have more doubts about, however, is the idea of social Europe. Is it not the case that the Prime Minister himself was involved in talks with David Cameron, thereby declaring social Europe dead? What started there was of course to roll back what the Social Democrats have been pushing in the election campaign, what has been one of the government's parade branches. I am thinking about how the Prime Minister sees it being connected, the work that the Prime Minister himself did with David Cameron and what he said in this House? I am a little worried that the Social Democrats have lost their idea for Europe. Like my colleague Gunnar Hökmark, I am keen that the Social Democrats support a strong Europe. It was the Social Democratic Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson who brought Sweden into Europe. It was the Social Democratic Prime Minister Goran Persson who embraced the enlargement of the EU. It was the nonsocialist Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt who brought Sweden to the heart of the European cooperation.

I think it is very good that you have come here and say that we are at a very critical time in the European Union, and we must do something to ensure that we get out of this together, and we can only do that if this is done in solidarity and really democratically and together. But then it also says: yes, we need a social Europe. At the same time, however, as a member of the Council – and as I am addressing you here – you are partly responsible for the fact that a deal has been struck with the United Kingdom that not only puts this social Europe to the test, but also puts away an essential side of this social Europe. I think it is very worrying that we are now putting to the test important regulations, which we have just found in connection with the free movement of workers from the Member States of the European Union, and finally to say that we are suspending one of these essential pillars – including the fundamental freedoms of the European Union. In this context, I would also like to say that if colleagues here say that there is a contradiction among you by saying that we want a social Europe and, on the other hand, you want to advocate a common solution to the refugee issue, then I say that this is precisely what belongs together. We will never achieve a democratic, social Europe if we start to share human rights, divide them by nation, by country of origin, and when we say that we are not coming together and trying to resolve this together. I expect you – and Here I fully agree with my colleague Malin Björk, who spoke earlier – that we expect you to take the first step.

I would therefore like to ask the Prime Minister a few questions about this.  Greece believes that Turkey should be regarded as a safe country on these issues, but Sweden does not. But surely the EU should have a common position on this issue? Otherwise, it is the choice that determines whether the refugee should be sent back, not where you come from or whether you have asylum reasons. If the Greek road is effectively closed, what other routes will people choose instead? Are they safer? Is there any analysis on this? Are you sure this agreement won't make the situation even worse for those fleeing?

Is there an idea of how the Swedish government will work to clear this up? And finally, a more personal question for you, Stefan.

Prime Minister, you are coming with a strong pro-European voice, building on the Swedish experience. Sweden does, of course, have several problems, but it remains one of the best examples to be followed in the European Union as a whole. First of all, when it comes to democracy, as you have just mentioned, you have high standards of representative democracy in Sweden.  Secondly, Sweden remains one of the best examples of how we can push for sustainable development combining the economic, social and environmental dimensions while delivering a stronger recovery with good jobs. Finally, Sweden remains a good example of a high degree of engagement with international responsibilities. I know that you are very committed to working for a global new deal.  Of course, in spite of the problems, Sweden remains a very important positive example as to how to integrate the refugees. Well let me say that I recently went again to Sweden to get some inspiration and I would like to tell the House what I saw. Sweden is managing a very big flow of refugees. Firstly, I saw refugees being received decently at the border; secondly, I saw them being distributed across the country in many municipalities, where they could find decent housing and access to basic social services. Then I saw very well—organised programmes for retraining and integrating refugees into the labour market. So that was the reality which I saw in Sweden.

I hope you have found the debate of the last hour interesting, general and fruitful. You are talking about a social Europe, but you did not mention the elephant in the room. The EU has a misconstructed and dysfunctional monetary union that has helped exacerbate the economic crisis and keep millions of people in unemployment. It is clear that Sweden made the right decision when we turned down the possibility of joining EMU in our referendum. But I often hear from Members of this House that Sweden does not have the right to remain free from monetary union for as long as possible. They do not respect the choice of the Swedish people, and I believe that in the long term it would be good and safer if Sweden were given a clear treaty-based derogation from EMU, just as many other countries have. I also believe that, in the long term, we need to ensure that good conditions are created for all those countries of the European Union that do not want to join monetary union.

Naturally, I cannot answer everyone but I will do my best to give my view on the different things that have been raised.  First, to Gunnar Hökmark. My point is not to deliver a lot of new rules that will burden companies, when I talk about social Europe, but my point is this: we have a common economy, we have a common labour market and in this labour market we need a future for those who are working, those who are actually delivering the wealth that we are trying to distribute , and I cannot see the smart thing in showing people a negative future – your wages will perhaps go down, your working conditions might worsen. That is not the future that the European people are looking for.  We have a common interest, a common responsibility to make sure that the European labour market is guided by some very important values and, at the same time, give the different countries the possibility to rule in the way they see fit. But the Laval case we saw in 2007 – the ruling on the Laval case showing that the Swedish trade unions could not defend collective agreements – that was wrong.  It would have been very easy to say, of course, if Sweden has collective agreements then protect them as long as you do not discriminate against anyone who comes into the country, but if the workers, the employees of Europe, are looking at a future when they are supposed to compete with lower wages, then I can assure you that those people will not be in favour of this cooperation.  So let us promise ourselves, one another, that we should develop a labour market in Europe that is a promising future, and let us realise that those women and men who go to work every day, they are the ones who really make a difference and they are the ones to whom we should be giving good conditions and a future.  There have been a lot of interventions of course about the refugee crisis. My message is this. We have and we will have refugees in the world, unfortunately. The problem, as some say, is that this is Sweden’s problem; Sweden has caused the problem because we received refugees. The problem is the crisis in Syria and the crisis in the Middle East that forces people to flee because they are afraid, they are terrorised, they are in the middle of a war. That is the real problem. And I think it is a human thing to say to people who are fleeing for their lives that yes, we need to help you.  We can do that in different ways. We need to help to solve the problem that causes the people to actually have to flee. That is the root thing. You have to help people in the neighbourhood, yes, but those who actually arrive – are you going to shut the door? Some parties think so. I think it is human to say that we also need to help people who are fleeing for their lives.  And we are in this organisation together, 28 member countries, and if we had done this together we would have solved it. It would not have been a problem. We are 508 million inhabitants on this continent. We could have solved it together. And it is alright for some to say that they will not participate. If they choose to do that, my point is that I think it is fair to say that if you do not participate in this system, the asylum system, perhaps you should not participate in the Schengen system. You cannot just choose the good things, the easy things, and sit in the quiet easy corner. You need sometimes to step up and also do the tricky things, the difficult things. We want a future system that actually distributes the responsibility amongst 28 Member States. Someone asked whether I believed this would happen. I am not sure, I do not know, because I hear the resistance, yes, but this is the only way for the European Union to function well: that we help one another, we assist one another, and those who do not want to participate should consider another thing. If this does not work it will affect the whole European Union, also affecting those who are now sitting in the backseat doing nothing. It will affect them as well. If we want an efficient, really working European Union we need to cooperate also on these difficult issues. That is my point, and I think we need to be clear with one another.  Regarding the agreement with Turkey, yes, I think it is right to do this. I think we need to find a solution, to find that and to have that cooperation with Turkey, otherwise I would not have supported it. I cannot answer all the detailed questions but what would that mean?  President Tusk is now being given a mandate, we gave him a mandate, to negotiate on these principles that we want this trafficking of human beings to stop. We need to do something about it, because those who are against everything also need to show the alternatives. The reality right now is that thousands and thousands of people are risking their lives on the water, in the sea, and we have people that are selling these trips who do not care at all about these lives. We have at least so far, more than 400 people, perhaps 500 people today who have died so far this year, and I think we need to stop it.  This is one way of going. It is not the only solution. No, it is not the only solution but it is one of the things that we need to do and now let us see what the negotiations will bring. We will see that result and then we will discuss it, but I think it is the right thing to do.  I was asked also about the Posting of Workers Directive and the changes, and will that solve everything, if I understood the question correctly. No it will not solve everything but it is a very good step forward, to show the employees, and the employers I would say, of Europe, that we can develop a European labour market that is functioning and that respects collective agreements, or legislation or whatever we choose to develop in our respective countries.  But no matter what way we choose as individual countries the European Union should give that platform, should give that possibility. For our country it means respecting the collective agreement. This is a path that we have chosen. It has been a good path, it has been a very efficient one with wealth, with growth, but also with quite a fair distribution between the citizens of our country and I would like to stick to that path. Therefore, I think what the Commission has proposed now is very good. It is a step forward. It will bring more hope to the employees, the workers of Europe and I think that is a very good start.

This very small country in the Horn of Africa is – or continues to be, I have to say – in the headlines because many people are fleeing the country on a monthly basis, many of them to Europe, seeking a better life without political oppression, a better life and better employment opportunities. And yes, we are deeply concerned about the gross human rights violations.  Respect for human rights is a basic principle of the EU’s foreign policy and it is part of our political dialogues with governments around the world, including with the Eritrean authorities. Through this dialogue, but also publicly, we raise our concerns about violations of human rights obligations and reaffirm the need for Eritrea to respect fundamental democratic rights.  We have also repeatedly requested concrete gestures, such as freeing prisoners detained incommunicado since 2001, among them Mr Dawit Isaak, a Swedish Eritrean citizen, and we will continue to do so at all levels and on all occasions.  The EU also raises issues related to the human rights situation in Eritrea in international fora, notably at meetings of the UN Human Rights Council. We appeal to Eritrea to cooperate with the UN Special Rapporteur and the UN Commission of Inquiry on Eritrea and give them access to the country. Let me underline that we believe that a critical engagement with the country is still the best option for the EU for a number of reasons. Firstly, because critical engagement creates the possibility to stress the need for concrete changes and progress across the board, and it gives us the possibility to insist on the importance of adhering to international standards on human rights. Isolation rarely helps in these circumstances. A second reason why we think that critical engagement with the country is useful is the fight against poverty. Regardless of the nature of the political regime, the EU is committed to supporting the population and improving its living conditions through development projects; so no budget support. A lot needs to be done to alleviate the huge stress upon Eritrea’s population.  Eritreans are facing a problematic food security situation and lack of economic opportunities. Their despair translates into a constantly high rate of people, especially young people, trying to flee the country. They often venture on a dangerous journey, mainly towards Europe, by illegal means and are easy prey for traffickers.  This is why EU development aid under the 11th European Development Fund (the EDF) will support social and economic development in Eritrea. The programme foresees increasing access to renewable energy and supports economic governance, which will in turn contribute to economic growth and the creation of job opportunities. Under the EDF programme EU engagement also foresees measures to improve the human rights situation in Eritrea. There is a third element to take into account. The country has a strategic position in the Horn of Africa, bordering Sudan, Ethiopia and Djibouti, as well as the Red Sea with its access to the Arabian Peninsula. A peaceful and stable Eritrea and an Eritrea that respects its neighbours will have a positive impact on the overall situation in this region.  The conflict in Yemen and the tensions in the Arab world are changing dynamics in the Horn of Africa and our critical engagement should therefore also be seen in this regional context. The policy of isolation has not worked. Direct EU support to improve the living conditions of the populations also make them less prone to radicalisation and violent extremism. It is also in this framework that we want to engage with Eritrea, thus contributing to regional peace and stability.  Let me conclude by addressing the issue of migration and asylum. The constant high outflow of migrants and asylum seekers from Eritrea is a major challenge. Eritrea is a key country of origin. Eritrean asylum seekers are generally recognised for international protection in the EU with a very high acceptance rate – understandably so – but Eritrea is also an active partner in the Khartoum Process which addresses, among other things, human rights issues, as well as border management and migration management.  By discussing the human rights record and improving the livelihoods of the people of Eritrea, our engagement is expected to address some of the push factors for migration. This is part of our comprehensive response to the current migration crisis. Let me say clearly that we engage with Eritrea for the sake of its people and I would like to stress that once again. Yes, the critical engagement is also in our own interest. It is the only way to try to help move things in the right direction. In Eritrea or elsewhere, critical engagement based on a good understanding of the dynamics and challenges is a pragmatic way to help promote positive change.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Liberals and centrists"}, {"id": 1623, "date": "2016-03-09.json", "name": "Davor Ivo STIER", "mepid": "119435", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Club.

For the most part, all political groups were skeptical of the Commission's idea of giving development aid and asked the Commission if it came to this point that this cooperation must focus on issues of good rule and respect for human rights, as it is the dictatorial regime's systematic violation of human rights that makes people flee Eritrea to Europe.  The programme proposed by the Commission shortly afterwards focuses on energy investments and, in a small part, in effective governance in the energy sector and therefore did not reflect the conclusions of our debate in Parliament.

We have thousands of political prisoners whose family members are not informed about what is going on in the prisons and what the state of the detainees is. We must also mention that Eritrea is constantly justifying the state of emergency on domestic political grounds and saying that we have problems with Ethiopia, and that is why we are basically in a state of war.

But you know, the decision to significantly increase the European aid package to Eritrea is, in my opinion, a gross error of judgement. It also goes against the recommendation and the position of this Parliament. The European Commission attributes the exodus from the country mainly to the economic situation. Error! It thus ignores the real suffering of the Eritrean people. President Afewerki's Eritrea is one of the most totalitarian states in the world. An open prison where the population lives in permanent fear. Arbitrary arrests, torture, extrajudicial killings are the rule. No free speech, freedom of association or religious freedom. There is a mandatory military service for an indefinite period. From an early age, children have been recruited by this military regime. Education does not know these young people, their future is brutally taken away from them. Against this background of gross human rights violations, you have to explain the large flow of refugees to Europe. I see no intention whatsoever with the authorities to really improve the fate of the population. More European money will only enable them to continue their dictatorial repressive practices. Is that what we want? The people will not benefit from our money if it does not serve clear development objectives and if there are no conditions for respect for human rights. And there's more.

Today we are debating a resolution affecting hundreds of thousands of people seeking refuge and asylum fleeing a country, Eritrea, which offers them no more opportunities than labour slavery. Today we are debating the two hundred million that the European Union is going to donate to the Eritrean Government over the next five years: will it serve to help Eritreans think of anything other than leaving their country?  Ladies and gentlemen, we cannot give that money once again, without guaranteeing that it will not go to a government that systematically violates human rights as few do in the world.  Madam Minister, the Committee on Development of this Parliament, of which I am a member, made it clear last November to the Commission and the European External Action Service that the Indicative Programme should not be adopted as there were serious doubts that this money would be used for the purpose for which it was intended. The position of this institution, chosen directly by the citizens we serve, was ignored.  This position is based on facts such as those reported by the United Nations Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in Eritrea, which ensures that military service is used to enslave the population at work.  Precisely, Madam Minister, one of the commitments Eritrea made to the European Union to receive the two hundred million was to limit military service to eighteen months. Just two weeks ago, the government said it has no intention of doing so.  I would like to ask the Commission: have you found any way to ensure that European taxpayers' money is not going to go back into the hands of one of the worst dictators on Earth?  Development aid must be a finalist, and we are responsible for weaving programmes that help solve the structural problems of the poorest countries. We need to be wary of the use of funds and, above all, maintain proper conditionality and inexcusable respect for human rights.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 1627, "date": "2016-03-09.json", "name": "Marie-Christine VERGIAT", "mepid": "96858", "text": "  on behalf of the GUE/NGL group.

There are no state structures other than security. No NGO can work there. How will aid reach the population? How can electrification projects be implemented without primarily serving the interests of a few multinationals? What political dialogue with leaders who have just declared that the European Union's aid will have no impact on the duration of national service, contrary to their very small promises?

I hope I have your assurance, Minister – and there is nobody here from the Commission, I hope we get their assurance also – that this does not happen again. This is a very serious decision and I hope that when the spending and annual action programmes come forward Parliament will be involved in these matters. Secondly, Minister, you said that the money will go to tackle poverty, but 87% of the funding is due to be allocated to energy projects – but to whom is the money going? There is no private sector in Eritrea. Who is getting the money? That is what we need to know. Finally, you said our response is part of a current response to the migration crisis – that makes me even more sceptical. The number of Eritreans getting refugee status in my country is going down. And let us be clear: the Eritreans who come are refugees from an appalling political system – they are not migrants.

All of them contribute to the number of refugees in the world reaching already 60 million people, more or less the population of a country such as France or the United Kingdom.

The EU will support, and continue to support, implementation of the recommendations made to Eritrea under the UN-led Universal Periodic Review.  Now, development assistance – and I noted many remarks about this specific issue – is implemented on the basis of projects that are tailor-made to address the needs of the population in Eritrea: to create jobs, reduce poverty. There is no support to the central government. The process of approving and implementing EU projects is carried out transparently, following EU and European Development Fund rules at all stages. Furthermore, projects are being strictly monitored, following the EU financial and auditing regulations. The benefit of the funding – this was raised several times – will be for the Eritrean people. Let me stress it once more: there is no such thing as support to the central government. I am conscious, as was pointed out, of the very difficult political context in which we are operating when engaging with Eritrea. We will review our engagement at regular intervals, taking stock of how far we have progressed and how serious the government is in reforming its system. The High Representative, Ms Mogherini, will report on such progress, or lack of it, to you. So it is not at all my intention to ignore Parliament. Be assured that we will continue to follow very closely the development of the human rights situation in Eritrea and the country’s role in the region. As I said at the beginning, we engage with Eritrea for the sake of its people. One thing is sure: further isolation will not help the Eritrean people.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Liberals and centrists"}, {"id": 1653, "date": "2016-03-09.json", "name": "Ryszard CZARNECKI", "mepid": "28372", "text": "   I have received seven motions for resolutions tabled in accordance with Rule 123(2) of the Rules of Procedure.

There was incredible sadness in their faces, the hopelessness of people who were forced to leave their homeland, relatives and embarked on an uncertain journey in the hope of a better chance of life for their children. It was just a small group of refugees from six million Eritreans, but since meeting them, the question has arisen: Is it just an authoritarian state that forces them to leave their own country, not even multinational corporations and the globalisation policy of rich states that exploits the poorest?

In 2015 the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia faced one of its most severe political crises, which was marked by a divisive political culture, backsliding on freedom of expression and judicial independence, as well as further erosion of trust in public institutions. It is now essential to overcome this crisis and to ensure that these shortcomings will be addressed decisively. The June-July Pržino political agreement reached among the political leaders, as well as the urgent reform priorities which have been issued by the Commission, provide the blueprint for what needs to be done. We have taken good note of the decision to postpone the early parliamentary elections to 5 June, given that necessary conditions for holding credible elections on 24 April were not in place. It will now be essential for all political actors to live up to their responsibility and to take the necessary measures, including the election—related media reform. A constructive and inclusive political dialogue within the country will be crucial in order to move forward.  Obviously the holding of credible elections in which all citizens and parties freely participate is a first major step towards ending the ongoing political crisis. We are closely monitoring this process in cooperation with the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights.  Let me also commend the close cooperation between the EU actors, necessary to pave the way out of the country’s political crisis. I want to mention in particular Commissioner Hahn’s substantive engagement and to thank him very much, and to thank as well the three Members of this House, Mr Vajgl, Mr Howitt and Mr Kukan.  Sustainable reforms to address systematic values in the areas of the rule of law, public administration, protection of fundamental rights and media freedom, as well as the fight against corruption, continue to remain central for the country’s path towards the EU. Let me also reiterate the importance of an independent investigation of all the allegations brought to the fore by the wiretapping affair. The Special Prosecutor and the parliamentary committee of inquiry need to be supported in their work. Equally, I want to repeat the Council’s call for the Kumanovo events of May 2015 to be fully investigated in an objective and transparent manner.  On migration let me commend the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia for its efforts in addressing the refugee and migration crisis last year. For some weeks now several unilateral decisions and regional coordinated responses have been put in place along the western Balkan route. On 18 February the European Council was very clear that only through concerted action can we address the challenge in a proper manner. There is no alternative to a comprehensive European solution. And yes, it is very important that the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, as our neighbouring and candidate country, plays its part in this process.  The EU is providing – and will continue to provide – significant support to the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in order to strengthen border controls and to improve border and asylum management. The same goes for several Member States which do it on a bilateral level. Finally, let me underline that good neighbourly relations, including a negotiated and mutually accepted solution to the name issue under the auspices of the UN, remain central for the stability of the region. The accession process of the country is at a critical juncture. The Commission has stated its readiness to extend its recommendation to open accession negotiations. These shall, however, be conditional on the continued implementation of the June—July political agreement and on substantial progress in the implementation of the urgent reform priorities.  The Council will refer to the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia after its elections.

I would also like to say thanks once again to three Members of your Parliament – Mr Vajgl, Mr Kukan and Mr Howitt – for their unceasing work on and with this country and its key players in order to facilitate, together with us, a political agreement last summer. It was – and is – crucial and essential that we are helping the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to address the political challenge they are facing and that we are keeping the political agreement alive in the months afterwards.  The three MEPs paid a visit only two weeks ago, following a letter from the EU delegation and the US Ambassador, to the Prime Minister, presenting our joint view that the conditions for organising credible elections on 24 April were not in place. With the EU delegation, your colleagues brokered a deal among the political leaders to postpone the date of the early parliamentary elections from 24 April to 5 June. I would like to stress how important it is that the European Parliament has played its role to engage with the country and to help in the democratic process. I hope it will be possible to be present with observers around the election day. I also would like to take this opportunity to thank Parliament’s Committee on Foreign Affairs, and rapporteur Ivo Vajgl in particular, for the resolution which is before you today for adoption. I find it balanced and in line with the main findings of our 2015 Report on the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. As you all know, the reporting period was very challenging for the country. I am convinced, however, that our report struck the right balance. On the one hand, we acknowledged that the country has a good level of preparation in developing a functioning market economy. It also has a relatively good level of alignment with the acquis. This means that the right laws and strategies are more or less in place. The issue, as in all these countries, is the application and implementation, as well as the will to take if necessary hard decisions. On the other hand, the country has faced the most severe political crisis in years. The parliament was boycotted by the main opposition party for more than a year. The situation deteriorated further with the publication of intercepted conversations which suggests that the system has been undermined by political interference and high-level corruption.  In order to overcome this political crisis, we adopted a two-track approach. Firstly, the political agreement, which was reached by the four political leaders last summer, as mentioned, was a decisive step forward. Some commitments have been met within the agreed deadlines. The main opposition party returned to the parliament and the special prosecutor was appointed in September. I regret that some other deadlines have been met with considerable delay and required active involvement from the European Union.  In parallel to the political agreement in June last year, we presented a set of urgent reform priorities aiming at addressing underlying rule of law issues. Once again, political will is key to progress on these priorities. In our report, we stated that the Commission is prepared to extend its recommendation to open accession negotiations with the country conditional on the continued implementation of the June/July political agreement and substantial implementation of the urgent reform priorities. We are monitoring these issues constantly and will report on this in due course.  As you rightly pointed out in your resolution, the inter-ethnic situation remains fragile in the country. Proactive measures should be undertaken to address inter-ethnic issues and to build greater trust between communities. In this respect, the review of the Ohrid Framework Agreement needs to be completed.  Good neighbourly relations are also essential for the country. Resolving the name issue remains a priority. The country is also on the front line of Europe’s unprecedented refugee and migration crisis, and the Commission remains committed to continue to help the country in this challenge.

Let me say right from the outset that, on behalf of all three colleagues, I would like to express my sincere thanks for the lovely words you have given to our cooperation. It has been a great pleasure to work with all of us, Commissioner.  The resolution on Macedonia, drawn up together with the excellent shadow rapporteurs, the Secretariat and colleagues who have tabled some 300 amendments, will be adopted at a critical time for this country. Not only is he waiting too long at the door of the European Union as a candidate, but she is facing the challenge these days of the thousands of refugees at the borders who want to go to the Union along the Balkan route, and we are looking for the means to cut this way. On 5 June, there will be early parliamentary elections in Macedonia to end the political crisis. If the elections are in accordance with democratic standards, then it will be time for the Commission to submit and the Council finally confirms the opening of negotiations on Macedonia's accession to the Union under the same conditions previously in force in the enlargement process. Macedonia largely fulfils the acquis conditions, demonstrates satisfactory economic stability and growth, is active in developing good-neighbouring relations and is acting proactively when it comes to building trust with the countries with which it has open problems - Greece and Bulgaria. In the resolution, as before, in the Commission's report to which we are responding, we pointed to the problems revealed by the eavesdropping affair. The consistent exasification of these anomalies is in line with the so-called The Pržinski agreements are entrusted to the special prosecutor's office and is a prerequisite for building trust and functioning of the country's democratic system. The same applies to the urgent reforms envisaged by the agreement of the political parties, which was created with the intervention of the European Union, the Commission, in particular Commissioner Hahn, and with the participation of the us diplomatic representatives and three mediators, members of the European Parliament.  I would also particularly underscore the need to open up the media space in accordance with the principles of democratic and creative opinion. Dear colleagues, it is time for Macedonia to take a new step towards Euro-Atlantic integration, and my ALDE Group supports this.

But there is a grave political crisis where Europe’s commitment is not questioned but where the democratic commitment in the country very much is. So in our vote tomorrow we will send some very clear messages. As Mr Hahn has repeated this afternoon, the Commission has made the positive recommendation to start the EU accession talks contingent on full implementation of the Pržino inter-party agreement, which we helped to negotiate. The European Council has supported him in their December conclusions and tomorrow this Parliament will stand squarely with them and say, preserve your democracy or the positive recommendation is withdrawn.  After the latest set of talks in which we were involved last month, when the ruling VMRO Party claimed that we had agreed no further media reforms before the election and no further electoral assessments, as mediators and with clear statements from the EU and US Ambassadors, we put on record that these were not part of any agreement and the Dutch President-in-Office , I am grateful, has repeated that this afternoon.  The position of the Council and the Commission, to be fully supported by Parliament tomorrow, is that progress must continue to be made on urgent reforms and I note that the Commission has told us that there has been backsliding. I also note that the Special Prosecutor investigating the deep allegations of criminality against politicians has told us that she has not received the full cooperation which she needs from the country’s court system and in our vote tomorrow we reiterate that she must be given full powers and autonomy to undertake her work.  I and my Group will not join those who use the fact that this country is at the heart of the refugee crisis in order to attack it. We do insist on solidarity with Skopje to match the solidarity needed from all countries if there is to be an adequate response. But tonight we do send a very tough message. A tough message that politicians are not yet fulfilling their obligations and that there is no alternative to them doing so. A tough message: not against the Macedonian people, but for them, for their democracy and for a better future for their country. We are sure that is what they want and their politicians must demonstrate that they want it too.

I would like to state categorically that I, as both a Bulgarian and the ECR Group, support fraternal Macedonia's aspiration striving for its membership of the European Union. But local authorities need to know that each candidate country is judged on merit, and the speed and quality of the necessary reforms set the timetable for its accession. There are reasonable doubts that Macedonia is in a political crisis, reforms are stalled, there are suspicions that the judiciary and political power are corrupt and the media is censored. The rights of some of the national communities, such as the Bulgarian one, are constantly being violated. This is not the progress we expect and steps need to be taken in this direction.  I have no doubt and there is no question that the Macedonian authorities should stop justifying the name problem, but start solving the political problems of the country. A step forward will be for the government to recognize the existence of a Bulgarian community and guarantee its rights and freedoms, make them full citizens of the state, stop forgery of our common history and stop using the language of hate. It is high time to see progress in the accession process, but this can be done by improving good neighbourly relations with the Member States of the European Union, which goes hand in hand with the necessary internal reforms.

In conclusion, I repeat: The nomenclature is not a bilateral issue between Greece and the FYLOM as expressed in the report.

Mr President, the reports in the European Parliament are definitely following and similar. In its expansionist will, the European Union always puts forward two demands which seem to condition the admission of new Member States more than others: membership of NATO, whose existence is no longer justified since the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact, and the promotion of gender ideology, with its procession of communitarian demands. For example, paragraph 22 of the resolution calls for following the union's so-called model - open quotation marks - \"in terms of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity\", a vague concept which justifies the delusions of obviously disturbed ideologues. However, your obsessions prevent you from seeing the real problems facing the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. You are talking about the Roma - those bands of merry troubadours that you want to see everywhere except, of course, in the gardens of your second homes - but not a word about the Albanians of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The latter, however, constitute a minority that is constantly growing in population and whose demands threaten the stability of the country, especially since Kosovo's self-proclaimed independence.

Remember: The process of integrating the FYLOM began with war, the dissolution of Yugoslavia, protectorate states of NATO and the European Union.

An assessment of whether it has actually complied with these European standards is quite contradictory. I speak from my own experience, I have travelled the Balkan route several times.

I think the political leaders of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia now have the responsibility to take the necessary steps to put their country back on the Euro-Atlantic track. We have sent a clear signal; they need to implement the political agreement in full and in good faith and address the urgent reform priorities to which the government has also committed itself.  The next challenge for the political leaders is to show political will and to take the necessary measures in order to organise credible elections on 5 June. Under the political agreement the elections are meant to be a key step as part of the reform process. The elections should restore citizens’ faith in the electoral process and move the country beyond the political crisis. With your support we will continue to follow and measure progress very closely.  The country has no time to lose and I am saying this in particular in respect to what has been discussed here and mentioned several times, namely the refugee and migration flow, and therefore I think the political leadership in the country should be focused on this. I can also reassure you that the European Union is supporting the country in terms of expertise, but also in terms of money, but also here I have to say, this is always based on the concrete needs assessment. It is not about transferring money on an unclear request, it is always on the basis of a clear, so to say, traceable need and then support is possible and has already been provided.  The political crisis should end for once and for all, in the interest of the country hopefully and the future, and in the interest and need and demand of its citizens.  So I count on the support of this House in sending unified messages to the political leaders of the country and may I say to all of those who have criticised, shall I say, the democratic development of the country, these sceptics are right and I agree, but I think we should understand and share the view that the biggest leverage for the European Union , for our own interests, is to have negotiations where we can really address these deficiencies.  We have only leverage at the point where we prepare the opening of accessions and we have a particular leverage during the negotiations. As we can see in some examples we do not have a real leverage after the accession. So this is something we should be aware of if we are thinking about further development of a country, in particular of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.

Over the past year, relations between the European Union and Montenegro have maintained a positive momentum. In its conclusions adopted in December last year, the Council welcomed the continued progress. It took positive note of improvements in the legal framework in the area of the rule of law and work on the establishment of new institutions.  Now the Council also noted with satisfaction Montenegro’s positive role in further developing regional cooperation and in advancing good neighbourly relations. It also commended Montenegro for its cooperation on foreign policy issues, in particular, for its continued full alignment with the EU’s foreign policy positions. It is furthermore encouraging evidence that two further negotiation chapters could be opened up at the accession conference in December, bringing the total number of chapters now opened to 22 out of 35.  Looking to the future, we need to stress again the importance of the rule of law, which is a fundamental value of the European Union and a cross cutting concern for the enlargement process. As your draft resolution rightly points out, further progress in Montenegro’s accession negotiations continues to depend on progress in this area.  The Council also restated how important it is for the entire rule of law system to deliver concrete results, in particular, by establishing a solid track record in the fight against corruption and organised crime. Further efforts are needed to focus on effective reform implementation, leading to tangible results towards the interim benchmarks. The Council will continue to closely monitor developments in this area. On a related note, the Council shares the view expressed in your draft resolution that Montenegro should intensify its efforts to guarantee freedom of expression and of the media, to pursue the public administration reform and to strengthen the independence of institutions, as well as to improve the business environment. Your draft resolution spells out many other important concerns to address, which are also highlighted by the findings of the Commission’s progress report. With the upcoming parliamentary elections in Montenegro this year, I would stress that ensuring the full implementation of the new electoral legislation is crucial. We are well aware that Montenegro currently is facing a difficult political situation and that this could hamper the reform efforts. Therefore, it is important to recall the need for all political parties to show responsibility and to re-engage in constructive dialogue, with parliament being the key forum for political debate. In this context, we count on the government and on the opposition to work together, not least to meet the expectations of the Montenegrin citizens. This is also important for ensuring public trust in the political process and in the state institutions. Sustainable and constructive cooperation remains essential to maintaining the necessary political commitments to effectively address outstanding challenges, to deliver on the reform agenda and to progress in the accession negotiations. Dialogue and inclusiveness are also key issues raised by your draft resolution, and I would like to stress how valuable it is that this message is passed on to Montenegro. In this respect the European Parliament’s important contribution through its work in the stabilisation and association parliamentary committee is most welcome.

I would also like to take this opportunity to thank the rapporteur for Montenegro, Charles Tannock, for his balanced and comprehensive draft resolution. It is a text that well reflects the assessment of the Commission’s 2015 Montenegro Report. This June, we will mark four years since the opening of accession negotiations with Montenegro. As your resolution points out, we have, as was already mentioned by the Minister, to date opened 22 negotiating chapters with Montenegro, of which two are provisionally closed. Concerning the rule of law, which is, as you know, at the heart of the accession process, over the last few years we have seen the first steps in achieving lasting reforms, through the adoption of legislation and the establishment of institutions. As you also point out however – and as the Commission stated in its November report – this is not the whole story. Our assessment is, unfortunately, that real progress on the ground on the rule of law remains limited, including in establishing a track record in the fight against corruption and organised crime. This is the message that the Commission is giving to Montenegro at a rule of law meeting in Podgorica today. When I met Prime Minister Djukanovic last month, I congratulated him on his country’s invitation to join NATO. I also stressed, however, that while the country was moving ahead overall, we were now entering a decisive phase, in particular in the accession negotiations and on the rule of law. We need to see Montenegro making credible progress on Chapters 23 and 24. We must see a tangible track record of implementation. This is not only for the benefit of the accession negotiations: legal certainty, a functioning independent judicial system, a transparent administration and fundamental rights, such as for instance property rights, are necessary not only for meeting the rule of law criteria; they are preconditions for attracting investment, improving competitiveness and stimulating growth and jobs. And therefore, as you know, I prefer to talk about the accession process and less about negotiations because it is about the development of a country towards European Union membership. We are also working very closely with Montenegro on improving the country’s competitiveness through our economic dialogue. The focus is on sectoral reforms, including on education, labour market, infrastructure, and the business environment. Concerning the other negotiating chapters, we have given Montenegro guidance on what needs to be done, through the opening benchmarks. Meeting them is a challenge for the country, in particular when we talk about alignment with the EU acquis on competition policy, or environment and climate change. Let me turn now to the political situation in Montenegro. The political dialogue that was launched in December was put on hold, without an agreement, on 19 February. However, despite the fact that there is, to date, no agreement among the political leaders on the establishment of a ‘government of electoral trust’, it is crucial that the dialogue within the parliament continues.  This year, Montenegro will hold local and parliamentary elections. The full implementation of the electoral legislation is crucial for the organisation of these elections so that they are credible. It is the responsibility of Montenegro’s political leaders to ensure this.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "partyIdeology": "Liberals and centrists"}, {"id": 1722, "date": "2016-03-09.json", "name": "Charles TANNOCK", "mepid": "4521", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Group. – Mr President, 2016 is a very important year for Montenegro politically. As it approaches its 10th anniversary since independence, the country is not only going to the polls in parliamentary elections, it is also in the process of crucial negotiations regarding its accession to NATO following its invitation to join the alliance last year. Montenegro continues to progress well, and has now opened 22 chapters including the key ones of 23 and 24, and 2016 will see the opening of further chapters and hopefully the provisional closing of others. As both the Commission report and the resolution as adopted in committee note, corruption and organised crime continue to be of concern, along with some aspects of media freedom, but the situation is generally improving and progress is being made. We are seeing an increased number of charges brought against those involved in high-level corruption, and the work of the Special Prosecutor’s Office is beginning to establish itself. With the launch of the Anti-Corruption Agency on 1 January this year I am encouraged by the increase in state resources that have been made available to tackle these issues. But of course there are some concerns as to the administrative capacity of such institutions in terms of their financing and these need to be addressed. But we must remain conscious of the financial constraints facing a very small country like Montenegro, which already gets some specialist assistance from neighbouring former-Yugoslav countries already in the EU, like Slovenia and Croatia. Very much to its credit, Montenegro has been a leading example in aligning its foreign policy with that of the EU’s CFSP and its Member States, and it has clearly demonstrated its ability to interact competently with its partners on such issues. Montenegro bravely fully aligned itself with the EU on the sanctions regime against Russia following the annexation of Crimea despite its economic ties with that country, and works in close cooperation with the European Union in tackling international Jihadi terrorism. There will be much talk in the year ahead of the need for a referendum regarding NATO membership. My position as rapporteur is clear in that I believe this is an internal matter for Montenegro and not something that we in the EU should be interfering with. That being said, however, we should be aware of the wider context of the debate and the external influences that are being brought to bear on tiny Montenegro. In summary, I am very happy with the resolution before us today and I am pleased that we have been able to work constructively across the political groups to agree to this in the committee.

We are still waiting for action to tackle tax evasion, high social inequalities, long-term unemployment and poverty. Social progress for us is the most important factor in the accession process.  Finally, I would like to address the issue of Montenegro's accession to NATO. We are by no means opposed to joining the Alliance, as some here want to present. But we believe that it is a decision that every country must take on its own, without any external intervention. What we disagree with is the attempt to link these two different processes.

Montenegro is the country most advanced on the road from six Western Balkan countries to the European Union. Although it is the smallest country, it can have a major positive impact on the entire Area of the Western Balkans, especially on the two neighbouring countries, namely Kosovo and Bosnia and Herzegovina.  The report mentions all outstanding issues very clearly and I agree with Commissioner Hahn that Montenegro's integration is at a critical point. It is time for Montenegro, in addition to the formal results, to show real progress in a number of areas mentioned in the report, the fight against corruption, freedom of the media, the fight against organised crime, the role and strength of civil society, minority rights, but I would nevertheless emphasize one most important thing in my opinion for Montenegro, which is elections.  That country has been deeply divided since its very creation. One part of that country's political forces is actually against independence, almost the existence of that country, and that is why the elections ahead are actually the most important process. If these are fair, clear and transparent elections that no significant political force will contest, then Montenegro will have a democratic future and then its path to the European Union will be much clearer.  With the perpetuation of the conflict in Montenegro after the election, Montenegro's chances of being a democratic country and being successful on the road to the European Union are much lower.

In addition, we invite Parliament to consider the fact that public opinion in Montenegro is divided over the possibility of joining NATO, so they should be able to decide: it is called democracy. Also, as a group, we are against privatization policies promoted through the accession process, because of the social problems that accompany these policies. These economic models have proven to have a negative impact on European citizens and, consequently, there is no need to impose them on the States that are now trying to join the European Union. Let us deepen our relationship, of course, let us support the country in its efforts to address the serious problems it has. Let us help in strengthening the rule of law and democracy, in the fight against corruption and organized crime, and strengthening the protection of freedom of expression, the media and journalists.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 1727, "date": "2016-03-09.json", "name": "Ulrike LUNACEK", "mepid": "97017", "text": "  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Madam President, Montenegro as such is, yes, something of a success story.

Montenegro is, in my view, certainly an example in the Western Balkans and among the candidate countries, and it is also one that, seeing the steps taken in recent years, is the closest, in this process of rapprochement, to the Union and to accession to it.  It certainly still needs to make enormous progress on the issue of corruption, also on the issue of the functioning of public administration, which continues – but it is a scourge common to many candidate countries in this area – to still be too politicised and still too closely linked to party activity.  I would like to highlight the problem of high unemployment, especially among young people, which afflicts the country. Unfortunately, I cannot agree with the part in which it welcomes NATO membership with great positivity, especially in its timing, which, in my opinion, risks fuelling tensions and divisions, which are very deep with neighbouring countries, but which is dividing up even more and helping to split the internal political landscape.

Joining the European Union is a key foreign policy priority for the country and it enjoys strong cross-party support. Montenegro is actively pursuing the goal of EU integration and the support of this Parliament is crucial in ensuring the transformative power of enlargement for the country. In May, Montenegro will celebrate the 10th anniversary of its independence. It has already achieved a lot in the past 10 years. Starting negotiations for accession to the European Union and receiving an invitation to join NATO can be counted amongst these achievements. However, as it has already been said several times by many of the speakers, important challenges remain. In the short term, these include the full implementation of the new electoral legislation that will ensure credible local and parliamentary elections in 2016. They also include making tangible progress on the rule of law, delivering on the commitments of its economic reform programme and ensuring a depoliticised and effective public administration.

The EU’s fundamental values, and notably the rule of law, democracy and fundamental rights make us unique in the world, and we should be proud of that. Therefore it is important and it will continue to be important that Montenegro’s rule-of-law system delivers concrete results and establishes a solid track record in, for example, the fight against corruption and organised crime. Many of you also commented on Montenegro’s relationship with NATO. I consider Montenegro a partner country that contributes towards the further development of peaceful and friendly international relations. Montenegro’s positive role in further developing regional cooperation and advancing good neighbourly relations is also noted.

Given the similar conditions of accession between NATO and the EU, the country's membership in NATO will result in better preparedness in the accession negotiations. However, parliament's report also points out that Montenegro needs to take a stronger fight against corruption, which is swaying the country's democratic foundations and social and economic development.  The issue of media freedom, fair and equal access for parties to the media and the self-organisation of the media have also been important in the report this year. In my field of expertise, it is important that the report commands the government's commitment to extending quality early childhood education and welcomes the increase in pre-school enrolments in the wake of the targeted campaign.

Nevertheless, it still has a lot of work to do, to tackle corruption, to improve the electoral system, to guarantee media freedom, to combat organised crime.

In the process of accession to NATO, Montenegro will have to carry out reforms to ensure that it respects certain democratic and civil society norms. I believe that joining NATO will also give it a greater willingness to join the EU and stability to the wider region. Montenegro has proven to be a good foreign policy partner for the EU, both in sanctions against Russia over Crimea and in the fight against extremist Islamic radicalism.

Madam President, I hope that my colleagues have had time to arrive in the Chamber, because I would like to start by thanking very warmly my fellow shadow rapporteurs and commissioner Andriukaitis's teams who have worked with me on this issue. With more than 1,000 amendments and nearly 150 articles, this was a titanic work, which we did as a team, in a spirit of cooperation and compromise that I very much appreciated. This was necessary in light of the important issues at stake in this legislative review. While the World Health Organization warns us that the world is in danger of sinking into a post-antibiotic era, where antibiotic resistance would kill more people each year than cancer, it was time to take strong action and grasp the problem at its root. The fight against antibiotic resistance must begin in farms. With this report, we want to ban the purely preventive use of antibiotics, restrict mass treatments to specific cases, ban the veterinary use of antibiotics critical to human medicine or end the online sale of antibiotics, vaccines and psychotropic products. Through these measures, we hope to reduce the amount of antibiotics that end up on the consumer base. However, we must not reduce the therapeutic arsenal of veterinarians. They are responsible professionals, whom we must trust. They are best placed to choose the most appropriate treatments depending on the circumstances. This regulation is designed to facilitate their work and not to over-regulate a profession that has already demonstrated its commitment to high ethical rigour.  It should also be noted that there is a real problem with the availability of medicines on the veterinary market. To preserve animal health, the quality of treatment must be improved and the use of drugs outside of marketing authorization must be reduced. To do this, it is absolutely necessary to encourage research and innovation in this sector. Our report is therefore very ambitious on this point. It proposes to extend certain periods of commercial exclusivity, including those for medicines for minor species, in order to create strong incentives for research. The cumbersome administrative procedures, particularly in terms of pharmacovigilance, are another obstacle to the introduction of innovative products. On the basis of the Commission's proposals, we have therefore revised certain provisions in order to set up a new system of pharmacovigilance that is more flexible, more efficient and less bureaucratic. Accelerated procedures must also allow laboratories to respond quickly to outbreaks, for example, without compromising our quality and safety standards, which are among the highest in the world. Finally, this new regulation must first and foremost be at the service of farmers and farmers, whose current difficulties we know and who will be the first to be affected by this text. The rules of this legislation are therefore not intended to stigmatize them, but to help them and to better care for their herds. In particular, I wanted to ensure, together with our colleagues in the AGRI Committee and the farmers' unions, that these new rules are applicable on the ground and do not add to the administrative burden under which they are already falling. In conclusion, the main issue was threefold: protection of animal health and therefore of human health, the fight against antibiotic resistance and the competitiveness of our farms and our veterinary drug industry, objectives which may seem contradictory, but which we have managed to reconcile perfectly in this legislative report. I now hope that we will not waste any more time. Parliament is ready.

The proposal for a regulation of veterinary medicines seeks to make more veterinary medicines available and to strengthen considerably European Union action to fight antimicrobial resistance (AMR). I know it is a key concern of this Parliament and, as you will know, it is a concern that I share deeply. I welcome very much that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI) adopted its report on 17 February by an overwhelming majority. I take this opportunity to congratulate Madam Grossetête for her excellent and timely work as rapporteur for this file and for the excellent cooperation with the Commission. Madam Grossetête succeeded in gaining strong support on 39 compromise amendments covering all the important provisions of this proposal. The Commission appreciates in particular the efforts made in proposing constructive amendments and concrete alternatives regarding the provisions related to labelling, environmental risk assessment, harmonisation of all products, pharmacovigilance and last, but not least, on AMR. The Commission welcomes the spirit of these amendments and they are in line with the co-objectives of the proposals. Now let me touch upon the Proposal amending Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. This proposal was necessary to allow for the incorporation of the rules on centralised authorisation in a single regulation on veterinary medicines. Its secondary aim was to perform the necessary and obligatory alignment of the Regulation to the Lisbon Treaty. The ENVI Committee adopted its report on 17 February and I also congratulate Mr Tănăsescu for his work as rapporteur for this file, which was confirmed with the adoption of the report by a large majority of the Committee. The Commission appreciates the efforts made to improve the proposal in order to take into account the specificities of the veterinary sector. Let me underline once again that the cooperation between Parliament and the Commission on the two files respectively has been excellent. Naturally we will strive to keep it that way, to bring this file to a satisfactory conclusion as early as possible. I am convinced that a first reading agreement is possible and, indeed, desirable and I am convinced that today’s vote will represent an important incentive for the Council to speed up its work. Finally let me reaffirm my commitment to the fight against AMR. For the years to come, my main ambition and first priority is to make the European Union a best practice region in the field of AMR. In order to make this possible I hope every Member State will be equipped with a comprehensive action plan against AMR, developed following the one-health approach. To assist this process I will put in place in the coming months, a one-health AMR network to bring together Member States’ experts from both the veterinary and human health domains, as well as actors from the environmental sector.  The European Union has indeed a key role to play both within its borders and globally, and your constructive work on these proposals will certainly represent an important contribution to succeeding in our endeavour. I thank Parliament again for its substantial proposals in the framework for this legislation, and its continuous interest and involvement in the ongoing fight against AMR. I count on the support of this House to ensure that the very important and urgent new measures designed to tackle AMR are adopted and applied as swiftly as possible.

In addition to the new Regulation on Veterinary Medicinal Products, just mentioned by Mrs Grossetête, it was also necessary to amend, on the part of the Commission, Regulation No 17. However, as can be seen from my report, there were some elements in the proposal that needed improvement. Firstly, for the sake of clarity, since all the articles relating to the authorisation procedure for veterinary medicinal products are now being moved to a new regulation, I have clarified in the text that the European Medicines Agency remains responsible, under the centralised authorisation procedure, for both medicinal products for human and veterinary use. The report shall also ensure that the revised Regulation complies with the new Financial Regulation. We now have a clear and up-to-date picture of the principles applicable to the Agency's budget, including a separation between the different revenue sources that make up the budget of the European Medicines Agency. As a result of the broad support received in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, Parliament should be fully involved in the process of setting the Agency's fees through the ordinary legislative procedure, as has recently been done for legislation on pharmacovigilance fees.  Finally, the text voted on in the ENVI Commission recognises the role of the European Medicines Agency in increasing access to medicines. The report also contains a statement on the Agency's cooperation with medical technology assessment bodies, as is currently the case, in order to further facilitate cooperation and exchange of scientific information. The EMA should also be able to provide Member States with a comparative assessment of medicinal products for human use. Such an assessment could then be used by Member States on a voluntary basis during the national decision-making process on the setting of prices and repayment conditions, activities which, of course, remain within national competence. Now, as shadow rapporteur in the Grossetête report, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and colleagues on their good cooperation. We now have a very well structured report, which allows for considerable improvements in the field of veterinary medicinal products. Proposed measures include limiting and controlling the use of antibiotics in the treatment of animals, but also creating a favourable framework for investment in the research and development of new medicines, and beyond. It is intended to increase access to veterinary medicinal products and to provide veterinarians with a much wider therapeutic arsenal. In this respect, the requirements for medicinal products for limited markets are also simplified. In addition, the movement of veterinary medicinal products between Member States is facilitated by better authorisation procedures and clear rules on modern forms of retailing. In this respect, we have reached an agreement allowing the retail sale of veterinary medicinal products on the internet, with the exception of antimicrobial substances, psychotropic products and immunological biological products. Similarly to what happens in the case of medicinal products for human use, the Commission is invited to adopt guidelines to support Member States in the development of a harmonised system of digital prescriptions in the European Union. It is regrettable that a large proportion of the antibiotics sold in the European Union are given to animals. It is our duty to protect the effectiveness of antibiotics in medical centres, but also on farms. This report sets out clear measures for the correct and proper use of antibiotics on the farm, as well as a ban on the preventive, routine use of antimicrobial substances. This is complemented by stricter standards for the use of antimicrobial metafilactic treatment. In order to combat antimicrobial resistance, everyone should be involved, including national authorities, patients, doctors, but also veterinarians, farmers and consumers.", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 1759, "date": "2016-03-09.json", "name": "Jasenko SELIMOVIC", "mepid": "134243", "text": "   rapporteur on the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.

The package is well balanced between consumer concerns, taking into account the proposal to provide strong incentives for industry to produce medicine, including the generic industry, consideration for the fight against antibiotic resistance and environmental considerations.

There were many amendments, but I believe that a balance has been struck, a significant compromise point.  What I think needs to be emphasised is that we are obviously talking here about new rules, new regulations and, immediately, some people may be afraid, of new rules, of Europe imposeing new rules in a sector that is already highly bureaucratic, unfortunately, such as agriculture and livestock farming. On the other hand, the approach that has been taken to this work is exactly the opposite approach, in the sense that these are new rules which have been checked on the ground, so that they do not in any way constitute a further bureaucratization of the system but, even more so, they are rules that move towards overall European harmonisation and I believe that from these benches, on this occasion, they do not in any way constitute a further bureaucratization of the system. , it is also necessary to remember that we, when we talk about farmers, are talking about a sector such as milk, which in Italy, but not only in Italy, in several European countries, is really on its knees today. He's going through a really dramatic crisis.  These new rules will, in some way, help this sector.

In the spirit of this prudent use of veterinary medicinal products, this Pharmaceutical Sea Law has also been negotiated by Madame Grossetéte and all the shadow rapporteurs. I am very grateful that these compromises have been negotiated, because they really carry on the idea that it is necessary to look at animal health and human health together, especially when using medicines. We need to separate veterinary medicinal products and medicinal products for human use and, in reality, to retain those special medicines for humans. However, we must also encourage innovation. We must help to ensure that, above all, those who prescribe these medicines do not necessarily sell and earn from them, but that there are very clear rules in this regard. It was also necessary for us to ban the internet trade here, especially for antibiotics. There is much in this legislative package to be proud of. It will allow for the improvement of availability, it will enable innovation.

When we mean a veterinary medicinal product, I am thinking, first of all, of the work that has been carried out on a difficult and complex process aimed not only at the safety and protection of animals in the broad sense, as the content of the report indicates in the first place, but also of the process of protecting human health, food safety and numerous aspects of environmental protection. In my opinion, security should be given priority, and I am referring to various aspects of security. Firstly, a medicine that is safe and effective for an animal, safe for man as a user who uses this medicine for an animal, safe for man as a food consumer, or finally safe for man as a patient, especially when we need to limit the build-up of resistance of microbes to antibiotics; also a drug safe for the environment. I wholeheartedly support cascading mechanisms aimed at reducing the use and use of antibiotics in particular. There needs to be a clear differentiation between treatment, metaphylaxis and antibiotic prophylaxis, which, moreover, is banned in this document – and very well. Legal and commercial issues have also been regulated. Many concerns were raised about the arrangements for allowing the distribution of medicines and the criteria for advertising. In my opinion, these are serious challenges that concern not only veterinary medicinal products. Product advertising and distribution, especially online, is a major challenge. We must also bear in mind the important topic of data protection, because bad legislation in this area can put out the innovative measures so necessary in this area.  On one point, I have a different opinion as a doctor: I cannot agree with the specific proposals for amendments to this report. In particular, I have doubts about the numerous references made to so-called homeopathic medicines. I have the impression that ideological rather than scientific considerations prevailed. Science does not give clear evidence confirming the effectiveness of homeopathic tics in animals. In humans, the placebo effect or belief in the effectiveness of drugs counts. Whether a similar mechanism works in animals – I do not know, but I doubt very seriously.

Madam President, I would like to thank the president for her First of all, I would like to express my sincere thanks to the two rapporteurs, Mr Tansescu and Mrs Grossetéte.  It is indeed the case that these two reports, with this legislation, improve something quite crucial, which is now also improving antibiotic resistance, which we are discussing a great deal. This has to do with the fact that the Tnsescu report is now actually separating the authorisation of medicinal products for human and veterinary use, which is currently still in a regulation. It makes perfect sense that, at the same time, we are also adapting to the Treaty of Lisbon, so that the fees for admission to the EMA, as we want, are then also made in the co-determination procedure. These are all things that make sense. I think perhaps even more important – and this is also the larger report – is the report by Mrs Grossetéte. In fact, it is the case that prophylaxis, metaphylaxis and treatment are processed very precisely. In prophylaxis, it is said that there should be no more critical antibiotics, that prophylactic administration via the feed should generally no longer be permitted, at most if, for example, an animal is directly in front of an operation.  The allocation of antibiotics to animals should then only be subject to specialist treatment by veterinarians. I also think it is important to see the cascade system, which has been said to be that some antibiotics should really only be used for human treatment, so that they really have an effect when used in humans.  Then it is also said that if, for example, one veterinary medicinal product is not available in one Member State, then another can be taken, another special one, which is available in other Member States. In individual cases, you can also administer human medications with or something individually manufactured. But basically, of course, we should always take the veterinary medicinal product that is intended for this particular case. Personally, unlike a previous speaker, I also think it is absolutely right and important that homeopathic remedies should also be authorised in the future, because – it is possible to argue for a long time whether or not it has been scientifically proven – there have already been very good successes with them.

I have to say that we have made the Commission's proposal much better. I think it is important to point out, of course, that we must also act. We have conditions that we cannot accept. The fact that twice as many antibiotics are still used in animal husbandry – mainly in fattening, incidentally – as in human medicine is unacceptable in the long run. We have the problem of resistance. We have 26 000 deaths in Europe from antibiotic resistance. The irresponsible, over-massive use in animal husbandry also contributes to this. That is why we need to address the issues of prophylaxis and metaphylaxis. Too many antibiotics are used in actually healthy animals. This has something to do with incorrect farming conditions and with false breeds, and this problem is also addressed by this proposal that we consider this in order to use fewer antibiotics. I think this is extremely important. We also need to talk about reserve antibiotics. Reserve antibiotics are really reserved for human medicine. We must not compromise on this. We also need to improve the collection of data in the European Union, where there is insufficient data collection. And we also need to look at the environmental impact of antibiotics, especially in the production and application. I would like to make one more point.

In our opinion, however, the main aim of the future legislative framework for veterinary medicinal products must be to protect public health and animal welfare. In my own-initiative report on patient safety, I already mentioned the importance of tackling antibiotic resistance in veterinary medicine as well. That is why we are very satisfied, because routine prophylaxis is banned and because the use of antibiotics in a metaphylactic way is restricted only to cases of clinically ill animals.  However, in our opinion, in order to find new effective antibiotics, we must prevent the use and abuse of the pharmaceutical monopolist, who imposes his own price under copyright laws. The game of industry is to exploit certain substances for as long as possible, without stimulating real research. The current text in this area needs to be improved, because it extends from 10 to 18 years, the period during which the industry can exclusively exploit a new drug.

When you admit a precautionary period, it means that you also admit a risk. However, we cannot maintain this risk in the area of food security. In addition, the online sale of veterinary medicines needs to be more regulated. Drugs that require a prescription by qualified veterinarians or professionals should not be sold on the internet, and I stress this point. This restriction preserves two pillars of the sector: on the one hand, the health mesh provided by our veterinarians, whose action must be supported and protected by the profession - it is thanks to these veterinarians that the consumption of antibiotics has been reduced in France, in particular; on the other hand, the quality of our farms, which we cannot sell out through deregulation favouring counterfeiting and multiple deliverances due to the lack of control.

It is a good report and we should vote in favour of it by a large majority.  I would like to talk above all about antibiotic resistance. According to the Commission and the World Health Organisation, 25 000 people die every year because antibiotics lose their effect because they suffer from germs that are no longer helped.  This is where we have to start in veterinary medicine – I will come to human medicine in a while. Much has already been said. I would ask the Commission and then also the Council, when we go to the trialogue, to look in particular at Amendments Nos 245 and 246. It is a question of not only covering antibiotics – this is already included in the Commission proposal – but also drawing conclusions when a farmer uses significantly more antibiotics than other comparable farms.  This already exists in some Member States, and the vets tell me that the farmers come preventively and say before the official veterinarian comes and tells me what to do, please tell me how I can avoid using so many antibiotics by means of better hygiene, better breeding and so on. I believe that we should introduce this throughout Europe. A word about human medicine. If 25 000 people die every year, then we must also look at where people are treated. Prescription practice in human medicine is still too generous, and hygiene in hospitals leaves much to be desired. But we also need innovation. Even if we are still doing so well, we already have the resistant germs and unfortunately we do not have enough modern antibiotics. I would therefore like to draw your attention to Amendment No 22.

It is important that the regulation contains a provision prohibiting certain antibiotics in veterinary care in order to preserve them for human use. But for this to make sense it must be retroactive, therefore include the obligation to withdraw from the market those spare antibiotics already on sale.  Furthermore, the key is to binder the distribution of antibiotics with a prescription issued by an authorized person. Likewise, to prevent possible abuses in the interest of public health is to ban the online sale of antibiotics. Human and animal health are increasingly connected due to our eating habits and intensive farming methods, which is why we need to address the problem of antibiotics through a \"one health\" approach.

Prophylactic antibiotic use is kept to an absolute minimum and routine use is completely prohibited. The Commission is to draw up a list of reserve antibiotics.

In fact, I would have liked to have seen that we had made a real ban on animal doctors selling the medicine they prescribe, but we did not come to terms with that. Maybe we can take that next time.

It is important that this report makes the organisation of the market a lot more efficient.  For me, however, the measures taken in the fight against antibiotic resistance stand out. Due to a large-scale use of antibiotics, also preventively in healthy animals, more and more bacteria become resistant and thereby reduces the effect of some antibiotics. With the development of new types of antibiotics also sputtering, this is rightly causing concern. All the actors involved in the sector agree: the use of antibiotics must be reduced, but a complete ban, as some colleagues have suggested, is, in my view, a bridge too far.  Careful and responsible use of antibiotics is necessary. This report celebrates that starting point. Routine, preventive antibiotics are restricted. This is an excellent thing, because this avoids bad conditions, such as newborn piglets with resistant bacteria. However, there has been no complete ban on preventive use, and I think that is common sense. Just before or during the operation of an animal, the farmer should be able to continue to use antibiotics preventively. Such exceptions are necessary to limit animal cruelty.

I would like to emphasize a couple of things. There is a real need to promote alternatives. Indeed, we can reduce the use of antibiotics, but we must also strengthen - and here I support the amendment of my colleague Martin Huusling - homeopathy. At the same time, it's a shame we haven't talked about it, we need to increase research on phage therapy, which is killing certain bacteria with bacteriophages.

The fundamental problem is undoubtedly antibiotic resistance: in this area it is essential that the Member States take into account the guidelines drawn up by the Commission for the prudent use of antibiotics. More comprehensive data are needed on how antibiotics are used and plans need to be put in place to discourage their administration for preventive or prophylactic purposes.

Madam President, we are discussing the authorisation of medicinal products for veterinary use and the impact of these medicinal products on public health. Firstly, as regards the central marketing authorisation for veterinary products, it should be disconnected from that of medicinal products for humans, as the needs of the veterinary sector for medicinal products differ greatly from those of humans. Moreover, in the veterinary field there are different types of animals, resulting in market fragmentation and increasing the need for investment in order to extend the authorisation of medicinal products from one animal species to another. In addition, despite the health measures taken by farmers, animals also need veterinary medicinal products to treat a disease and avoid any possible transmission of it to humans.

It is important to reach an agreement on these new rules in order to increase the availability of veterinary medicines and, even more urgently, to address the risks to public health arising from the use of antimicrobials in veterinary medicine. The Commission welcomes further provisions addressing AMR and considers most of them positive. I also welcome the amendment introducing precise conditions on prophylactics and methaphylactic use of antimicrobials, inter alia prophylactic use restricted to single animals and only when fully justified by a veterinarian, and methaphylactic use restricted to clinically ill animals and to single animals that are identified as being at high risk of contamination. I am sure that we will have very interesting discussions on this issue during the trilogue and you will be able to access those in detail.  Some Members have mentioned very important issues relating to innovations. Use of new innovative treatments is very important to all of us. Innovations, access to veterinary medicines, the fight against AMR and the protection of public health are not in contradiction. On the contrary, innovation is a main tool to guarantee public health.  I am sure that we must also debate in detail many other issues; for example, the proposal to collect data at farm level needs to be further assessed as it could be burdensome and may create additional administrative burdens. I firmly believe that on the basis of the good work done by the European Parliament we will be able to fully achieve those goals in the near future.

On this point, I will not go into detail, because the Commissioner has just talked about it, but it is fundamental. At the same time, we really had to take into account support for innovation, because we have a severe shortage of veterinary drugs. We have therefore constantly sought the balance between this fight against antibiotic resistance and the need to support innovation, to provide for the protection of commercial data, but in a differentiated way for major or minor species, or even very particular species, such as bees for which we are determined to provide 20-year protection, because we have a real problem in this regard. On sale online: of course, veterinary drugs are allowed, except for antibiotics and immunological or psychotropic products.

The European Commission m.in. to increase access to medicinal products, to improve the functioning of the internal market for these substances (while reducing the administrative burden linked to pharmacovigilance), and to combat increasing antibiotic resistance. Of course, I fully support all these measures, but the new legislation should include precise and clear provisions on certain issues. In particular, the text lacks an appropriate definition of 'responsible use of veterinary medicinal products' – it should cover all parties involved comprehensively, from pharmaceutical companies to veterinarians to farmers. Furthermore, online sales of antibiotics to animals (the EC's proposed solution to accessibility) should not be allowed and only over-the-counter sales of medicines should be possible.

Fertilisers of animal origin cause bacteria resistant to antimicrobials to enter arable land and water, which poses a risk to the environment and humans.

I have to say that blaming each other or blaming a country for not moving is of no use to the victims at all, but I think it is good if we act together here, send a clear signal that we need a European solution for those who are not compensated by the Contergan Foundation – as we have in Germany – but who are covered by a licensed product. These people need compensation as soon as possible.  I am also looking forward to the Council's reaction – the Council bench is unfortunately empty today. I would have liked some Member States to be represented there and listen to what we have to say here – on the spot.

Nothing of course could be further from the truth. The effects of thalidomide are not just historic: they are ongoing, they are in the present. Many thalidomide survivors and their families across Europe have suffered for over 50 years and are still suffering without adequate financial support; they cannot meet their everyday living costs and they certainly cannot meet their health costs. They do not want to live a life of luxury: they want enough to live in relative comfort, free from worry and chronic pain. Those who are still in work find it increasingly difficult to maintain a full-time working schedule; their mobility is deteriorating and often depression can be heaped on top of this critical physical condition. So what is happening to help? Well, different countries in Europe have dealt with this in different ways and we know that in Germany the government is contributing to the funding for survivors via the Conterganstiftung. This is a welcome acknowledgment of their responsibility. So what then of all the other sufferers in Europe who have received little or nothing? They are still waiting for the German Government to address its moral responsibility and allocate the relatively modest, and annually decreasing, sums required.

Many citizens who are following us will wonder what has happened in all this time. The answer is that, half a century later, many of the victims of tydomy continue to demand justice, the guarantee of a minimally dignified life is still being demanded.  The tragedy of tydomy changed the history of medicines in Europe, allowed legislation with higher levels of quality and safety to be passed and other pharmaceutical disasters to be avoided, although the current model of research and clinical trials continues to suffer from the transparency it must manifest.  However, no progress has been made in repairing the damage suffered by many of the poisoned children and who are now living a precarious old age after a lifetime of suffering. In many cases, care and necessary medical care cannot be afforded.  Within this drama, it is worth noting the injustice committed with the Spanish victims.  In 1972, the Contergan Foundation was created with a law establishing the universal character of aid. The reality is that 3,000 German citizens and only one Spaniard have been recognised for aid. Those affected from other countries have received aid from the Foundation or its governments, including in Australia. In the case of the Spaniards, neither the State nor the pharmacist remembered them: they have been condemned to a situation of helplessness and marginality.  From the very first moment of my parliamentary activity, I have known firsthand the heroic struggle maintained by the members of AVITE, the Spanish Association of Victims of the Talidomide.  Commissioner, it is time for action, it is time for concrete measures. It is time to end the discrimination faced by victims and it is certainly time to establish a protocol in the European Union, as this oral question raises, where all European citizens affected by tydomy receive the same compensation.

Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to thank the commissioner for her work and for the work she has The Contergan case is arguably the most well-known pharmaceutical disaster that the pharmaceutical industry has caused. After thalidomide was tested in animal experiments – we see once again: animal testing is generally the wrong way – the German company Grünenthal launched this substance under the name Contergan. The drug has been approved in 52 countries as a safe product for pregnant women and young mothers, although no tests have been carried out on the effect on embryos. Between 5 000 and 10 000 injured children have been born worldwide. There were also an unknown number of stillbirths. The Contergan victims were compensated absolutely poorly and 900 of them were not at all. Today, they are often unable to cover their medical costs. The EU must provide assistance to the victims after Grünenthal has failed to fulfil its moral obligation. All those affected should receive comparable compensation, higher pensions and easy access to assistance and assistance. Victims have a right to financial security in old age, barrier-free living and a self-determined life. That is what we must ensure. I firmly believe that, with a common market for pharmaceutical companies, the EU must also establish a common system to support the victims of pharmaceutical disasters, even if this is not yet the EU's competence. As a member of the ENVI Committee, it is particularly important to me that the Commission and the Council support strict liability rules for pharmaceutical companies operating inside and outside Europe. Those affected need social acceptance, but above all they need justice. Justice must be done to them. And we, the European Union, should give them this justice.

They require an adequate and reasonable sum to help them cope with the daily challenges that life throws at them as they get older. Their needs should not be ignored.

The thalidomide disaster reminds us today, and will always remind us, of the potential tragic consequences that the absence of an appropriate regulatory framework for medicines may trigger. The thalidomide disaster did, however, serve as an important driver to inspire the European Union’s pharma legislation over 50 years ago to reach agreement on harmonised rules focusing on a high level of public health protection. The origin of this tragedy dates back more than half a century, but there are still many survivors living with its consequences – survivors who need moral, social and financial support, especially as their medical and physical condition is worsening day by day.  Many Members of the European Parliament have written to me personally and to the Commission, highlighting the issue and calling for support for the victims. I met thalidomide survivors from the UK, Italy, Spain and Sweden last year in Brussels, and we discussed their request. I recognise the need to find a suitable solution for all survivors, which ensures their quality of life, and I have taken several steps to support this. In September 2015, I informed the national governments of the five countries concerned by my meeting with the representatives of survivors with the aim of raising awareness. I thank all the thalidomide survivors once again for accepting my invitation to participate in the ‘50 years of pharma legislation’ event and for presenting a very outspoken movie on the subject. I also met in October with Members of the European Parliament to discuss the topic and the possibilities to raise awareness of the situation of survivors in Europe. I have also discussed this issue several times since the beginning of my mandate with the pharma association FPA. A few weeks ago, I also spoke in front of his House about clinical trials, as you remember. This topic is closely related, and I would like to see the pharma industry taking more moral responsibility. However, it needs to be recognised that under Article 168 of the Treaty, the organisation and delivery of health services and medical care, including the management and allocation of the resources assigned to them, is a Member State competence. As we all know injury compensation schemes at the moment, unfortunately, are not a matter of the European Union competence. Therefore, the Commission is not in a position to establish a framework for compensation at European level. It can only support finding a political solution at Member State-level through sincere cooperation. I would encourage you, as Members of the Parliament, to relay back to your national governments the specific needs of thalidomide survivors and the need to support their cause.

I regret that, to this day, we have not actually found common ground on how to compensate these victims, because it is not only the 3 000 German victims who have been compensated, tens of thousands around the world, and it should be remembered that many mothers have been affected by the birth of dead children or had spontaneous premature abortions of their children who, if they had not taken this medicine, were not. would be born healthy.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sk", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 1808, "date": "2016-03-09.json", "name": "Soledad CABEZÓN RUIZ", "mepid": "125041", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group – Mr President, the tidomide crisis was so severe that, as has been said here, it led to the implementation of the European pharmacovigilance system.

Mr President, Commissioner, you said 'it is the responsibility of the Member States to compensate the victims'. But you are ignoring a directive which concerns us closely and which my colleagues do not mention either - I am a little surprised - namely the European Directive on Defective Products of 1985. This directive needs to be completely revised. What for? Because it provides deadlines that no longer correspond to reality. The victim can only act within three years of knowing the damage within 10 years of the time the drug has been put into circulation. These deadlines are far too short. What does this lead to? You are talking about the dramatic thalidomide scandal in Spain. 180 victims attacked the High Court, which, under the 1985 directive, found that the facts were prescribed. As a result, they could not be compensated by the grunnenthal laboratory, which marketed thalidomide. So this is not a problem for the Member States, but with the directive that we voted on in 1985. Secondly, in this 1985 directive, victims must prove causal link between their damage, their illness and the drug. In the wake of the thalidomide scandal, what did the Germans do? Well, they reversed the burden of proof. It will absolutely have to be done in our directive when it is revised.  Third thing: when a victim suffers from a side effect due to taking a drug, he or she cannot claim any compensation if it is mentioned in the notice.

From this point of view, I have a report from the Czech Ministry of Health that there are no known cases of thalidomide use in the Czech Republic that would lead to harm to health and subsequently to courts and disputes.

But I also support all the more my colleagues from Spain, Britain, Germany, who have expressed themselves here in order to compensate these victims. Lessons must also be learned in the future within the European Union and great caution should be exercised in the development and marketing of new medicines.

Of course I am ready to help people, I am ready, please send me your views. Some have mentioned a directive, I do not know about a directive. Of course we must see the possibility maybe to introduce new laws, but it needs real instruments today on the ground, and not only to send in statements. It is not enough about statements, we need results and of course I am ready, I am open to see and I will continue to follow the question and explore any possibility to facilitate a concrete solution that may help thalidomide survivors. Is that absolutely crystal clear? But as you mentioned, it is not only the German Government; the Spanish Government did not do enough from my point of view.

Blowing the whistle requires civil courage. It is about promotion of good governance and the fight against corruption. It is also about protecting privacy and preserving the freedom of expression and of information. As you know, and as was mentioned in the debate on the theme last April, there is no overarching harmonised system in place in the European Union for the protection of whistle-blowers. The Commission is well aware of Parliament’s strong calls for putting such a system in place. As you also know, in cases where no sectoral EU laws exist, it is up to the Member States to regulate this issue.  The Commission is closely following the evolving jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights on whistle-blowing, as well as the Council of Europe discussions on a possible framework convention on this issue. The Commission has taken good note of the Council of Europe’s 2014 recommendation on the protection of whistle-blowers, which calls on the Council of Europe member states to create a normative, judicial and institutional framework for the protection of whistle-blowers, and the Commission welcomes the fact that several Member States have already put such an institutional framework in place. European Union rules on whistle-blowing currently exist only in some specific areas regulated at EU level. In addition, let me recall that the anti-money laundering directive which was adopted in December 2014 contains provisions on the protection of those who report suspicious financial transactions. Also in December last year, the Commission adopted an implementing directive to the market abuse regulation. Member States have to establish effective mechanisms to protect whistle-blowers who would report infringement of the regulation.  You will also remember that last December you adopted a directive on the protection of trade secrets against unlawful acquisition, use or disclosure. This legislation considerably strengthens the rights of whistle-blowers. According to this directive, any claim on an alleged unlawful acquisition, use or disclosure of trade secrets should be dismissed when such conduct is carried out in the general public interest for the purpose of revealing misconduct, wrongdoing or illegal activity.  Let me also refer to the 2014 European Union anti-corruption report, which covers whistle-blowing for all our Member States. This is an important topic in our bilateral discussions with the Member States in the follow-up to the report.  Finally, the Commission wants to ensure that whistle-blowers who would report European Union fraud and corruption cases to the future European Public Prosecutor’s Office receive the necessary protection in accordance with national law. As you know, the negotiations on the European Public Prosecutor’s Office are ongoing and Parliament’s support in this respect would be most helpful and welcome.

After all, whistleblowers are often judged as a general remedy.  I would also like to make it clear at this point that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats would be very critical of the inclusion of comprehensive whistleblower protection, which is above criminal law. But in a reasonable procedure, we are not fundamentally opposed to protecting whistleblowers.  That is why it is important to talk about these structures – structures in companies, associations and authorities, where structures must be established so that appropriate protection can also apply in the event of alleged violations of the law. The debate about whistleblowers is complex and difficult to handle because it covers various areas: freedom of expression, privacy protection, data protection, ethical issues, national security, corporate secrets, tax issues, fraud, etc. Then you have to focus directly on the individual cases. You can't lump everything together and then just say: we're protecting in general now. You have to look very carefully at the areas involved.

We are talking about a matter of the greatest topicality and of the greatest seriousness, because it raises great concern: the protection of Fundamental European rights and the privacy of Europeans.  But it is also necessary to contemplate the protection of what is known internationally with this English locution of the 'whistleblower' which, translated into Spanish, would be the delator, the complainant of a situation affecting cases of corruption, attacks on national security, environmental crimes, fraud, economic crimes that therefore require active cooperation with law enforcement agencies : law enforcement agencies. And that's what we're talking about.  Why did you get so topical? Evidently in the wake of the so-called 'Snowden case' which reveals an invasive and massive practice against fundamental rights, not longer europeans, but citizens around the world, potentially by the US National Security Agency.  And it therefore tells us of the need to protect these whistleblowers, who can bring tax fraud, concealment in tax havens, environmental crimes, crimes with an impact on health, abuses that undermine the full enjoyment of fundamental rights, which European law is obliged to guarantee, to be known to justice or law ensuring.  The European Parliament has taken care of this. In 2013, I chaired a commission on mass surveillance on the fundamental rights of Europeans in the Committee on Freedoms, Justice and Home Affairs, the conclusions of which were adopted in October 2013.  And, in 2015, we held a hearing at the LIBE Commission – the Committee on Freedoms, Justice and Home Affairs – to conclude that a framework of protection is needed to develop the rights referred to in Articles 11, 30 and 41 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which is consistent with the Council of Europe and the OECD , but above all, give rules and safe channels to ensure the confidences of these crime delators that matter to us and we want to pursue.  This is what we have to do in the European Parliament: how to improve the protection of confidants with uniform status throughout European law, with European legislation fulfilling the mandate of the conclusions of the committee of inquiry which I chaired as chairman of the Committee on Freedoms, Justice and Home Affairs.

These are the most responsible and courageous individuals who warn about the problem before it becomes unsolvable. Unfortunately, they rarely get the recognition they deserve, and much more often at risk of health and disillusioned with the system leave their workplace within a year or two.  In countries shaken by the rule of law, whistleblowers face almost never real complacency due to systemic shortcomings and corruption. While in many developed countries it is very difficult to hire the best lawyers because they prefer to have wealthy corporations for their clients who do not want to work with those who represent whistleblowers. We also often witness politics flirting with whistleblowers because they have great moral credibility in the public eye, so they bring easy political points.  I believe that the policy towards whistleblowers should be treated much more constructively and responsibly because they show what needs to be fixed, and because of their experience and knowledge of the internal situation, they often offer concrete quality solutions. Because of all this, we need to strongly promote the positive role of whistleblowers in society, and our states need to do everything they can to make the best legal aid available to them at all times.

We are talking about white-gloved criminals, who can hide crimes; in fact, because of their sophistication and technical and intellectual training, it is very, very difficult to discover, and much more difficult to prove the crimes. When crimes are committed by large corporations, which carry them out, because they are carrying out illegal espionage work, or by some politicians within their parties or in local, regional, national or European power, it is extremely difficult to punish them. Internal informants are therefore the key to impunity. At the United Nations Convention against Corruption, which entered into force in 2005, the 167 countries that have ratified it recognize the importance of the issue. However, many of them still do not provide whistleblowers with adequate legal protection. Most countries do not go from general declarations of principle, because it is very uncomfortable, very difficult, very sensitive, and only four Member States have extensive legislation on whistleblower protection. Creating a healthy culture of transparency is just as important as designing specific whistleblower protection legislation. My own country, Spain, is in line, with many other countries, in this area. And I can assure you that we could have gotten rid of much of the corruption if we had good whistleblower protection legislation. Protection surely goes through the establishment of a legal statute. Undoubtedly, when someone makes the decision to dare to report a felony within a large corporation, state or political party, if their anonymity is not protected, they will suffer a situation of isolation and harassment, with potential risks to their professional career and their personal tranquility, as we have said. They need the protection of their physical integrity and need secure reporting protocols, which ensure the confidentiality of the information received. They require legal assistance, free of charge, as well as being guaranteed access to psychological care, if necessary. Because we are talking about the search for the annulment of the people who make these kinds of complaints. We cannot forget that, in some cases, whistleblowers of serious illegalities have been persecuted even internationally. Julian Assange's case we all know him. The Working Group on Arbitrary Detention of the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has concluded that it is subject to deprivation continues its freedom.

As stated in the EU anti-corruption report, whistle-blowing faces a difficulty as there is a reluctance to act against one’s own organisation due to the fear of retaliation. Whistle-blowers are often acting according to their conscience, but outside or against a legal framework. They are forced to break the law to act according to their moral compass. In this role, they are contributing to the democracy mechanisms and helping to reveal criminal activities, for instance corruption, but it should not lead to the destruction of the state and in functions. In democratic societies, for instance, investigative journalists have rights and are protected. That is why I believe we need to develop our discussion on whistle-blowers. We need to raise awareness of the problem, continue efforts on finding and implementing a better framework for protecting their rights as persons, as professionals. Some countries in Europe have done so in an advanced way, so this is a duty for all Member States.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 1844, "date": "2016-03-09.json", "name": "Elly SCHLEIN", "mepid": "124804", "text": "   Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, whistle-blowers play a key role in the fight against corruption, evasion and organised crime, phenomena that are now moving very casually across national borders. These are European phenomena, and that is why we need solutions that are European. We need a European directive setting minimum standards for the protection of whistle-blowers and detecting safe channels for revealing information. We cannot be credible in the fight against these phenomena unless we protect the speaker. Unfortunately, however, at European level, only eight Member States have completed legislation in this area. As long ago as 2013, as part of the REPORT of the CRIM Committee, this Parliament called, by a very large majority, for the European Commission, by 2013, to prepare a legislative proposal that would go in the direction of an effective and comprehensive European programme for the protection of whistle-blowers. Three years have passed and we have not yet seen any trace of this proposal. I would therefore like to ask the Commission why this delay and this resistance have been delayed.  Finally, I would like to point out that since January 2014 the European institutions have made it compulsory to introduce internal rules on complaints of irregularities, including the protection of whistleblowers. Well, an inquiry carried out by the European Ombudsman has shown that, with the exception of the Commission and the Court of Auditors, the other institutions, including, alas, this Parliament, have done very little in the area of whistle-blower protection.

Mr President, the European Union must ensure the effective protection of the people who help with their information to uncover corruption scandals.

As the President of the Commission, Mr President-in- Juncker, in September 2015 before the European Parliament, we must adopt a common European policy on this issue.

We must ensure that these controls have sufficient protection in our legal environment, and this also applies to Mr Assange. Despite my personal reservations about Mr Assange's person, we cannot ignore his legacy, which is of great importance to us in understanding the complexity of international affairs.  Many people are very interested in sweeping some things under the rug, and it is no wonder that people like Julian Assange are simply uncomfortable. However, we must bear in mind that inconvenient whistle-blowers can very easily fall victim to fabricated accusations and persecution, which we, members of the European Parliament and the representatives of the European Union, are supposed to prevent.

If we look at the opinion polls in the individual countries of the European Union, then the citizens of the European Union see corruption as one of the key issues that is burning them very much. It is a little surprising that most countries in the European Union do not have a complete adjustment to the subject of whistle-blowers, only some states have this matter in the area of labour law. I personally believe that it would therefore be worth considering, Commissioner, if you were to consider a more general arrangement setting a minimum European standard for the status of a whistle-blower. You have mentioned here specific examples of directives where the subject of the whistle-blower is, in principle, only marginally constructed. However, I believe that the general regulation would be worth considering if it is in minimal form, for example, if the person concerned reports a crime, not just an ethical offence, just as we have legislation today that regulates so-called anti-discrimination laws. This has also been acquired by the European Union. Five years ago, I was responsible for legislation in the Czech Government and I prepared this law. But there was no political will to pass such a law. To this day, the Czech Republic does not have whistleblower protection.

Mr President, those few who dare to report illegalities do not receive adequate legal protection in the European Union. All this is despite the fact that the complaints have shown their usefulness, since the various banking scandals, volkswagen scandals, money laundering, tax evasion and tax avoidance are on the agenda. The LuxLeaks scandal, the Borgens and Lagarde lists, which have not yet been fully exploited by the competent authorities, especially in Greece, have shown that individuals as well as multinationals systematically avoid and avoid tax. The introduction of the protection of whistle-blowers is therefore bound to highlight other cases of infringement of the tax and legislation of the Member States of the European Union in general.
