This proposal represents three years of work for me personally and even longer for many others in the Commission and beyond. I would like to thank the political Group shadow rapporteurs for their close cooperation throughout the work on the proposal, the Commission team for their technical knowledge and irrepressible optimism and the Dutch Presidency for the good spirit in which these difficult negotiations were conducted. On the last day of the Dutch Presidency, 30 June 2016, we reached an agreement on this challenging legislative proposal after five months of tough trilogues and many technical drafting meetings. The political backdrop has changed dramatically over the past three years, with the issue of air quality moving up the public agenda in an unprecedented way, culminating in the VW scandal and the focus on the issue of real-driving emissions. Perhaps there is also a recognition that we have spent the past decade or more concentrating so much on CO2 that we have neglected air quality. We have known for some time that Europe needs to take action to clean up its air, and I believe strongly that this vote is a step in the right direction. It is not a perfect solution but it will go a long way to making important health improvements for our citizens. Air pollution is the number one environmental cause of death in the EU. More than 400 000 of our citizens die prematurely each year and millions more suffer debilitating illness requiring medication and hospitalisation. This has an enormous human and economic cost, with tens of billions of euros in days lost at work and even more spent on healthcare bills, particularly in a country like my own where healthcare costs are met directly through our national system. Air pollution also hits the natural environment through eutrophication and acid deposition. So in December 2013 the Commission published its clean air package the central plank of which was the NEC Directive and the setting of emissions reduction targets in all the Member States for 2030. This proposal has had a difficult passage through the legislative process. We had the European elections shortly after it was published, a new Commission taking office and a real fight from this House to keep the directive on the table after a suggestion that it might be withdrawn from the work programme. More recently, we have had to contend with the UK referendum on EU membership and securing a deal in the difficult days – for me at least – after the vote to leave. I still feel strongly, as your rapporteur, that this is a key issue which is best tackled at EU level. Simply put, air pollution does not stop at Member State borders. I strongly believe that better regulation and good air quality are not mutually exclusive and that is why I fought so hard to keep this proposal alive and get it onto the books. There will be some people here who will say that the deal is not ambitious enough and that we should have fought longer and harder for even higher targets. The fact is, however, that this is a negotiation. Each side has its positions and, whilst there is always room for improvement, we have to be cognisant of the political reality and not allow perfection to become the enemy of good. Parliament’s starting position on Annex II was in line with the Commission’s impact—assessed proposal, which estimated the emission reduction commitments would result in a 52% health improvement, whereas the Council’s figures, set out as part of a general approach, would have resulted in a 48% reduction in premature mortality. In the final, hard-fought agreement the overall level of ambition on Annex II takes us to just under 50%. Concerning the targets for 2025, the final compromise specifies that Member States may follow a non-linear trajectory if that is economically or technically more efficient, provided that, as from 2025, it converges progressively with the linear trajectory and does not affect any reduction commitment for 2030. In addition, Member States would have to explain the reasons for any deviation from the linear trajectory, as well as the measures necessary to return to it. On flexibility provisions, Parliament accepted that Member States should be granted some flexibility in achieving the 2030 targets but tightened the wording proposed by the Council to ensure that the provisions were not open to abuse. Parliament accepted that methane be excluded from the scope of the legislation on condition that the Commission confirmed, in accordance with its right of initiative, that it would carry out a review with regard to methane even if it was not specifically in the directive. This issue should never be about playing to the gallery: it should be about real action for our citizens. As the rapporteur, I am fully supportive of this final text and consider it to be an ambitious, fair and workable agreement for reducing the number of premature deaths attributable to air pollution. It is not a perfect agreement but, as a Brit working in Brussels, I am not sure there is any such thing, ever. Compromise is key to any negotiation and any final agreement. Indeed, having a seat at the table and being able to influence the discussions is a precious thing. So I urge you all to vote in favour of this deal today.

The result is a major achievement on the biggest environment and health problem facing Europe. It will reduce the health impacts of air pollution, respiratory diseases and premature death by close to 50% by 2030. Citizens across the whole European Union will benefit enormously and these are results that we collectively can be very proud of. It will also pave the way for ratification of the revised Gothenburg Protocol and for pollution reduction in the Eastern European Caucasus and Central Asian States. It is important not only for the population of all those countries but also in terms of reducing trans-boundary pollution in the European Union. In any negotiation there are compromises to be made, and discussions on the key points were long and hard, but the final position is an honourable outcome which is ambitious, fair and practical. The level of ambition is high, the flexibilities are limited and their use must be justified, and there must be steady progress towards the 2030 commitments, to ensure full and timely implementation, as well as providing legal certainty to investors in green technology.  All Member States and sectors will need to play their part in the implementation of the directive. It is understandable that where pollution, and therefore health impacts, are highest more effort is needed. We must maximise the use of European Union support as well as synergies with other policies such as those on agriculture, energy and climate. Cost-effective implementation will deliver not only better health but also the economic benefits of cleaner air, such as lower health costs and less absenteeism at work. The Commission regrets the deletion of methane from the scope of the directive, and we have made clear in our statement that we will continue to monitor these emissions and their effect on ambient air quality and we will take action as appropriate. On ammonia, we regret that the reduction is less than we had initially proposed on the basis of scientific analysis in our impact assessment. Lastly, we also regret that the co-legislator has departed from the letter and the spirit of the regulation governing the adoption of implementing acts. We have made our concerns clear in a further statement. However, this will not distract attention from the fact that the agreement before us is a major achievement by the three EU institutions working together for the benefit of the public, which I hope you will endorse today. This would enable us to turn our attention to implementation, with the health and wellbeing of our citizens always in mind.

We welcome the agreement reached with the Council on 30 June 2016 under the Dutch Presidency. This will speed up the improvement of air quality in Europe, which will also provide the sectors concerned with the necessary planning and investment security. The five main points in detail: firstly, the health target: we are achieving a nearly 50% improvement in health by significantly reducing five air pollutants: sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, ammonia, volatile organic compounds and particulate matter. Secondly — and Mr Huitema has just rightly pointed this out: methane has been excluded from the scope of the directive. A legitimate concern of colleagues from the Committee on Agriculture has been taken into account. Thirdly, the national emission reduction targets for ammonia have been set at a realistic level, i.e. at an achievable level. That was definitely a good negotiation result. Fourthly, the reduction targets for mercury have not been included here. An equally legitimate concern of colleagues from the Committee on Industry has been taken into account here. We have remained true to the principle of 'no regulation without impact assessment'. We should remain true to this principle in the future. Then we really do better laws and not just say this. Fifthly and lastly, the targets for 2025. Member States will be able to follow a nonlinear path if this is more efficient for them. The key factor is not the achievement of intermediate targets, but the principle of cost-efficiency. Conclusion: Overall, we achieved a good negotiation result.

It is important to recognise that, at the beginning of the mandate of this Parliament, the issue of air equality was not perhaps quite uppermost in people’s thoughts. It has taken a scandal or two to get us to this situation, most notably, of course, the ‘Dieselgate’ scandal involving VW. This is an issue that affects so many of our citizens: 400 000 across the EU are dying prematurely, and in my city – the EU’s biggest city, London – 10 000 people are dying every single year from the effects of poor air. 90% of our citizens who live in cities are exposed to dangerously high levels of air pollution. We could be proud of this place and the coordinated action that has taken place at a European level. Throughout the process, it was the European institutions that led the way in terms of ambition. The high initial ambition shown by the Environment Committee is testament to the individual ambitions of the Members who supported the highest targets, and this place can be proud of consistently holding a higher line than that shown by the Member States. Ultimately we had to compromise, but it was the national governments who had consistently shown the least resolve. At every stage this Parliament, representing 500 million citizens across the European Union, was backed not just by NGOs, scientists and public health campaigns, but also by cities from Berlin to Barcelona, London to Lisbon, Paris to Prague, to Dublin to Dubrovnik, Amsterdam to Aarhus. City mayors have shown us that they want this action to be taken at European level. We now have this deal on the table with Member States; it is not perfect, and it will not eliminate the problem, but it is significant progress and it does show what can be achieved by scaling up overriding competing regional and national interests and acting in the common good. Our task is now to hold governments to account on delivering these targets. We must challenge the old tired but re-emerging competition between industry and the idea that industry and clean air cannot go hand in hand. We must consistently put pressure to target resources into innovation and the development of new technology, and we must never surrender to the divisive rhetoric from those who want to see a race to the bottom between us on environmental standards. It has perhaps become fashionable in my country to pretend we can insulate ourselves from difficult decisions, to pretend that we can deal with these issues on our own. We cannot. We breathe the same air. I have no idea what Brexit will end up doing to my city and my country, but I do know that the best environmental protections we have have come from this place. If we are to continue to work and to trade with our nearest neighbours in the world’s biggest market, we have to abide by its rules. I do not expect them to, but if my government decides to use environmental standards as a bargaining chip, I expect and urge all of us here to stand firm.

The agreement concluded between the institutions on the reduction of certain pollutants is critically evaluated for three reasons. First, Ladies, for methodological reasons. The whole negotiation was based on a questionable methodology that converted pollution reduction into a percentage of determined health improvements — as if health improvements depended only and solely on that sole source. Secondly, I also assess them critically for procedural reasons, because Parliament has made it a point of honour to achieve a specific level of health protection. In order to satisfy Parliament, the Dutch Presidency has imposed on three countries — Poland, Romania and Hungary — commitments that are not really able to meet. And the third reason — it's decency. The European Commission has made it clear that the cost of reductions in the Netherlands is several times lower than in Poland, for example. So how does this come to decency?

I think it was not always a simple job, and I think it was a rather time-consuming job, and yet I dare say that, above all, the rapporteur, as our head, managed and mastered it her well. However, remembering in retrospect how the whole negotiations for this directive took place, I am kind of sad, because I also consider them a missed chance. The final text is a mere shadow of the originally approved ambitious wording. The conclusion of the negotiation was negatively affected by two things. First and foremost with the panic fear of the forthcoming Presidency of the Council, and second, sorry Julie, a Brexit that at the time had just a few days since its shocking birth. We panicked unnecessarily in this atmosphere and what's about the final result is knowing that. The biggest problem I see is that the original text, as amended before the trialogues, contained a legally binding commitment to reduce the health burden caused by people by air pollution by 52% compared to a year ago 2005. However, at the same time, the text voted agrees with the Council's proposed value of 49,6%, while the red line was 50%. Behind these abstract numbers, however, lie concrete foiled extra human lives, which could have been prevented.

Indeed, as a previous colleague said, it was a very interesting and tough negotiation path, but I do think that in the end Ms Girling was very helpful in trying to strike a deal. However, if you assess the deal we can only be disappointed. Just look at the demands that we had as a Parliament. We wanted higher ambition. We had to give in substantially. We did not want any flexibilities on top of that. The Council and the Member States were asking for more and more flexibilities. We do not have a 2025 target, so it is now only talking about 2030, which is very, very far down the road. Methane is out, so the agriculture sector is off the hook again for cleaning our air. All these things together can only lead to one conclusion and that is that this package is not good enough. And I think I have to turn now to the Council – to the Dutch Presidency maybe in particular – who did good work in striking this deal. But if you turn to all the Member States, I really have a question. We are discussing air pollution. If there is one thing that is clearly a European competence and that is really cross-border, it is air pollution. If we do something about it, it will lead to jobs, cleaner technologies, cleaner air, better improvements for our citizens, lower costs for health. All these things we can achieve. What we saw at the Member State level was just a purely nationalistic approach; what can I do? I shall pay no mind to my neighbouring countries and only do what I can deliver. That approach really caused the deterioration of this deal, and it is a shame. I ask the Member States to keep in mind that if you want to fight for Europe, you have to fight for European solidarity on these kind of issues.

It is not by chance that the situation of agriculture, livestock husbandry and the strict limits on ammonia emissions have been said several times. It should have been taken into account that this sector has already achieved a 30% reduction since '90. By the way, Hungary is facing the highest requirement. Agriculture must reduce ammonia emissions by 32% by 2030. We must also look at this in the light of where we are with one of the most dangerous emitters, the pollution caused by the car.

Unfortunately, the Council softened him a little. But this is definitely doable now. I would like to say one more sentence on ammonia. This is a pollutant that does not come primarily from industry, but above all from agriculture, for example when spauting manure. If we manage to deliver manure more specifically — through new technology — if you do better than before, we can bring down ammonia emissions and thus protect health and the environment.

I also wonder about the inspections and the enforcement of all of this. We will do it in the UK to the letter. I wonder if the same can be true of elsewhere in Europe.  I am also concerned about NMVO compounds. Are we going to export an industry here? Are we simply going to import materials that are being produced with these compounds elsewhere?  Finally, nitrous oxide is produced by leguminous plants, yet the European Commission wants farmers to produce more leguminous plants.

This report is also in this direction, despite the individual disagreements that we may have. Unfortunately, however, environmental pollution is a global problem that cannot be solved by the European Union alone, while emissions and efforts to reduce them have complications that extend to issues beyond the ecological approach and have to do with the economy, competition of companies and the context in which companies operate. For example, with free trade agreements, companies that remain within the Union, where the many and correct emission restrictions apply, will find themselves facing companies based in China or South-East Asia or even the USA, where regulations are clearly more relaxed and, consequently, production costs are reduced. The result is essentially that companies are forced to migrate, causing social and economic problems in the Union, but also greater environmental pollution overall. We therefore conclude that restrictions on emissions must also be accompanied by a policy of economic protectionism, making imports from countries which do not meet exactly the same legal requirements regarding the emission of pollutants more expensive. Unfortunately, the free trade agreements are going in the exact opposite direction. Finally, the Union must review its relations with third countries and make environmental protection an important factor and a prerequisite for the continuation of these relations.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "aws", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 22, "date": "2016-11-23.json", "name": "Françoise GROSSETÊTE", "mepid": "2025", "text": " — Mr President, Commissioner, let us not be afraid of words, air pollution is a silent mass killer that is very little talked about but is a real massacre.

Because the memorandum has increased the rate of excise duty on heating oil, as well as VAT on heating oil, electricity and gas.

I am encouraged by the broad support for the agreement that has been reached. It is close to the original Commission proposal in terms of ambition and, given the difficulty of the negotiation, is in my view a good compromise between various positions. I know that concerns remain on flexibilities and on interim checks on the trajectory to 2030. However, the additional flexibilities are tightly constrained and we will monitor their application closely. Likewise, for the interim trajectory there is now a robust management framework in place to ensure that Member States are on track to meet their commitments. The Commission will evaluate the national programmes, including the credibility of the reduction pathways, and those evaluations will be made public. I have listened to and note the concerns of some about the level of effort required in particular Member States, but those are the very Member States whose citizens will benefit the most from implementation of the measures. They are the Member States that have the greatest problems in complying with ambient air quality standards and they are the Member States that will save most in terms of health and other economic benefits. We will work with non—Member States to maximise their support, including from European Union financing and from synergies with, for instance, EU climate and energy policies for the successful and cost—effective implementation of the directive. On the review of methane emissions, the Commission has made a declaration because it considers that there is a strong air-quality case for keeping the development of methane emissions in the Member States under review in order to reduce the ozone concentrations in the EU and to promote methane reductions internationally. The Commission confirms that, on the basis of the reported national emissions, it intends to assess further the impact of methane emissions on achieving the objectives set out in Article 1(2) of the NEC Directive; it will consider measures for reducing those emissions and, where appropriate, will submit a legislative proposal for that purpose. In its assessment the Commission will take into account a number of ongoing studies in this field, due to be finalised in 2017, as well as further international developments in this area. I would like to close by again thanking the rapporteur and shadow rapporteurs for making possible this major step forward in air pollution control. Declaration by the Commission on the procedure for adoption of implementing acts The Commission underlines that it is contrary to the letter and to the spirit of regulation 182/2011 (OJ L 55 of 28.2.2011, p. 13) to invoke Article 5§4, subparagraph 2, point b) in a systematic manner. Recourse to this provision must respond to a specific need to depart from the rule of principle which is that the Commission may adopt a draft implementing act when no opinion is delivered.  Given that it is an exception to the general rule established in Article 5§4 recourse to subparagraph 2, point b), cannot be simply seen as a \"discretionary power\" of the Legislator, but must be interpreted in a restrictive manner and thus must be justified.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 44, "date": "2016-11-23.json", "name": "Julie GIRLING", "mepid": "96956", "text": "  rapporteur. – Mr President, thank you to all the colleagues who have spoken this morning. Their contributions reflect the divisions in this House over the ambition levels, and particularly the removal of methane and the effects on agriculture. In fact, agriculture has taken quite a prominent position in this debate, so I would particularly like to mention to Mr Häusling that, whilst he extols the virtue of organic farming, you will search in vain through his organic regulation proposals, currently in trilogue, for any reference to agricultural standards on air quality, whereas the NEC proposal contains an extensive annex referencing farming practices. This is a lost opportunity I think. Also, to those Polish members who criticise this directive: they have spoken about unfairness to agriculture, while rather ignoring the elephant in the room. In 2013, a survey by the Environmental Agency of air quality in 386 cities found that Krakow had the third most polluted air in Europe, predominantly as a result of 30 000 coal-fired boilers, with a further 150 000 in the wider Malopolska area.

Recently, attention has been focused on greenhouse emissions, and this has led to a decline in the rates of limiting other pollutants, which have a serious impact on human health and the environment. For example, the expansion of diesel cars due to lower CO2-discharges has led to an increase in harmful nitrogen oxides from them. Almost 400,000 people in the EU die prematurely from polluted air and another 40 million people breathe particulate matter far above the norm. The new legislation must restore confidence in the reduction of harmful emissions with its ambition of targets and sound control mechanisms.

At the outset, let me highlight that the European Union has shown its strong commitment to climate action by ratifying the Paris Agreement on 5 October 2016. Following the consent given by Parliament, the ratification of the Agreement by the EU, together with seven Member States, triggered its entry into force on 4 November 2016 and confirmed the key role of the European Union in the multilateral process. This was clearly recognised in Marrakech.  Overall, 112 parties ratified the Paris Agreement by 18 November. The European Union can be satisfied with the result of the Marrakech Conference. We witnessed the unprecedented quick entry into force of the Paris Agreement, the progress made on the development of its rules and the major demonstration of activities by non-state actors. This all confirmed the determination of the international community to continue moving forward, with a transition towards a low emission and climate-resilient future.  The European Union’s main objective at the Marrakech Conference was to put on track the swift preparation for the effective and comprehensive implementation of all the elements of the Paris Agreement.  Marrakech demonstrated progress and enabled action in the following areas: First, the subsidiary bodies outlined the work to establish the Paris rulebook, including the progress on the features of nationally determined contributions, the Transparency Framework, the Adaptation Mechanism and the Adaptation Registry.  Other elements to be mentioned are the global stock take, the Sustainable Development Mechanism concerning markets, non-market approaches and the compliance mechanism. The COP also mandated the current and incoming presidencies to start preparations for the 2018 facilitative dialogues. Secondly, progress was made on enhancing action and transparency before 2020, including on the predictability of climate finance flows to developing countries; on loss and damage, namely the review of the Warsaw International Mechanism; on technology development and transfer, capacity-building mechanisms, methodological issues, response measures, as well as on measures concerning gender and indigenous peoples.  Thirdly, the Global Climate Action Agenda was another key part of Marrakech. The Action Agenda builds on the growing momentum from stakeholders to mobilise global action in the water sector and in the areas of oceans, disaster risk reduction, agriculture, forestry, transport, energy and human settlements. All these initiatives by non-state actors support the Convention and the aims of the Paris Agreement.  Amongst many other issues, I would like to highlight the second round of the multilateral assessment process, which took place in Marrakech. Nineteen EU Member States and the European Union successfully completed the process of reviewing the progress made in the implementation of emission reductions and removals related to their quantified economy-wide emission reduction targets. The remaining Member States will follow next year.  And finally, the conference made a high-level political statement, the Marrakech Action Proclamation, which reflects the continuous political commitment towards the implementation of the Paris Agreement and reaffirms the willingness of all participants to fight against climate change and to support sustainable development.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "PPE-DE", "partyIdeology": "PPE-DE"}, {"id": 52, "date": "2016-11-23.json", "name": "Miguel ARIAS CAÑETE", "mepid": "1351", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, honourable Members, Minister, it is a pleasure to be here today, having just returned from the COP22 in Marrakech, where almost 200 countries met against the background of the early ratification and entry into force of the Paris Agreement.  First, I want to thank the European Parliament’s delegation to COP for their very strong support throughout the conference. This enabled the European Union to stay unified as we forge ahead on global climate action. I also want to take this opportunity, in the presence of the Minister, to thank the Slovak Presidency for the close cooperation, both in the preparations and during the COP22. I will also stress again my appreciation for Parliament’s role in ensuring the early ratification of the Agreement, which enabled the Marrakech Conference to convene the first ever meeting of the parties to the Paris Agreement.  COP22 lived up to expectations as an action and implementation COP. It is true that, in the light of the United States election results, we face political challenges and uncertainties ahead, but the message from Marrakech was nevertheless clear: we will stand by Paris; we will defend Paris; and we will implement Paris.  The Marrakech Action Proclamation reflects the spirit of COP22. It is a statement of global unity, confirming that the parties remain committed to climate action post—Paris and the transition to a global low—carbon economy. Important progress was also achieved under the Paris Work Programme. The parties agreed a clear way forward to ensure that the rule book will be ready by 2018, and advanced on key elements to guide the implementation of the Agreement, including transparency and the five-year ambition cycle.  Solidarity with our international partners is critical if we wish to maintain global momentum on climate action, and the parties welcomed the adoption of the 2020 climate finance roadmap as progress towards the goal of mobilising USD 100 million by 2020. Member States have also shown their commitment to supporting the most vulnerable countries in dealing with the impacts of climate change. Several European Union Member States announced that new contributions to the adaptation fund, which now stands at USD 81 million, directly supporting developing countries in their efforts to cope with the effects of climate change. In addition, the parties also showed a continued commitment to capacity building and the Warsaw International Mechanism for Loss and Damage. A decision was adopted on the review of the Mechanism, which will result in increasing its potential and effectiveness and confirming the shared commitment of parties to address the concerns of the most vulnerable countries. On the Action Agenda, COP22 included an impressive range of high—level side—events. This enabled countries, states, regions, cities, the private sector and NGOs to come together under the Global Climate Action Agenda to showcase inspiring climate action initiatives to reduce emissions, transition to a low—carbon economy and support our partners in the mitigation and adaptation efforts. Besides several other major actions, COP22 saw the launch of the international NDC partnership. We will support developing countries in the implementation of the nationally determined contributions to the Paris Agreement.  The European Union played an instrumental role in achieving the Marrakech outcomes, and there was regular effective coordination with Member States, no red lines were crossed and all politically sensitive options were considered carefully and collectively. The European Union Member States negotiated with flexibility, and their commitment to delivering a positive outcome in Marrakech was very clear.  The European Union also demonstrated its determination to making significant efforts to scale up support to climate relevant action. In 2015, the European Union and its Member States provided EUR 17.6 billion to help developing countries tackle climate change. Moreover, the European External Investment Plan expected to trigger public and private investment of up to EUR 44 billion in Africa and the European Union’s neighbourhood area had a very positive reception by our international partners. The High Ambition Coalition – the alliance of developed and developing countries that made possible the Paris Agreement – also convened during COP22. The meeting helped to define our joint negotiation strategy during the COP, as well as to exchange views on the potential impact of the outcome of the United States elections on the United Nation negotiation process. What is clear is that, given the current uncertainties, the High Ambition Coalition has a renewed sense of purpose as we move ahead with the implementation of the Paris Agreement.  Now that we have returned from Marrakech, the hard work does not stop. In the current uncertain geopolitical setting the European Union must, more than ever, remain steady on its course to a low—carbon, energy-efficient future. Marrakech showed us we are not alone. The momentum keeps growing in many of our G20 partners, including China, that are more determined than ever. We have good scope for scaling up international collaboration in terms of bilateral policy dialogues and sharing experiences. I will do the necessary to deliver on this.  I will also work closely with the German G20 Presidency to make sure we exploit the positive opening under the G20 to follow up on the Paris implementation. In addition to strengthening our strategic partnerships, we must continue to demonstrate to the world our commitment to climate action by implementing our NDC. Our proposals on the 23rd legislative framework, including the European Union ETS and LLUCF, are now on the table, and I look forward to working with the Parliament in the months ahead to ensure strict progress on this package.  Implementing the Paris Agreement is an unprecedented opportunity to modernise our economy and create jobs and growth. It is a central element in achieving broad and sustainable development goals as well as the European Union priorities on investment, competitiveness, circular economy research, innovation and energy transition. Therefore, we will also shortly come forward with a package under the title Smart and Clean Energy for all Europeans – a package of proposals which will put energy efficiency first, will reinvigorate our global leadership in renewables and deliver a fair deal for European consumers and citizens, as well as business and industry. Together with existing proposals on the table, this package will ensure a comprehensive and coherent climate and energy policy framework up to 2030. It will deliver on our contribution to the Paris Agreement and will make bigger steps forward towards our overall vision for an energy union.  In conclusion, honourable Members, we have achieved marked progress this year on global climate action. Less than twelve months ago, we adopted the Paris Agreement, and through commitment and hard work ensured its entry into force earlier this month. We still have much work to do to implement our commitments on the ground and I count on your continued support to turn our commitments into reality.

Almost 200 countries met in Morocco and many were the commitments of our delegation, which had the opportunity to confront many other national delegations and prominent personalities. We can certainly say that the progress made in Marrakech is proof that the world will move forward with the fight against climate change. With the Marrakesh Declaration, in fact, states have shown an idea of solidarity and continuity with each other. The COP22 leaves no doubt: we must continue the path started last year. The Paris Agreement would not have been possible without the trust between the parties and we in Marrakech confirmed that confidence. As far as the EU is concerned, we will continue to implement our commitments and achieve the goals we set ourselves, no matter what happens.

COP 22 was a success. On behalf of the S&D Group, I would like to thank the Commission and the Council for their good negotiation and also for the involvement of Parliament's delegation with the daily briefings. It is good to see in Marrakech that the international community stands together and that all 195 states have reaffirmed their commitment to enforce the Paris Agreement and not to be unsettled by the election of the new US President Donald Trump. However, with the election in the US, we need a revision of leadership in global climate protection. The EU must take on this leadership role and — Commissioner, you said — we should win China as a partner and keep it further so that this coalition can really push ahead with the Paris agenda. China will be useful for new technologies, as well as for a global carbon market. The next COP, which will be very important, will be COP 24 in two years' time — 2018, where we need to review the national commitments. Here would be my question to the Council and the Commission: what will the EU offer in 2018? Will we be discussing our 2030 targets there, too, whether we can stand up better? We also saw in Marrakech that 48 countries have chosen to switch 100% to renewable energy and to organise a long-term strategy. As the EU, are we also able to adopt a roadmap 2050, a 2050 strategy?

It is pretty impossible to ignore, though, the big orange cloud that was hanging over COP 22, and not from the Saharan dust. It is true that the US elections did have an effect, but there were positive outcomes. In a political statement of resolve following the US presidential elections, the Conference adopted a call for all nations to honour promises made in Paris and renew their attempts to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees. Negotiators focused on initiatives to reinforce existing carbon reduction plans, with some countries promising to review ambitions before 2020. Countries also fixed a 2018 deadline for preparing a rule book establishing the rules and processes needed to provide operational guidance for the Paris Agreement and 11 governments, including my own, actually ratified the climate agreement during the COP.  There were, of course, some negative outcomes. Despite strategic funding commitments from the US, Germany and the UK to improve carbon accounting in developing countries, the sums on offer fall well short of the EUR 100 billion a year developed countries have promised to mobilise by 2020 in order to help poorer countries develop their infrastructure on many fronts. I know that the work to increase these new financial pledges will be ongoing, and Mr Arias Cañete is in the forefront with his high ambition coalition.  The issue of loss and damage and how to approach recompense for damage caused by climate change has been put off again for discussions at further dates, but that does not mean that it has been forgotten. Over the past 12 months, we have made rapid and unprecedented progress in laying the foundations for a low-carbon, climate-resilient economy.

At the start of the Marrakech COP I had one hope, and that was that the entire world would send a message to Washington that the Paris Agreement and the process after that would be irreversible, that the world would move towards this zero-carbon economy, and that in the end is exactly what happened. If President-elect Trump has achieved anything, it is that the world is much more united now behind this transition towards a zero-carbon economy, and even countries like India seem to be much more determined now than they were a few months ago – as does China. What happened in Marrakech shows very well how rapidly the geopolitical scene is changing at the moment. It is only two years since President Obama struck the deal with President Xi Jinping on climate with China. Before that, China was one of the biggest obstacles in international climate negotiations, and look at it now. China is now one of the leading countries in the post-Paris process and that is extremely encouraging.  And what about Europe? Of course Europe is still one of the leaders, and we are still leading by example, but we have to be careful. Look at the difficult internal negotiations within Council but also within Parliament on the ETS. Look at the first reactions by almost all Member States on the effort-sharing regulation proposal from the Commission. It is not that long ago that we all laughed about Russia counting every tree in the Kyoto Agreement to try to undermine that, but now all Member States are doing exactly the same. We think that our trees will save us in the fight against climate change and that is not going to happen.  Finally, it is also an economic issue. China is investing two-and-a-half times more on green technology than Europe. As a percentage of GDP, it is even four times as much, so we have to be extremely careful there. This is also a race ....

I'm sorry to say, Mr Cañete, that I am not going to thank you for your role as Commissioner. The European Union's little weight in the negotiations has become even more evident and, given the new world scenario, more worrying. We still wonder what does a politician with interests in the oil industry and ties with brick giants — also related to corruption scandals like Acuamed or Panama Papers — representing the European Union's position in the fight against climate change. You filled your mouth in Marrakech calling the energy transition unstoppable, yet the party to which you belong did not even ratify the Paris Agreement in time, withdrew the incentives for renewable energy, and, since the People's Party reached the government in Spain, emissions have not stopped growing. Spain is the only country in the European Union to have increased its greenhouse gas emissions since 2013. It seems to me that this is not a good method for making the energy transition. Mr Cañete, the European Union has been out, it has been absent in many important negotiations. This should make you think about your role as Commissioner, whether you are at the ethical level of the post.

We had a great time and our Commissioner is certainly a good international negotiator. I think it is right that we should point this out. It was a good COP. We had the impression of a quick ratification, there was unity against Mr Trump and there were a lot of positive vibes, in part because of the positive agenda that the French have started in Paris: energy efficiency in buildings, energy efficiency in transport, renewable energy, interconnectivity, and getting financial markets to understand that it is not black energy but green energy which is the future. All that was around us and is really positive. I have two critical remarks to make. One, Commissioner, is that I think we in Europe could be better at selling our story. The success story of Europe is that 95% of our climate achievements are in eco-design, labelling, building legislation, energy efficiency legislation, renewables, CO2 and cars. Five percent may be due to the ETS, because the ETS is largely a failure. So why, at international COPs, do we speak only about carbon markets and why do we hide away our success stories on renewables? Why did nobody from the Commission speak about the Juncker external fund for Africa at a time when we could help Africa to improve and to move much more quickly into renewable energy? The second criticism concerns early ambition. You will have a difficult time in 2018 if we go with that the Council’s low level of ambition, which was set in the light of Mr Cameron’s veto threat. Forty percent by 2727 is not a story in a 1.5º world nor in a 2º world. Your energy package of next week will be the occasion to show that Europe is a leader and, in that regard, why are you now reducing the investment opportunities for renewables in Europe with low ambition, low governance and the destruction of priority access and despatch? On the rule book and the support scheme, you have some civil servants who prevent you from doing what you have politically agreed. Why is Mr Timmermans opposing a quota on renewable energy? I hope it is not because we have so many gas lobbyists hanging around.

The shadow of Trump's pre-election statements was all over the conference and in fact from Marrakech only one proclamation came out, but it reaffirms the desire to continue united and compact in the implementation of what was decided and established in the Paris Agreement, which was not for granted, so anyway it is good news. We want to be positive and say that “irreversibility” and “cooperation” are the two key words of COP22. Irreversibility, because the fight against climate change through the development of a sustainable economy is a mechanism that can no longer be stopped. Not even from Trump: Doubts about US engagement were swept up by the words of outgoing Secretary of State Kerry, who explained what the same US economy will look like, the same businesses , to get Trump back on his steps. Back there is no coming back. Cooperation, because it is only through support, investment and knowledge transfer between developed countries and developing economies, that the fight against global warming can be won. Now, with the United States likely to be less motivated and decided at the negotiating tables, it is up to the European Union to take the leadership in negotiations and policies against global warming. And the actions on which to be strong and decided now are, above all, those of individual countries. It is essential that the Union pushes for a first NDCs review, in the crucial year 2018, strong and ambitious and aimed at meeting the 1.5 degree limit set in Paris. And it cannot and should not let its Member States — as someone, including Italy, is already doing — start playing the downside. It is necessary to push hard on the newborn 2050 Pathway Platform, to which the European Union promptly has joined, to make it an opportunity to strengthen the climate policies of the Member States by integrating them into a broader and more effective plan.

On the one hand the impoverishment of labour, the impoverishment of the manufacturing production of our countries, relocated precisely in China, India, Brazil. But sadly, alas, world pollution has also not shrunk. Because it's obvious that if you move production from one side to another and don't act on the actual causes, you've shifted pollution but didn't reduce pollution. And therefore the pollution continues to be there and testify, alas, the actions that precisely want to put in the field of expenditure of more than 100 billion dollars to reduce the environmental impact.

Marrakech has been a success and I would like to thank everyone who contributed to this. I would like to commend Mr Turmes for praising Mr Turmes for praising the Commissioner. We agree on the EPP: if the Greens praise Jean-Claude Juncker and Miguel Arias Cañete, then we must approve that. The election of Donald Trump was, of course, a shock to everyone in Marrakech. But there has been a clear response from all the rest of the world. If we used to have a situation where climate protection had to be done against the US and China, then we now have at least a clear commitment from China that it will continue to implement the Paris Agreement and the Convention. In the US, thank God, there are also discussions on whether Trump's announcements will be implemented in this way — we do not know yet. But we have to be armed. This is an important statement that I would like to make here on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party. Now, after the elections in the United States, we must all the more ensure that the industry is protected, if it is up to date. That is why we want to increase the free allocation for industry in emissions trading. We need to figure out what will happen if Trump really gets out. I have always been — like many in my group — against customs duties at borders, against carbon border tax adjustments. But if a country is opting out of the climate agreement — the Paris Convention and the Paris Convention — we must at least consider whether we will not use this instrument against that country.

Many people have said that, and we absolutely want to support that: the dynamism that arose in Paris, which was not broken in COP 22, despite the elections in the United States. And on that momentum, work needs to be continued. And then it is extremely important that Europe not only maintains its historic leadership role, but further strengthens it and seeks new allies, for example by looking at China. And that means that we must also show that leadership in our own policies, and I support what Mr Turmes has said about this: when it comes to the winter package that is coming, please let that be the most ambitious thing that we can put forward when the is about energy efficiency, about our buildings and, of course, about renewable energy. But it is also a task for ourselves, as has been said a few times earlier: we are in the last straight line in Parliament to negotiate within ENVI on ETS. Here too, ladies and gentlemen, as ambitious as possible. We still have to negotiate with the Member States. We always know that this gives rise to some further dilution of the compromises.

If, I say, the United States somehow withdraws from Paris, then we should not be naive. We must be ambitious and at the same time make sure that we protect. If we demand great efforts from our industry, what we need to do to ensure that we tackle CO2, we must also ensure that we look in a good way to protect ourselves from countries that leave the Paris Agreement.

That was the political side of the story which was not in the negotiations room, but was very prominent and visible and you could feel it in the rooms in Marrakech. There, we really have a challenge. What we saw happening in Marrakech is that China is taking the lead. They say that they are going ahead no matter what. So we have left the idea that we are finger-pointing at each other and the idea of ‘we only move if you move’. That is very important, but we also know that it is a delicate balance. For example, a country like India is much more insecure. So this really boils down to ‘what is Europe going to do’? Is Europe going to step in in two ways – dealing with China and also increasing ambition? We need to show that we, as Europe, not only talk the talk but also walk the walk. That is crucial, and that is where Europe is not delivering yet, but it is also now very crucial in the negotiations on ETS, for example. Everyone who is talking about the importance of climate change – and I am looking at my EPP colleagues now – make sure you also deliver on ETS, because in the current negotiations we are only discussing ‘protecting, protecting, protecting’ and forgetting the ambition, and that is making us weak internationally.

Also there is thanks due to Morocco itself, it was a good location because they gave an example of moving to low-carbon economy: they have the largest solar plant in the world and electric cars were used to ferry people around from place to place. Some people were worried about the impact of the presidential elections. I left much less worried then when I went there, for two reasons. Number one: the United States themselves have indicated that in many states there are movements to decarbonise the economy, both at official level and at business level. This is not going to change in states like California, Florida, Pennsylvania, and so on. Number two: China, in reply to a question I put to them directly as to whether they would use the election in the United States to renege, or to attain the opportunity for global leadership on this issue, they said they would continue with global leadership on the path they promised last year. So I think we can be encouraged. The word that we can use to describe this movement now is ‘unstoppable’.

We have to do an awful lot, especially in relation to the developing countries. The EUR 100 billion fund will have to be attained.

In Marrakech this year, and in Bonn, tomorrow, the effort must focus on implementing the Paris Agreement. As we see, COP22 has embarked on this momentum, but negotiations remain slow and difficult. Let me draw your attention to the topic of water. I note with regret that, too often, we make the supply of quality and sufficient water an achievement. However, climate change and population growth are unprecedented threats. 80% of the world's jobs depend on access to water supplies. Good water management is therefore a priority challenge. It is a cross-cutting topic that should be at the heart of climate action. COP22 devoted a day to water, which is a breakthrough. This event highlighted the hyperactivity of civil society that innovates daily, invents and develops to improve water management and rationalize uses. Water actors are ready to take up this challenge. What we need today is a political portage and a framework for action to unlock the potential of the blue economy. Several key principles seem to me to be a priority: to better take into account climate interaction and generalize the watershed system, which is the most relevant scale for good water management.

So I hope we will work together in this Parliament, and also that the various parts of the Commission will work together. The second opportunity concerns energy in Africa and developing countries, and I thank Claude Turmes for talking about the external investment plan because this is an extremely important opportunity, and we have not talked much today about Africa and developing countries.

Clearly, the Commission has played a very intense role. We did so in Paris, launching the ambition of the grand coalition; in Marrakesh, in negotiations that are different, much more technical, but moving forward on the road map. And we will have to continue at future COP, future POPs that are going to be very different, they will not have that element of political negotiation so sharp that Paris had, but they are going to be POPs that are technically important in providing the Paris Agreement with the instruments necessary for its implementation and, on the other hand, they are going to be COP of implementation, to develop our policies. What we have seen at this COP is that non-governmental actors had a very important presence: municipalities, regions, autonomous communities, Oenegés, civil society, energy companies, renewable energy companies, energy efficiency companies, economic actors, social actors. It was a COP, as will be future POPs, to see best practices. I was asked what the Commission's attitude is to respect non-governmental actors: maximum cooperation and openness. We have worked very closely with the Covenant of Mayors, because we understood that cities were a very powerful melting pot of climate change experiences, and we will continue to work with other non-governmental actors, with the Committee of the Regions and with all these actors, because the fight against climate change is a bottom-up, up bottom, and therefore we have to do it enormously participatory. I want to say that 2016 has been a very positive year for climate change. 2015 had the emblematic Paris Agreement, but in 2016 we have ratified — the European Union and many of its Member States, at this time sixteen Member States, have already ratified it — it has entered into force thanks to European ratification, and we have developed COP 22 in accordance with expectations on the table and even with the Marrakesh Action Plan, which is a commitment to all parties to keep action at an important level and to implement our policies. Mr. Helmer said Paris was dead. For “the dead you kill are in good health”, because Paris is alive and kicking, which is said in Spanish, in Spanish, in Spanish, and, if anything I saw in Marrakech, it was everyone's desire to move forward. And the problem of China has arisen. Faced with a horizon of uncertainty, it is clear that China and the European Union have to approach in order to maintain that permanent leadership in the fight against climate change by developing our policies. And the European Union can be proud and come to these negotiations with very important assets that justify it being able to participate in global leadership. Because we have the most ambitious emission reduction target, at least 40% with domestic action, not international credits. Secondly, we are the only party that, at the moment, has launched (or is going to launch next week) all the legislation necessary to meet its climate goals, through legislation, not by presidential decisions. And that is a differential factor, because, apart from the various electoral results that may exist in the twenty-eight Member States, policies remain constant, and that is a value that Europeans can presume. And finally, we have international financial solidarity, respect for developing countries. We can orchestrate large coalitions with developing countries because we are financially supportive; because we are the ones that most climate finance we put on the table, and in addition, in coordination with our development policies. Commissioner Mimica and I worked together. We are the ones who contribute the most in climate finance; we are the ones who finance 50% of the Green Climate Fund; we finance 90% of the Adaptation Fund, and we are respected by developing countries. This is not the work of this Commissioner, it is the work of very consistent policies, which justify that the voice of the European Union can sound strong and seek alliances that will be complex in the future. And we will have to build alliances to India, said Mr Eickhout: it is essential to have India, a country that has impressive demography and equally impressive CO2 emissions, such as its demography. We will have to make approximations to the big emitters, to release the reduction of them. Therefore, the challenges ahead are important. Mr Turmes, you know that I fight to have the most ambitious package possible, and you know me well. Therefore, in this endeavour we will be together. I will launch an important package and then, as Mrs Van Brempt has said here, Parliament will also have its responsibilities, starting with the European emission allowance system, which is fundamental for the industrial sectors; following on the fuzzy sectors — agriculture, buildings, transport — and finally developing the technological innovation that allows us to lead energy efficiency and renewable processes in the world. For all this I know that I have this Parliament. It is very pleasant to work on a policy which, at a time of division in the European Union, is a policy that is a policy that attracts unity. There was unity in the Environment Council, under the Slovak Presidency, to launch the ratification process; there has been unity in this Parliament to give its consent to that ratification; there has been unity in parliaments since sixteen European Union parliaments have already ratified this process. And I wanted to say something to Mrs Estefanía Torres Martínez — which I don't think she is — when she criticized the lack of ratification in the country I know: man, I should tell the whole truth. The Government was in operation throughout the past year and an acting government, with the Spanish Constitution, cannot ratify an agreement. But the first act taken by the Government of the country I know best, after the investiture, was to launch the ratification process. This shows that throughout the European Union climate change policies are policies that bring about unity, ambition and hope.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "aws", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 98, "date": "2016-11-23.json", "name": "Miguel ARIAS CAÑETE", "mepid": "1351", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Madam President, thank you and I thank all those honourable Members who have spoken.

Unfortunately, the EU has also failed to put forward any new measures to help close the emission gap, to hold global warming to well below 2°C, and to pursue efforts to limit it to 1,5°C. Thus, COP24 in 2018 will be the next moment for countries to increase their ambition and scale up emission reduction pledges, and the EU’s leadership is crucial. We must start walking the talk and prioritise energy transition by ramping up our own policies and inadequate climate and energy targets.

I supported Parliament&#39;s calendar of part-sessions for 2018, because, despite the reservations of many EU citizens, but also of us Members, we must abide by the existing treaties and meet 12 times in Strasbourg. The monthly removal from Brussels to Strasbourg of 751 deputies, assistants, officials, ... costs a considerable amount from the EU budget. But in order for this to change, all EU Member States must agree, including France, where plenary sessions take place. To save money, we tried to reduce the meetings in Strasbourg by setting one meeting for Monday and Tuesday, we did not negotiate on Wednesday and then a second meeting on Thursday and Friday.

As a Social Democrat, I have always supported clarity about ICS, but this interest is already secured and reassured by the legal analysis made by the EP services.

Agreement (CETA) between Canada and the European Union with the Treaties. The Free Trade Agreement between Canada and the European Union was signed on October 30 this year, and negotiations ended in August 2014. By the treaty, the European Union and Canada have agreed on an ambitious agreement that will open up new opportunities for trade and investment for businesses on both sides of the Atlantic. Both sides of this Agreement emphasized the importance of conducting economic activity within the framework of clear and transparent regulations issued by public bodies and stressed that they consider the right to regulation in the public interest a fundamental principle of the Agreement. For example, in Article 1.9.

It is outrageous that there is even a limited democratic debate in the European Parliament on such an important topic on which our future depends, as the motion for a resolution has not even been allowed to be debated.

We now know the answer. It happened because of a brilliant lobbying operation by Volkswagen and other car manufacturers which had discovered a new form of turbo engine. The result was literally fatal. We do not know how many people died as the result of pushing diesel, because the death certificate will not show ‘diesel’. It will show ‘heart failure’ or ‘pollutants getting into the brain’.

In Europe, society's total health-related external costs due to air pollution are estimated at around € 330-940 billion per year. In addition, there is growing evidence that the deposition of atmospheric nitrogen particles in the atmosphere causes changes in the natural environment, such as reduced diversity of ground vegetation, reduced plant growth, and an unbalanced nutritional status due to eutrophication and acidification.

The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), the international standard-setting body for banking regulation, is in the process of finalising new prudential regulations (reducing the level of risks depositors are exposed to), which is supposed to be finished by the end of the year. It is considering several new requirements such as restrictions on how banks use internal models to estimate risks from real-estate loans as well as corporate and infrastructure lending. Banks like HSBC and Deutsche Bank, among others, have been lobbying fiercely against these new requirements saying they will amount to a massive increase in their capital requirements. This resolution is a statement of the European Parliament’s position on the issue, in response to Commission statement backing the banks. The resolution calls for the BCBS to revise its draft proposals to ensure the revision does not bring about a significant increase in overall capital requirements, and to ensure a ‘level playing field’ between EU and global banks. In other words, it calls on the Basel Committee to back away from imposing regulations that would protect the public and depositors.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "GUE/NGL", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Left-wing"}, {"id": 628, "date": "2016-11-23.json", "name": "Eric ANDRIEU", "mepid": "113892", "text": "in writing.- I voted in favor of this balanced report.It is essential that banks are an efficient part of our economy and not an element of risk.Banks must be well capitalized in order to support the real economy, reduce systemic risk and avoid a repeat of the huge bailouts seen during the crisis.The Basel Committee's on-going work is expected to promote a level playing field globally by reducing - rather than exacerbating - differences between jurisdictions and banking models and not unduly penalizing the EU banking model.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 629, "date": "2016-11-23.json", "name": "Laima Liucija ANDRIKIENĖ", "mepid": "28276", "text": "in writing. - I voted in favor of the resolution on the final adoption of the Basel III agreement, in which the European Parliament notes the work of the Basel Committee to finalize the Basel III framework to increase simplicity, comparability and convergence of risk-weighted capital rules to address excessive asset the problem of differences in risk assessment and apply the same rules to the same risk.

In 2011, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision published its Basel III framework, which sets out new global regulatory standards for banks' capital adequacy and liquidity and the accompanying implementation plan. Most importantly, banks need to increase their current share capital. They need to increase the current share capital ratio from 4 percent to 6 percent. The share capital must cover the bank's loss of income in a crisis situation. Another element of Basel III is the appropriate shaping of liquidity requirements. Financial institutions must have sufficient liquid assets to cover the so-called their net liquidity outflows. The motion for a resolution concerns the finalization of the Basel III agreement. The various provisions will be phased in by 2019. I supported the motion for a resolution because it reduces the likelihood of financial crises. At the same time, I would also like to emphasize that the problem can only be resolved once and for all if we return to the pre-1990s situation, ie the provisions of the Glass-Steagall Act, which

The sovereignty of financing our economy is at stake. Since 2008, the trend has been one of tightening requirements, which has forced banks to increase their equity or reduce their commitments (lend less, more expensive, or to less risky projects or companies). There is a lot of complex work to refine the calculation formula to better contain the risks. We therefore support this option, which favors the competitiveness of European banks vis-à-vis their competitors, particularly American ones.

The domination of the short term and yield at all costs has penetrated the financial market. Finance has thus been diverted from its primary purpose, namely to transform savers' deposits into long-term investments. When the financial bubble burst, some banks did not have the necessary liquidity to absorb their losses. Following this crisis, a broad reform program aimed at strengthening regulatory standards applicable to international banks, such as prudential requirements, was agreed by G20 leaders. The European Parliament reiterates today the importance of setting strong global standards and principles for the prudential regulation of banks in order to reduce the likelihood and severity of future crises.

an element of risk. They play a key role in financing the European economy and are likely to remain the main source of funding for households and businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises. A resilient and well-capitalized banking system is a prerequisite for maintaining financial stability and supporting economic growth. The audit currently being conducted by BCBS must encourage and promote balanced chances of success, a level playing field for all globally. It must reduce, not further emphasize, differences in jurisdictions and banking models and avoid unnecessarily penalizing the EU's banking model. The key is in an approach based on proper risk assessment, with the same rules that apply to the same risk.

However, the rules for their accounting become increasingly complex and opaque, as befits interest groups that always profit from the lack of transparency. Today, the citizen is instilled in the idea that asset risk assessment models are the responsibility of so-called systemic banks, unlike others that are subject to a standardized model. That is, we have, as proved by a study by Standard & amp; Poor's, assets with different weightings from bank to bank, therefore, a system in which solvency ratios and stress tests are completely manipulated by large banks, thus removing any credibility from the entire supervisory system.

The work of the Basel Committee represents an effort to prepare the ground for reducing the differences between legal environments and banking models. Although the recommendations issued by the committee are not binding, they represent the standards of the banking sector for the central banks of the member countries. I also agree with the rapporteur's view that it is not possible to penalize the EU's banking model and that it is necessary to maintain the same rules for the same level of risk when regulating it. The resolution we have adopted today is a contribution to the Basel Committee's debate on future legislation in the banking sector.

The rules created from Basel I to III are intended to impose minimum levels of equity. However, the rules for their accounting become increasingly complex and opaque, as befits interest groups that always profit from the lack of transparency. Today, citizens learn that asset risk assessment models are the responsibility of so-called systemic banks, unlike others that are subject to a standardized model. That is, we have, as proved by a study by Standard & amp; Poor's, assets with different weightings from bank to bank.

We must acknowledge that the security situation in Europe has deteriorated significantly. It has become more complex, more dangerous, and more difficult to predict.

The security of EU Member States is highly interlinked, but they respond to common threats and risks in an uncoordinated and inconsistent manner. Lack of coordination is one of the weaknesses of the Union's action, which is being successfully exploited by aggressors. Europe also lacks resilience to effectively counter hybrid threats. I agree with the rapporteur that, for these reasons, the CSDP needs to be thoroughly and fundamentally overhauled in order to enable the EU and its Member States to make a decisive contribution to the Union's security, international crisis management and demonstrate the EU's strategic autonomy. It is clear that no country can deal with the current security challenges on its own. It is therefore necessary to ensure that the CSDP is based on a strong principle of collective defense and effective funding and is implemented in coordination with international institutions in the field of security and defense, with full complementarity with NATO.

We are also in principle in favor of the new proposal to strengthen the opportunities for the EU to support partner countries in terms of capacity building in support of security and development (CBSD).

The original concept, ie the Western European Union, was to bring about the convergence of standards and possible cooperation between arms manufacturers. Especially after France withdrew from the NATO military component and moved its headquarters to Brussels, the project had a real contour. After de Gaulle's retirement, a significant coughing overseas was enough, or a raised eyebrow at NATO's top chief, and new weapons were purchased from the United States, especially in the renewal of the fleet and other modern systems. Nevertheless, from time to time, there is an effort to refresh the original concept and support the EU military-industrial complex. Perhaps the only area where this has succeeded and where the EU is competing successfully is the Airbus consortium, but this is mainly for civilian use. There are only two successful multilateral implementations left, both in aeronautics, Eurofighter Typhoon and Gripen.

Although the security of the Member States of the Union is interconnected, they respond to common threats in an uncoordinated way and on their own, which makes it impossible to take a common approach to crisis management, which also weakens the position of the Union itself. A more coherent, and therefore more effective, European foreign and security policy could be beneficial in resolving the conflict in Syria and Iraq. However, this will not be possible without a thorough review of the Common Security and Defense Policy (CSDP), which should consist of several steps. Permanent cooperation structures need to be set up to enable the Union to intervene in various crises and at any stage of the conflict, based on the principle of strong collective defense and effective financing.

Therefore, as a first step towards common defense, EU countries should now focus primarily on maintaining a level of defense spending of 2% of GDP, but also on improving cooperation between national armed forces. The European Union should be able to respond quickly and effectively to current security threats. Whether this will be due to the cooperation of states or thanks to joint troops is not so relevant at the moment.", "language": "en", "original_language": "cs", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 986, "date": "2016-11-23.json", "name": "Jana ŽITŇANSKÁ", "mepid": "124901", "text": "in writing - I did not support the report on the implementation of the common security and defense policy.

One of the aims of the Kremlin's propaganda is to portray some European states as \"traditionally under Russia's sphere of influence,\" undermining their sovereignty and European identity. Therefore, in order to counter the Kremlin's discourse, there is a need to raise awareness of the crimes committed by the communist regime, to carry out public information campaigns and to use education systems, and to support research and document research in EU Member States. In addition, it is essential for the EU to act in a united and coordinated manner in the means and instruments to combat propaganda. This is especially important for the Baltic countries, which are becoming Russia's information war front. In Lithuania, the Kremlin applies a complex strategy of propaganda and disinformation, seeks to assert that traditional Lithuanian values ​​and the rest of Western European values ​​are different, and to show that Lithuania is defenseless and therefore not worth defending.

Unfortunately, the report identifies two threats regarding propaganda: a non-state actor, the terrorist group known as Daesh or ISIS, and a state actor, Russia. I believe the propaganda targeting EU and its citizens is an undeniable fact, the need to react by strategic communication is apparent, but mixing the state and non-state actors is not the correct approach.   However, the fact that the EU states are subject to a very strong propaganda, while the Russian one is more present in the Central and Eastern Europe, made me express my support to the report. I am persuaded, however, that further attention should be given to both Russian and Daesh actions, but in a separate way. The separation is necessary not only because of the political gap but also because of the different strategic communication targets.

various levels, including the EU institutions, the Member States, the various NATO and UN bodies, non-governmental organizations and civil society organizations.However, an effective and responsible approach to communication must also include raising awareness, educating EU citizens and developing online, media and information literacy in the EU and its neighborhood.", "language": "en",

Doubts remain as to its harmfulness to humans and the environment, despite several reassuring studies. This contamination from seepage depends, in part, on the type of soil and its porosity and is hampered by the rapid photodegradation of this substance. However, the UK Environment Agency has found frequent cases of bentazon contamination of groundwater and even surface water. In addition, doubts remain as to the dangerousness of bentazon for human health, although, according to the conclusions of several scientific studies emanating in particular from the World Health Organization, this would be conditioned by the absorption of very strong doses.

One of the characteristics of this substance is also a very high potential to penetrate into groundwater. Bentazone has been discovered in the groundwater of several countries, although more detailed information of this nature is missing in the Commission's proposal. In addition, the consumer risk assessment has not yet been completed. This is because the residue definition for plant risk assessment and enforcement in livestock was considered preliminary due to lack of data. The Commission is thus seeking to approve the placing on the market of bentazone before it has a decision confirming its safety.

The use of this substance in the EU is allowed until the end of June 2017. However, the European Commission now proposes, based on an assessment by the European Food Safety Authority, to extend the use of bentazone until 31 January 2032, the longest possible period. I believe that the European Food Safety Authority should consult experts on the toxicological effects of bentazone on mammals and its impact on the environment.

protection product. The current permit expires on 30 June 2017 and the European Commission has proposed an extension (until 2032). However, it has been suspected that, as a result of intensive use, it is detectable in groundwater and is likely to have a detrimental effect on human reproduction. I agree with the motion that these agents should only be used responsibly and in moderation, and I think it is important that, with proper scientific evidence, it is only possible to decide on the extension of such agents, with food safety in mind. If these agents are suspected, we should not use them. The motion will not immediately terminate the authorization of bentazone, but bearing in mind the precautionary principle, I am convinced that it should not be extended immediately.

It is a serious crime and it is widespread. Behind every victim, there is a heart-breaking story of a broken life. Too many women and girls today live in fear and despair, bleeding in their minds and bodies, hurt and crushed by guilt and shame. I have visited shelters from Sweden to Greece, witnessing amazing examples of civil society taking women and girls by the hand to help them recover their dignity and rebuild their life. However, women at home continue to be beaten, and often children witness terrible scenes. In public there are cases where even going to a swimming pool or to a music festival poses a danger of harassment or rape, and persecution in the social media has become a global phenomenon affecting an entire generation. Let us be clear: this is often about men attacking women out of jealousy or frustration, under the influence of alcohol or for revenge. Often they just cannot accept a woman being strong, independent and modern, making her own choices and then daring to live them. Let us talk about Lucia, an Italian woman disfigured by acid. She had the courage to denounce her former partner. She said: ‘It is not your fault to have chosen the wrong man. It is his fault to have hit you.’ The time has come to say no to sexism and to build a culture of respect for women and girls – and religion and culture can never be excuses for the abuse of women. On the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, with our joint resolution, let us give a voice to women who are victims of violence. Let us help them to break the vicious circle of silence and loneliness. Together we call on the Member States to implement the Anti-Trafficking Directive, the European Protection Order and the Directive on Protection of Victims, and to ratify the Istanbul Convention. We also ask them to speed up the accession of the EU to the Convention, to strengthen our tools, to combat and prevent violence against women and to protect victims.

This violence is indicative of the inequalities and discrimination suffered by women compared to men. Moreover, women in Europe are not protected in the same way from violence depending on the country in which they live. The fight against violence against women is a daily struggle, which calls for a profound change in mentalities, nourished by prejudices and sexist stereotypes. This is not a problem that only affects women. It involves all of our societies and requires a strong political response. The accession of the European Union to the Istanbul Convention will bring a first stone to the building to better fight against violence against women in Europe and provide legal tools to protect them. Through our oral questions, we ask the Commission and the Council for precise answers on the state of play of the negotiations. We therefore urge the 14 States of the Union which have not yet done so to ratify the Istanbul Convention. Beyond that, the Socialists and Democrats group defends the adoption of a directive on the fight against violence against women. I am also convinced that the rule of law mechanism will help to strengthen the implementation of the Istanbul Convention in member states. I am delighted that tomorrow we are proposing a joint resolution to make our voice heard in this fight and say no to violence against all women and girls.

We are almost unanimously asking the European Union and individual Member States to ratify it, and for the first time we are sending a clear and strong political message. We are – and we will always be – on the side of victims of gender—based violence and violence against women. I will never get tired of repeating that violence against women is a violation of women’s human rights and an extreme form of discrimination embedded in gender inequalities and contributing to reinforcing them. For those who still wonder why we are once again debating this, my answer is very simple. We are not gender ideologists, we are human rights defenders. It is true that the accession process was initiated by the Commission, all EU Member States have already signed it and 14 Member States have ratified it. But my experience has never proved me wrong: never take rights for granted. We should be vocal until we have a generation of Europeans completely aware that gender—based violence is not tolerable and there is never a justification for it. On behalf of my Group, I would like to express our full support for the Commission and for making sure that the Council reacts. Until the Istanbul Convention is ratified by the European Union, we will not have an instrument in Europe to set legally binding standards to specifically prevent violence against women and girls, protect victims and punish perpetrators. I look forward to cooperating with the Commission and the coming Council Presidencies to make the Istanbul Convention an EU instrument against violence against women.  My last words go to the Orange Campaign on Friday. We should orange the world and join the UN women’s initiative, keeping in mind that we have to fight inequalities and violence every single day.

The horrible law proposed by the Turkish Government to clear a rapist of all his charges if he marries the victim has been withdrawn by the AKP. The Turkish Government has not withdrawn this proposal because they think it is wrong, but because of thousands of women fighting against this proposal in the streets of Istanbul. It is so sad, but also so obvious, that we will have to fight for our freedom over and over again.  Now one could argue, well, this is far away, and this is not happening in the European Union. But it is. It is happening in the European Union as well. Every third woman in the European Union experiences violence in her life. This might seem like an abstract number, but out of 280 women in this Chamber, approximately 90 would have been those who experienced violence in their lives. This is not ‘the others’. This is us. It is women who are sitting with us in this Chamber, voting, representing their constituents – maybe women that you have a coffee with from time to time. They have the same fate as millions of women in the European Union, and it is not enough to talk about it once a year.  We need to do something, especially in times when the other side is gearing up, where there are more and more people who are trying to go back to the good old times, to the 1950s, when a husband beating up his wife was actually not really a reason to bother about and, yes, we will have to fight for our freedom over and over again: against a Polish Government that wants to restrict women’s rights, against the Turkish government that wants to do that, and against a backlash that we are facing in the European Union. We will have to fight against this, but this fight will be a thousand times stronger if we have a good legal foundation, and the Istanbul Convention is one of the tools to do that.

In no country has enough been done to combat violence against women and girls. The threat of violence reduces our living spaces - it is not about anything less important than that. The Istanbul Convention, or the Council of Europe Convention on Violence against Women, is an important tool for all of us who fight violence against women, not least because it places violence against women in a context of power and structures. The Convention also requires all countries to take a holistic approach to stopping gender-based violence through public funding of women's shelters, through preventive measures, through requirements for consent legislation. However, we can also state that we live in a culture that accepts men's violence against women. Otherwise it would have been stopped. Public figures who have abused the bodies of women and girls continue to be held on their backs. Just look at the newly elected president Donald Trump, the former head of the IMF and the French presidential candidate Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the film director Roman Polanski. In addition, several countries still allow a prostitution industry where women and girls can be bought by men. In such a culture, it becomes difficult to create justice and deliver convictions for rape cases, for example. It is not only in Sweden that convictions in rape cases shine with their absence. That is the truth throughout Europe. Here in Europe, there is a lack of political will. Earlier today, we voted on a report calling for refurbishment. Is it more important to rattle with weapons than to defend women's bodies and rights? It does not hold! The struggle for equality, for women's bodies, against macho culture, must be allowed to take the central place it should have in this House. We demand that the Istanbul Convention be ratified by the EU, by the Member States. At the same time, we also want an EU strategy and funding to combat violence against women.

These are crimes that have no place in the EU Member States, and the Council has encouraged them to sign and ratify the Istanbul Convention. As you know, all the Member States have already signed and, so far, 14 of them have ratified the convention. We are aware of Parliament’s efforts, such as last year’s initiative by the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality in launching a working group on violence against women, and all the many hearings and inter-parliamentary committee meetings you have organised to raise awareness. We very much welcome these initiatives and I would like to inform you that the Presidency – specifically the working party Chair – will be addressing the hearing on the EU accession to the Istanbul Convention co-organised next week – 29 November 2016 – by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs and the Women’s Rights Committee. This will be an excellent opportunity for exchanges with the co-rapporteurs and representatives of the Council of Europe, the United Nations and the Commission. Allow me to turn now to the state of play as regards our work in the Council, and on the EU’s proposed accession to the Istanbul Convention. This matter has been one of our priorities since the very start of our Presidency last July. It has been dealt with by the Council’s working party responsible for fundamental rights, which last convened on 10 November 2016. In a first phase, Member States have agreed to concentrate on the Council decision authorising the signature, on behalf of the EU, of the Istanbul Convention. There is very broad support among Member States for this accession. However, there are still diverging views regarding the scope of the EU’s accession. These involve complex legal matters on which Member States are seeking more clarity. Nevertheless, we are confident that we will be able to make substantial progress with the proposal for a Council decision on the signing of the Convention. Another meeting is scheduled next week to continue the negotiations. As regards the external dimension of the Istanbul Convention, the Presidency is organising a meeting in December with the Council’s working party responsible for human rights. Throughout these last months of our Presidency, we have been in regular contact with the co-rapporteurs on this subject, Ms Bildt and Ms Revault D’Allonnes Bonnefoy, and this close collaboration with Parliament will be encouraged in the future. For our part, and I think this is most important, we still aim to submit the proposal for the Council decision on the signing of the Convention to the Council in December. Lastly Madam President, I need to apologise for not being able to be here with you until the end of your debate. I will have to leave after the presentation by Commissioner Jourová but, be sure, our colleagues here, and we as a Presidency, will pay attention to it during our last days and weeks in office, and we are still working towards getting an agreement in December.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 1547, "date": "2016-11-23.json", "name": "Helga STEVENS", "mepid": "125105", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, let me thank you all, first and foremost, for keeping violence against women high on the European Parliament’s agenda. It is a privilege to be here just a few days before – this has already been mentioned several times – the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women on 25 November, and to give you an overview from the perspective of the Commission, together with the Council Presidency, on how we see the progress towards an EU accession to the Istanbul Convention.  Together with you and Member States’ Ministers at this year’s United Nations Conference on the Status of Women, where we as ‘Team Europe’ successfully represented the EU in delivering on our messages, we agree that the importance of the Istanbul Convention and the need to address the difficult issue of gender—based violence in a coordinated and focused way is desirable. This Conference took place in March shortly after the Commission adopted proposals for the signing and conclusion of the accession to the Convention. Since then, we have put all our efforts behind constructive discussions with the Council to reach political agreement. The Council Presidencies involved have been very successful and useful in facilitating this. We have held in-depth discussions on all legal aspects of the accession, in particular the extent of accession. We discussed the division of roles between the Member States and the Union in the implementation of the Convention. As you know, the Commission is of the view that EU accession should generate the added value we are seeking to make a difference on the ground. We want to strengthen and complement the existing framework in a wide range of policy areas. The competences and roles of the EU and Member States are closely intertwined. That is why the EU aims to accede to this Convention in parallel to national ratifications. I seriously hope that we can reach an agreement on the terms of the signing decision within the coming month. We heard from the Presidency that it should be in December. This would be the best news. Signing this decision would demonstrate the common political will of the Union to be bound by the Convention. We have emphasised since the beginning that only the joint participation of both the EU and the Member States makes sense, legally and politically. I am constantly encouraging the Member States to ratify alongside the EU, and the Member States can rely on available European Programmes and funds to help in this process. I would like to thank the Parliament again for its support and I look forward to its interim report, which will be adopted next year. We will continue to monitor and support the implementation of the existing legal instruments to combat violence against women. That includes the Victims’ Rights Directive and EU legislation on cross-border recognition of protection orders.  I have promised to you several times that we want to devote the year 2017 to strengthening combating violence against women, so I am particularly glad to announce to you that, on 25 November, as part of our year of focused actions to combat violence against women, I will launch the promised EU—wide campaign. My objective is to provide a framework for a coordinated approach and join forces together with you, Member States, the European Institute for Gender Equality, UN Women and other International Organisations, civil society organisations, academia, businesses, trade unions, media and, within the Member States, also with law enforcement authorities, because I said we want to make a change on the ground. This means that the women will be protected not only by preventive measures, but also – let us face it – by a necessary reaction from the side of criminal justice.  During the year of focused actions to combat violence against women, many activities are planned. It is a cross-cutting effort and work within the Commission, involving many of my colleague Commissioners and their services. Apart from communication, best practices and experience sharing, it also includes funding. As for the Commission’s work on this campaign, you very often call for more efforts in mainstreaming gender topics and gender policy, so I can confirm today that several of my colleague Commissioners will take very concrete actions next year from their perspective, be it eliminating violence in transport, the campaign against alcoholism – which is very often one of the enabling situations in domestic violence – or the effort to get this topic more to documentary film creation. This is a very wide range of different plans and actions and I can only say that I have received a very good reaction from my colleague Commissioners. With regard to the funding I indicated, the Commission dedicated EUR 4 million from the Rights, Equality and Citizenship Programme in 2016 to support Member States in developing and implementing national practical and targeted information, awareness-raising and educational activities aimed at preventing and combating violence against women. Why do we rely on Member States for this? Simply because violence against women has many different forms in Member States. That is why we speak about targeting actions and the Commission provides the funding for this, as well as the unifying logo, slogans, design and many other things. That is just for you to understand how the campaign will work. Activities will cover all forms of violence against women or focus on specific forms or issues, as relevant. In addition to the EUR 4 million, EUR 6 million will be provided in 2017 for transnational grassroots projects to prevent the problem and protect and support victims, under the Daphne strand of the Rights, Equality and Citizenship Programme. This money will go to the organisations – the NGOs – which work on the ground and which can also contribute in a very significant way to the success of this campaign. Just to add regarding the money, in 2016 alone the EU spent EUR 24.5 million to support 62 gender-based violence combating humanitarian projects. I would like to thank the Parliament once again for its support of our endeavours in fighting violence against women. I remain committed to continue informing you in a timely manner on all developments in this area, and of course to invite you to join and participate in our coming campaign.

That is my Member State, the population of my country, represented in that number. While cases are reported and action is taken, there are still far too many instances where women are trapped, suffering in silence and with no conceivable way out. Violence against women does not just apply to physical abuse. It also covers the emotional manipulation and psychological trauma thousands of women are subjected to just because they are women. Violence against women is a form of gender-based violence. It is gross, inexcusable and a violation of human rights.  Given the varying forms violence against women can take, as well as the numerous avenues through which such violence can be executed, no single intervention will result in its elimination. A combination of infrastructural, legal, cultural, educational and social actions, in addition to the sharing of best practices between Member States, is essential to raise awareness and stimulate the action needed, so I welcome the Commissioner’s reassurances on all of those areas.

It has now been more than five years since the approval of the Istanbul Convention and I think we have to ask ourselves a question: why not all EU states have ratified it yet and others have not even signed? The states that have not ratified it certainly have not, because they are not against violence against women. So, let us pause to understand the real reasons for these non-ratifications. The reason why some States oppose ratification is to be found in some contents of the convention itself, which go beyond the subject of the fight against gender-based violence, such as the introduction, for the first time in an international treaty, of the social definition of \"gender\", which becomes binding for the States that ratified the convention. And it is therefore understandable that states in which the gender debate is more complicated are reluctant to such ratification. If at the time this forcing had not been made, which has nothing to do with the urgency of the issue of violence against women, today, probably, we would not find ourselves facing such a paradoxical situation. Let us ask ourselves, rather, if in the States where it has been ratified and for which it has been legislated on the matter, there have been clear positive statistical results in terms of decreasing gender violence. Shouldn't we focus attention on the fact that Member States actually legislate and take measures to prevent and combat the phenomenon of violence against women? In fact, many states have focused on repression measures and still too little on prevention ones.

It took years before the Rotherham child abuse case was brought to light in the UK, out of fear of being labelled racist. In the UK we still have a parallel society of Sharia courts operating right under our noses. In fact all over Europe we see the same pattern. Those claiming to champion women’s rights are in denial and attempt to sweep this problem under the carpet. No amount of EU law or funds will make a difference until this is addressed. The truth is that by letting millions of young migrant men with Muslim backgrounds into our countries, we have submitted our women to these attacks. It is a form of terrorism. No more cover-ups, no more mitigating circumstances, no more political correctness.

In this regard, I support the accession of the European Union to the Convention and call for its ratification by the Member States. A few aspects to consider, however. In the first place, in order to achieve the desired results, it is important that the provisions of the Convention are consistent with the various national legal systems. This implies both the adaptation of the relevant regulations at national level and the provision of sufficient financial and human resources. Next, I would like to emphasize the key role that close cooperation with civil society organizations has in achieving a coordinated approach to combating violence against women and raising awareness. The national campaign we conducted with them in Bulgaria on violence against women \"Let's open our eyes and break the silence\" showed that our cooperation can be a powerful catalyst for change. Finally, it is important to continue at European level our efforts to create a common system for collecting data on violence against women, because violence against women is not just a problem for women.

A third of European women have suffered physical or sexual violence at least once in their life, and in most cases it is not reported out of fear or shame. The victims, in many cases, are helpless, and their attackers enjoy impunity. Faced with a European panorama where women are not equally protected in all States, it is urgent to adopt a common legislative framework that, although it is not the immediate solution, it will be a great advance to protect the victims. To end the violence we must take not only legal measures but also educational, cultural and social ones. That is why we have submitted this oral question to the Commission.

These attacks on the dignity of women are appalling. The degradation of the condition of women in our various countries is unbearable, because the rights of women are declining. Islamist fundamentalism takes root, attacks women head-on and seeks to lock them into fabric cages. The attacks on their physical integrity remain at a dramatically high level. In France alone, a woman is raped every 40 minutes. The free trade treaties that the European Commission negotiates or the laws that it imposes on the Member States, such as the El Khomri law in France, make employees more precarious and make women their first victims. You have all subscribed to these texts of social regression. The National Front, the first feminist party in France, for its part rejects these monstrous attacks on women's rights, and we will fight throughout this term and during the presidential campaign that is coming, alongside Marine Le Pen so that the condition of women is finally improving.

Accession would enable better implementation of existing laws, appropriate rights of intervention against perpetrators, it would improve prevention and victim work, raise awareness for the creation of emergency shelters and so on. This guideline, which has been discussed many times today, is therefore very necessary. The Commission is to be thanked for taking the initiative and it has Parliament's support. A few days before November 25th, this is an important sign. The Council should recognize that there is no point in putting such an essential subject on the back burner.

Commissioner, I ask: why is the Commission promoting an instrument that takes the Member States' sovereign competences in this matter? The right of each Member State to consider at national level whether or not to waive this competence should be respected. The Convention forces 14 Member States that have not yet ratified it to agree, for example, on the binding introduction of the concept of 'gender' as a social construct and the promotion of gender ideology; second point: and interfering in education, including restricting parents' rights. Accession to the Convention would undermine the judicial system of the Member States without sufficiently addressing the issue of violence itself.

It is very clear that the Istanbul Convention must finally take effect, must be introduced and implemented across Europe.

Climate policy for women - it's about the social climate in which women move. The social climate in the USA is poisoned, for example, by the sexist Trump. In Europe it is the right, the very right and the very, very right that poison the climate against women. They create a social climate, a social climate that makes violence against women possible.

I am really unhappy to have to repeat that the situation is not getting better; the situation is becoming worse in Europe and that is why we decided to earmark quite a lot of money to the campaign. That is why we keep exerting pressure on the Member States to ratify the Istanbul Convention. That is why we are in such intensive discussions with the Council to have the accession of the European Union to the Istanbul Convention adopted.  These are the concrete measures and concrete steps. I just want to tell you and confirm that what was quoted here by Ms Arena – from Simone de Beauvoir – was right: we are now in a period of where the atmosphere in society as such is worsening. I am working also in the field of anti-extremism and anti-radicalisation of society. I am in contact with the main IT providers. We are trying to combat hate speech online with all possible efficient tools, and this is the sphere where a lot of violence against women starts.  And it is not only against women. It is against all the other vulnerable groups in our societies. We should bear in mind that this is a complex issue and the worsening of the atmosphere in our society is not any excuse for saying, ‘okay, so this is also the case with violence against women’. We must combat and mobilise forces against this on all fronts. I know that you expect answers from me and I am going to raise several questions here. I will not be long as I know that we are limited by time.  You asked: is the political will missing? I think we have to monitor what will be done at Member State level, whether they will ratify the Convention, but I can only share with you my frustration that I was in discussions with some colleagues from Member States, some of the Ministers and people responsible for equality and gender policy, and they told me it is more and more difficult to sell. It is more and more unpopular in some of our Member States. Why is that so? We have to support this policy from a European level and to support these colleagues who work in the Member States. Another question which was flying through the air here: is violence against women a taboo in society? Is it really culturally rooted in some parts of our society where we hear that violence is something normal, it is normality? Is there really such a strong silent acceptance of this phenomenon in our society?  If so, then I am afraid that we cannot change it just by legislation. We need to do much more on the preventive side. We need to do much more campaigning, awareness-raising. We have to work with the young generation. So it is a very complex issue, and I am afraid that if something is culturally-rooted, it will take more time to change it and we have to keep on trying. We will open the data on this which we now have from the Eurobarometer. For 94% of our citizens, violence against women is intolerable. It is a very surprisingly high number, but at the same time, one quarter of people say ‘but the victims are very often also guilty’. We will see these surprising findings from this new survey, which will show us that we have to work more vis-à-vis society itself, and legislation will not do this by magic.  And believe me, I speak to politicians, I speak to organisations, NGOs, to people who are somehow engaged, and all of them say that this is very serious, this is getting worse, we have to combat this. And then when I speak to – and forgive me for this expression – ‘normal people’, they say to me: ‘What do you want? Nothing is happening, it cannot be that bad’. And this applies to everything we do on gender. Once that label of ‘gender’ is put on it, it does not take off. People say: ‘What do you want? Sometimes when I promote gender policy and the policy of equality I work with economic figures. I have never done this for this problem of violence. I will do it now. The estimation of the costs for Europe is more than EUR 200 million a year. This is the cost of violence against women. And why am I quite reticent to use this argument? Because here, we have to speak about the lives of women and children. This is not about money, but it is good to understand that it also has this economic aspect. The last difficult question is: can we change the behaviour of the victims themselves? Everybody – and the Eurobarometer survey showed it – knows somebody who is a victim. So why do we have so few of them – 15-20% of victims – who report it and use the helping hand of society, use the social services, use the power of law enforcement authorities? Why is this so? We need to change this and we need to encourage them.  We have legislation for this. The Victims Directive clearly asks and demands that the law enforcement authorities take a special approach to victims of violence, of domestic violence, to children and women who are the victims of this. So we need to join forces and we need to use all possible instruments, not only legislation, to change the situation.  I am sure the Istanbul Convention should be ratified by all Member States because there are practical measures. There are also measures which can help children who are victims, as well as women. European Union accession is equally important. It is not true that we are decreasing the competences of Member States by this accession. We are enlarging the coherence of this policy within Europe. We can get better data collection and monitoring of the situation. It is also equally important and it will achieve slightly different goals from those which must be achieved through ratification by the Member States.  One last comment. It must be absolutely clear to European society, to European people, and to the newcomers, the people who come in the refugee influx – and this is more a message for this side of the Chamber – that violence against women is intolerable in Europe, for all, and we must not relativise it. This must be absolutely clear, and this must not only be the subject for awareness-raising in European citizens, but also in all integration plans and activities vis-à-vis the people who are coming to Europe.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 1607, "date": "2016-11-23.json", "name": "David Maria SASSOLI", "mepid": "96864", "text": "The discussion is closed.I have received two motions for resolutions in accordance with Rule 128 (5) of the Rules of Procedure.The vote will take place tomorrow.Written declarations (Rule 162)", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 1608, "date": "2016-11-23.json", "name": "Rosa ESTARÀS FERRAGUT", "mepid": "96811", "text": "written.- The Istanbul Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence is the first instrument in Europe that establishes legally binding and specific standards for the prevention of gender-based violence and the protection of victims.and the punishment of the aggressor.The Convention covers a wide range of measures, including obligations ranging from awareness raising and data collection to legal measures on criminalizing different forms of violence.Although all the Member States of the European Union have signed the Convention, only fourteen of them have ratified it.From the European Parliament we consider it essential to support the Union's adherence to the Istanbul Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 1609, "date": "2016-11-23.json", "name": "Lidia Joanna GERINGER DE OEDENBERG", "mepid": "28377", "text": "in writing. - Women living in the EU are unfortunately still frequently victims of violence.

I will not go into what is happening in Jordan again, but the economic and social consequences of what is happening around this country are obviously considerable. Tourism has dropped sharply, exports are slowing down because Jordan's natural trade opportunities, Syria and Iraq, are totally devastated, growth is sluggish, unemployment has exploded. So we have a country that is both politically stable, but in great difficulty economically and socially. Despite this, Jordan faces another challenge, a colossal and considerable challenge, that of welcoming hundreds of thousands of refugees from these countries at war, fleeing persecution and misery. I recall that in Jordan, the refugees are less in camps than in the cities, where the Jordanian authorities try to integrate them, to allow them to work, and all this with a lot of dignity. This should appeal to those of us who know a little about the situation in this country, as Europeans also facing this refugee crisis, but with answers that are sometimes slow to come and in any case a generosity that we do not give. not really proof. Thus, faced with this exceptional situation, the European institutions have obviously decided to provide aid, relief to Jordan via what is called \"macro-financial assistance\" (AMF). Of course, there are other ways to help this country, it is not the only one. Moreover, the Commission is working on making rules of origin more flexible for Jordanian products and we may mention the negotiation a trade agreement that is both asymmetric and progressive. But in any case, within the INTA committee, we discussed this macro-financial assistance and we reached an initial agreement. There were technical elements since it was necessary to accept the modifications introduced by the Council on the Commission text - that did not take us much time - but obviously, we mainly talked about the amount. There was unanimity within the INTA committee, right and left alike, to try to propose an amount much higher than that suggested by the Commission, which was only 200 million euros. There was an interesting debate. We felt that the Jordanians' financial needs were great and that Europe had ample means to help them. There was a debate, a discussion. I would also like to thank Bernd Lange, chairman of the INTA committee, who worked hard to find a compromise. We finally reached a compromise which I consider acceptable, since there would be a first tranche of 200 million euros which would be disbursed immediately but with the promise, or in any case the commitment of the Commission, to make even over the next year. This is what this report proposes. Personally, however, I would like to reiterate two requests that I have included in the explanatory memorandum. First, I think that the Commission must show intelligence and flexibility in the terms of what is called \"the memorandum of understanding\", that is to say that it negotiates with the authorities. Jordanian and not obsessed with structural reforms whose pace would be too hasty. But we must not forget that the AMF is only a loan; these are not gifts. At some point, like what we did when we had the debate on Tunisia with Ms. de Sarnez who was the rapporteur, we will obviously have to wonder about the renegotiation of Jordanian debt, which may be very important in the future.There you have it, dear colleagues, Commissioner, Mr President, I would obviously like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs who, on this subject, have been very active and determined to ensure that the European Parliament speaks with one voice on a subject which isimportant, since it is about the future of the countries of our immediate neighborhood.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 1616, "date": "2016-11-23.json", "name": "Emmanuel MAUREL", "mepid": "24505", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission. – Mr President, let me first thank the rapporteur, Mr Emmanuel Maurel, and the Committee on International Trade (INTA) for their valuable work on this report. I also thank the Committee on Foreign Affairs (AFET) and the Committee on Budgets (BUDG) for their support.  As you know, Jordan is among those partner countries facing enormous political and economic challenges due to the regional conflict and the influx of more than one million Syrian refugees. The intensification of the conflicts in Syria and Iraq led to a deterioration of the macroeconomic situation in Jordan in 2015, with trade, the tourism sector and the gas supply being particularly affected. It is in this broader context of regional conflict and with every intention of supporting Jordan and its people during this difficult time that the Commission submitted its proposal for the macro—financial assistance operation. The international community has continued to fully support Jordan in this difficult situation and pledged about EUR 10 billion at the so-called London Conference in February 2016 for countries most affected by the Syrian refugee crisis. At this conference the EU pledged EUR 2.4 billion including a EUR 200 million macro—financial assistance loan. The EU—Jordan partnership priorities approved recently by the Council also include the prospect of this macro-financial assistance. In view of these international commitments, it is crucial that Parliament and the Council agree on the proposed macro—financial assistance of EUR 200 million to Jordan so that this support can be effectively and swiftly delivered.  The new macro—financial assistance operation will of course be subject to the fulfilment of a number of economic reforms. Jordan must satisfactorily implement the programme of the International Monetary Fund as well as the policy measures to be agreed between the EU and Jordan in a memorandum of understanding.  Once agreement on the proposed loan is reached, we will work to agree quickly the policy measures with our Jordanian partners. It is likely that these would cover measures in the areas of public finance management, fiscal reform, the societal safety net and access for Syrian refugees to the labour market, measures that would help Jordan withstand the economic pressure it is currently facing while securing a stable future for its people.  I am pleased that Parliament and the Council were able to agree on the final text in trilogue on 27 October 2016, with two amendments that the Commission can support. In accordance with the joint statement agreed by the three institutions the Commission will, in 2017, if appropriate, submit a new proposal for macro-financial assistance, provided that the usual preconditions for this type of assistance are fulfilled and on the basis of an updated assessment by the Commission of Jordan’s external financing needs. I am pleased to underline that two weeks ago the Council confirmed already its approval of the Commission proposal subject to the approval of this Parliament.  I hope, therefore, that you will choose to vote positively on the proposal and the accompanying compromise. We need to move ahead quickly to achieve a positive impact in support of Jordan and the Jordanian people. I hope we will have your full support going forward.

The priority of this strategy is to create an alternative to radicalization to overcome economic uncertainty and exclusion but, above all, to move towards a consolidated peace. Jordan applied for a loan from the European Union because development and growth are an absolute priority for Jordan. I want to remind you that Jordan - as has already been done, however - beyond the serious economic and financial difficulties, has opened its arms to a huge number of Syrian refugees: 1 400 000, representing 20% ​​of the Jordanian population. . It is as if the entire population of Belgium moved to France. It is also facing major difficulties also in terms of energy supply, a significant drop in revenue from the tourism sector, as well as a drop in foreign investment.

That is a significant number no matter how you measure it. Yet despite its economic difficulties, Jordan has not followed the example of other countries in Europe and around the world. It is not calling for walls to be built around its nation. On the contrary, it has shown a remarkable generosity to its neighbours and has kept its borders open. Because of that generosity, we should be as generous as possible to the country.  Jordan, also in difficult circumstances, continues to have an effective democratic system. It includes a multi-party parliamentary system. It respects the rule of law and human rights in Jordan are guaranteed, and of course, these are all preconditions for receiving MFA. Like the rapporteur, I am disappointed that we could not have been more generous, but also like the rapporteur, I am pleased that during the trilogue we managed to find a compromise that at least looks like we can promise more money to Jordan in 2017, if the need arises.

A few remarks were raised by many Members. For instance, many supported the sum but said it should be bigger.  Why did the Commission propose what it proposed and what was accepted in the trialogues? The proposed MFA amount takes into account several factors: firstly Jordan’s external financing needs at the time of the Commission’s decision, which was at the end of June; secondly, a marked reduction in IMF financing; thirdly, the burden—sharing efforts of other donors; and, fourthly, the Commission’s budget constraints. It also takes into consideration Jordan’s reserves in foreign currencies, which are at relatively healthy levels. We should not forget that this MFA operation is part of the larger and very substantial package of assistance to Jordan. That includes support in forms other than direct financial assistance. The Jordan Compact also includes about EUR 550 million in grants for the next three years, as well as a significant relaxation of the rules of origin for an extended duration. It should also be seen in combination with the first MFA programme, which brings the EU’s total amounts for balance of payments support alone to EUR 380 million.  Since the outbreak of the Syrian crisis in 2011, the EU has allocated almost EUR 1.13 billion euros to Jordan under various instruments. In any case, as is now underlined in the joint declaration to be adopted with the proposed decision, the Commission stands ready to continue providing support to Jordan should the situation call for it and acute needs remain.

What I mean by that, it is that, obviously, Europe is fully aware of the situation in these countries and is doing its best to help resolve this crisis, which is indeed a very important crisis.In any case, I thank you for this debate and I hope that tomorrow's vote will be as much as possible - and I think that this is what the Jordanians also expect from us.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 1642, "date": "2016-11-23.json", "name": "Ioan Mircea PAŞCU", "mepid": "33984", "text": "The debate is closed.The vote will take place on Thursday, 24 November 2016.", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 1643, "date": "2016-11-23.json", "name": "Ioan Mircea PAŞCU", "mepid": "33984", "text": "The next item is the debate on the report by Werner Langen on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs entitled 'Towards a definitive VAT system and combating VAT fraud' (2016/2033 (INI)) (A8-0307 /2016).", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 1644, "date": "2016-11-23.json", "name": "Werner LANGEN", "mepid": "1928", "text": "Rapporteur. - Mister President! I would like to present the ECON committee's draft report. We intensively discussed the European Commission's action program, which was presented on April 7, 2016. There were a total of 239 amendments. Two committees were invited to give advice. In the end we passed 81 points, which found a large majority with 47 votes in favor, 5 against and 5 abstentions. First of all, I would like to thank everyone who took part for the constructive cooperation and the good ideas. In the end, I believe, we found compromises that should be included in the Commission's deliberations on the specific legislative measures, but also in the Council's decision-making. The problem with tax issues is that the Council has to be unanimous, but we have to be heard beforehand. That is why we took the matter more seriously, even if we are ultimately not in the codecision procedure. It is undisputed that the member states can decide independently about their tax policy. However, the Sixth VAT Directive of 1993 provides a framework for excise and VAT. This Sixth VAT Directive has been revised and reformed several times. One big problem remains, that is the VAT gap and cross-border VAT fraud. The revenue is around EUR 1 trillion. The VAT gap confirmed by the Court of Auditors last year was EUR 160 billion including fraud, which was estimated at EUR 60 billion. This means that around 16% of the revenue is not collected or, as a result, cannot be collected due to fraudulent measures. We all agree that something needs to be done about it. But in the past all steps have been very hesitant. The Commission has therefore proposed that cooperation between the Member States, the exchange of data, improve the information and use necessary and possible technical units for cross-border billing. We have welcomed all of this and there was broad agreement in committee that the ideas that the Commission has proposed are generally positive. But we also discussed proposals going beyond this, namely - in particular - the project, supported by the Czech Republic and by a significant number of member states in the last Ecofin Council, to set up a pilot project on the reverse charge procedure in the Czech Republic. That was not without controversy and we reached a compromise on such a pilot project, but we also said: The duration of such a pilot project must not mean that the other measures are ultimately not taken. Because it is a question of fairness: the lost VAT revenues are significantly higher than the EU budget. You have to know that, and the VAT directive of 1993 says: A definitive system is sought. The final system is now proposed: that the destination principle should be introduced, that we should improve coordination, cooperation, that we should fight fraud. But there are also other measures: In addition to the pilot project I have mentioned, the Commission's proposal to provide a list of reduced goods and services not for the normal tax rate but for reduced tax rates is particularly important. Here we find that the list is very long today, that it is far too long, because it stems from the history of the creation of the VAT Directive and at that time the states insisted that their own interests should also be made the standard for future common legislation. The most glaring case is the Council's decision in the summer to put a zero tax rate on hygiene products for men and women in the UK to allow.That means we have an abundance of tasks.I would like to express my thanks.The report was adopted by a large majority, and I would ask colleagues to vote in favor of the report as a whole, despite all the split votes and all changes to the compromises.(The

We are very glad of your valuable guidance for the Commission and I am also glad that we share the same views on many of these issues.  VAT is a big source of revenue for the Member States and that is why, every once in a while, we have to check if everything in this field is fit for purpose because the world around us is changing. There are obviously some shortcomings which we have to address. First, Member States are faced with a massive revenue loss. The VAT gap has been estimated at around EUR 160 billion each year. Cross-border fraud alone accounts for EUR 50 billion each year. Second, complying with VAT rules for cross—border and digital activities is still very cumbersome. Compliance costs need to be reduced. Third, we must adapt the system to technological progress, tax goods and services where they are consumed, and give Member States more flexibility in setting VAT rates.  The Commission, via the Action Plan, sets out immediate and urgent actions to tackle the VAT gap and adapt the VAT system to the digital economy, e—commerce and the needs of small and medium—sized enterprises. It provides a clear orientation towards a robust, definitive VAT system for cross—border supplies and proposes options for modern and flexible rules on VAT rates. Overall this Action Plan sets out progressive steps towards a modernised and rebooted VAT system tailored to the single market. The proposed initiatives are numerous and ambitious, but I believe that they are realistic with their step—by—step approach. I am pleased that the report of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON) welcomes many of these.  The option we put forward for the definitive VAT system based on the – already agreed – destination principle consists in taxing intra—EU supplies in the Member States of destination via an extended one—stop shop. I warmly welcome Parliament’s support in the report adopted by ECON and its strong reference to the principle of the fractionated payments of VAT, which should remain a core element of the definitive VAT system. This would ensure a consistent treatment with domestic supplies and drastically reduce cross—border fraud. It has been estimated that this option would reduce cross—border VAT fraud by 80%. In real terms EUR 40 billion more could be collected per year. Other options, like the generalised reverse charge, which ECON’s report recommends, do not offer the same potential. In fact replacing VAT by a sort of sales tax could significantly increase fraud and administrative burdens for businesses. In our view, this is not the right approach. The time has also come to adapt the VAT rates legislation to the definitive VAT system based on the destination principle, which should allow for creative rates flexibility for Member States. I welcome Parliament’s willingness to provide us with a clear guidance on the options we have set out in the VAT Action Plan. We will give full consideration to this guidance when preparing our legislative proposals next year. By the end of this year the Commission will already address some of your recommendations in a series of ambitious legislative proposals.  As regards SMEs and e-commerce, the Commission’s upcoming proposal will include a threshold and other simplification initiatives targeted at small and micro-businesses, including an extended and enhanced one—stop shop mechanism. This proposal will also address current distortions putting EU businesses at a significance disadvantage compared to non-EU businesses, which can legally supply small consignments VAT-free into the EU annually and frequently omit paying the VAT they should.  As regards rates for e-publication, our upcoming proposal will give Member States the option of aligning the VAT treatment of e—publication, such as books, newspapers and periodicals, with that of printed publication. Taking into account last May’s ECOFIN Council conclusions on the Action Plan, the Commission will pursue its efforts to achieve consensus. We count on Parliament’s active support in this respect.  The Commission is equally determined to take strong actions to speed up the fight against VAT fraud in the EU, an idea dear to this House. As recommended and supported by you, the Commission is working to improve the administrative cooperation between the Member States, in particular by reinforcing Eurofisc, by more efficient and real time sharing of information, and by adding a common risk analysis, as well as by deepening cooperation with other European and national law enforcement authorities. I look looking forward to a good debate and good cooperation when trying to find good and concrete proposals next year.

Better, more efficient and fairer taxation is one of our key economic priorities and we are acting accordingly. Collecting taxes better applies not only in relation to large corporations or multinationals but also in any areas where we are losing money. As was said by the Commissioner and the rapporteur, we are losing tens of billions of euros every year in VAT fraud or VAT avoidance, and there is no excuse for us not to act. Unlike in the case of corporate taxation, where Europe cannot resolve all of the issues, these are our own domestic issues. So there is no excuse for not taking decisive steps – and improving the exchange of information among Member States is not a sufficient solution. That is why I believe the Commission proposal is a very good and efficient way to tackle the issue. I consider VAT to be an effective means of collecting tax, and I believe that any move towards a turnover or sales tax, rather than solving problems, would create more problems.

As in the case of tax fraud and tax evasion, the creation of a European VAT system free of corruption requires, above all, political will. Only together can the Member States take effective action against VAT fraud and only with the full agreement of the rules needed to break down unnecessary administrative barriers, thus making life easier for European businesses. Because the more complex a system is, the easier it is to circumvent it. It is therefore particularly to be welcomed that the Commission has committed itself to creating an effectively functioning single EU VAT area, all the more so as the current VAT system is not capable of preventing fraud. I would add that in the case of the single EU VAT area, pilot projects - which introduce different logics into the VAT system - are not necessarily sympathetic to us. The Commission estimates that the loss of VAT revenue is around EUR 170 billion a year, of which cross-border fraud alone is at least EUR 50 billion, although I fear that the real figures here are much higher, in some places they say EUR 1 trillion a year, which we lose. , or because of a malfunctioning VAT system. Yes, the Member States must therefore do their utmost to ensure that the exchange of information between them is effective, because without it and without coordination of tax policies between Member States, the fight against tax fraud and tax evasion will never be effective. I also agree that the Commission should closely monitor the functioning of national tax authorities, avoiding unfortunate cases such as the one in Hungary, where the National Tax and Customs Administration was reported by its own staff member, for which larger domestic and multinational companies protected by government circles assisted, but at least looked aside, in fraudulent tax amounts of more than € 3 billion a year.

Modernization and simplification of the whole system are needed. The current system does not sufficiently prevent fraud and its scale is enormous. As part of the measures against tax fraud, I consider it important and almost necessary to apply the mechanism of transferring the tax liability to the final taxpayer. The wider introduction of the reverse charge mechanism is the third pillar of tax administration reform in my country, the Czech Republic, and completely eliminates so-called carousel VAT fraud. Of course, the EP's draft report also addresses this mechanism and welcomes the pilot project in this area. I would like to call on the Commission to objectively assess its impact on the fight against VAT fraud, and I hope that the Commission's assessment will be based on the creation of a new VAT system in the EU. Not only because the mechanism of transfer of tax liability is tested in practice, unlike other, so far only theoretical concepts. Cooperation within the EU, but also with third countries, is also a prerequisite for a successful fight against fraud. In particular, the rapid and regular exchange of information in the field of the internal market is an effective tool.

Even in view of the numerous revelations linking VAT evasion to organized crime and serious crime, including terrorist financing, modernization of the current system is necessary.

The Commission’s VAT action plan makes important proposals to bridge this divide by introducing a single definitive VAT regime for the EU, and I welcome this. For two years now I have been raising the issue of the difficulties of the VAT mini one-stop-shop, or ‘VAT MOSS’ as it is known, ever since small businesses in South West England began contacting me to say that the changes would put them out of business. I have submitted questions to the Commission, written to UK ministers and Commissioner Ansip, and most recently submitted an amendment to this report, constantly calling for a VAT threshold of EUR 100 000 for start-ups and small businesses. So I am pleased that other MEPs have joined the call, and we can all welcome the Commission’s proposals for this VAT threshold in the final Parliamentary report. We must ensure that the VAT regime works for people, not against them, in our overall goal of tackling tax fraud. Lastly, I am delighted that we also have a reference to the social, environmental and gender dimension of VAT on certain products. We can and should use lower rates and zero rates to encourage renewable energy and the insulation of buildings, and to prevent discrimination against menstruating women.

Value-added tax is of great importance - and this is why this report too - because it is the most important source of income for the budgets of the Member States and also an important source of income for the European Union. In 2014, EUR 1 000 billion in VAT revenues were earned across the EU, 17.6 billion of which went into the European Union's budget. This makes up a total of 12.2% of the European budget. The tax shortfalls with such a large tax are also gigantic, and the rapporteur has already mentioned the following: the tax shortfall on VAT is higher than the budget of the European Union. The tax shortfall is reflected in the VAT gap, which has accumulated to EUR 170 billion annually, of which EUR 50 billion is due to cross-border fraud. Again, this is primarily carousel fraud, and behind carousel fraud is organized crime. European investigators recently struck a big blow against organized crime. They were able to uncover a carousel fraud system that caused damage of EUR 320 million. The fight against VAT fraud and VAT avoidance, i.e. also closing the VAT gap, must therefore have priority. For this reason, the VAT system needs to be made simpler, less fraudulent and more business friendly. For SMEs in particular, easier handling is necessary without additional administrative effort, and digital technologies will be important, digital processing platforms, so that this VAT can be collected better and more profitably in the future.

In the report, we can read that the current VAT system across the EU is excessively complicated, with a multitude of VAT rates and exemptions that put unnecessary burden on companies involved in cross-border trading. Moreover, this complexity opens up ample possibilities for VAT fraud and VAT avoidance within the single market. According to the Commission’s assessment, in 2014 alone the VAT gap between expected revenue and revenue actually collected was estimated at about EUR 160 billion.  These enormous losses suffered by all Member States call for swift and ambitious action to address VAT fraud. The focus should be on three areas: firstly, we should minimise the amount of goods that benefit from reduced VAT rates across the EU. Secondly, in the longer run, we should aim at gradually harmonising national VAT rates within the single market. Thirdly, the EU should take steps to address tax fraud coming from the so-called carousel schemes.  One way of solving this last problem is to ask banks to separate the VAT obligations from the gross price paid for a given transaction. A payment by a payer for any given invoice should then be immediately split by the bank into VAT tax due that would be transferred to the national tax authority, and the remaining amount would be transferred to the seller’s account.

I believe that, in the global strategy which is being put in place in terms of taxation, this action plan of the European Commission to combat fraud in the field of VAT is a welcome element. When we know the figures for this fraud, we see that there is indeed something wrong. This is a subject which obviously concerns the European Union directly since we are discussing a tax which also constitutes one of the rare own resources of its budget. However, out of 1 trillion, the 170 billion in annual fraud, including 50 billion in cross-border transactions, are not acceptable by our fellow citizens or by our States, any more than by the European Union. I think that the avenues proposed by the Commission go in the right direction as regards the delivery of a good between Member States which would become taxable in the State of arrival or the possibility for the purchaser to finalize his VAT with the establishment of mini-counters which, I think, will help improve the system. A debate is open on the advantage granted to the Czech Republic to test in a pilot project the mechanism of self-regulation. Let's be frank, we don't believe it, we don't think it will reduce fraud. We do not think that this is going in the right direction because VAT is a useful tax, an effective tax, and we just have to correct the things that do not allow us to collect this tax in good conditions.

This sounds like a good idea. However, the tax system of each country is different and the development of the country's economy is based on it. The leveling integration of all into a common VAT tax system will therefore create economic upheaval and loss of revenue. The real purpose of this proposal is to deprive states of the ability to manage their economies and meet their needs and aspirations and to delegate this right to the European Union.

The problem, however, is that it has increased VAT fraud and distorted competition between Member States. We therefore have to discuss many and broad solutions. The Commission has proposed the reverse charge, a system that will now tax goods and services in the country of destination. Since VAT is a consumer tax, it would make sense for it to be collected in the consumer's country and not in the entrepreneur's country. We have therefore also developed an alternative model in Austria. An alternative to the reverse charge system would be a Europe-wide IT platform, on which the seller must register in the customer's country. The monthly sales tax is automatically determined there, and the data is immediately forwarded to the authorities and shared across Europe.

I think it is really necessary to have a reform which will establish a single community space in the field of VAT. We know that VAT in Europe is something important. In 2014, it represented EUR 1 trillion in revenue, or around 7% of the Union's GDP and, above all, it is part of the Union's own resources which allow us to finance a whole series of projects. interesting for our fellow citizens, whether it is the youth guarantee, cultural programs, aid to the most disadvantaged or even aid to the licensees of multinationals.

I think this last point is important, because it will simplify the business operations of SMEs and, more importantly, it will underline the need for harmonization at EU level in tax policy. We have also appealed to the Member States since - as we all know - it is a national policy, but it is good to converge towards an equivalent rate of VAT in the various Member States if we want to find a solution to this problem.

Mr Langen has obviously done a valuable job and all the thanks to him are well deserved. Tax fraud is a cancer in our society. It is bad for entrepreneurs, it is bad for consumers and it is bad for our societies. That is why there are good reasons to reform the VAT system in order for it to be more watertight than it is at the moment.  I will make a couple of personal and rather political observations. These are not necessarily the political views of the Commission. As a former finance minister, I like VAT a lot. It is a money machine but it must be a fair money machine. If it functions well, you do not need to worry about revenues. They just come. It is basically a very simple tax and, if we manage to address the fraud opportunities, it is one of the best taxes we can have. But I also want to say that I do not see the VAT system as a perfect tool for taking care of social policy goals because it is much better to collect returns by VAT but then use direct subsidies to help those who need our joint help and common effort. So VAT is a good money machine but not ideal for addressing social issues. That is why direct subsidies are more efficient in this respect.  Also, the fewer reduced rates there are, the more efficient the VAT system is. I know that there are always good reasons to use reduced rates for good purposes but, at the same time, it is not good for the efficiency of the system as such. So that is why I, personally, am not a big fan of a large amount of reduced rates because it would be better to keep a general rate at as low a level as possible and at the same time not to use too many reduced rates.  But, as I said, these couple of observations were more my own opinions and contributions to this good discussion which we have witnessed today.

I would like to follow up on what Vice-President Katainen said. Of course, in our application we also have the socio-political, environmental and other functions that are possible. But you are right: in its report, the Court of Auditors found that only a limited number of socio-political, low taxes can actually be justified - especially for food and basic needs. So that's where we'll have to argue. But I would like to thank everyone for their positive contributions, for the undeserved praise - because everyone contributed. I believe that if we levy VAT based on the country of destination principle, then it will be up to the Member States to be better able to close the tax gap. Because then it is up to you whether that is the case. At a meeting in Athens this spring, the Greek finance minister said: Since the introduction of automatic cash registers in retail stores in Greece, revenues have increased by 18%. That means there are also technical devices that the Member States can use themselves. The country of destination principle is such. All arguments have been exchanged, especially the question that small and medium-sized enterprises are most likely to suffer from the high level of bureaucracy that the input tax procedure - the deduction procedure - entails. We agree to fight the fraud. I would like to make another point that the two British colleagues, who are no longer present, said: the VAT should be a sign of what is going wrong in Europe; he said the rate would be increased from 10 to 20%. The tax rate is still the independent responsibility of the member states. So this is the wrong track. The other statement that Brexit offers the British the opportunity to finally introduce their tampon tax is the highest Nonsense.Because so far there are over 500 exceptions that the member states have defended.If the British government has not been able to do this in the past, then it should be responsible and it should not be blamed on Europe.Thank you very much again.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 1690, "date": "2016-11-23.json", "name": "Ioan Mircea PAŞCU", "mepid": "33984", "text": "The debate was closed.The vote will take place on Thursday, 24 November 2016.

Europol has estimated that the activities of organized crime lead to revenue losses of approximately EUR 50 billion per year in the Member States. The scale of this phenomenon is extremely difficult to estimate, as only two Member States collect statistics in this area. In the process of combating VAT fraud, it is extremely important to simplify the system, also through the use of modern technology. One should also strive to minimize both financial and administrative burdens for entrepreneurs. Increasing the effectiveness of counteracting VAT fraud will be facilitated by the cooperation of Member States towards an agreement on the final VAT system. Effectiveness will also be achieved through the coordination of tax policy and the exchange of information in this regard between the Member States, as well as the tax authorities of the Member States.

It is the outcome of an important and positive negotiation, for which I want to thank everyone in this Chamber. In June of this year, we reached agreement with the Dutch Council Presidency: I believe this is a good outcome for European pensioners, and we have brought more protection, more transparency and more security to the way that occupational funds are managed across Europe. I believe we have achieved the right balance between respecting differences between Member States’ individual pension schemes and encouraging pension mobility within the European Union. Although this is a minimum harmonisation directive, it is also an extremely sensitive piece of legislation in that we are dealing with other people’s money here. We are dealing with people who have saved money, who have put that money aside, and we must always respect that. This has been a guiding principle that I had in the course of the negotiations. I want to highlight the excellent working partnership in Parliament’s negotiating team, and that applies to all my colleagues and all the political Groups. I was proud of the fact that we received a very broad majority in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. I want to thank my colleagues, here this evening, who worked with me as their rapporteur and I also want to thank the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality for their work in terms of the opinions they gave on the proposal. I especially want to thank the secretariat of the Economic and Affairs Committee for the excellent work they did and the expertise they brought to this issue. Ultimately, I believe Parliament’s position was upheld very strongly in the negotiations, and I want to highlight some of our achievements. On funding provisions, we managed to ensure that under-funding can occur when doing cross-border business. Currently under-funding is not permitted for cross-border activity, and this has caused a great deal of uncertainty for cross-border pension business. We brought clarity to this area, and we have ensured that appropriate action should be taken by regulators to correct the situation. On cross-border transfers we have ensured that when a pension scheme is being transferred to another Member State there is just one single authorisation from the regulator of the host Member State along with prior consent from the home Member State regulator. Both regulators must assess a limited list of criteria when approving transfers. The transfer must also be approved by members and beneficiaries of the scheme – a crucial issue. These procedures have never been set out before in EU legislation, so we have made advances here. On the pension benefit statement, this annual statement to members and beneficiaries on their pension rights has been turned from a very prescriptive and fully harmonised statement into a principles-based approach, and therefore we have more flexibility in terms of using Parliament’s proposed structure. We have also ensured that members and beneficiaries receive, at the very least, the key information on their contributions, the costs, the guarantees and the projections within their scheme. We have ensured that the depository function remains as a Member State option, so as to take into account the variety of pension systems and the way in which depository activities can be conducted. On environmental, social and government (ESG) risks for occupational pension funds: under this directive, we now have to assess these risks when making investment decisions. This idea follows the work of the United Nations. This is the first financial services directive in which such a requirement has been incorporated. It was a crucial issue for many members of Parliament’s negotiating team, and we have achieved that. On intergenerational balance, it has been recognised in the text that there should be intergenerational solidarity between younger and older members of a pension scheme, so that younger generations should not be disproportionately burdened if there are losses in the scheme. I am optimistic that this directive can pave the way for a stronger internal market for pensions across the European Union, but I also feel that it can kick-start a real debate on pensions in the EU – a debate that is much needed here. Lastly, can I make this remark: I hope that we will recast the debate on pensions, which is necessary in a situation where so many people who are currently working across the 28 EU Member States lack pension cover for the future.

I welcome the importance that this Parliament attaches to the revision of the Institutions for Occupational Retirement Provision Directive (IORPs). Your agreement will be an important step towards modernising the EU framework for occupational pension funds.  The Directive accommodates diversity in the EU pensions landscape with principles-based rules under a minimum harmonisation approach, which gives Member States maximum flexibility in implementation in national systems. The IORP2 directive brings improvements to governance provisions on cross-border activities and transfers, provisions on transparency to members, an increased freedom of investment of IORPs over the long term contributing to these EMU objectives.  Let me briefly present these improvements. The financial crisis has reinforced the need for sound governance of financial institutions and clear information to members and beneficiaries. Failure of governance of certain funds in the EU meant in some cases a cut in members’ and beneficiaries’ rights. In the new IORP2 directive, occupational pension funds and their members and beneficiaries will benefit from pension funds governed by experienced persons who carry out their duties in an objective, fair and independent way. The directive will make it easier for pension funds to conduct cross-border business, creating new opportunities for companies and their workforce. By making use of these possibilities, innovative companies ranging from SMEs to multinationals will be able to reduce costs through economies of scale, risk diversifications and innovations. The directive will improve the information provided to individuals about their pension savings. As a result, individuals will know more about their pensions. They will receive updates about their pensions regularly and will be able to make more informed choices about where they put their money. The directive will ensure that clear information is provided to pension scheme members and beneficiaries. The directive will stimulate the capacity of IORPs to invest in financial assets with a long-term economic profile and thereby support the financing of growth in the real economy.  The new rules will also make it easier for pension funds to invest in long-term assets, strengthening the role they can play in the capital markets union. Finally, the new directive will also encourage responsible investments. As a result of the agreement, pension funds will have to consider the risk of environmental, social and governance risks in their investment decisions and documents. This entails a three-yearly statement of investment policy principles.

Here the European Union can deliver, and it has delivered. Our group welcomes the revision of the Directive on Occupational Pensions, which has been negotiated under the auspices of our EPP rapporteur, Brian Hayes. The directive affirms that the opportunities for occupational pension provision in the Member States must be more strongly promoted and better secured. To achieve this, the specifics of the different types of occupational pension schemes must be recognized. We succeeded. The institutions for company pension schemes have special, effective security mechanisms. They are closely linked to employers. This is a fact that must also affect the assessment of risks in the facilities. The legislators have opted for comprehensive risk protection, but deliberately against the introduction of a solvency balance sheet. It was important to us that the company pension scheme be strengthened across the board. Small and medium-sized institutions should have the chance to continue to offer their services despite the demanding Europe-wide rules. Company pension schemes will benefit from the new directive.

The UK has already introduced automatic enrolment schemes, so all employees enjoy workplace pensions with contributions from their employers. I therefore hope that this legislation will encourage the provision of work- based pensions across the whole of the EU.  This report makes substantial improvements to the Commission’s original proposal. It is a less prescriptive text that recognises pensions as a Member State competence, focuses more on the provisions for cross-border IORPs, and deletes the delegated acts originally proposed by the Commission. Employees will now receive a tailored annual pension benefit statement and will be consulted if there are decisions which affect their pension payouts. I am happy that there are no harmonised EU solvency requirements. I support the more lenient funding regime, which was included, rather than the fully funded model. Allowing for periods of under-funding is important to reflect instances such as mergers, which would prevent funds from being fully funded at all times.  I am pleased the legislation is now more proportionate and that IORPs with less than 100 members will have reduced compliance commitments. Finally, my group is happy to see that if a Member State has equivalent protection in place then the requirement to appoint a depository for defined contribution schemes would not be necessary.

It also seems good to us to improve transparency and provide clear information to workers so that they know their rights and can defend them.

This is unavoidable on this topic because indeed in the Netherlands as soon as you talk about pensions and Europe, it is great fun, and that is even an understatement. I would like to thank the rapporteur, Brian Hayes – by the way, in Ireland it is also good fun on pensions and Europe – for his very good work. Maybe from the starting position we had slightly different views on this file. For Brian, it was also very important to stimulate the cross-border activity of pension funds, whereas for me, the protection of the people back home to ensure that their pension funds could not just go under and leave them unprotected was very important, as was ensuring that national banks keep their supervision and their control.  We secured that very well, and the compromise that we struck is a very good way of dealing with cross-border pension funds. This is indeed crucial. Why is Europe addressing this issue? It is because we are talking about huge investments with huge consequences that people are relying on, and you want to make sure that people can rely on them in the longer term too. We are especially happy that, under the Green initiative, pension funds are now obliged to report on their investments and future carbon stocks so that in the longer term the carbon bubble is being taken care of for the pension funds’ longer-term investments. That is a very important Green success which we have happily achieved under the leadership of Brian Hayes.

As people have said: the great news is we are living longer, and we have got to respond to the demographic needs across the European Union, but we have also got to respect the fact that we have, within the European Union, many different pension schemes, different pillars, and that has to be respected.  So our principle of having minimum harmonisation, respecting Member States, and doing that in a framework, is at the heart of this proposal. I think it is really important that we send out a strong message to encourage employers and employees, which is a great European tradition in terms of the social market economy, to start saving and putting money aside. We are not going to do that if we impose new solvency requirements on pensions, if we impose new taxation on pensions. Now is the time for people to save, to ensure they have an adequate income into the future, and the way to do that is to make sure that we get this proposal right. Others have spoken about the challenges. Yes, this is a low interest rate environment. It is an enormous challenge for pension schemes to yield the return that they need. We have seen a move from defined benefit to defined contribution schemes within the second pillar. There is a clear funding gap for many of these schemes. That is why we need a period of certainty and not to start having enormous regulatory burdens placed on the industry right now.  I am particularly proud of the fact that we have managed to put in place a better regime for cross-border pension provision and for cross-border schemes in terms of the fully funded arrangement, and also in terms of the clear rules for home and host. This is a major advance to ensure that we can get more take-up of cross-border pension schemes.  Finally, this has to be seen within the context of CMU, within the context of aligning our pension policy towards jobs, investment and growth across the European Union. If we do that we will make a success of that into the future by protecting people’s real incomes into the future.

In preparing my report I must thank my shadow rapporteurs, the Committee on International Trade, the Committee on Legal Affairs, the Committee on Development and the Committee on Fisheries for their opinions, the Secretariat of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, the policy team of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE), and my own staff, who have all worked very hard on this report. Also, thanks to all the members of MEPs4wildlife who have consistently backed the drive to bring this plan forward. Whilst we have been meeting here today in Strasbourg an estimated 44 more elephants have died: one every 15 minutes. They are poached, killed most brutally to make useless trinkets out of their tusks. But the problem of wildlife trafficking is not just elephant or rhino poaching. Brutal as this is, it is not the whole story. Wildlife trafficking is the trade in plants, animals, fish, birds and insects collected illegally – taken from the wild and sold in the global market place. That market place is huge. Europe is a market and a transit route for these goods. It is frogs’ legs, caviar or sharks for the catering industry. It is skins, furs and timber for the fashion and furniture industry. It is bones and scales for medicines, and reptiles and birds for pets. The lists go on and on. The risk of detection is low and the financial rewards attract criminals who launder money, destabilise communities and fund their illegal activities. In short, it is terrorism against nature and it has to be stopped.  My report builds on the Commission’s good action plan by calling for some more ways to reduce wildlife trafficking. First, wildlife trafficking must be given the same priority as drugs, human trafficking and money laundering in Europol’s Serious and Organised Crime Threat Assessments. Secondly, while it is illegal in source countries to seize certain species, they have no protection here in the EU, and this is a gap in the law. We should introduce a US-style ‘Lacey Act’ at EU level. Thirdly, better reporting needs coordination and watching. An EU wildlife trafficking coordinator would ensure this and watch Member States. This works very well with our human trafficking work, and we should repeat it here. Fourthly, until we can prove otherwise, we must introduce a full and immediate ban on the trade, export and re-export of ivory across the whole of the EU, including ‘pre-Convention’ ivory, and rhino horns. Finally, the punishment must fit the crime. The UN Convention on Serious and Organised Crime sets a minimum of four years’ internment. All Member States should sign up now and implement common standards of justice so these gangs know they will be caught and punished anywhere in the EU. At the end of the day, the fight against wildlife trafficking stands and falls with the EU’s Member States. They must make this plan an urgent priority. The public is with us on this, the politicians now need to act. This is about fighting crime, but also about protecting the planet and its wondrous gifts for future generations.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Liberals and centrists"}, {"id": 1720, "date": "2016-11-23.json", "name": "Catherine BEARDER", "mepid": "96955", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission. – Mr. President, there has been a dramatic surge in wildlife trafficking. It raises between EUR 8 and 20 billion each year for organised criminal groups, ranking alongside trafficking of drugs, people and arms. It not only threatens the survival of some species, it also creates corruption, claims human victims and deprives poorer communities of much-needed income. It also threatens security in Central Africa, funding militia and terrorist group activities.  The Commission responded by adopting in February an EU Action Plan to tackle wildlife trafficking within the EU, and to strengthen the EU’s role in a global fight against these illegal activities. Member States endorsed the plan at the June Environment Council. Parliament already had an important role in developing the EU approach. Your resolution of 2014 was an important contribution to the development of the action plan.  This new resolution is comprehensive and ambitious. It is particularly encouraging to see that several committees – Development, International Trade and Fisheries – have provided substantial input to the resolution, in addition to the Environment Committee. This reflects the multi-dimensional nature of wildlife trafficking as well as the need for a large spectrum of stakeholders and communities to take action and work together to address this trafficking.  In the Commission also, not only myself and Carmen Vella but also several other colleagues – Federica Mogherini, Nina Mimica and Dimitris Avramopoulos – were all closely associated in the development and adoption of the Action Plan, with the support of our services. We have now turned to implementation of the Action Plan, as requested in your resolution. It is too early to give a detailed report on this, but good progress has already been made since its adoption.  The Action Plan helped the EU to get successful outcomes at the recent Conference of the Parties of the CITES Convention. The CITES COP was a success and the EU was a major driver for that. My colleague Commissioner Vella was on the spot with the Commission team to guide EU positions, and I know also that the rapporteur herself and several other Members of this House were in Johannesburg following the negotiations. The EU tabled a record number of proposals at this meeting. This included the inclusion of new species in CITES, in particular rare and valuable reptiles and birds which are traded into the EU for the exotic pet market. The resolution was adopted, which for the first time in CITES clearly recognises that corruption is a key enabler for wildlife trafficking and calls on CITES parties and bodies to investigate and penalise it. The EU also pushed for targeted recommendations and sanctions to improve the fight against ivory, rhino horn and tiger trafficking.  At international level, we have also succeeded in including the issue of wildlife trafficking on the agenda of the G20 and of the Financial Action Task Force, the main international body in charge of money laundering, so that the financial dimension of wildlife trafficking will be addressed. Within the EU, the Commission has been working with enforcement agencies from the Member States, Europol and European networks of judges and prosecutors, to raise the awareness of wildlife crime, especially through training sessions and the facilitation of joint enforcement operations.  The Commission and the Member States are also developing guidelines on trade ivory to make sure that trade within the EU, or exports from the EU, do not contribute to international ivory trafficking. We will continue to work on many strands of the EU Action Plan to make sure that the EU delivers on its commitments and makes a real difference in the fight against wildlife trafficking.

We are talking about the fourth largest illegal activity on the planet and Europe is not just a taker of this illegal activity; it is also a significant transit point. So we have responsibilities. We have signed up to a UN Convention and, as the Commissioner has said, it is now about implementation. It is about getting it done, Member State by Member State, and calling out those Member States where there is an insufficiency of response in terms of that UN mandate.  So we very much support what Mrs Bearder has put forward in this particular resolution. The Committee on Development fully supports the work that she has brought to Parliament in terms of this plenary session. We expect substantial support for this in the House tomorrow.  It is worth saying, as she rightly said, that the public is ahead of politicians here. The public is demanding action on this illegal activity. They are demanding an international coordinated response and if it does not start here within the European Union, across the 28 Member States, it cannot start anywhere, and I think that is the message that needs to come from this debate this evening.

Illegal trafficking in wild flora and fauna is one of the most lucrative types of organized crime in the world with an annual turnover of between € 8 billion and € 20 billion. It has more than doubled since 2007, and has tripled since 1998, making it the fourth largest illegal activity in the world after drug trafficking, counterfeiting and human trafficking. This form of crime is becoming a serious threat to security, political stability, the economy, the source of income at the local level, natural resources and the cultural heritage of many countries. In the fight against illegal trade in wild species, I consider it important to take preventive measures in order to make the offer of illegally caught wild species as inaccessible as possible to our citizens. Control measures need to be tightened and effective policies developed to combat potential illegal activities on the Internet. The European Union and its Member States must consistently implement existing legislation and international agreements. To combat this form of organized crime, it is necessary to provide the competent authorities with sufficient resources and adequate administrative capacity. All stakeholders involved should be adequately trained depending on the important function they perform in this fight against crime.

She did a really good job. We were able to communicate well with one another in shadow meetings. From 188 amendments and four opinions from other committees, 19 compromises have been forged. Unfortunately, the report has now become a bit long at 65 digits, which in my opinion has made it a bit less precise. But on the other hand it also became clear that almost all members of parliament and committees are pulling in the right direction here and want to put an end to the illegal wildlife trade. The Commissioner has already pointed out that it is not just about elephants and rhinos - I will come to that in a moment. Pangolins and reptiles in particular are traded illegally in the EU. This includes pangolins, small crocodiles, certain turtles, but also orchids, tropical woods and exotic parrots. The Member States would have to make far more efforts here - and we should support them in doing so - to put an end to this illegal trade. I would like to draw particular attention to one point: Paragraph 58 in the report. It deals with the illegal trade in ivory and rhinoceros horn within the EU. This should clearly be banned. Just to confirm: The large elephant census in Africa, which was completed just a few months ago, clearly shows how endangered these animals are. Between 2007 and 2014 the elephant population decreased by 30%.

Trade leads to insecurity and instability, for example in Central Africa and this was also explicitly recognized by the UN Security Council. The EU is involved. After all, Europe is not only a sales market for illegal products, but also functions as a hub. Reasons enough to combat this illegal trade. In the interest of nature and our safety.

This is why I endorse the Commission and encourage Member States to seriously tackle this crime against biodiversity.

It is to be welcomed and it is high time that the Commission tries to prevent illegal wildlife trafficking and thus poaching as well. After all, poaching and illegal trade go a long way toward exterminating animal and plant species. However, under paragraph 56 of this report, legal and thus sustainable trophy hunting was also cited as a major reason for endangering endangered animals, and this follows more an ideological position against sustainable hunting and less reason. Sustainable hunting has certainly not led to the extinction of animal species in the last few decades, on the contrary. And the example of Kenya, where hunting has been banned since 1977 and the wild animal population has declined by 68% to this day, is hopefully well known to the Commission. The reasons for this are a lack of wildlife management, civilization pressures, but also a lack of protection against illegal hunting. The animals there have no real value for large parts of the population, they become unrestrained and were unrestrainedly killed as illegal trophy suppliers and pests. In South Africa, however, where hunting is allowed, the rhino population increased by around 900% in spite of the poaching of 2,000 animals, because it is important and worthwhile for the state and the locals to protect animals and to preserve their populations also increase. Because wherever people live from and with trophy hunting, the wild animal automatically receives value, is protected and, accordingly, is less the target of illegal hunting. The wild animal thus also provides a livelihood for many people and a decent reward for the regional population. Well-trained and equipped game rangers or bush rangers are a guarantee for the preservation of the wild animal population. The number 56 discriminates against hunting and is therefore to be rejected because it is simply wrong. I will agree with the report itself because very much there is much positive in it.And we have to say: in the end, sustainable hunting really only protects the environment.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "ENF", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Far-right nationalists"}, {"id": 1742, "date": "2016-11-23.json", "name": "Annie SCHREIJER-PIERIK", "mepid": "125030", "text": "- I thank my colleague Bearder for this report. Indeed, the illegal wildlife trade poses a serious threat to wildlife and the rule of law. Let's take a look at the rhinoceros. Poaching in South Africa alone breaks a record this year. More than a thousand rhinos have already been poached, which is a low point. Rhino poaching has increased by 9,000 percent in seven years. More than three rhinos a day are currently being killed. The horn of this animal is more expensive than gold. It yields 50,000 euros per kilo. Such proceeds make this crime too attractive to the poor population of the region and we must therefore tackle this crime very hard with the action plan before us. I would also like to point out the importance of legal hunting, point 56. In some reserves, sustainable legal game management is an important source of income. This source of income offers the poor population a good alternative to poaching. Certified legal sustainable hunting trophies can therefore make an important contribution, despite all emotions and prejudices. And as a hunter you can be proud of that. And we must be able to admit these. Furthermore, I think it is important that the European development funds provide financial support for emerging countries to stop, arrest and punish poachers and smugglers. And I am therefore pleased that the Environment Committee has supported my amendment on this point.

It is perhaps time to recall that, philosophically, man is superior to the animal as the animal is to the plant and the plant to the mineral. It therefore seems irresponsible and scandalous to me to compare trafficking in wildlife to trafficking in human beings, otherwise known as slavery - an analogy expressed in black and white in this report.

It makes it possible to co-finance wildlife conservation plans and to provide monitoring and traceability to work in symbiosis with sovereign States. These States precisely, respect them!

First, the loss of biodiversity. It is estimated, according to what is exposed in the report, that we face a clear extinction of species that can unbalance the trophic chain of animal species and cause, therefore, irreparable damage to some ecosystems that are unique on our planet. Second, the financing of criminal organizations. Approximately, the wildlife smuggling business moves around 20 billion euros annually; 20 billion hidden euros, which are neither taxed to the States, nor is it known where they come from, nor help to improve the economy of the countries of origin of these species; on the contrary, they destabilize it.

This is very positive news.  In many contributions, many Members highlighted the importance of implementation; that is of course of the essence. We have to make sure that our Member States will implement everything that we have agreed. Many colleagues here said that the Commission must make sure that the Action Plan is implemented. We do our share, but implementation is mostly in the hands of Member States, and you as representatives of Member States can hopefully put pressure on your governments so that these things are taken seriously. So let us take this implementation as a core issue.  The third point I want to make is that the EU has the strictest rules on the trade in hunting trophies. Trade is possible but strictly framed, which is very good. The EU made a proposal to CITES and this proposal was accepted, which means that there are guidelines to ensure that hunting trophies are from legal and sustainable origins. We now have an international standard that establishes an export permit for species like lions, hippos and polar bears.  On the fourth element, illegal killing has nothing to do with hunting, because hunting always has legal rules and it is better to have sustainable rules for hunting. Illegal killing is a crime which destroys sustainability and that is why we have to concentrate our efforts, especially with this.  Some Members asked about the continuation of the process. The Action Plan covers five years from this year to 2020, and the Commission and the EEAS will establish a scoreboard to monitor implementation. The Commission will report to the European Parliament and to the Council by July 2018 on progress made. Evaluation of the plan’s curbing of wildlife trafficking will be carried out in 2020.

But, as with any of this, the important thing is enforcement and making sure that we do what we say we are signed up to do. So we will be looking to you, Commissioner, to make sure that that is done. On the issue of trophy hunting: trophy hunting pretends to be about conservation. If it was about conservation we would not have a problem, but there are tens of thousands of animals taken from the wild and it is creating a market for illegal trophies and putting money into big businesses. It is not helping local communities. It is not helping the animals. It is very complicated to stop wildlife trafficking. The source countries need help. We need to stop the money laundering and the gun running. I am very pleased to hear about the online marketplace, which is also a really growing market. Biodiversity is under huge pressure; climate change and human pressure on wildlife areas are adding to that, but wildlife trafficking is a concerted attack for profit. It is heart-breaking to see what is happening. Out there are brave game rangers risking their lives, and others are facing determined criminals. We face telling our children: once there were elephants, or rhinos, or redwood trees. This action plan is good, but so far it is just a paper document. We have to work altogether to turn that into action, and quickly. The biosphere is under attack. It is the life-sustaining system of our planet and it is the beautiful result of millions of years of evolution. Without action now we will lose most of it forever.

It is necessary to recall that transport, essential for the movement of people and goods, is a fundamental element of the internal market. Alongside public transport, which is often in difficulty, SMEs in the transport sector - or, should I say, \"mobility\" - represent an essential activity and often the bulk of the sector's activity, a capital element of mobility, especially in urban nodes, and a dynamic source of growth and, therefore, of job creation to meet the ever-increasing demand for mobility. The challenges facing European transport SMEs as a whole are of various kinds. They are firstly confronted with a regulatory challenge due to the complexity, the inherent costs generated and the great disparity in the rules governing access to regulated professions; secondly, to an economic challenge linked to heavy charges and to the perennial problem of financing with difficult access to credit for limited investment capacities; third, to an environmental challenge resulting from congestion, emissions and dependence on fossil fuels; fourth, to a technological challenge with the emergence of the new economy, intermediation platforms, empowerment, automation and vehicle connectivity. Moreover, this last point leads me to underline the appearance of a new phenomenon in this context. It was in the transport sector that the collaborative economy first made its most spectacular breakthrough. Uberization is a term that bears witness to this. However, this new economy brings ruptures positive technological and commercial innovations, but also poses certain problems for traditional players and regulators. The progress generated by the collaborative economy is numerous: improvement of the quality and fluidity of existing services; securing actors for the benefit of the consumer - I mean the gains in confidence generated by the reciprocal identification and notification of the consumer and the service provider; strengthening of transaction security; creation of a new type of self-employed worker, often in need of income and participating both in increasing growth and reducing unemployment. However, let us not forget the challenges posed by this platform economy, starting with the definition and supervision of the relationships between these platforms and service providers, both for the purposes of taxation and social protection or the security of legal stability. Then, should the nature of the service offered by the service provider to the individual be qualified as \"commercial\" or \"cost-sharing\" in the context of co-consumption? In addition and as a consequence of the above, the question is raised of the fiscal and social status of the actors of the collaborative economy as well as the differentiation between the non-profit sharing economy for the service provider and the platform economy. for profit. Data protection is obviously an important subject, without forgetting the relationship with the so-called \"classic\" transport economy and corporations. Access to regulated professions is often complex, restricted and different in the Member States. The response to all of these problems involves, on the one hand, improving the environment for SMEs in the sector by reducing their administrative burden, simplifying their access to credit, and even to research, by modernizing the status of professions and by easier access to new technologies for traditional players. This response implies, on the other hand, the convergence between the classic economy and the new collaborative economy at European level by the harmonization of statutes and rules of access to professions, by the determination of what falls under sharing and which is profit in a commercial activity, by the harmonization of tax and social systems in order to ensure identical rules between the traditional economy and the new economy and by the progression towards European frameworks which define the status of the professions and their economic framework. My dear colleagues, these are the challenges ahead. I am delighted that this report has received very broad support from my colleagues in the Transport Committee. I hope that it will be useful in moving towards more efficiency, growth, employment and sustainability in the service of citizens and I am about to listen to your interventions very carefully.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 1768, "date": "2016-11-23.json", "name": "Dominique RIQUET", "mepid": "96885", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, I would like to welcome the report by Mr Riquet which provides a really balanced view of current developments in the transport sector, while pointing out some of the major challenges. Let me respond to the elements of his report. First, on the importance of SMEs in the transport sector. Road transport is a sector which is characterised by hundreds of thousands of SMEs. As an example, 95% of road freight companies are micro-companies with less than 10 employees. As opposed to other modes of transport, companies in road transport are subject to stiff competition in an already open market. This is largely due to the creation of a single market.  However, looking at the local level and at passenger transport in particular, the development has been quite different. Local and regional markets are often closed and strictly regulated, or even operated directly by public authorities. This way of functioning has not been challenged until recently. In some cases it has not promoted the industry to develop innovative solutions for transport.  On the role of the Commission, our role is to propose, where appropriate, EU legislation that addresses issues identified in a proportionate manner, having regard to the different public interests possibly involved, such as road safety or social working conditions, and of course our role is also to ensure that Member States comply with EU law, and the responsibility of Member States highlighted by your report is therefore very welcome.  On the 2017 road initiatives, as you know, the Commission has announced legislative proposals in the field of road transport to be presented in the first semester of 2017. When reviewing existing EU legislation in road transport, we will be looking for a balance between social standards and enhancing the functioning of the internal market. In particular, we are looking at ways to improve rules on access to the profession of road transport operator that are supposed to ensure fair conditions for hauliers of different Member States. We need to adjust and clarify rules in a way that does not increase administrative burdens.  On digitalisation of the economy, digitalisation is an opportunity to increase mobility and reduce congestion in cities, but it may also be a challenge for transport. We must ensure access to relevant transport data by all potential service providers, which is essential to ensure fair competition and effective functioning of the single market, and for municipalities and regulators to improve mobility services.  On the collaborative economy and regulation of shared passenger transport, the Commission has made it clear, notably in the communication on the collaborative economy, that it supports initiatives that help make better use of resources and that make the lives of citizens easier. We have also made it clear that all undertakings must observe Union law, as well as applicable national law, which itself must be in line with Union law. Within this framework, however, it is up to the undertakings concerned to choose their business model. At the same time, we have encouraged Member States to take the emergence of new technological solutions and business models as an opportunity to modernise decades-old regulations, and only apply restrictions if fully justified, proportionate and non-discriminatory.  When looking at the legislation and applying it to new business models, the Commission encourages Member States to take into account the particularities of the collaborative economy. In this context, thresholds may be a good means to distinguish between professional providers and peer providers. Banning services should only be a last resort and should be objectively justified by reason of an overriding public interest. In the specific case of passenger transport by taxi, hire car and ride-sharing, the Commission launched a fact-finding study which has identified a huge diversity of national and local rules, resulting in a very different development on the market in each Member State.  While one can see some restrictions which are difficult to justify, we also see some good examples. More and more Member States realise the potential of technological development, as well as new ways of organising transport services. Some Member States have decided to modify and simplify their laws by removing unnecessary barriers while ensuring minimum standards. These signs are encouraging and the Commission will continue to support this process.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "PPE", "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 1769, "date": "2016-11-23.json", "name": "Elena GENTILE", "mepid": "124847", "text": "draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the transport market, traditional business models are now being joined by new business models which appear to be of interest in terms of employment and because they make the services offered more competitive, to the benefit of end consumers. But we cannot fail to say that we are concerned about the possible repercussions on working conditions, its precariousness, its safety, with the risk that the boundary between self-employed and subordinate work becomes blurred. Furthermore, digitized business models do not appear so transparent with respect to competition rules, with the risk of favoring unfair market practices, avoidance and tax evasion.

I will transfer her criteria in her name, since she is absent. The report, in the opinion of Mrs. Monteiro, analyzes the new opportunities for the transport sector, especially in the area of ​​the collaborative economy. Mrs Monteiro believes that it is an important issue that current legislation takes innovation into account. In her opinion, digital applications facilitate the connection between client and company and are part of the unstoppable innovation. Ms Monteiro considers that there is too much regulation for access to the taxi profession and that Member States should not protect either one or the other, but rather find a fair solution in order to create optimal conditions for the two business models . The shadow rapporteur also calls on the Member States to update their national laws, so that they encompass an idea of ​​a collaborative economy. And I am now going to make a series of personal judgments, not without saying beforehand that my agreement with Mrs. Monteiro is absolute: the collaborative economy can and should be an element of innovation and competition, as long as it respects the basic elements of transport, such as safety and consumer protection, and do not incur unfair competition. However, the element that worries the Spanish delegation is that of light commercial vehicles. Small companies cannot use means of transport that optimize economies of scale. Mr Riquet wonders in his report, in paragraph 37, whether there are reasons to exempt light commercial vehicles from the application of European regulations. Well, as his title indicates — New opportunities for small businesses in transport—, this is a report that aims to facilitate the integration of small and medium-sized companies in the transport market.It is therefore incoherent, in our view, to question the exemption for light commercial vehicles, since it would be contrary to what is intended in the title of the report.Therefore, we understand and see as a hindrance the tightening of the administrative conditions for smaller vehicles.Light cargo vehicles represent a very small part of the freight transport sector in Europe.Consequently, the Spanish delegation of the PPE will vote against paragraph 37 of this report, without prejudice to our final positive vote on this good work, as will be the vote of the entire PPE Group on this report, which we find positive and very realistic.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 1771, "date": "2016-11-23.json", "name": "Maria GRAPINI", "mepid": "124785", "text": "on behalf of the S & D group. - Mr President, Commissioner, I would like, from the outset, as co-rapporteur for the S&D Group, to thank the rapporteur, Mr Riquet, who has created a good atmosphere and good collaboration in the team he has coordinated. . The report was very important for me and my group, because we had the opportunity to propose the improvement of the situation of SMEs by creating new opportunities for these SMEs in the field of transport. There are challenges for small transport companies and we, the Parliament, the Commission, the Council, but also the national authorities need to support them. That is why I consider this report important and I hope that it will be supported and voted on by all political groups. I emphasized in the report the need for the Member States and the Commission to take appropriate measures to combat anti-competitive practices on the part of the large integrated groups. The Commission needs to increase transparency and ask it to publish a roadmap on the release of data on publicly funded transport. We must not run away from the truth: small businesses cannot enter public or even publicly funded urban urban transport precisely because of the large integrated groups. I have proposed several amendments to this report and I thank the rapporteur, but also the shadow rapporteurs for the way in which we negotiated the compromises. The report also refers to social dumping and social protection and consumer protection. The report calls for the establishment of cooperation structures between small transport enterprises, research institutes and local and regional authorities, in order to better organize urban and interurban mobility, in order to respond effectively to the emergence of services and products, including to those offered by SMEs. I am also co-chair of the SME intergroup and I have had many debates on SMEs, including in the field of SMEs. transport.

The report calls on the Commission, in collaboration with the national, regional and local authorities of the Member States, to develop a communication platform to advise and train SMEs, as it has often been found that SMEs, small businesses, chosen, avoids expanding into the transport sector due to the increased risks involved in cross-border activity. We need to better understand, Commissioner, that small transport companies are inherent in European mobility, SMEs are creative, innovative, but they need to have a favorable environment in order to grow. We need to support small businesses to turn challenges into opportunities, especially when it comes to ICT. The model of the collaborative economy has also made its presence felt in the field of transport, with more flexible forms of work and this is beneficial. We must not forget that small transport companies are particularly important in hard-to-reach regions, in remote areas, in rural areas, but also in the peripheral areas of urban areas. That is why this own-initiative report of the European Parliament is important and I support its vote. I conclude by thanking my colleagues who tabled amendments and the rapporteur, Mr Riquet, who took an objective position in negotiating the compromises.

Commissioner! Small and medium-sized enterprises operating in the transport sector have to face many constraints: tax, environmental or social barriers that effectively hinder their functioning. Overcoming these barriers is not possible without friendly legislation. The digital revolution has created many new opportunities for small and medium-sized transport companies. New transport-sharing business models are the most popular of these opportunities, so we badly need a sensible and comprehensive assessment of their impact on the entire transport services market. Both the self-regulation of this segment and the imposition of too many restrictions on it will not be conducive to innovation, safety and protection of the rights of consumers and employees. It is certainly not about giving too much importance to the social aspects, which this report unfortunately tends to do, but about a balanced and coordinated response to the challenges of the digital revolution at European level. Undoubtedly, all forms of state protectionism, which we have witnessed for many months, especially in the area of ​​road freight transport, are detrimental to the development of small transport companies.

Thus, these companies will play a decisive role in the fight against climate change, at the same time that they will be in the best position to solve the great challenge facing the integration of the different modes of transport into an intelligent mobility system , the solution to the challenge of the «last kilometer», both in non-urban spaces and in cities.

Furthermore, as this report points out, it requires a change in the philosophy of regulation to adapt it to the new reality, to favor innovation and fair competition, and to guarantee consumer rights.

Among these platforms, we find new ethical business models that pursue values ​​of sharing, climate protection and social bonding.

This is why I want to say that it is urgent to have a strict regulatory framework and I am making this appeal to the European Commission because there are still too many legal uncertainties, which are obstacles to the development of the collaborative economy. In this regulatory framework, we must, on the one hand, define what a collaborative economy platform that is based on cost-sharing as opposed to platforms that provide professional services and, on the other hand, harmonize the rules at European level. There are two other reasons for regulating the collaborative economy as well. First of all, to protect it from itself because it is a sector which is still not very mature and which has a tendency towards monopoly. Then, rules should be established so that competition is not unfair and does not encourage fiscal dumping or social dumping. This risk of dumping exists.

In particular, it must be borne in mind that regulation must not become too burdensome for small businesses.

Among other things, emerging business models may indeed raise problems of legal uncertainty with regard to the application of the existing legal framework. We also agree that we need to distinguish between profit-making and cost-sharing activities. This is, again, in line with the Commission’s communication on the collaborative economy. In that communication, besides a clear definition of terms, the Commission also made very clear that operators in the collaborative economy should comply with rules that are well designed to ensure consumer protection, safety and security, adequate working conditions and training and fiscal compliance. With this report, Parliament calls on the Commission and Member States to combat anti-competitive practices. The reaction of Member States to the emergence of new players has indeed been diverse and the Commission is following the developments. Whether or not the Commission needs to intervene will depend on case-by-case assessment.

Europe should support their adaptation to these rapid changes by improving their environment and focusing its action on the following priorities: more efficient, simpler and less costly regulation, more transparent, stable and attractive taxation, access to credit which must be simplified, accelerated and more effective, as well as social protection and fiscal equality.

In December 2015 the Commission adopted an Aviation Strategy for Europe. As part of this strategy, it was proposed to start negotiations at EU level on aviation safety agreements with Japan and China and on aviation agreements with China, Turkey, Mexico, the six member states of the Gulf Cooperation Council, Armenia and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ASEAN. On March 8, 2016, the Council authorized the Commission to open negotiations with China and Japan on aviation safety agreements. On June 7, 2016, the start of negotiations on aviation agreements at EU level with ASEAN, Turkey, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates was approved. The Council is currently still discussing draft negotiating directives for the start of negotiations at EU level on aviation agreements with China, Mexico, Armenia and the remaining four member states of the Gulf Cooperation Council. The Committee on Transport and Tourism - not Transport and Tourism - put the following questions to the Commission in this context: What objectives, priorities and timeframes have been set for the negotiation of aviation agreements for which the Commission has received the negotiating directives? What is the state of the negotiating directives on which the Council still has to decide? How does the Commission intend to ensure that Parliament is immediately and fully informed of all stages of the negotiations, pursuant to Article 218 (10) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union? How does the Commission intend to ensure adequate transparency and access to files during the negotiations? Can the Commission guarantee that Parliament and the Council will be informed at the same time, before and after each negotiation round - on an equal footing, I would say? Can the Commission confirm that it does will not seek the provisional application of concluded aviation agreements until Parliament has given its approval to the agreements?Commissioner, I look forward to your answer.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "Verts/ALE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Greens and regionalists"}, {"id": 1796, "date": "2016-11-23.json", "name": "Rainer WIELAND", "mepid": "2323", "text": "Thank you very much, Mr Cramer.We will enter into a semantic discussion about the difference between tourism and tourism.In the landscape where I come from, we try very hard not to treat tourists as strangers.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 1797, "date": "2016-11-23.json", "name": "Rainer WIELAND", "mepid": "2323", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, honourable Members, Mr Cramer, thank you very much for all your questions. I hope I will be able to respond to them adequately. Since the publication of the Commission communication on developing the external aviation agenda, the EU and the Commission have been successfully pursuing aviation agreements in the neighbourhood and with key external partners. In the aviation strategy last December, we announced an ambitious external aviation agenda to ensure that our industry can be where growth is, and can deliver benefits to the European consumer and the EU economy. To that end, the Commission proposed to negotiate EU air transport agreements with a number of partner countries – China, the member states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Turkey, Mexico, all six member states of the Gulf Cooperation Council and Armenia – as well as EU air safety agreements with China and Japan. The objective is to tap into those markets and improve commercial opportunities within a modern regulatory framework. EU transport agreements with these partners aim to provide for market access based on the acceptance of certain common rules. In the case of neighbourhood countries, the EU expects the partner country to agree to implement the entire EU aviation acquis. The Commission aims to replicate in new air transport agreements the positive impact of the existing agreements. These already cover almost half of today’s passengers flying in and out of the EU, and deliver consumer benefits through a modern, transparent and enabling regulatory framework, better connections and lower fares. With all the countries with which we sign such agreements we also see dramatic increases in traffic. EU bilateral aviation safety agreements promote cooperation to ensure high levels of civil aviation safety and environmental compatibility. They also serve the purpose of facilitating and promoting trade and investment relations for aeronautic products and services. Through the negotiation of such air safety agreements with China and Japan, the Commission is seeking to replicate the benefits that have been achieved from similar agreements with the United States of America, Canada and Brazil. So what is the state of play of negotiations? On 7 March 2016, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations for bilateral air safety agreements with China and Japan. A first round of negotiations with China will take place in December in Beijing and a first round of negotiations with Japan is expected in early 2017. On 7 June 2016, the Council authorised the Commission to open negotiations with Qatar, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), ASEAN and Turkey. The first round of negotiations has taken place with Qatar, ASEAN and Turkey. The next rounds are planned for early 2017. Concerning the UAE, there is no confirmation yet on the starting date for negotiations. The dialogue so far has been very constructive and the interest of all parties in making progress is already clear. We intend to sustain a quick pace throughout the negotiations. Further requests for authorisation to launch negotiations with Armenia, Mexico, China and the four remaining countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council, namely Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, and Saudi Arabia, are still on the table at the Council. We expect that the Commission will be authorised by the Council in December to open negotiations with Armenia. Regarding cooperation with the European Parliament, as you know, honourable Members, the Commission considers it very important that Parliament is kept fully informed of progress in the aviation negotiations. The modalities for the Commission’s contribution to keeping Parliament informed were agreed between our two institutions and set out in the framework agreement. Good cooperation on these matters must continue, as outlined in my letter of March this year to the Chair of the Committee on Transport and Tourism, Mr Cramer. My staff are working in this spirit to keep interested members of the Transport Committee informed about the state of play in the negotiations, as provided for in the Interinstitutional Agreement on Better Law-Making, concluded earlier this year between Parliament, the Council and the Commission, on improved practical arrangements for cooperation and information sharing in the context of international agreements. These negotiations provide a good opportunity to discuss further the modalities of our cooperation on these matters.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "PPE", "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 1798, "date": "2016-11-23.json", "name": "Wim van de CAMP", "mepid": "96754", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - Indeed, the big question tonight is: how will the European Parliament be involved in the negotiation of international aviation agreements?

That is dangerous. We have all kinds of views, we have all kinds of wings in this house, we do not have to negotiate ourselves. However, Madam President, and I very much agree with the Transport Committee and the Tourism Committee, there is indeed a big difference between Fremdenverkehr and tourism. Because tourism sounds much more sympathetic. And I ask Ms Bulc to keep that information flow going. Indeed, interim reports on the negotiations would be very welcome. Mr President, we should not underestimate the cultural differences between the European Union and a number of our treaty partners. The level playing field that we would like, for example with the Gulf States, but also the issue of illegal state aid, as well as the social aspects, are of great importance to the European Parliament.

For these reasons, I would like to emphasize how essential the full and constant involvement of the European Parliament is, as expressly provided for in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. It is not just a question of transparency: being able to assess the issues at stake, knowing the timing and the state of the art, before and after each negotiation round, means being able to consciously choose whether to support or not, in the future, a potential agreement reached.

Following phenomenal technological advances during World War II, the transition that moved us from airships to biplanes to the invention of the jet engine meant we were now developing the ability to move more and more people and freight around the world. As a result, in 1944, 54 countries signed the Chicago Convention, which is an important reminder that these agreements predate the foundation of the United Nations. In 1946 the first bilateral between the UK and the US became the model. This consisted of a schedule which outlined prices and capacity in order to regulate air traffic between two countries. These were registered under the auspices of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), where additional criteria were lodged. The EU court judgment of 2002 sent a clear message: that, in order to have the EU nature of our carriers recognised, Member States had to allow access for the relevant third country.  To conclude, while it is vitally important that we are updated with the progress of negotiations, we should be aware that unrealistic demands on third-country airlines who wish to access the EU will ultimately damage the opportunities for our airlines to expand their networks worldwide. Ultimately, these agreements are about trade, jobs and wealth and it is vital that we take a pragmatic approach.

Obviously, while we would love to be consulted on every single proposal that is made, sometimes negotiating techniques mean that this is not always possible. But that is one side of the story. The second part of the story – and you have heard it – is that many of us have different concerns. Some have social concerns, some have concerns about security, safety or trade, some want to see a liberal approach etc. I must say that the Parliament is very lively today on these issues. While I might not share some of the concerns, I do appreciate the fact that the Parliament has to be engaged. We need to find the right balance. This is perhaps the way to avoid unpleasant surprises later on. This means that we can have solid interaction with the Commission from time to time in plenary as we are doing today, but the Committee and the Commission services should be in intensive contact on the relevant issues to be negotiated. That is a message to the Commission. The message for us is that the agreements are an opportunity. It is something that can address a number of the issues that we are legitimately concerned about. Some of you mentioned social issues and some mentioned anti-competitive measures. I am the rapporteur for aviation strategy, and I would like to see a fair competition clause in the bilateral agreements. This is just one example, but I think that we need to understand that, while there has to be a balance, we also need to address these agreements as an opportunity to settle some of the problems and some of the concerns, but also maximise the effect for our consumers, our industries and our airliners and to avoid counterproductive results.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 1802, "date": "2016-11-23.json", "name": "Merja KYLLÖNEN", "mepid": "124736", "text": "On behalf of the GUE / NGL Group. - Mr President, the development of air transport, both within Europe and with third countries, is very important.

I strongly believe that the changing landscape of global aviation offers many opportunities for the EU. Our successful internal EU aviation market shows that open markets are the best basis for developing our international aviation relationships. But let me stress this point: market opening must come with a clear, fair and stable regulatory environment. EU aviation agreements are our tools to achieve this and make the external aviation policy a success. We should therefore aim to capitalise on the benefits of international aviation agreements without delay and with as many partners as possible. I know that some of you might dispute that, but if we do not have enough partners with whom we can negotiate at the same time, we will lose the competitive situation and that works against us. Under the Treaty, provisional application may begin from the date of signature of an international agreement, if so decided by the Council. You know very well that there is, unfortunately, a very long delay between the signing and the conclusion of EU air transport agreements. This is due to the fact that they are mixed agreements that have to be ratified by all 28 Member States before proceeding to conclusion at EU level. We are, however, only at the beginning of the process. The first negotiating rounds were promising. I am looking forward to continuing to work with Parliament and I will keep you fully informed of the progress of the talks. The Commission is committed to transparency. For the agreements pursued as part of the aviation strategy, in particular, we have made available the documents that come under the Commission’s responsibility, as provided for in the framework agreement. We have also arranged to debrief the rapporteurs on the progress made today. Dialogue is ongoing as to how to make this information process even smoother.

Due to the sanctions imposed on Russia and its response to them, European airlines pay significantly higher rates for transit flights over Russian territory. The amounts we are talking about here are very large. Some European airlines have extensive connection networks and even operate several hundred flights over the territory of Russia. Tickets are already very expensive. Signing an agreement with, for example, China, whose airlines have significantly lower rates for transit flights over Russia, may cause many European carriers to simply collapse.

As stated in the Energy Union Strategy, we need to adopt a broad approach on energy security, encompassing solid emergency plans, external supply diversification, enforcement of internal market rules, infrastructure development, indigenous renewable generation and energy savings.  First, the Commission has proposed a revision of the 2010 Security of Gas Supply Regulation in order to improve further the level of preparedness and resilience of our gas system. This proposal aims at a more robust and consistent security of support framework, in particular by strengthening regional cooperation to lay the foundation for true solidarity among Member States.  Second, the EU needs to ensure that intergovernmental agreements signed by its Member States with third countries in the area of energy are more transparent and fully compliant with EU law. To that end, the Commission proposed to significantly improve the information exchange mechanism with regard to intergovernmental agreements and non-binding instruments.  Third, the Commission adopted the LNG and gas storage strategy, which analyses the related strategic infrastructure to complete the internal energy market and the necessary projects to end the single source dependency of some Member States.  Lastly, the security of supply package included the heating and cooling strategy. The Commission strategy focuses on removing barriers to decarbonisation in buildings and industry, highlighting the role of modern technologies, increased energy efficiency and the use of renewables. In July 2015 the Commission proposed a revision of the Energy Labelling Directive and it will soon present a comprehensive review of the Renewable Energy Efficiency and Energy Performance of Buildings Directives.  But energy security also refers to the electricity sector itself, where security of supply requires us to develop a more integrated approach, based on common methods and rules, as well as regional cooperation. To ensure this, the Commission is currently considering a proposal for a new regulation on how to prevent and manage crisis situations in the European electricity sector, which would include the obligation to draw up risk preparedness plans for Member States, as well as sharing information and cooperation in times of crisis. In 2014 more than 80% of our total gas imports came from just three countries. The diversification of both suppliers and supply routes is therefore a key area to ensure security of supply, but we also need more competition that keeps prices in check. As argued in the Energy Union Strategy, the Commission has identified four main areas that can play a crucial role in enhancing gas supply diversification in Europe. First, the realisation of the Southern Gas Corridor is a landmark project as it will link the EU market to the immense gas resources around the Caspian Basin. The implementation of the project is on track and, as of 2020, it will start supplying the European market with 10 billion cubic meters of Azeri gas each year. The Caspian region has an incredible potential in terms of expanding these gas volumes. Following the signature of the Ashgabat Declaration, the Commission is working with Azerbaijan, Georgia, Turkey and Turkmenistan to extend the Southern Gas Corridor to Central Asia. Second, we have to cooperate with the countries bordering the Eastern Mediterranean in order to develop their rich resources. With regard to Eastern Mediterranean gas, a solution to the transport mode is required. Both the LNG and pipeline options are on the table.  Third, although North Africa already supplies 15% of our gas imports, the region still has untapped oil and gas reserves, both conventional and unconventional. The main challenge to realising this potential and linking it to the EU market is to overcome the current security issues and political instability. In order to realise the opportunities in our southern neighbourhood a Euro-Mediterranean Platform on Gas has been set up and is operational.  Fourth, with the emergence of new suppliers, LNG will become an important flexibility element in the coming years. In this respect, we need to ensure an optimal use of our existing and future regasification capacities. When it comes to gas supply, it is important to stress that Ukraine is – and should remain – an important transit country for Russian gas to Europe. The Commission has led trilateral negotiations between Russia, Ukraine and the EU to ensure a continuous flow of Russian gas into Ukraine and to the rest of Europe. We are also working with our Ukrainian partners to revise and upgrade the existing Memorandum of Understanding on Energy Cooperation to be fit for the common challenges ahead. We hope to sign this at the EU—Ukraine summit later this week. Let me conclude this intervention with a few words on Nord Stream II. Irrespective of the organisational set—up of Nord Stream II, the Commission’s overall negative assessment of the project’s contribution to the EU’s energy policy goals remains valid. If built, Nord Stream II would have to fully comply with applicable EU law, as the project cannot happen in a legal void or only according to Russian law. Nord Stream II, if built, has to be operated under a legal framework which also takes due account of the key principles of our energy market rules. Transport capacity from Russia is currently only used at a rate of about 50%. If constructed, Nord Stream II would, according to our estimates, increase access transmission capacity from Russia even further.  In this context, let me also mention the decision on OPAL that the Commission took a few weeks ago. This is the result of an exemption procedure under the EU’s Third Energy Package legislation for the use of an internal pipeline in the EU, and was requested by a national regulator. This decision will allow a more efficient use of the existing infrastructure and, in particular, allow competitors better access to it, thereby enhancing competition. In our view, this makes the economic case for Nord Stream II even less compelling. I am now ready to listen to your comments and then respond to them.

In the European Union, we have set ourselves the goal of creating a so-called Energy Union, the way a marathon is run. The Energy Union has several objectives at the same time: to reduce import dependence, to reduce CO2 emissions and to increase competition between energy suppliers so that consumers have the lowest possible prices. It is therefore completely incomprehensible that three things are happening or not happening on the part of the Commission that are actually hindering this Energy Union. The first is - what happens to a settlement? Will there be a settlement with Gazprom or not? Gazprom has long abused its dominant position, forcing Eastern Europe to pay much more for gas. We read in the press that a friendly solution is possible, where he will not have to pay anything at all. What is it? How does this fit in with our goals? The second is this Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. European Commission, you say all the time: 'Well, it has to be connected, he has to meet ...' Clear and light, black on white it must be said! And the third is the expansion of the Opel gas pipeline specifically for Gazprom. All three of these things work against our goals of achieving the Energy Union.

For this reason, we must recognize the right to energy as a common good and necessary for life and prohibit power outages for people in vulnerable situations - as the directives mandate. And, of course, to fulfill this right, supply must be ensured.

In fact, the European Commission's own stress tests for eventual gas supply cuts say so: current infrastructures are sufficient and meeting the 2030 renewable and efficiency targets would improve the situation and reduce dependence on fossil fuels imported. For this reason, we ask the Commission and the Member States not to listen to the lobbies so much for the Winter Package and to listen more to the people.

That is a fact. It is not only considered in a time of supply crisis; it has become an integral part of the EU’s energy policy and is firmly enshrined in the Energy Union strategy.  Let me now try to reply to some of the topics that many of you raised. First, Nord Stream: if built, Nord Stream 2 would have to fully comply with applicable EU law, as the project cannot happen in a legal void or only according to Russian law. It has to at least comply with the main principles of the Third Energy Package and fully respect the applicable rules of EU environmental and public procurement legislation. On topic number 2, OPAL: in general, enabling efficient use of existing pipelines contributes better to market integration and security of supply for all EU Member States than building new costly pipelines. The decision does not provide access to new supply sources or alternative supply routes in a crisis situation, but promotes closer integration of the Czech and German gas market. On the topic of the overall situation in the gas sector and climate change, the EU gas markets have been experiencing important changes in the last two to three years and are exposed to a lot of uncertainty regarding future consumption levels. Following the COP 21 Summit in Paris, opportunities are arising for the gas market as a traditional fuel. Yet, thanks to the increasing energy efficiency and continued development of renewables, the sluggish recovery of the EU economy gas consumption is likely to pick up by 2020. On the fourth topic, the Winter Package of 30 November: in July 2015, the Commission proposed a revision of the Energy Labelling Directive, and it will soon present a comprehensive review of the Renewable Energy Efficiency and Energy Performance of Buildings Directives. But energy security also refers to the electricity sector itself, where security of supply requires us to develop a more integrated approach based on common methods and rules, as well as regional cooperation.  Last, but not least, energy poverty: EU legislation clearly assigns responsibility for protecting vulnerable consumers and addressing energy poverty to Member States. However, the Commission has been taking action to assist Member States to meet their obligations under EU law by identifying best practices and supporting the exchange of information on how to alleviate energy poverty in the most cost effective way. As announced in the Consumer Communication, the Commission will further consider how to improve the EU-wide data collection and monitoring of energy poverty.  Finally, let me stress one more time that the Commission is putting a lot of effort into strengthening the frameworks and concrete projects to enhance the EU’s energy security, in full consistency with the priorities identified by the Energy Union strategy. We welcome the support of the European Parliament for our work in this area; this is crucial in order to ensure a swift implementation of the Energy Union strategy. Thank you very much.

Meanwhile, over 50 million European citizens live in conditions of energy poverty at a level that requires interventions to safeguard their health. Furthermore, many Member States are far from the targets set for renewable energies, which would instead guarantee a secure and autonomous supply.

I don’t think the importance of the topic can be overemphasized. We MEPs know exactly what it is like when energy supply is disrupted or systems that were previously considered reliable suddenly fail due to a shortage of supply. A reliable energy supply is a precondition for all other economic activities. A predictable, stable and affordable electricity and gas supply is needed for the safety of economic and residential consumers. EU integration is a unique and irreplaceable opportunity for European Member States. By interconnecting and coordinating their existing self-sufficient energy networks, Member States may be able to operate a much more efficient and cost-effective system. Naturally, as Energy Union integration progresses, energy planning will become increasingly detached from the level of the Member States and rise to higher, regional and EU levels. I fundamentally welcome this integration, but at the same time it is very important that, in the process, we do not forget one of the European Union's greatest competitive advantages, the strength of the diversity of different nations.
