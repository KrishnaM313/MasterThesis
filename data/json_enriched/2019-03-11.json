Mr President, I want to talk about the agenda and we want to make the following proposal by ECR: the natural disaster that hit the regional unit of Chania in Crete, on the weekend of 24-25 February, caused enormous damage to public infrastructure and private property. I have already visited the affected areas twice and the area of Chania looks like a bombed landscape; bridges damaged, roads opened in two, extensive landslides, rural and livestock units destroyed.  Last week at the technical meeting, the ECR had requested that the issue of compensation for damage and compensation for those affected by natural disasters in the regional unit of Chania be added to the plenary agenda for discussion. We are therefore proposing today, since this request has not been accepted by the other political groups, because the agenda was supposedly saturated, so we propose, today Monday, that this issue be added and that a resolution be adopted to take measures to support those affected by the natural disaster in the regional unit of Chania, as well as to take disaster recovery measures. I think it is a sign of solidarity with our tested fellow citizens in the regional unit of Chania and I call on colleagues to accept the ECR's request, to add as an eighth issue the issue of repairing damage to the regional unit of Chania and to adopt a resolution.

The existing rules make it easier for non-EU nationals to hide crimes they have committed on EU soil than it is for EU nationals. This means that today, under the current European Criminal Records Information System (ECRIS), there is an efficient and effective way to identify previous criminal convictions for EU nationals but not for third-country nationals. At present, officials who suspect a non-EU national has a criminal past can only find those convictions by individually asking all 27 other Member States. This means that previous criminal records are rarely found. It is a gaping legal loophole which leaves people in the EU less safe. This regulation is an important step to close these loopholes and improve information-sharing and cooperation between Member States in the fight against cross-border crime and terrorism. At the core, this is about ensuring judicial authorities have a complete picture when carrying out their work, meaning they can apply sentences fairly. We can all agree that non-EU nationals should not find themselves with more rights than EU citizens in the EU itself. Getting the right balance on this was important to all the groups, especially ensuring that there was no discrimination to EU nationals, who would be included if they had a third-country nationality as well. I believe that we have got this balance right and we won some significant safeguards in those negotiations, particularly regarding fingerprints. Our legal services see no discrimination in the text. This legislation closes the gap, while also providing a fair balance between protecting the rights of individuals and ensuring that past convictions are correctly attributed. We have ensured safeguards on how specific and targeted information can be shared. This is not a database that can simply be browsed through. There is no conviction data stored in the central database and so there is no differentiation of treatment between EU and third-country nationals, as both the EU and the third-country national systems ultimately result in the same outcome, i.e. that Member States’ judicial authorities are able to request previous criminal conviction information from the relevant Member State so that that can be taken into account for the sentencing of new convictions. Critically, the inclusion of dual nationals in this system means that nationals of both a third-country and an EU Member State can’t hide their past criminal convictions in the EU simply by disclosing only one of their passports. Let me be clear here as there is some misunderstanding, especially within the ALDE Group. This is for EU convictions only, so no Turkish convictions or convictions from any other non-EU Member State are involved – it’s only EU convictions. If we don’t have this system, authorities will have to make judgment calls on which system to search, and that would probably mean profiling based on race and name. I don’t believe we want to see that. In addition, the collection of the fingerprints for dual nationals will be exactly the same as for EU nationals. Overall, this is about ensuring judicial authorities have a complete picture in order to react adequately and to apply the right measures. Let me be clear, if colleagues here vote to reopen the deal you are putting your own citizens at risk. You are saying you want to discriminate against EU citizens in the EU, and you admit that you want some people to be able to hide serious criminal convictions, convictions which have been handed down on EU soil. This deal was voted through the LIBE Committee with a considerable majority. The Legal Services of all three institutions agree that there is no discrimination. It is a good agreement.

In particular, let me thank both co—legislators’ unceasing efforts to find a solution that is acceptable for all parties. The Commission proposed the ECRIS—TCN system following the terrorist attacks in Paris in November 2015. The aim was to close loopholes in the existing system for the exchange of criminal records, which is ECRIS, by ensuring better access for Member States’ competent authorities to criminal records of third—country nationals. The proposals were included in the list of 2017 interinstitutional priorities for delivery before the European Parliament elections. With tomorrow’s vote, the European Parliament is delivering on this objective. As a result, we will achieve an improved system for the exchange of criminal records that contributes to the European area of freedom, security and justice. I would like to thank the rapporteur and the shadows in particular for their efforts to solve two main issues: first, the conditions under which fingerprints can be included in the ECRIS—TCN system; second, the inclusion of dual nationals, notably EU citizens who also hold the nationality of a third country. I am satisfied that we have found a balanced solution that is acceptable to all sides and that will ensure that the ECRIS—TCN system fulfils its purpose. The new system will allow the closing of loopholes in information exchange on previous convictions and this will be done on the basis of reliable identity information and with due regard to the rights of the individual.

I would like to thank my colleague Mr Dalton for his work on this document. I believe that the cooperation between the European People's Party and the ECR has been a pillar of our success. I am pleased that, contrary to the Commission's proposal for 2016, the EU institutions are now aiming to create a centralised system. From the outset, I supported the creation of such a system, as the central system excludes technical problems and excludes possible misuse of information. I think it is safe to say that years of work are now over, because both the Commission and the Council have recognised that such a system is a key element of effective law enforcement, especially considering that the Schengen borders are also interoperable for law enforcement. I also think it is important that fingerprints will be part of the identification of third-country offenders, as they are more difficult to identify. Fingerprints are the most reliable way to accurately identify the person. I would like to stress that the security of citizens living in the European Union cannot be negotiable. For this reason, during the negotiations, I strongly advocated that the ECRIS-TCN system should not only cover third-country nationals who do not have EU nationality. I am convinced that all information relating to dual nationals who have the nationality of a third country in addition to the nationality of an EU Member State should be stored. The system must not contain loopholes.

Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating Mr We are now on the final stages of working on these two proposals. It has been a long journey, which has become much more complicated than I first thought.  The basic objective of these proposals – that member states' criminal courts should be able to exchange information on convictions of third-country nationals with each other – is commendable. On the substance, our political group has no objection to the creation of a new information system to address shortcomings in the current system. On the other hand, we have seen problems with how the Commission and also the Council wanted to shape the system. Some of these have been resolved in the course of our work, but the main problem for us has been possible discrimination, and more concrete differences in treatment, between people who have only one European citizenship, people who have European citizenship plus citizenship of a country outside the Union and, finally, third-country nationals. The difference in processing is how many of the databases you are registered in and whether fingerprints should be taken. During the negotiations, we tried, together with alde, the Greens and the GUE, to put forward proposals for solutions based on objective criteria, but unfortunately we have not heard them during the negotiations.  It has also become apparent in the course of the hearing that the Commission had partly objectives other than simply putting in place a system for the exchange of convictions. Instead, what has been focused on is the future use of data in the context of so-called interoperability, that is, the interconnection of the EU information system. In the run-up to a European Parliament election in which far-right and racist parties are likely to move forward, it is important that we do not back down from fundamental principles. I am concerned that we are sending out signals that people who have citizenship of countries outside the Union may be treated differently. At the same time, I am basically in favour of a system for the exchange of convictions, but not in the way proposed.

However, the Ecris database is not suitable for the exchange of information on convicted foreigners.

In concrete terms, the Justice Department must draw up 27 separate applications and send them to each EU Member State, with the result that this cumbersome procedure is barely followed. Foreigners with criminal records are about to walk.  Due to a lack of information, a Belgian court cannot currently take into account previous convictions in other EU Member States. This is an unacceptable gap for us. Foreigners with criminal histories must be dealt with as harshly as Belgians or EU citizens with similar criminal histories. With the proposal before us, we want to adapt European legislation in this way to simplify the exchange of data on condemned non-European citizens. A central database will keep track of which foreigners have been convicted in which Member State, after which the authorities can quickly request additional information. This dossier is an excellent example of the added value that the European Union can offer. The N-VA is satisfied with the outcome of the negotiations.

It has been a long walk that has brought us here today, and I am very sad to tell you that I cannot support the outcome of the trilogue negotiations on the regulation. I am deeply disappointed at the decision to include dual nationals in the ECRIS-TCN system. From the beginning, this was clearly a red line for me as the shadow rapporteur for the ALDE Group in Parliament. It is alarming that the Council has not been able to prove the necessity or the proportionality of such a far-reaching measure. This only proves that their arguments about dual nationals trying to hide their EU nationality are completely unfounded. The significant difference in treatment between EU nationals, non-EU nationals and dual nationals introduced by the proposal is clearly discriminatory. It has been described as differentiated treatment: with all due respect, that is a description for alternative facts. ECRIS-TCN, as proposed now, fails to respect fundamental rights and non-discrimination and it also violates primary Union law. If the proposal is adopted as it stands it will result, for the first time, in a large category of Union citizens being treated under Union law no longer as Union citizens but as nationals of third countries. De facto, this proposal will introduce the idea of first-class and second-class Union citizens.

ECRIS is not about mass surveillance, but about the retrievability of data on convicted criminals. This index already exists for EU citizens. It is only logical to finally set it up for third-country nationals who have been convicted in the EU. And yet, in the end, we will not be able to support the result. ECRIS for third-country nationals, as it is now to be decided, and as Mr Dalton negotiated with the Council against the mandate of most LIBE coordinators, does not lead to equal treatment for third-country nationals, but to double unequal treatment: while FINGERPRINTs are only recorded in ECRIS by EU citizens if they have already accrued in the course of the investigation, the fingerprints of third-country nationals should always be taken from a certain threshold. This has a system and is another building block of a comprehensive biometrics database of all third-country nationals, which we not only categorically reject. Dual nationals, i.e. people who hold both EU citizenship and those of a third country, are to be included in ECRIS and ECRIS-TCN. So, \"as a precaution,\" they end up in two databases instead of one.

We recognise that this establishes a different approach between EU citizens who only have an EU nationality and those also holding the nationality of a third country. However, we consider this is justified by the fact that the latter can use either of these nationalities when confronted with a prosecution, or in other cases where their previous criminal record might hamper them. For example, if the persons concerned had already been convicted for a sexual offence under their TCN nationality, they might use only their EU nationality when applying for a position involving working with children in another Member State. Excluding persons with EU/third-country nationality would mean that the identity data of certain persons with a criminal record, who hold the nationality of a third country, would not be stored in the ECRIS—TCN system.

Here we are again with an even stronger youth programme. Our task was complicated by the fact that we could not rely on implementation data from the ongoing European Solidarity Corps as such data was not available. However, with the help of stakeholders, we were able to identify areas which could be further improved. I am also glad that all political groups maintained the same shadow rapporteurs so we could continue with our previous excellent cooperation, and I would like to thank them for this. Some 332 amendments were tabled and four committees issued opinions, so there were many ideas on the table. Despite this, we managed to achieve a broad majority and the final report was approved with only one vote against and one abstention. The Commission proposal provides us with a budget of EUR 1 260 000 000, which we endorsed. It is necessary in order to meet the objective of activities for over 350 000 participants over the course of seven years. It is also needed since the European Solidarity Corps will newly integrate the former EU Aid Volunteers programme, providing possibilities to volunteer in third countries struck by a humanitarian crisis. Volunteering and humanitarian aid should enable participants to express their solidarity in more ways, and the EU to express more solidarity towards third counties. In order to be successful, the European Solidarity Corps needs greater visibility. During discussions with young people, I realised that most of them, even if involved in youth organisations, are still not aware of the programme, so this is where ambassadors could be of help. Former participants could share their experience with other young people in schools, youth organisations and other gatherings, thus spreading awareness and encouraging others to participate. The programme should also be promoted through dynamic means such as social media. We also propose a European Solidarity Corps ‘Infoday’, which would serve to reinforce promotion activities. In order to increase the programme’s visibility, it is also necessary to attract more organisations active in the solidarity field and encourage them to become participating organisations. We must not, however, sacrifice quality for quantity. Activities must be high quality and meet the expectations and needs of young people. It is important that quality labels are differentiated too. It’s crucial to empower stakeholders. We should give them more space to engage in the implementation of the programme. We must not forget that the European Solidarity Corps was designed as a programme for young people. Therefore, in principle, the programme should remain open to people up to the age of 30. I respect that humanitarian aid should allow participation regardless of age. However, the aim of the programme is to empower youth so other solidarity activities must stay limited to the participation of young people. We have to give greater thought to ensuring that the programme is also accessible to people with fewer opportunities. I am convinced that together we have set a very good basis for the negotiations with the Council. Many practical aspects of the programme will be determined through implementation, so I am also counting on the Commission’s dedication and continuous support. For me, the European Solidarity Corps is a springboard for volunteering in the EU. I believe that volunteering should be mainstreamed through the other EU programmes.

Mr President, the establishment of the European Solidarity Corps will be the cornerstone of European solidarity and volunteering and will develop the spirit of solidarity and volunteering among European young people. The ESE Programme offers young people the opportunity to participate in solidarity programmes to address social challenges in the field of humanitarian aid.  Our recommendation, however, is that the 30-year age limit should not be applied in the field of humanitarian aid, to allow more experienced people to assist in the effort, because it often requires special training and knowledge before taking office. There are also concerns about the distribution of the budget in the various aspects and, for this reason, we, on behalf of the Committee on Development, have tabled amendments to this end in order to ensure adequate funding for all humanitarian aid activities.

This programme is still quite young but it is growing quickly and young people across Europe are keen to get involved. The European Solidarity Corps has the potential to become another iconic programme like Erasmus. Solidarity among citizens and Member States is one of the key values on which our Union is built. The European Solidarity Corps offers young people opportunities to live that solidarity and to experience what being European feels like, and they are eager to take these opportunities. One hundred and thirteen thousand young people have now signed up for this initiative. Almost 12 000 of these have already started their solidarity activities. This proves that the programme is responding to a clear demand on the ground. Young people are making a real difference, supporting individuals and whole communities in need. This is why, in June 2018, the Commission proposed to continue and further expand the European Solidarity Corps under the next multiannual financial framework. We want to keep the main thrust of the current programme, but extend its scope after 2020 so that we can also support humanitarian aid operations beyond the EU’s borders. I want to express my thanks for the great dedication with which the rapporteur – Ms Šojdrová –, and the shadow rapporteurs have taken this work forward. I would also like to thank Ms Theocarous for her work as the rapporteur in the Development Committee, particularly looking at the new humanitarian aid operations. The Commission welcomes the strong support of the European Parliament for the proposal and takes note of the amendments that it put forward. I am very pleased to see that we have common ground on almost all aspects of the programme.  One important point where we differ and where we still need to find agreement is the new humanitarian aid stand and, more specifically, your wish to open it up to people of all ages.  Let me underline that the European Solidarity Corps is a youth programme, designed specifically to offer fresh opportunities to the young generation, to invest in their development, their skills, their dreams, and the idea is to bring all of these opportunities together in one place. In fact, the activities of the programme are limited to young people aged up to 30 for good reason: to help them in their transition to adulthood and independence and to the labour market, while obtaining a solidarity experience. Thirty is not an arbitrary age limit; it is based on evidence. Above this age, the vast majority of people have settled in their professional and private life. The demand is already high in the age group up to 30. Removing the age limit would mean taking away opportunities for young people and we risk job substitution. Moreover, the activities falling under the new humanitarian aid strand will account for only 4 500 of the 350 000 opportunities that we want to offer under the European Solidarity Corps over 7 years, and only 500 of these are expected to be taken up by people above 30. Introducing different eligibility criteria for such a small share of activities would lead to disproportionate extra administrative costs and make the programme more complicated, threatening to shut out those who we want to benefit most: young people. I would therefore plead with you to keep the European Solidarity Corps a real youth programme. Having said this, the Commission would be keen to start negotiating with you right away, as is the Council. This is my personal commitment and offer to you. I’m ready to work with you towards an agreement before the end of the current parliamentary term. Partial first reading agreements have already been reached for quite a number of future programmes. It would be a pity if the European Solidarity Corps, this new flagship programme for young people, were to be left behind. I am sure that the good compromise we reached on the current regulation only very recently would greatly facilitate negotiations. A swift agreement would help the Commission to make all the preparations to ensure that the programme can be fully and effectively implemented right from the start of 2021, but most importantly, it would send a clear signal to Europe’s young generation that investing in them remains a priority for us, and that we want to do what we can to enable them to make the most of their lives and build a better Europe for the future.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": null}, {"id": 58, "date": "2019-03-11.json", "name": "Tiemo WÖLKEN", "mepid": "185619", "text": "  Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets.

Two very strong messages.  The face of Europe is also decidedly that of volunteering, solidarity and active citizenship. And this must once again be a watchword of the European Union, especially from the new generations. We must make this experience stable over the next 7 years, which had already begun in recent years and which had included the European voluntary service, which in twenty years had, however, involved one hundred thousand young people. We certainly want to be bolder. With tomorrow's vote on the establishment of the European Solidarity Corps, for which I was shadow rapporteur in the Group of the Party of European Socialists and European Socialists, we are taking an important step forward because we are going to establish a stable Union programme within the framework of the next MFF and I hope that the Council of Ministers will accept the proposal – also in terms of budget – that Parliament has made. Almost all will be devoted (almost 86 %) of its budget for voluntary activities, active citizenship and solidarity for young people between the ages of 18 and 30, 8 % of the quota will go to traineeships and work, but in the context of non-profit activities, and 6 % will go to humanitarian aid, collecting an important inheritance, without an age limit similar to the other. This is a political step, which we really must tell young people who do not know it. I think it is important to think about the fact that, symbolically, this will be of the utmost importance. I remember. I met them, as the Commissioner met them, in Norcia, after a terrible earthquake: a nucleus of young volunteers from twelve countries – it had enormous significance. More than 70 000 young people have already registered on the dedicated online portal; 7 000 are already participating in social inclusion, migrant integration, support for local communities and cultural heritage. It is important that for the next seven years the budget has been increased to more than one billion, confirming as a political priority this fundamental value of the European Union, in order to respond above all to the needs of society, communities, promoting the personal and professional development of young people, civic, with particular attention to the most disadvantaged. That is why we wanted to make it more inclusive, for children with fewer opportunities, for example those who have disabilities, health, difficulties even in the school field or come from a migratory context or from marginalized communities.  I am very pleased that some very important aspects have been taken up. The first is the European dimension of experience: all these activities must be transnational in nature, they must not overlap with national voluntary schemes but, on the contrary, they must support countries that do not need to achieve this. Country activities must also have this transnational dimension.  And then, above all, we have expanded to social enterprises and organizations also private, but always for non-profit activities and with the possibility of having a diversified quality mark for the types of insertion.  I will end by saying that this is a new experience that gathers the best in the past, but that it also wants to have the will to build a citizenship from below. I think that today we need to talk a lot about this, about institutional reforms of Europe, about political integration and about building processes of active citizenship.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 62, "date": "2019-03-11.json", "name": "Izaskun BILBAO BARANDICA", "mepid": "96922", "text": "  on behalf of the ALDE Group. – Mr President, Commissioner, the European Solidarity Corps in its new version as a one-stop shop which brings together all the possibilities for young Europeans to participate in solidarity programmes is a reality that we will be proud of in a few years.

Thus, the noblest values on which our Union is founded will be systematically converted into facts. Our young people are going to contribute to the cohesion of our society, they will help the people who need them, they will know other realities that will make them more aware, more supportive, they will be vaccinated against stereotypes and prejudices, and they will acquire skills that will help them as citizens and in their possibilities of employability.

I also advocate improving the quality and accuracy of the certifications obtained by the participants and I propose that in this concept, \"participants\", be included the companions who highlight the civil organizations that make possible the operation of this program.

They learn languages, they get to know other countries. They learn empathy and they learn to hold the European Union together and, at the same time, to do something for themselves.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has I would like to begin by thanking all the rapporteurs from the political groups for their good cooperation or intensive cooperation in the trialogue with the Commission. From the refrigerator to the coffee maker to the pacemaker, from the energy networks to the telecommunications networks to the transport infrastructure – everything will be connected to everything in the future. What does this mean for us, ladies and gentlemen? For us, this means that cybersecurity must be one of the top political priorities in Europe. You may remember that two years ago we had wannaCry a major cyberattack. More than 200 000 IT systems across Europe have been affected, there has been anger in the United Kingdom, hospitals have been affected, in Germany the scoreboards of Deutsche Bahn have been suspended and some telecoms companies in Spain have been paralysed. So you can see what such a Europe-wide international cyberattack can have for dramatic consequences. I think we are well advised to prepare as Europeans for attacks of this kind. In view of what we have already achieved in recent years in terms of cybersecurity in Europe, particularly with the help of the European Parliament, I believe that we are quite well equipped. There is a European cybersecurity strategy, we adopted the Critical Infrastructure Directive a few years ago, we will adopt the Cyber Security Act tomorrow, and we will network competence centres in Europe and also build a European cyber competence centre. This is precisely the right answer to these international challenges. So what is the Cybersecurity Act about? Well, firstly, to strengthen our European cybersecurity agency ENISA. I am pleased that the Commission has made a bold proposal to increase this very enISA agency, both in terms of personnel and funding, and we here in Parliament wanted to give the European agency even more powers. This was also one of the critical points in the debate, in the discussion with the Member States. We want to have strong national cybersecurity competence centers. However, we in Parliament were particularly concerned about strengthening ENISA, our European cybersecurity agency, in other words, that it is not only involved in greater coordination between national security agencies, but also has independent competences, particularly in the area of certification. We want to create a European roll-out of certification frameworks in Europe. This is also a huge advantage for our domestic industry, if you do not just have certification in one country, but if the framework is given accordingly throughout Europe. It was important for us in Parliament that security levels be introduced for smart devices, for smart products, services and systems, and for us it was also important that in future there should be product information for consumers for these smart devices, for these smart devices. We think the consumer needs to know if their device is safe. We think that the consumer also needs to know how to safely adjust his device. All this is now in the proposal. We are happy that this was taken up in the trialogue. Personally, I would have liked to have gone one step further here. I would have imagined that it makes sense for critical infrastructures to also impose mandatory certification frameworks. I believe that we have now reached a good compromise. As a first step at ENISA, we will determine in which area it makes sense to make such certifications mandatory with a long-running annual programme. I also believe that this is a sensible next step. The next steps will follow. Cybersecurity is a mega-important issue, especially for us in the European Union. I am pleased that we have also been able to reach such a good compromise in rapid discussions with the Council and with the Commission as a Parliament. I hope that it will be adopted tomorrow by a large majority.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 82, "date": "2019-03-11.json", "name": "Julia REDA", "mepid": "124816", "text": "  Rapporteur. – Madam President, today we are also debating the proposal establishing the European Cybersecurity Industrial, Technology and Research Competence Centre, and establishing the Network of National Coordination Centres. By coordinating the implementation of the cybersecurity programmes from Digital Europe and Horizon Europe, the Centre will complement the work of the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA) and increase the competitiveness of the European cybersecurity industry and research. With the Reda report we are acknowledging that cybersecurity is not a status that can be achieved by buying a certain product. Information and communications technology (ICT) evolves constantly and so do the threats. It requires constant efforts to make our infrastructure, communication and information systems more secure. Cybersecurity is a process that continues throughout the life cycle of a product, but the most secure product is not enough if we fail to secure the underlying infrastructure. The report welcomes as an advantage that businesses and expertise are distributed across Europe. We embrace the wealth of knowledge and potential of our unique ecosystem of small and medium—sized cybersecurity companies. In addition to this, we involve the broader cybersecurity community in Europe. This community ranges from researchers in academia to individual entrepreneurs, but we also want to connect to actors in consumer associations and include the crucial contribution of civil society initiatives, including those of ethical hackers. The proposal for a cybersecurity competence centre gives the unique opportunity to shape the future of cybersecurity in Europe. The fact that expertise is distributed across the Union is a strength, but also a challenge to connect them in projects. For those reasons we are encouraging collaborative approaches and investment in free and open-source software and open hardware. Businesses throughout Europe are struggling to fulfil their demand for skilled workers. In the ICT industry each unemployed worker is matched with approximately 1.5 open jobs. Clearly businesses cannot afford to ignore half of society in their search for potential. The report therefore wants to achieve a more balanced and diverse workforce in ICT and also in the governance structures of the Cybersecurity Competence Centre because it is good for business, and even more so, because it is in the interest of equality. In the past months and years there has been one debate gaining more and more public attention. It is the debate about the consequences that decisions taken by the digital industry have for society at large. We cannot ignore this debate in our cybersecurity research. The Cybersecurity Competence Centre needs to take into account what societal and ethical implications its projects may have and anticipate the concerns its actions may raise. We must not take a narrow view of cybersecurity research by only involving computer scientists. Instead, social scientists and ethicists must have a seat at the table. Thanks to the ambitious work of all colleagues involved, the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE) has found a solid and balanced report. We all agree on the European Union’s crucial task of promoting democracy, the rule of law, human rights and fundamental freedoms worldwide. That is why we need to be very clear in respect of the Treaties when it comes to the funding of technology that can be used for military applications. Therefore, I would like to ask you to make it even clearer and to support my plenary amendments to underline that, when it comes to defence, the Centre’s role should be to facilitate the resilience—building initiatives against cybersecurity threats such as the protection of critical infrastructure. The Cybersecurity Competence Centre should have no role in developing and building cyber-weapons. There is no question that some of the technologies have applications beyond just the civilian sphere, for example, cryptography. Fortunately, we can rely and build upon the existing frameworks for the control of dual-use technology that this House has already helped create.

They will reinforce EU cybersecurity structures and improve our collective resilience to combat cyber-attacks in a mutually supportive and coordinated way, as part of building the digital single market. Firstly, on the Cybersecurity Act, the Commission fully supports the political agreement reached by the co-legislators. This agreement is the result of good cooperation between the co-legislators on the future of ENISA, the European Agency for Cybersecurity, and on setting up a cybersecurity certification framework for the digital single market. It will strengthen the regulation in several important areas. In particular, it puts in place a clear, open and robust EU framework for cybersecurity certification. The European Union will be able to agree certification schemes that are fit for purpose, keep our citizens safe and businesses resilient, and meet the needs of both the regulators and markets. It will provide ENISA with a permanent, stronger mandate to contribute to the cybersecurity of the EU. ENISA is already using its expertise in cybersecurity exercises to help prepare securing the upcoming European Parliament elections. Secondly, and equally importantly, I would like to strongly welcome the report on the cybersecurity competence centre and network of national coordination centres proposal. This proposal is a key element for building a secure European digital single market. It responds to the urgent need to build up our cybersecurity capabilities. It uses the excellent research carried out in Horizon 2020 and the future Horizon year. It is in Europe’s strategic interests to make sure that EU industries are at the cutting edge in developing next-generation cybersecurity and digital technologies. We have proposed the digital year programme to finance the development of new cybersecurity capabilities in Europe, and to invest with the Member States and the private sector in their deployment across the European Union. With a planned network of national coordination centres, we want to make sure that Member States bring together all relevant parties involved in developing new cybersecurity capabilities for the digital single market, the public and private sectors, as well as academia. I’m delighted that the European Parliament’s report shares our vision on the future of European cybersecurity and technologies and the importance of ensuring access to these financial means, based on priorities agreed between all relevant stakeholders. The Parliament has worked hard on this file in a very short time and I’m grateful for this. By strengthening Europe’s cybersecurity capabilities across the entire digital technology value chain, we are ensuring that the digital single market, that we have built together, will be strong and resilient to cyber-threats.

Article 48a, which the LIBE Committee wanted to insert on this, would have been an important step in this area. For the first time, it would have introduced a mandatory minimum standard of IT security for all connected devices offered on the European market. We are always talking about greater security here in Parliament, and here we would have the opportunity to avoid security gaps that many citizens are not even aware of, because unsafe devices can very easily be hacked and then used to attack other devices or security-related infrastructure. A comparison: we do not issue type-approval for cars whose brakes or clutches are only tested voluntarily and for which there are no minimum standards.  Ladies and gentlemen, we MEPs have recognised the problem. It is not for nothing that we are discussing security aspects for our mobile networks this week. We only need to tackle it seriously – at the latest at the next revision of the ENISA regulation, or even before that in the Product Liability Directive or in the revision of the CE label.

First, we have a double budget of the European Cybersecurity Agency, we have its permanent mandate and we have our own technical capabilities of THE ENISA, which I hope are only a first step in the right direction and the ERISA will yet have even more serious technical capabilities and the opportunity to help each Member State. I would also like to express, unlike the other rapporteurs, my satisfaction that there will be voluntary certification, as I have noticed the temptation to have mandatory certification to be used as a market advantage for some companies over others, and not so much as a concern for consumers. I would like to mark two controversial moments in the legislation on national competence centres. One is the text which currently states that only bodies established within the Union and natural persons residing within the Union can be accredited as members of that community, and that I mean does not entitles third-country subsidiaries that meet the criteria and have cybersecurity expertise. If we want to build cybersecurity, it cannot be built solely on the territory of the European Union. We have also given powers to the ESISA on research needs and similar powers are also given in regulation for competence centres.

This is indicated by the data. As you know, households around the world have about five billion internet-connected devices. Some predict that this number is expected to rise to fifteen billion by 2021. Manufacturers are introducing new devices, new models of goods that are connected to the Internet, while the installation of appropriate security measures does not go hand in hand. We know that a single-home hacking attack can already cause big problems for owners, but at the same time it is also the case that such an attack on multiple devices can also be used by cyber criminals as a tool to attack the strategic infrastructure of the state. Researchers at Princeton University conducted simulations that showed that a sudden 30 percent jump in electricity demand could effectively shut down all generators in the attacked area, so the safety of private homes is also linked to strategic security. For example, 90,000 internet-connected air conditioners or eight thousand water boilers are enough to take over, the researchers write.

I think the agreement achieves what we want it to achieve, and will help protect us against cyber-attacks. A robust EU cybersecurity strategy is vital to enable us to repel any cyber-attacks against our energy supplies, aviation sector, commercial sectors or governments. Hackers are now targeting sensitive sectors for criminal and terrorist purposes, and this is a real concern. Thankfully, the work that has been done on this proposal, and the agreement reached will go a long way to ensuring that such concerns are addressed. We hear about data breaches, malware and online financial scams on a regular basis now, and about more and more sophisticated plots. We must be ready to defend crucial infrastructure, such as energy grids, plants and industry, against sinister attacks from criminals or terrorists. Shutting down electricity grids on a large scale for a prolonged time could cause massive disruption and economic damage. I welcome the strengthened role for the European Union Agency for Network and Information Security (ENISA), and indeed my own country has the potential to be a cybersecurity hub for Europe. Ireland is world renowned as a high-tech country with a skilled workforce and it is already home to the largest, biggest tech companies. Companies like VMware in Cork can do an awful lot to prevent cyber-attacks. We have the expertise readily available to develop more cybersecurity services quickly and to become the global leader in securing personal and financial information online.

This is the next important step after the NIS directive to strengthen cyber security in the European Union that protects both our economy and our society, but also our democracy. Every day we have cyberattacks, many of which come from third countries and our digital economy is evolving exponentially and these attacks will also evolve exponentially. It is therefore very important to strengthen the European Union in dealing with tools and policies, but not only in cooperation, but also in coordination between Member States and in the exchange of information, because cyber security is a moving objective. ENISA, therefore, based in Greece, is an important part of this effort. With the passage of the EU Cybersecurity Act it is greatly strengthened, acquires increased powers and is staffed with experts to deal with cyber-attacks. However, we must continue and substantially complete investments in cyber security, supporting innovation and through the European Union's financial instruments – we are investing around 2 billion for 2021-2027.  I believe that it is on the right track and I hope that the new regulation on security centres and networks, which we are also voting on, will also be completed and the trilogue will begin, so that with this composition of the European Parliament we can actually complete this strategic plan for cyber security.

The Cybersecurity Act will create a flexible and market-oriented cybersecurity certification framework and give a permanent mandate to ENISA.

We have a collective responsibility to ensure that risks are properly addressed and that digital products and services are cyber-secure throughout their lifetime. The Cybersecurity Act is one of the building blocks for the EU’s cyber-resilience, along with the Network and Information Security Directive. The Cybersecurity Competence Centre and Network will be key to make sure that we have European capacities to protect the digital single market. Cybersecurity expertise centres located across EU countries should now have adequate resources facilitated by the European Cybersecurity Competence Centre. We now need to transform that expertise and experience into innovative cybersecurity products and services, and support their uptake across the economy. We must strengthen the European cybersecurity ecosystem, provide Europe with the means to autonomously secure its digital assets and to compete on the global technology markets. This requires coordinated work, both nationally and EU-wide, combining efforts from both the public and private sectors, so that we achieve significant progress. I am very grateful for the rapid pace of the legislative work on the Competence Centre and Network.

To name but a few: the extension of the scope, which now protects 100 % of farmers and more than 95 % of the Union's agri-food holdings, with the increase from EUR 50 million to EUR 350 million in turnover; the inclusion of buyers based outside the Union among those who will have to comply with the Directive; the inclusion of all agricultural and not only food products, protecting strategic sectors such as floro-nursery and feed, feed for pets; the strengthening and doubling of prohibited practices, from 8 to 16, including, for example, late payment for non-perishable products, refusal to grant written contracts, or the threat of commercial retaliation in the event of a complaint; the better safeguarding of the confidentiality of the complainant's identity, in order to overcome the fear factor that all too often obliges our producers to accept these practices, with the right of complaint extended to all associations; the obligation to act and to put an end to unfair practices for national law enforcement authorities, to which we have also guaranteed greater powers both in the investigative phase and in terms of sanctions; not forgetting the enhanced cooperation between the various national authorities, which will have to meet at least once a year and exchange information and good practices in order to ensure the most uniform and ambitious application of the directive possible. It is worth remembering that this is in fact a question of minimum harmonisation, and that The Member States will be able to provide in their national legislation both for the extension of the parties involved and for the list of unfair practices to be banned. In order to achieve this result, ladies and gentlemen, in just eleven months from the publication of the Commission's proposal to date, despite the various attempts to block this directive once again, it has taken a strong political will on the part of all. That is why I would like to thank all those who have made this possible, starting, of course, with my colleagues in the Commission, starting with Commissioner Hogan, whom I thank, the shadow rapporteurs, the entire European Parliament negotiating team, the services, the Austrian Presidency, Minister Elisabeth Kostinger, President-in-Office of the Council, not forgetting the fundamental work done by all the technical groups and, of course, also by my team.   Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this directive is a Europe that shows that it can stand shoulder to shoulder with the weakest economic operators, such as farmers, and with all citizens. A supply chain characterized by unfair behaviour and therefore by an inefficient distribution of resources puts pressure on all producers, in a race to the bottom of prices that depresses both the quality of the products that arrive on the tables of families and citizens, and the quality of the production process, encouraging labour exploitation and unsustainable production practices. On the contrary, by overcoming these distortions within the agri-food chain, the directive will be a point of reference for achieving more transparent and fair markets, more efficient markets capable of generating benefits for society as a whole, and especially for consumers.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 115, "date": "2019-03-11.json", "name": "Marc TARABELLA", "mepid": "29579", "text": "  rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection. Mr President, Commissioner, this directive is undoubtedly one of the great advances of this Parliament.

This pressure on prices from the markets is one of the causes of the current suffering of the agricultural world, while European food must be a top priority. This long-awaited directive abolishes unfair trade practices in the food supply chain, while enhancing transparency and combating the blackmail of multinationals. In this regard, I would like to warmly welcome the excellent work of my colleague and friend Paolo De Castro, with whom we worked together in a very tight time to ensure that this text, which is so important to our farmers, is finalised before the end of this mandate.

What this debate and the vote represent is an acknowledgment that, for far too long, the farmer and other smaller operators in our food supply chain have been disadvantaged by their relative weakness; but, more importantly, what this debate and the vote will deliver is protection for these farmers and suppliers of agri-food products further downstream. Many Members of this House have been consistent and vocal in calling for greater protection for the position of farmers in the agri-food supply chain – and rightly so. Without that influence, I have no doubt in saying, today might never have happened. I am pleased therefore that the Commission – and, of course, a very good Commissioner for Agriculture – could finally, and for the first time, response positively with a legislative proposal to ban certain unfair trading practices. Before reflecting briefly on the contents of the directive on which you are about to vote, I want to congratulate the rapporteurs for Parliament and the Austrian Council Presidency for their efforts in reaching these landmark achievements – particularly Mr De Castro, for Parliament, and Ms Köstinger and the Austrian team on behalf of the Council. I would like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs and all the other committee people who have been involved: Mr Tarabella, on behalf of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection; Ms McAvan on behalf of the Committee on Development; and Ms Pilar Ayuso on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection. I would include, as well, the shadow rapporteurs, Ms McGuinness and Ms McIntyre, and Maria Heubuch, Elsi Katainen, Matt Carthy, Marco Zullo and Jacques Colombier. All of you have played a remarkable part in ensuring that we are discussing this milestone legislation here this evening. It’s worth recalling, as Mr De Castro has done, that only eight months passed between the adoption of the Commission’s proposal in April and the conclusion of the political agreement in December, so it demonstrates very clearly that if there is the political will a lot can happen in almost all respects in this House. It will now be up to the Member States to transpose the directive, and I want to assure you that the Commission will follow this process carefully and closely and I trust that this House will do so as well. The final agreement is one that safeguards our initial objectives and our rationale behind the legislation, which is to protect the weak from possible abuses of buyer power by the strong. For the first time, rules will be introduced at a European level that target unfair trading practices and provide protection for all EU farmers, as well as most agri-food businesses, against practices that are contrary to good faith and fair dealing. The directive will introduce a minimum EU level of protection against unfair trading practices that occur in the food supply chain. That level will apply in all the Member States – which will remain free to go further, subject to internal market rules. For the first time, there will be a ban on 16 unfair trading practices which are imposed unilaterally by one trading partner on another. Other practices will be permitted only if they are subject to a clear and unambiguous upfront agreement between the parties involved. The agreement that we reached in December will apply to anyone involved in the food supply chain with a turnover of EUR 350 million, with differentiated levels of protection provided below that threshold. It is important to see this directive as part of a wider initiative to strengthen the position of farmers in the food supply chain. Indeed, the Agricultural Markets Task Force, under former Minister for Agriculture Cees Veerman, called for a better legal framework on producer cooperation, as well as improved market transparency. I am pleased to be able to tell the House, and to be able to report to you, that we have also achieved significant progress in these two areas through the Omnibus Regulation, in which Parliament was instrumental, including with the involvement of Mr De Castro and Mr Dess, and through the development of our market observatories. As you are aware, the Commission is working too on a proposal to extend our transparency initiative to cover the processing and retail sector end of the food supply chain and I expect to be in a position very shortly to announce more details of this initiative. Together, these three policy adaptations will allow farmers to seize greater opportunities as they present themselves in a market-orientated environment, and to defend themselves against market failures. In conclusion, can I reiterate my appreciation to all the Members of the House, to the rapporteurs in particular, and to the Austrian Presidency, which has shown very strong support for this initiative that will protect not only the interests but in some cases the very survival of our farmers, as Mr Tarabella has said.

I would therefore first of all like to congratulate the Commission on having made this proposal, as well as the Council and Mr Paolo De Castro, as well as all the shadow rapporteurs who have been able to carry it forward.  Even though the European Parliament's position was much stricter than we finally achieved, I think we are going to reach a very good agreement for farmers and for agriculture in general. In Spain we have a law of the food chain and I can assure you that it works very well.  It is true that some objectives have not been achieved— such as the inclusion of loss sales within prohibited practices—but others that you yourself have mentioned and which are very important.

You, as Commissioner, took it seriously and came forward with a proposal. So thank you for that. I think it is very significant. Of course, it will be tested in the Member States. I do welcome your comments that you will keep a close eye on implementation, because I see already in some Member States a hesitancy, questioning how it will be done. It’s got to be done without too much bureaucracy, and it’s got to be effective so that those with a genuine complaint can come forward and get results. But for me today is much bigger than the sum total of those unfair trading practices that will be banned. This is about the sustainability of the food-supply chain and we hear a great deal about that – about the challenge of climate, biodiversity, air quality and water quality. I think Mr De Castro was very right when he said that the current system operates in a very incorrect way. It results in a race to the bottom because farmers’ margins are constantly being tightened. So I very much welcome this as a first step towards a more sustainable food-supply chain. I read comments from Arla, who talk about their drive for more sustainable farming, where they say that consumers are willing to reward the most sustainable dairy farmers. I hope that is the case and that those who are dealing between consumers and farmers ensure that the farmers get a sustainable price for the work that they do. I had Irish dairy representatives over last week in Brussels and we spoke about issues around welfare and environment, and the challenges generally. They pleaded, because they said that the farmer is not getting rewarded sufficiently to deliver on all of those things. So tonight is a first step. Thank you, Commissioner.

The number of unfair practices is increasing significantly, with eight more practices than the Commission's proposal, ranging from last-minute cancellation of orders to late payments, unilateral changes to contract changes to non-payments to suppliers for unsold goods by large purchasing power plants. One of the strengths is undoubtedly the anonymous complaint in defence of the confidentiality of the supplier during the investigative procedure not only with regard to his identity, but also with regard to all other information that the supplier himself identifies as sensitive.

I would like to thank our rapporteur Paolo De Castro and my fellow shadows, and Commissioner Hogan, for all the work they have put into this directive to deliver fairer treatment for our farmers. At Parliament’s insistence, the directive now includes all agricultural produce not just food. So that means that cut flowers, which are just as perishable as fruit and veg, are covered. We also extended the threshold so that suppliers with a turnover of up to EUR 350 million will be protected. That means all EU farmers are covered, and all producer organisations in the UK are covered too. I am also glad that the directive covers suppliers who are outside the EU, so not only will farmers in Kenya and Peru be protected, but in a post-Brexit world, UK farmers and growers will continue to be protected while selling into the EU.

Producers with profitability problems will be given concrete confirmation of their position on the food market by the directive. This is an important message from the EU – precisely for producers who are increasingly required and who have been subjected to regrettable cuts. As a farmer myself, I know that the result is wanted on the market rather than on aid. I have often been asked what this directive means in concrete terms for the farmer. There are three things that could be summed up. Firstly, producers can also complain to the domestic supervisory authority about the activities of buyers located in other countries. This significantly lowers the threshold for food exports. Secondly, the directive creates a strong guiding effect, because sanctions will follow if the rules are not complied with.

I would also like to thank Paolo de Castro and all those involved for the really good cooperation. It is important to me that Europe does not stop here, because not all the problems have been solved by a long way. Farmers, but also the workers in the fields, in the greenhouses, the workers in the slaughterhouses and the small food processors are under pressure from different sides, not only from the side of the supermarket chains, but also from the side of the upstream sector – if I think only of the seed, fertilizer, feed or pesticide industries. And it is precisely in all these industries that we are seeing an increasing concentration of power. The merger of Bayer and Monsanto is just the latest example. In order for farms to be able to generate a fair income through their work, this concentration of power must be combated, both in the upstream and in the downstream sectors, and this can only be done by reforming competition law.

This directive is a necessary act to restore balance in the commercial chain, providing protection for those who, because of their small size, are all too often at risk of being crushed by the abuses of larger players. The lack of bargaining power obliges many small businesses to sell their products under unfair terms, by suffering economic agreements that impoverish and by taking on the costs and risks of companies of others. Thanks now to clear rules at European level, all those commercial practices put in place by unscrupulous economic actors that end up crushing small and honest farmers are unequivocally condemned. Once and for all, unfair commercial practices such as unilateral and retroactive changes to supply contracts, commercial retaliation and payment for un rendered services will be stopped and punished.

As a result, additional costs arise, difficulties in the activity. This centralizes the market, eliminates smaller sellers, introduces additional regulations that centralize the market, because centralization is at the hand of the government, because it is easier to control it. The result is, finally, a ban on retail sales to farmers, a weakening of their negotiating position, resulting in unfavourable contracts and low purchase prices.

Maybe he'll explain a lot of problems. Dear! After many years of work by the Committee on Agriculture, we can finally announce that we have a European legal framework to combat unfair practices in the food supply chain. I would like to thank Commissioner Hogan for his proposal for a directive and the rapporteur Paolo De Castro, shadow rapporteurs, for their work, which has allowed an exceptionally smooth agreement to be reached and adopted later in this term. It is also impossible not to mention Mrs McGuinness, who three years ago prepared an opinion for our committee, which was subsequently supported by a plenum. Thank you to many, many others.  I would like to point out one of the reasons for the poor position of the farmer in the food chain, which is the high fragmentation of agricultural producers. It is estimated that only less than 10% of farms have the opportunity to compete with the economic size of the market. This is why it is so important to improve market power that agricultural producers merge through producer organisations and cooperatives. The large number of small farms does not facilitate the creation of structured economic structures, such as producer groups.  I want to raise the need for economic dialogue between the actors in the food chain. It seems that representatives of the agricultural, processing and trade sectors are more likely to talk through the media than directly. I think that this task should lie with the European Commission and also with Parliament.  Finally, this directive is a major compromise that Commissioner Hogan has reached in the European Commission. Compromises, like these compromises, do not always solve many problems. We have a good start. Finally, there are possibilities for national legislation that can go further and solve many problems.

I wouldn’t have expected anything less of Paolo De Castro than the report he has brought forward, but I also congratulate all involved on the remarkable speed with which this agreement was reached. The dominant bargaining power of large operators in the food supply chain has left farmers squeezed between the processors and the large multiples. Unfair trading practices have been a continuous problem for farmers across Europe and it is sensible to introduce extra protection for farmers. I am pleased this will be done in conjunction with already existing frameworks in Member States. For too long, we have seen – and continue to see – power concentrated in the hands of the buyers. This has resulted in an uneven playing field whereby farmers have had little influence to exert in the marketplace and been subject to unfair practices to cut their margins when you look at the fact that across Europe, farmers receive an average of 21% of the final price of the agricultural product. The various measures in this directive, such as banning late payments for perishable goods and banning late cancellations, will go a long way to restoring the imbalances, give farmers extra protection and keep food at the highest standards and quality. But we must not – and I give this warning – become complacent that our work here is done. One of the greatest obstacles to successful European legislation lies within incorrect implementation at Member State level – not at Brussels, at Member State level –and this is where we have got to follow it through.

While these issues had been blocked for years, Parliament played an indispensable role in this fight against the timidities and divisions of the Council. In the future, it must continue to address these essential issues. We would not have been able to do this without the task force on agricultural markets at the heart of the milk crisis in 2016, and we must thank you for that, Commissioner. The conclusions of this working group have been essential to the progress we have made and are still making this evening. One last key topic remains on the table, that of market transparency. The committee is working on this and we will be making concrete proposals in the coming weeks as part of the CAP reform. Once again, Commissioner, we will need your support to complete this work on a cause that seems to you and to us to be a noble cause.

Unfair competitive practices take place throughout the food supply chain and also extend in connection with the marketing of other products. Small producers are frequent victims of abusive commercial behaviour involving late payments, cancellations and unilateral or retroactive changes to contracts.

In a market-oriented context of agricultural policy, the good and equitable management of the food supply chain has acquired fundamental importance, particularly for small agricultural producers, who are particularly vulnerable to unfair commercial practices, as they often lack bargaining power corresponding to that of their partners who buy their products.  This is mainly due to the limited alternatives available to them in order to get their products to final consumers, as well as to the structural shortcomings of the agricultural system. The directive aims to target unfair commercial practices through the introduction of protection instruments common to the whole of the European Union, including a wider list of prohibited practices.

The whole lot of the unfair practices, involving aid payments, perishable goods, non-perishable goods, contracts, ‘hello money’, etcetera, have been dealt with.

I was present at the vote in the Committee on Economic and Industrial Policy until the end, so I was only able to arrive here a little late. I believe that we can all now state that the protection of small and medium-sized enterprises, particularly in small-scale agricultural production, has always been an important concern of many forces in this House, and the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats has always listened to this. That is why, of course, I would like to thank all those who have contributed to the fact that this directive has now been produced, in particular the rapporteur, Mr de Castro. However, I think I have to make it clear that this directive, Commissioner, has not been a perfect success in all areas. The protection of the companies that are now included in the scope of application goes far beyond the definition of what small and medium-sized enterprises have been up to now. One can, of course, raise the question of whether we need a broader definition of 'small and medium-sized enterprises'. But if you ask yourself this question, you actually need an impact assessment in Europe. That is why I have some doubts as to whether we can now shake off an extension of the definition of SMEs from the agricultural sector or whether we would not have needed a little more time to do so. The second problem that I think arises is that this directive actually assumes that we also have a single European market in the agricultural sector. In this respect, it would have been logically imperative to bring this directive to full harmonisation and not to explicitly place further fragmentation in recitals 16 and 17 of the Member States. This, of course, puts the uniformity of this market into question to some extent. All in all, we will agree to this, but there remain some doubts.

(Protests) (Addressing Mr Agnew) No. You’ve got plenty of time to express your view over the years.  The second one is Mr Carthy’s view in relation to this legislation. Presumably speaking on behalf of his group, he now is adopting a very isolationist position, where he is actually supporting the strong versus the weak. I’m absolutely flabbergasted at this political stance of Sinn Féin, in particular, who portrayed themselves as extreme Socialists, with great pride, for many, many years. What we’re trying to do here is go in the right direction and help the weak against the strong. I thought that that very principle would be something that could be shared by Sinn Féin and actually it’s remarkable that he has now put himself in a political position where he’s on the same side as the big supermarket retailers, rather than actually on the side of the farmers who are being 100% protected and the small businesses who are being protected as well, up to EUR 350 million turnover. Nobody is saying, Mr Carthy, that this is going to be a panacea for farm prices overnight, but it’s minimum harmonisation at the European Union level for Member States, including Ireland, if you can persuade them, that will be able to do more in this case. Member States can go further due to the construction of this directive and I hope that they do so, particularly as Mr Andrieu and Mr Loiseau have mentioned, in relation to France. This is an opportunity to bring about much-needed protection for our farmers. With the help of this House, we have seized that opportunity and those who continue to oppose the legislation now make up a bizarre incoherent coalition of interests.  Mr Nicholson is quite correct and so is Ms Aguilera. This is about protecting farmers and you have to actually start somewhere in order to do this. Ms McGuinness and Ms Aguilera, and others, emphasised that what the Commission’s proposal is about, with a strong initiative and support of the farmers, is to respond to calls out there from this House about trying to protect the weak against the strong. We’re strengthening the position of the farmers in the food chain. We’re actually banning unfair trading practices in a number of areas, and I think that 96% of the respondents to our public consultation agreed that we should do this, so I don’t know where the support is for anything other than this. Madam Heubuch, you are free to make more changes in competition law, as you attempted to do in the trilogue process, and in four years’ time, you will have another opportunity. We have made a lot of progress in competition law in relation to agriculture in the last few years through the Omnibus Regulation, through the food chain and we will be making further progress through market transparency rules that I will be publishing in the near future.  The reality of this is that the course is in front of us, but we will only start to work when the Member States take their responsibilities seriously. The EU has done its job, in the words of Mr Dantin, in a noble cause. Now let us join together to ensure the steady transposition of this directive and let us remind ourselves that this is a minimum requirement.  Mr Andrieu, Ms Zoană and others recalled that it has taken some time for there to be a Commission proposal. Let me confirm that this is a proposal that has the full support of the Commission and reflects what President Juncker said in his State of the Union speech here in 2015, when we had a milk crisis and a pigmeat crisis, that it was hard to understand how milk was cheaper than water. So we have made a stand and I say finally, Mr President, to Mr Schwab, that I understand his comments coming from his perspective, but there was a much more ambitious proposal that ultimately was put on the table. We have reached a compromise, and there was a very rigorous impact assessment completed by the Commission before the proposal was tabled. Finally, nothing in this legislation should provide any fear for any sector in the food chain if they are behaving in a proper manner and acting fairly towards the farmer.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank all my fellow Members for their comments and, once again, I would like to thank Commissioner Hogan for supporting the European Parliament so strongly.

It is only eight months since the proposal was presented to the political agreement of 19 December, and I would also like to mention the unanimous vote of the Agriculture Council. That is why I expect a positive vote from all my fellow Members, including those who wanted more, and also from those – few, in fact – who did not want this directive at all. Ladies and gentlemen, this is precisely the Europe we want. It is Europe that gives a helping hand to the weakest companies and ensures that consumers have transparent and quality-guaranteeing standards. I agree, once again, with mrs Mairead McGuinness: it is a first step, it is a first step and we must apply it well, this directive. Let us also remember, however, that the directive extends the effectiveness of national laws. So we can remind Mr Agnew that British companies will be better protected now, thanks to the directive, because they will also be protected when they export to other countries of the European Union. I would like to thank Linda McAvan, because she wanted to mention something of which we are proud: the directive also applies to producers outside Europe and therefore protection is extended to all those small producers who may suffer unfair practices here in Europe.  In short, Mr Hogan, dear Phil, we have done a little miracle with this directive. It is all the groups that support you, with the sole exception of my colleague Matt Carthy, which I hope he may reflect on at night.

There is also a direct link between this Voluntary Partnership Agreement with Vietnam and the European Union and Vietnam Free Trade Agreement: namely, Chapter 13, on sustainable development, of the free trade agreement, which still has to be ratified, has a reference to the implementation of this Voluntary Partnership Agreement. I would like to emphasise that this is an excellent instrument for addressing deficiencies of governance, not only in the forestry sector but in the state system as a whole. I am talking about the functioning of customs, border guards etcetera. Vietnam is now the third country in Asia that has entered Voluntary Partnership Agreement negotiations with the European Union and I am extremely happy that Vietnam has committed to eradicating illegal timber from its supply chains. I visited Vietnam in January in my role as rapporteur. My hosts emphasised that Vietnam’s aim is to become the world’s biggest producer of timber products. This is all the more reason to ensure that Vietnam sources and processes only legal timber. Vietnam has a new forestry law in force since January this year. It unequivocally prohibits imports of illegal timber. This effectively means that timber imports from Cambodia should no longer take place – and here work needs to be done, including with Cambodia. In that context, it is also extremely worrying that Global Witness has found a surge in imports from the Democratic Republic of Congo, which is known to be a high-risk country. This issue has to be tackled in the course of the implementation of the Voluntary Partnership Agreement. It is of critical importance that Vietnam makes sure illegal imports are effectively stopped: simply relocating the sourcing to new high-risk countries is clearly not the solution. I expect Vietnam to enforce its forestry law swiftly and effectively, and it should consult all the stakeholders. The EU is ready to help.  – Mr President, the EU for its part should ensure sufficient resources in supporting Vietnam while it implements the crucial reforms. The EU is also in the process of drafting a new action plan on deforestation and forest degradation. Innovations similar to the Voluntary Partnership Agreements are required in order to address the global challenge of deforestation. As we know, deforestation has become ever more critical as the scientific understanding of its importance to climate change has grown. The Voluntary Partnership Agreements are a crucial part of the solution, as legal instruments are needed to step up the fight against deforestation globally. The EU needs to put in place strong measures to eradicate fully deforestation from European products that it wants to export to us and from the supply chains. By the way, this approach could also be applied to other risk products such as coffee, cocoa and palm oil. Vietnam is facing a huge task. After the ratification, which is expected to happen tomorrow, it will have to fulfil the commitments of this agreement. I have all the confidence that Vietnam will tackle this challenge with the seriousness that it deserves. This is not, and certainly cannot be, a mere bx-ticking exercise. Only once this Parliament is fully assured of the complete implementation and once it is convinced of the eradication of illegal timber from Vietnamese wood products will it be able to agree to issue licensees to Vietnam.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "Verts/ALE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 169, "date": "2019-03-11.json", "name": "Andrus ANSIP", "mepid": "124696", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission. – Mr President, the EU Vietnam Voluntary Partnership Agreement is an important milestone in our relations with Vietnam, it is an important step in our battle against illegal logging and deforestation, and it is an important affirmation of the validity of the EU’s longstanding Action Plan on Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade. It is the first voluntary partnership agreement signed with a country that is not only an important exporter but also a significant importer of timber. Vietnam is at the very centre of the global timber products trade. That is why the Voluntary Partnership Agreement with Vietnam, once implemented and fully operational, has great potential for creating a positive impact well beyond Vietnamese borders and, at the same time, bringing social, economic and environmental benefits to the Vietnamese people. I am pleased to see that the European Parliament agrees with this assessment, as shown by the two resolutions we have before us today. I can only repeat some of the important points highlighted in the reports. Vietnam has made remarkable progress since the start of the negotiations. One major success has been the open and constructive participation by everyone in Vietnam who was relevant to the process, which we hope and expect will continue in the implementation phase. Vietnam will introduce mandatory due diligence obligations for its importers. We are proud of this achievement but we are also aware that it will be our duty to ensure that its implementation does not fall short of the high due diligence standards established by our own EU Timber Regulation. The issue of the legality of imports, especially those from Cambodia, has been at the heart of the debates, and rightly so. We will continue to monitor the situation very closely. However, we should remember that import controls are only one element of a comprehensive system designed to ensure timber legality beyond the import points. It also covers harvesting, processing, trade in and export of timber products. Ultimately, the success of this Voluntary Partnership Agreement will be measured by the credible and robust implementation of the timber legality assurance system as a whole. There can be no forest law enforcement, governance and trade licensing without this. I welcome the overall positive message on this agreement that comes from Parliament’s resolutions.

There is a voluntary partnership agreement process with Laos, a dialogue with Cambodia, and a bilateral cooperation mechanism with China, where the legality of timber is a priority. We are also having a dialogue with Japan.  The messages that I have heard today are clear: we must work with our Vietnamese partners to set out an ambitious course for this Agreement to be implemented effectively. I can assure you that the Commission is committed and ready to do this. At the same time, the Commission looks forward to building on the positive experience with the Voluntary Partnership Agreement on forest law enforcement, governance and trade in the context of our broader relationship with Vietnam. This includes our future EU—Vietnam trade and investment agreements and the EU-Vietnam Partnership and Cooperation Agreements. The Commission will of course be happy to inform the Parliament on progress in the implementation of the Voluntary Partnership Agreement with Vietnam and on how the points raised in the resolution are being addressed.

This support is valuable to us as we see this Action Plan as a prime example of environment, development and trade policies acting in a mutually supportive way.

I expect the Commission to take the recent revelations of organised crime, illegal logging and illegal timber trade in Southeast Asia extremely seriously.

The DRC is something that we have to look into in terms of the illegal timber trade.

Mr President, my first words will be to express what is the wish of the whole of this House, which is that our colleague Gy-rgy Spflin, who is currently hospitalized for a serious illness, will recover quickly and completely. I would like to point out that the aim of the European Citizens' Initiative is to give citizens, if there are enough of them and come from a quarter of the European countries, a right of political initiative comparable to that which this Parliament has, through the resolutions that we vote on each month and which the Council of Ministers has: the possibility of taking the European Commission to invite it to legislate in a new area , to stop legislating or to amend previous legislation. The first regulation that we adopted a few years ago to serve as the legal basis for the system was quite disappointing, as there are only four citizen initiatives that have reached the final phase of the process. That is why we have put the book back on the job and, in good agreement between the European Commission, Commissioner Timmermans, and the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, we have come up with a new proposal, which has resulted in a trilogue agreement, and this agreement has been approved in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs by 18 votes in support, no votes against and only three abstentions. The new life cycle, which is thus introduced into this regulation of the citizens' initiative, essentially at the initiative of Parliament, allows for a simpler, more accessible, less expensive and more transparent process, it introduces the possibility of partial registration of a citizens' initiative whose initial aim might be to break the limits of the Treaty, it obliges the European Commission to present its legal and political conclusions within a limited period of six months , and it also obliges - and the NGOs concerned - the European Parliament to hold a debate before the European Commission decides on its responsibilities; and finally, it gives Parliament the opportunity to adopt a motion for a resolution. You will recall that our Parliament has amended its internal rules to make this possibility effective. The revision of the regulation also ensures greater transparency of funding. It establishes contact points, an online register allowing the group of organisers to manage their initiative throughout the process and, with the aim of the Commission by 2020, setting up a central system for collecting declarations of support online. This system already exists, but is simply optional. It is expected to be fully finalized by next year. It's also free. This was one of the requests for simplification and technical assistance from the NGOs with which we worked. It would appear that other NGOs or others were, at the very last moment, concerned about this procedure, but there is no need to question the content of this trilogue.

The proposed revision of the Drinking Water Directive, now under discussion, and the proposal on transparency and sustainability of risk assessment in the food chain, where the institutions have reached a political agreement. The Commission has proposed a revised regulation for the European Citizens’ Initiative to realise its full potential. It is essential that people are helped and further encouraged to use this instrument without unnecessary obstacles or burdens standing in their way. The text agreed between Parliament and Council will make the European Citizens’ Initiative more accessible and user-friendly at all stages of the cycle. It will offer more opportunities for initiative organisers to receive support and advice, in particular, through an online collaborative platform and contact points in Member States. It will help organisers by improving the registration process and giving them a more flexible timeline to start their campaigns. The Commission will provide organisers with a free service for the online collection of signatures. It will simplify the personal data that people have to provide in order to sign. Everyone will be able to sign no matter where they live. There will also be more time and, therefore, awareness raising, engagement and debates on successful initiatives before the Commission replies. The Commission regrets that some of the objectives which it wanted to pursue in this reform and which it shared with Parliament could not be fully achieved. In the end, it was not possible to lower the participation age from 18 to 16 across the EU. However, each Member State has the possibility to lower it for their own citizens if they wish to do so. We hope that many will do this because the voices of younger generations deserve to be heard.  In addition, while the new regulation introduces a central online collection system that the Commission provides for free, we would have preferred to retain the option for organisers to use their own systems if they wish. As a compromise between co-legislators, this possibility will be phased out by the end of 2022. However, I would like to stress that the Commission is fully committed to delivering a high-quality central system, which we will develop in close consultation with stakeholders.  All in all, I believe we have already delivered on our objective to make the European Citizens’ Initiative more accessible, less burdensome and easier to use.

This is an important moment for European democracy. The European Parliament and we, its members, have said from the outset that the European citizens' initiative needs to be improved and simplified. We cannot ignore people's proposals to the Union. This is the only way the Union can become a citizens' union, and this requires a smoother process and clearer rules. Looks like things are changing today. In the space of a few months, the Court of Justice of the European Union has ruled in two cases against the European Commission. It is the registration of two EU citizens' initiatives to strengthen the protection of the rights of indigenous minorities in Europe on the so-called 'minority safe pack' and the 'Cohesion Policy for the equality of regions and the sustainability of regional cultures'. Earlier, registration of the two initiatives was rejected by the Commission. It turned out to be wrong. The successful collection of signatures by safe pack has shown how important this issue is for Europeans, as much more signatures have been collected than required. Even with the second court ruling, it looks like another signature-gathering operation is under way.

Mr President, I would like to thank the The European Citizens' Initiative has been in existence for almost seven years now. Since the entry into force of the regulation, more than nine million people have signed a citizens' initiative. This shows that citizens want this instrument of cross-border participatory democracy. The other side of the coin, however, is that, unfortunately, only four citizens' initiatives have been able to collect the necessary number of one million signatures in at least seven Member States. In my opinion, practice has shown that this was not primarily due to the issues raised, but that the administrative and technical barriers to citizen participation were obviously too high. It is good that, with the reform package, we are now clearing many of these hurdles. For example, firstly, all EU citizens will be able to support a citizens' initiative in the future, regardless of their place of residence. Secondly, in future, contact points in the Member States will advise organisers on all practical issues. Thirdly, if a citizens' initiative submitted is only partially permitted, the Commission can now allow it instead of having to declare it completely inadmissible. Fourthly, organizers will be given more time to prepare their campaigns. You can now choose when to start collecting signatures. Fifthly, in future, our Parliament will hold a public hearing on every successful citizens' initiative in order to raise awareness of the concern of an initiative, and we have already amended our Rules of Procedure for this. These and other improvements will make the citizens' initiative more user-friendly. There is, however, a downside. My group has argued in favour of significantly rejuvenating the citizens' initiative by lowering the minimum age to 16. Young people are very interested in politics; At the moment, they are taking to the streets in wind and weather to make their concerns heard, be it for a sustainable climate policy or for a free Internet. They want to get involved, and they should be able to do so. Unfortunately, however, the Council has resisted lowering the minimum age. It is therefore at least a step in the right direction that the Member States have now been given the opportunity to decide for themselves on the minimum age of 16. I very much hope that there will be a committed public debate on this and that it will soon be normal throughout the EU for young people to be allowed to support citizens' initiatives, because our Europe needs the participation of young people.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PSE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 189, "date": "2019-03-11.json", "name": "Notis MARIAS", "mepid": "125069", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Group.

The fact that 9 million citizens of the European Union have so far participated in various citizens' initiatives shows the massive participation and the fact that a legislative initiative on drinking water is already being launched shows the success of the effort. However, the whole process should be more simplified, the Commission should not have the dominant role, which is what the citizens are calling for to legislate, but it must itself check whether the initiatives are correct. Therefore, the new procedure is particularly important, we discussed it in the Committee on Petitions and of course the right of the organisers to have a public hearing and in the European Parliament I think it broadens the democratic side of the operation. I support the effort to have the maximum participation of young people, 16 years old young people being able to participate in the whole effort.

I hope that the improvements will increase the number of initiatives that are being put forward, that of citizens who are involved in promoting them and that of those who are allowed to process.  It is a good idea that public hearings are held in Parliament on initiatives, that they should be discussed in plenary and there will be a motion for a resolution. It is also positive that the deadline available to the proponents to collect support and the Commission to accept or reject the proposals should be made more flexible.

Instead of strengthening an instrument created to stem the democratic deficit that characterises the current European Union, the compromise reached between Parliament and the Council in some ways weakens this instrument. To date, according to the limits imposed by the Treaties, there is no obligation on the European Commission to present a legislative proposal on the subject under the citizens' initiative, even if it has all the requirements of the regulation. If the compromise reached were therefore to be confirmed, not only could the request coming directly from a million citizens still be ignored or circumvented, but the individual signature collection system, managed directly by the organisers of an ICE, which has so far been essential to make collecting signatures easier in fuelling debate and public awareness of the issues covered by an initiative, would even be deleted. We could also have strengthened this instrument in full compliance with the Treaties, bringing to three the number of hearings planned for each ECI: one during the collection of signatures, another at the reach of one million signatures and finally a follow-up, and not by a simple amendment of the European Parliament's Rules of Procedure. This would have made it possible to place greater emphasis on the demands made by citizens. Instead, it was the arrogance of those who believe that the best ideas for improving our Union are necessarily those coming from the palaces in Brussels that prevailed.

It was not an easy task to produce a report on relations in a situation in which the European Union and its associated partners are being attacked by Russian state-sponsored actors that creatively use a wide range of hybrid warfare techniques. As a result, a significant part of the report addresses the resilience of the Union and its ability to deter hybrid threats. Today, five years after the occupation of Crimea, we stress that there will be no return to ‘business as usual’ until Russia fully restores the territorial integrity of Ukraine. We need to reassess the basis of our relations with Russia, as it can no longer be considered a strategic partner. The outdated EU-Russia Partnership and Cooperation Agreement should be reconsidered and any future framework for the EU-Russia relationship should be based on the full observance of international law and OSCE principles. The time for nice diplomatic language is over. Unfortunately, there is no place, space or time for major new cooperation initiatives with Russia. There is very little room for any cooperation so long as Russia continues to occupy parts of Ukraine and hybrid attacks on other European countries continue. We should, however, continue selective engagement with Russia in areas of vital interest to the Union. The global challenges of climate change, energy security, digitalisation, non-proliferation and the fight against terrorism are a few of them. We should stand firm on sanctions, which should be prolonged for as long as Russian violations of international law continue. I advocate a clear message to Russia regarding the sanctions: ‘more for more, less for less’. As we witness serious deterioration in the human rights situation in Russia, the Council has to move on with adopting a European Magnitsky Act, establishing an individual sanctions regime for human rights violations. The key to a more effective EU policy towards Russia is coherence between internal and external policies. This applies in full to Nord Stream 2, a project that reinforces EU dependency on Russian gas supplies, threatens the EU internal market and is not in line with either European energy or foreign and security policy. It needs to be stopped. The report’s list of recommendations for interaction with Russia is rather limited, but some of them should be mentioned: continued support for people-to-people contacts in general – particularly involving civil society activists and with a focus on young people – and a clear code of conduct concerning airspace used by military and civilian aircraft, in order to reduce the risk of misunderstandings, misinterpretation and misreading of each other’s intentions. There can only be political solutions to the conflict in eastern Ukraine and we have to encourage confidence-building measures in the Donbas region across the Line of Contact. The EU has to advance the idea of a UN-led peace operation in this region of eastern Ukraine.

In April 2018, EU Foreign Ministers shared the assessment that the strategic challenges we face in our relations with Russia will persist for some time. As highlighted by rapporteur Kalniete, central to these challenges remains Russia’s violation of international law by the illegal annexation of the Crimean peninsula and the ongoing destabilisation of eastern Ukraine. The dangerous increase in tensions in the Sea of Azov and the Strait of Kerch is another consequence of the illegal annexation. The Foreign Ministers reconfirmed the relevance of the five guiding principles agreed in 2016 for EU policy towards Russia and highlighted the need to strengthen the resilience of the EU and its neighbours against Russian threats, including hybrid threats. The EU has responded promptly and proactively, to promote EU values and interests and increase EU resilience in line with the five principles. High Representative Mogherini has personally taken every opportunity to raise the EU’s concerns in her meetings with Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov, including the need for progress on the implementation of the Minsk Agreements, the illegal annexation of Crimea and the security situation in both the Sea of Azov and eastern Ukraine. In February 2019, EU Foreign Ministers reiterated the Union’s support for the territorial integrity of Ukraine and its condemnation of the illegal annexation of the Crimean peninsula by Russia. It was also agreed to provide further EU support for Ukrainian regions affected by the situation in the Sea of Azov. We have also raised with Foreign Minister Lavrov international issues such as Syria. We have stressed the need to preserve the ceasefire in Idlib and prevent another humanitarian emergency. We are continuing to discuss not only how to support the western workers in their economic development and EU integration efforts but also Iran and Afghanistan, the need to preserve the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty and the importance of Russia’s remaining in the Council of Europe. The report rightly highlights the fact that the space for civil society in Russia is shrinking and human rights defenders face a difficult situation. The EU delegation in Moscow maintains ongoing close engagement with the Russian authorities on human rights issues, including, among others, the situation of human rights defenders, women’s rights, gender equality, LGBTI persons and Ukrainian prisoners. EU support has been tireless, through frequent contacts with defenders, high-level demarches, media statements, field visits and trial observation. In order to strengthen contacts with the Russian people, the EU continues to maintain an intense level of support. Russian citizens continue to be the largest group of recipients of Schengen visas and Russian students are the largest group of beneficiaries of Erasmus+ exchanges. We will explore further ways to continue to convey the message that the European Union supports the Russian people. We are close to Russia and its people. We share centuries of history and culture, and this will not change, despite any disagreement with the Russian authorities. Russia is an important interlocutor for the EU, and we work well together on various issues, from Iran to the Arctic. Yet we are deeply worried about certain aspects of Russia’s behaviour, not only in Ukraine and Syria but also in Salisbury and in relation to the espionage against the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). Following the attack in Salisbury, and in line with the Council conclusions, we have redoubled our efforts to strengthen EU resilience, including in relation to chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear-related risks, and to continue strengthening our capacity to address hybrid threats. A new EU regime against the use and proliferation of chemical weapons was set out in October 2018. In January, the Council imposed sanctions under this new regime, and also against the four Russian GRU (intelligence agency) officials deemed responsible for the attack in Salisbury. Work is ongoing to establish a new EU sanction regime to counter cyber-attacks as part of our wider diplomatic toolbox. We are looking at strengthening our capacity to address the hybrid threats mentioned in the report, including in the areas of cyber-strategy communication and counter-intelligence. We are also reinforcing our work on tackling disinformation. In December 2018, the EU adopted an action plan against disinformation, responding to the European Council’s call for a coordinated response to challenges, particularly with a view to the forthcoming European elections. I know that Parliament will hold a specific discussion about this tomorrow. I will take this opportunity to highlight our common interest in retaining a realistic and balanced approach towards Russia, as underlined by the report. Despite increased tensions, it is essential for the EU to maintain open channels with Russia on issues of strategic interest for Europe and for the world. We will retain a policy of transparency towards Russia and explore cooperation in areas of mutual interest, such as regional connectivity, while also working to support the resilience of partners in the region.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": null}, {"id": 209, "date": "2019-03-11.json", "name": "Cristian Dan PREDA", "mepid": "96838", "text": "  on behalf of the EPP group. Mr President, first of all, I would like to congratulate my colleague Sandra Kalniete, who worked on this report and on the very welcome update of the incidents between the Union and Russia from the point of view of international relations. Of course, we have had some bad news, which we have already discussed here (for example, the situation in the Kerch Strait and the militarization of the Sea of Azov), but I would rather stress another aspect. As Commissioner has mentioned, we are on the eve of the European elections and we have been hearing for some time about the Kremlin's influence in the political affairs of our democracies. Russia's strong presence is feared and this is not a question of political relations in the foreign sense. I see that the Romanian Presidency of the Council is absent - it is already a habit - and I am therefore speaking to the Commission. Would it be possible to clarify certain points before the European elections: in which democracies is Russia present? Which parties does the Kremlin actually work with? Where is Russian money invested? In my opinion, it would be better if we had this information before the European elections and not after, otherwise we will find ourselves in a situation similar to that of the United States, where there is a post-election crisis due precisely to this uncertainty.

In such times of tension, it is important to do everything possible to reduce escalations. Unfortunately, this report doesn’t serve that purpose. The implementation of the Minsk agreements would demonstrate Russia’s goodwill with regard to solving the conflict in eastern Ukraine. We need to engage in consultations with Russia to reduce the risk of misunderstanding. One official platform for such consultations is our interparliamentary dialogue within the EU-Russia delegation. I believe such a dialogue is an important tool just in times of tensions. Therefore, both sides should remove the obstacles for dialogue to take place again.  We need to continue our pragmatic engagement with Russia in areas of common interests and with regard to global governance. The Northern Dimension initiative, cross-border cooperation and the Barents Euro-Arctic Council are good examples for constructive engagement that benefits citizens.

Mr President, Commissioner, I am very pleased that we can talk here tonight about the political relations between Europe and Russia. We should not hide it: the relationship between Europe and Russia is not good, and that is probably an understatement.  We now have fewer contacts with Russia and we negotiate less with Russia than in the cold war times. That should make us think about how to deal with this reality, taking into account the fact that we have been in a political deadlock of sanctions and counter-sanctions for five years. The dialogue is far to be seen.  In order to break this deadlock, I can tell you that the ALDE Group has drawn up a very nice paper on a new Russia strategy. A strategy in which we put the entire EU Russia relationship in a broader perspective. A strategy that leaves the door open to dialogue, because Russia is and remains Europe's great neighbour. A strategy based on conditional engagement, based on the Helsinki process of the 1970s, through parallel processes where, each time progress is made in one domain, cooperation is initiated in another domain, not just looking at economic sanctions in relation to the Minsk agreements. A strategy in which we reach out unconditionally – and I think this is very important – to the Russian citizens and civil society.  You know, ladies and gentlemen, at the moment a whole generation of Russians are growing up with anti-European sentiments.

The financing of anti-European parties on the far right, but also on the left, interference in EU referendums, cyberattacks, snipering in Macedonia and, more recently, on French roads in connection with the yellow vests, poison-killing attacks – these are all not invitations with which Russia would promote a return to better relations.

It suits the interests of this place to try to claim that there was something up with the British referendum because frankly you don’t like the result. There were indeed some accidental rule breaches on both sides in the British referendum campaign. The pro-EU Lib Dems were fined, the pro-EU Open Britain were fined for rule breaches. Some other allegations were simply not followed up on. Nothing, though, was material to the outcome as per the UK Court of Appeal ruling of 4 March. There is no evidence that gives rise to any soundly based grounds for believing the outcome of the referendum would have been different if those breaches had not occurred.

It is resigned to be noted that, compared to the resolution of similar content adopted by the European Parliament in 2015, relations between the European Union and Russia have not improved, but have deteriorated, and I see no basis for the hope that, in the future, the Kremlin could change its ideology and strategy aimed at destabilising the European Union and russia's self-isolation. This weekend there were widespread protests in Moscow and Vorone, against the Kremlin's intention to isolate the Russian Internet from the rest of the world. This is another sign of how much the Putin regime fears the diversity of information, because it is aware that openness is a threat to the existence of the regime. If the collapse of the USSR, in Putin's words, was the biggest geopolitical disaster of the 20th century, then the course chosen by the Kremlin for the isolation of the Russian state and the people could lead to the greatest geopolitical disaster of the 21st century. We must therefore leave the illusion in Europe that we will be able to return to the hopeful state of cooperation that developed between the European Union and Russia after the fall of the Iron Curtain.

As such, we must remain committed to reinforcing our role as a global actor for peace. The main idea of the report is to reinforce the institutional capacities of the EU for conflict prevention and mediation, as well as to increase the role of the European Parliament in this area. Our most important suggestions are to establish an EU High—Level Advisory Board on conflict prevention and mediation under the Vice President/High Representative. This advisory board will set up a pool of senior political mediators and conflict prevention experts. A High—Level Advisory Board for the EU also reflects what the UN has successfully put in place under the new Secretary-General. We also need an EU Special Envoy for Peace. There is indeed a need for a clear mandate on how to build and promote peace at all levels in the world. Furthermore, the establishment of additional institutional mechanisms, such as task forces for specific conflict prevention situations, are also important aspects on how to strengthen the institutional capacities for conflict prevention and mediation. These horizontal mechanisms are a very effective and pragmatic approach to coordinate EU institutional work on the ground. The establishment of a dedicated Council working group on conflict prevention and mediation is also a tool put forward in the report. The Council must put conflict prevention and mediation high on its agenda and step up its work through focused and informed measures.  When it comes to the European Parliament, its growing role in political mediation processes – notably via DEG activities – is more and more recognised. The report also suggests the appointment of a Vice—President responsible for coordinating the mediation and facilitation of dialogue activities. A yearly report to Parliament on the progress made in implementing EU policy commitments on conflict prevention and mediation is also requested. Additionally, I have been clear on the budget issues. If we want the EU to act and to be efficient on conflict prevention and mediation, we absolutely need to ensure that the new MFF will foresee sufficient and earmarked financial resources.  We must also see the fundamental logic of the active work and representation of women with women’s experiences, youth and civil society at all stages of conflict prevention and mediation work. This is why I put great effort into mainstreaming the gender perspective in the report, in line with the internationally accepted Women, Peace and Security (WPS) Agenda. This i reinforced by the EU in the conclusions adopted by the Council on women, peace and security just a few months ago, in December 2018. In their conclusions, the Council recalls the commitment of the European Union and its Member States to full implementation of the WPS Agenda, which consists of UN Security Council Resolution 1325 and its follow-up resolutions, ensuring that the 1325 agenda is fully integrated into all EU policies and efforts. I am very surprised by the fact that gender mainstreaming was not accepted by a majority in the Committee on Foreign Affairs (AFET). In order to rebalance the report, I have now put forward amendments for the plenary on the following topics: to call for the EU to take a lead role in the implementation of the UN Security Council resolution on women, peace and security; in the systematic establishment of a reconciliation and accountability mechanism; in the establishment of a pool of mediators that includes current and former members of the European Parliament; and in the establishment of a European women’s mediator network, and in gender budgeting.

The EU must be at the forefront of preventing and tackling violence against women and must encourage a holistic approach to dismantling all gender-based discrimination and violence, and this must go hand in hand with effective awareness raising and education for men and women on gender equality and human and women’s rights. However, none of these tools can be effectively shaped and implemented without the direct involvement of women from all backgrounds, as gender-based violence takes many forms.

As rapporteur Post rightly points out, conflict prevention and mediation are core issues of our daily work, which we are actively prioritising as also spelled out in our Global Strategy. Today the EU is involved in some 40 mediation and ILO processes worldwide and in some of them the EU is in the lead and its efforts is clearly visible. In other cases, and deliberately so, we are working more discreetly. In response to the impact of conflicts on our societies, we need to redouble our conflict-prevention efforts and to enhance mediation as a first response to tensions. Conflict prevention and mediation is an important priority for the European External Action Service (EEAS). The ongoing work has, for example, entailed active participation by the EU in the international mediation efforts accompanying the ongoing peace process in Mali. We are also building the capacity of parties in conflict to move towards peace in the Central African Republic. One further example is our support for women mediators who work at the front lines in Yemen and Syria to play a meaningful role in helping to make peace a reality. At the same time, we work very closely with our regional partners such as the United Nations, the African Union, the OSCE and others, by supporting their mediation work. As conflicts around the world increase both in number and complexity, we need more than ever to cooperate and complement each other. We also regularly convene meetings with the Member States and invite the European Parliament to share our insights and enhance our collective work by creating a common approach on mediation. As part of planning to enhance EEAS mediation capacities, an internal pool of mediators which can be deployed on behalf of the EU is being set up. Furthermore, a high-level interinstitutional and mediation taskforce – which should provide guidance for high-profile mediation assignments, risk assessments and enhanced cooperation – is being launched. It is sometimes difficult to demonstrate the success of mediation and conflict prevention activities that are often conducted discreetly. The demand for mediation and conflict prevention has risen exponentially and the mediation field is developing fast in response to the changing nature of conflicts. The EU shouldn’t only want to keep up with the pace of efforts, but should want to lead in this field, and we are working hard to make this possible. I count on your support to ensure that we will have dedicated and earmarked resources in the next Multiannual Financial Framework to further step up the EU’s role in conflict prevention and mediation.

Instead, the region's ERDF POR, agreed with the European Commission following the 2016 and 2017 earthquakes, provided for that money to go primarily to the area of the 87 municipalities of the crater, in order to provide support to the affected populations and the activities of the territory.  We all know how much we need it, but we get disconcerting news. It seems that the regional council has decided to use a large part of that money for interventions in the rest of the region.
