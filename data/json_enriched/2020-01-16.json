Let me remind you what the EBA’s responsibilities are: the EBA is responsible for supervising the EU’s banking sector and for setting technical standards implementing key financial regulations. This makes the EBA a fundamental institution that regulates and supervises the financial sector. It also, of course, makes it a constant lobbying target for the industry. AFME, like other stakeholders, appears to have permanent interactions with the EBA. In compliance with the staff regulations and ethical rules, the EBA’s Board of Supervisors has taken a decision to impose fairly light restrictions on its Executive Director, both while in service at the EBA and after leaving the EBA. However, the restrictions on Mr Farkas’s future employment do not seem either realistic or enforceable. Unless Mr Farkas simply becomes AFME’s poster boy, I cannot really find a single topic that AFME covers that does not fall within the remit of the EBA and does not relate to the work of Mr Farkas. Moreover, it is not clear to me who will monitor the effective application of these restrictions, in particular the one that provides that he cannot engage in lobbying or advocacy of the EBA or have professional contacts with EBA staff for 24 months after leaving the Authority. How are we going to enforce that or control that? Who’s going to do that? So, for this reason, we call for a review of this decision by the EBA Board of Supervisors. Sadly, Mr Farkas’ is not the first case, and will probably not be the last, of a post—public employment job in the private sector that poses evident problems of conflicts of interest, but we absolutely must act to ensure that this is the last. I really hope that this is the last.  Revolving doors, where one jumps from public institutions to top positions in the private sector, from regulators to regulated, or from supervisors to supervised, and vice versa unfortunately not only undermine the credibility of the individual engaging in such behaviour, but undermine the credibility of the whole institution and, more generally, the trust that citizens have in public bodies, and the trust that citizens have in public institutions is the backbone of democracies. So we shall not tolerate our European institutions and agencies’ credibility crumbling just because of some individuals’ interest, and we should always remain vigilant in making sure and guaranteeing that they are not influenced by private interest. For this reason, we call on the Commission to assess the current practice on post—public employment at European and national level, to extend this review to pre-public employment conflicts of interest, and also to put in place a harmonised legal framework, which should include an extension of the possibility to block professional moves and the provision of a cooling—off period that is proportionate to the specific case and accompanied by an appropriate temporary allowance. Finally, we call on the Commission also to assess whether it is appropriate that the EU agencies concerned decide for themselves on the enforcement of the rules for the prevention of conflicts of interest and how a consistent application of the rules can be ensured.  I was glad to see that the resolution was supported unanimously by Members in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON) with no votes against and no abstentions. I hope this is a clear signal and that the plenary widely supports the resolution as well.

These high ethical standards are vital – vital components that allow democracy to thrive. The effective operation of ethics in the civil service requires that public officials and agents be independent, impartial and responsible to the people. I understand that the move of Mr Farkas from the European Banking Authority (EBA) to the private sector generated some concerns and in this context, you addressed questions to the Commission with regards to its policy and its legal framework. You have also raised the point in relation to the horizontal harmonisation of the ethical legal framework across the EU institutions.  The Staff Regulations and the implementing rules adopted by the Commission apply to all EU agencies, unless agencies adopt their own implementing rules which are validated by the Commission. At the same time, each agency holds its independence, since they are separate legal entities. This means that agencies are independently responsible for the implementation of the rules, compliance and for adopting individual decisions concerning their staff and this also concerns Mr Farkas.  The decision concerning Mr Farkas was taken by the EBA Board of Supervisors, which is the decision-making body to decide on and enforce post-employment restrictions. The members of the board with voting rights are the heads of the national public authorities, competent for the supervision of credit institutions in each Member State. The Commission participates in the board meetings with only one representative, without voting rights. This mode of governance is the choice of the legislator.  As mentioned, the EBA, like all EU institutions, is bound by the Staff Regulations. These contain a comprehensive ethical framework. The latest Staff Regulations – reform of 2013 – reinforced this framework in the area of post-employment restrictions. More specifically, the Staff Regulations require that potential conflicts of interest are assessed upon recruitment or integration after a period of leave on personal grounds. These provisions explicitly address the issue of lobbying in a democracy during leave on personal grounds or after having left the institution. With particular regard to post-employment activities, the assessment is made on a case-by-case basis. Prohibitions or restrictions must be well reasoned and proportionate. For each case there must be appropriate balance between the need to ensure the integrity of the work of the institution, through temporary prohibitions and restrictions and, on the other hand, the need to respect the former staff members’ right to engage in work and to pursue a freely chosen or accepted occupation, as enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.  On these matters, the Commission has in place implementing rules which are regularly revised to reflect recommendations, in particular from the European Parliament, the European Ombudsman and the European Court of Auditors. This was the case when the new decision on outside activities and assignments and occupational activities after leaving the service was adopted in 2018.  I would also like to underline the importance of transparency. Since 2014, the Staff Regulations provide that each institution must publish annually information on the implementation of the prohibition for former senior managers for one year to engage in lobbying or advocacy vis-à-vis staff of the former institution on matters for which they were responsible during the last three years in service. The Commission has just published its fifth report. This is part of the Commission’s overall efforts to achieve greater transparency, which also includes publication of Commissioners’ and senior staff meetings and updates to the EU transparency register, to name just a few.  Over the recent years, the Commission has indeed closely cooperated with the European Ombudsman in the framework of her inquiries looking into the revolving doors phenomenon. When closing its second inquiry in February last year, the European Ombudsman confirmed that the Commission has high standards in the area of ethics and transparency and encouraged the Commission to continue to lead by example. In July last year, the European Court of Auditors issued a report on the ethical framework of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission. The Court of Auditors’ audit confirmed that, to a large extent, the audited institutions have established adequate ethical frameworks and that the Commission is well advanced in this matter. The new College marks a new momentum to address ethical challenges, together with new ideas and determination. In this respect, Vice-President Jourová has been entrusted by the President to work with the European Parliament and the Council on setting up an independent ethics body common to all EU institutions. Cooperation with the other institutions in this process, of course, is key to making this a success.

Latent conflicts of interest, such as those that can arise from a direct change of top staff from supervisory authorities to the private sector, erode confidence in the European Union and its institutions. The truth, however – and this has already been mentioned – is that we cannot, of course, impose bans on professions. Therefore, if we want to oblige top officials to take a cooling-off period, we must, of course, also grant appropriate compensation. Otherwise, we are really going into legally difficult territory. In this respect, it is necessary for the European Commission not only to say 'this is an agency that has its own rules', but for us to think together about a single legal framework. I very much regret that the Council is not taking part in this debate, because the single legal framework also requires the support of the Council. It would be nice if the Presidency would also take this issue with us to deal with it. It is therefore also part of giving the supervisory authorities themselves less leeway. After all, it is not acceptable for them to decide for themselves what is permissible and what is not allowed, because they measure according to different criteria than should be the case for top European officials. However, ladies and gentlemen, we must of course also be a little careful. I always say: if you want to ride out, you have to keep your own stable clean. And that is why it is also part of this – and we as the GROUP of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats have included this in the resolution – that we see this not only for institutions, but also for Parliament: when a Green employee, who has been working in a month to regulate investment funds and investment firms, suddenly moves to the umbrella organisation of the British asset management industry next month, and of course without a cooling-off period. , then this is also a questionable process.

The EU has strong safeguards against revolving doors and the perverse incentives that come from that. These new rules enable us to prevent employees from taking up positions that harm our collective interest. However, without their application and enforcement, rules turn into paper tigers. It is this vital that this Parliament reminds the Commission, reminds the European Banking Authority (EBA), reminds the public that we will not let vital rules descend into irrelevance. With this resolution, we send the reminder loud and clear: we demand that Mr Farkas’ move be blocked. If this demand is not met, we will stand ready to ban him from this Parliament.  But it doesn’t end here. We see a sort of intimate love story developing between the EBA on the one hand, and Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME) on the other hand now that Gerry Cross has also been appointed. We need to continue to address potential conflicts of interest in the EU, and this starts in two weeks’ time if Mr Farkas indeed takes up his new job.

Commissioner, we will be monitoring you and other agendas from your colleagues to verify whether you heed our advice not to meet Mr Farkas in the coming two years.

We’re not talking about vague ethical standards without implications, we’re talking about rules that actually matter to the taxpayers. Why? Because if those who are setting the rules are actually not setting the rules for the taxpayers, but they are setting the rules for the system, because they’re hoping to go back to the financial system, etc., what we end up is with rules that are actually not working, with rules that lead to bailouts and with rules that lead to taxpayers footing the bill.

When the european banking authority's number two moves directly from this position to the top of the big banking lobby, it weakens citizens' confidence in European democracy. And the further European institutions move away from local democracy, the higher the ethical standards must be. That is why it is also true that the EU has had ever higher standards in areas such as transparency of lobbying and documents. Unfortunately, however, in the area of revolving doors between the private sector and powerful lobbies and public positions, the rules are not so strong. That is why we need stricter rules here. The rules so far are a bad joke. This also applies to the rules that have now been imposed on Mr Farkas. It is important that the European Commission applies the Staff Regulations strictly, and we know that one reason why the Commission has not so thoroughly examined and rejected the Farkas case so far was also because one often does not look so closely at one's own staff. Yes, it is true that these problems also exist in the European Parliament. This starts with parliamentary assistants, but it does not stop at Members who continue to receive salaries after the end of the mandate, without any restrictions on conflicts of interest being attached to it. And that is why I am happy to take the initiative. Let us set ourselves rules here in this House. Because when we made our report on the integrity, transparency and accountability of the European Parliament, there was very, very little support for my proposals to limit the revolving door. That is why I am pleased that we are now regulating this differently here. In particular, however, the European Banking Authority must take seriously our call to reconsider this decision. If it does not do so, then there must be consequences. And we have an opportunity, because the new number two also comes from the big banking lobby, and we will see how seriously we actually mean this decision here.

Unfortunately, it seems that what the European Commission has brought us was a disappointment. This is customary, and has been customary in successive European Commissions.  Following the 2008 financial crisis, the then President of the European Commission said that the influence of the financial industry on European policies with the influence of citizens had to be rebalanced. The President of the European Commission who made this fine statement was called Barroso and, as we all know, ended up at Goldman Sachs. And this problem, which is an endemic problem in multiple European institutions, becomes infinitely more serious every time we discuss the financial system and its regulators in European committees, in various regulators, in the European Parliament.  The decisions that have been taken by the European Banking Authority in the Farkas case are, as has already been said, a bad joke. The restrictions that are imposed from not contacting people working in the Authority, even if this restriction could be inclosed and cannot obviously prevent you from passing your phone book to your new colleagues. As is ridiculous and would be rife, if this were not such a serious matter, the restriction of not using the information it has accumulated in eight years in the European Banking Authority in its new functions, which are lobbying functions, in which the European Banking Authority is a central regulator. Mr. Farkas will be paid to use that information. The salary he will receive is the price of this information. And what the European Commission has told us here is that the principle of regulatorindependence basically means that the democratic institutions that European citizens have elected cannot do anything, which means that important regulators such as the European Banking Authority can be fully captured by the economic sectors they aim to regulate.  Moreover, it should be stressed that this decision we are discussing is taken by a President of the European Banking Authority who himself comes from a lobbying position at Santander, and therefore this story, this novel in the European Banking Authority, already has many episodes. And while this is a serious matter, I cannot help but smile when the right to work is invoked. What we are discussing is the right to move directly from a regulator to a lobbying position.

An independent agency, with competence for all European institutions, the Commission and the supervisory agencies, is needed, which somehow clearly assesses the criteria, finally assesses the characteristics of these labour movements, in order to improve the confidence of European citizens in the institutions, to improve confidence in European democracy and to open a space, as I say , greater political responsibility through the Union as a whole.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 10, "date": "2020-01-16.json", "name": "Damien CARÊME", "mepid": "197574", "text": "   Madam President, everyone says it, but we must do it: we must put an end to the opaque and disproportionate influence of lobbies on our public policies: the financial lobby, but also the nuclear or fossil fuel lobby, etc. They are numerous and organized to advance in the shadows their private interests, with the consequences that we know: banking disturbances, subsidies to energies of the past, and so on. More transparency is needed to combat these shadowy forces, because we are far from done with corruption; even in France today, as evidenced, for example, by the council of Europe's latest report of 9 January 2020, which points to the persistence of grey areas in the fight against corruption and calls for greater transparency in contacts between the executive and interest groups so that their influence on decisions is clearer. To regain the full confidence of citizens, what everyone is calling for here, it is time to put an end to the collusion between public and private interests. For example, because this is the one we are interested in today, a senior official, Mr Farkas, in charge of the European supervision of banks, should not be able to become director of the main financial lobby overnight.

First of all, I would like to assure you all that, first, the Commission is not indifferent to issues of potential conflicts of interest, and, second, we are certainly not taking lightly this, or any other, case involving a potential conflict of interests. It is not for the Commission to play the role of an advocate for a decision taken by an independent body, the Board of Supervisors of the EBA, but we do feel that we can shed some additional light. I’ll try to do so in view of the comments just made.  First of all, the representative of the Commission on the Board of Supervisors, who, I repeat, does not have voting rights, tried to get restrictions which were as strict as possible because there was indeed the finding that this case involved a conflict of interest. The Board of Supervisors looked very carefully into this matter and was of the view that the conflict of interest could be managed by imposing additional restrictions, such that go beyond the minimum condition applied to senior officials. So the length of the period prohibiting the lobbying contracts vis—à-vis the former staff is twice the duration as compared to the minimum, and so on. I won’t go into the details of the restrictions now, but the Board had to weigh and find the right balance between the interests of the public, on the one hand, and the rights of a person to pursue their work. An important question was raised among others: who would monitor and ensure the implementation and enforcement of this decision? I would like to note that the decision by the EBA Board of Supervisors includes a provision on implementation. The restrictions that were imposed will be communicated to the EBA staff and they will be required to report to the Chairperson on any contacts with Mr Farkas after he has left the service of the EBA. Furthermore, the EBA is subject to an obligation to inform the public each year on the implementation of the prohibition on lobbying and advocacy, including a list of the cases assessed. Mr Farkas, as any other active or former staff member, is subject to the Staff Regulations and disciplinary proceedings could be opened against him in case of breach, including after his departure from the EBA. Were the EBA Board of Supervisors or the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) to become aware of evidence of failure, following an administrative investigation and eventual disciplinary proceedings, Mr Farkas could be subject to disciplinary measures, as defined in the Staff Regulations. I think this explains that not everything is left to chance. There are provisions in place that should ensure that these restrictions are properly implemented. To conclude, let me reiterate that the Commission ensures – or tries to ensure – that high ethical standards are in place across all the agencies by having in place a harmonised legal framework. However, it is the responsibility of, in this case, the EBA Board of Supervisors to implement this legal framework by taking decisions independently on post-employment restrictions, in accordance with its founding regulation and with the Staff Regulations. It is also the responsibility of the EBA Board of Supervisors to ensure that these decisions are properly monitored and their implementation enforced. Finally, the Commission is always seeking to improve the existing framework. The existing ethical framework is the subject of constant review. We are looking for possible improvements, including, as I mentioned earlier, by setting up an independent ethical body and, I repeat, we are looking forward to close collaboration with the European Parliament, the European Ombudsman and other institutions in this process.

The report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission released this week identified more than 4 000 mass graves, with over 142 000 victims. In such a context, the role of human rights defenders, the role of freedom of expression in an unfettered press, are even more important. They are cornerstones of democracy and of sustainable peace building.  We’ve been prompted to debate this topic today by the most recent example of Burundian government repression of freedom of expression. Burundi’s Public Prosecutor, on 30 December, asked for a 15-year jail term for four journalists and their driver, Christine Kamikazi, Agnès Ndirubusa, Térence Mpozenzi, Egide Harerimana, and Adolphe Masabarakiza, who was simply driving them.  They were arrested in October when they were covering clashes between rebel and government forces and they’ve been accused of complicity with undermining the State.  I understand the only evidence that’s been presented in the trial is a single WhatsApp message. They are not the first. In July 2016, another reporter, Jean Bigirimana disappeared and has not been heard from since. In 2015 journalist Christophe Nkezabahizi, his wife and two children were murdered in their home in Bujumbura and there has been no adequate follow up.  Human rights activist, Germain Rukuki, a member of Action by Christians for the Abolition of Torture (ACAT) was sentenced to 32 years in prison last year and Nestor Nibitanga, was also sentenced to five years.  We call on the government to, immediately and unconditionally, release these journalists and these human rights defenders. There are upcoming elections in 2020 – an important point for the country.  I welcome the fact that President Pierre Nkurunziza has said that he will not seek re-election, but in order for there to be credible elections, major changes – considerable improvements to the political and human rights situation – are needed.  I urge Burundi in the strongest possible terms to change course and create the conditions needed for an open and vibrant democracy and I salute the efforts of the journalists and human rights defenders who are working for that end.

Madam President, the political crisis in Burundi is having a devastating impact on the people of Burundi, who are being violated by their economic rights but also their fundamental rights. Since 2015, these fundamental rights, such as the right to vote, have been in difficulty. People considered political opponents in the broadest sense have been threatened, driven into exile, imprisoned and sometimes even subjected to summary executions. The right to freedom of expression has also been undermined and space for civil society and the media is increasingly restricted in this country. On 22 October 2019, Christine Kamikazi, Agnès Ndirubusa, Terence Mpozenzi and Egide Harerimana, four journalists from the Iwacu group, as well as their driver Adolphe Masabarakiza were arrested and charged with complicity in endangering state security. In addition, Jean Bigirimana, a journalist with the Iwacu group, has been missing since July 2016. And in relation to these arrests and killings, there are systematic failures of the authorities which constitute a violation of the law regarding the protection of citizens by the state. We strongly condemn intimidation and arbitrary arrests. We call for the immediate release of Iwacu journalists and anyone imprisoned for exercising their right to freedom of expression. In order to prevent the situation in the region from escalating, we also call on the African Union to send its human rights monitors to Burundi and call on the United Nations to launch impartial investigations into those suspected of committing human rights violations. Finally, we call on the Member States of the Union to provide financial assistance to Burundi's civil society actors and call on EU diplomats to ensure that the European Union's human rights guidelines are respected, by observing and visiting the trials of political prisoners and human rights defenders.

In Europe, through laws criminalizing protest and widespread increase in hatred, manifested in the far right.  In Latin America, with lawfare, with different direct attacks on different people, defenders of the territory and the environment.  In the Middle East, with the creation of a black hole of impunity in which international conventions on humanitarian law and international law are swept away.  Africa is not a continent that escapes this dangerous trend. Today we are talking about Burundi, where the political and economic crisis has been deepening for four years, where human rights violations are essentially political in nature, from the Government, and the abolition of civil liberties is intensified in a period prior to the 2020 presidential and legislative elections. The immediate and unconditional release of all detainees who freely express their views is necessary. Violence, human rights violations and political intimidation against civil society and opposition must cease immediately. Decisive action must be taken for freedom of expression by abolishing measures taken against NGOs and the media; respect international human rights and anti-torture treaties. The cessation of these human rights violations is the precondition for the Government of Burundi, through neighbouring countries, to establish a peaceful political dialogue process.  But none of this can happen if we don't get involved in Europe. And Europe also needs to decide what role it wants to play in today's world. That's why we need concrete action. Europe must demonstrate its commitment to peace by granting refugee status also to Burundian asylum seekers, as recommended by the United Nations, and also to work on official development aid on the ground, also to enable neighbouring countries to be able to take in refugees, and ensure that European companies operating in Burundi respect international standards.  The European Union's relationship with Africa has always been complicated. We're not linked to a story we can be proud of.

On 14 March 2016, the EU suspended all direct financial support to the Burundian administration. This arose out of the 2015 presidential elections, which were boycotted by the opposition and which the UN Observatory condemned.  The EU deplores the continued oppression of freedom of speech and freedom of expression in Burundi. In 2018 and 2019, media outlets faced increased harassment by the Burundian authorities when foreign-operating licenses such as that of the worldwide respected BBC were withdrawn. The Burundian authorities continue to subject independent journalists to arbitrary arrests. In the World Press Freedom Index, Burundi is ranked 159th out of 180 countries in 2019. That says it all where freedom of expression and freedom of speech are concerned.  With presidential, parliamentary and local elections taking place in 2020, this remains a huge issue. On 22 October 2019, the Burundian police arrested four journalists on the basis of complicity in threatening state security and a judgment is to be given on those in 30 days. For that reason, it is so important that the European Union and our High Representative take immediate steps and make representations there to ensure that the 15-year prison term suggested is not given to these journalists.

One of the first steps to holding human rights abusers to account is freedom of expression, but this too has come under attack in Burundi. The BBC had its licence revoked by the Burundian authorities, which also banned its citizens from providing information to the BBC. Even children are not safe from prosecution. Three schoolgirls were arrested last year for allegedly doodling on the President’s image in their school books. While they were later released, the government warned that future cases would be punished.  More recently, the police arrested four journalists from a Burundian media organisation – and their driver. They are potentially facing 15—year prison terms for just pursuing their profession. We must press the Burundian Government to release these journalists, cease the persecution of independent media and opposition politicians and reverse their suppression of freedom of expression.

In the meantime, however, Burundi remains the scene of very serious violations of human rights. President Nkurunziza has committed heinous crimes to maintain power against the will of the people, carrying out a bloody repression of demonstrations, which has seen massacres and extrajudicial executions of opponents and members of civil society. Since 1 May 2019, in particular, a long season of political assassinations and threats made by the regime to independent polling stations and political opponents has begun. The space for civil society and the media has been increasingly restricted and many independent activists and journalists face intimidation, arbitrary detention and summary trials. I would like to express my deepest concern at these developments, which presage the violent and undemocratic nature of the forthcoming elections. How can fair and fair electoral competition be guaranteed for opposition parties in the light of a reinforced repression of the independent media?

I recall that, last December, the Council confirmed the need to maintain appropriate measures, according to Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement, against Burundi.  The EU believes that the Burundi crisis should remain high on the international agenda and we will continue to work with our partners in the United Nations, the African Union and African regional organisations. There are signs that tensions could increase further in the run-up to elections that are now foreseen for 20 May. Violations and abuses of human rights and fundamental freedoms, in particular freedom of expression, freedom of assembly and freedom of association, persist across the country.  The case of four journalists from Iwacu who have been imprisoned was mentioned by many here and I would like to assure you that the EU is keeping this issue very high on its agenda with the Burundi authorities. We have been raising this and coordinating with our like-minded partners. We will not let this issue just go away.  The Commission of Inquiry on Burundi, in its latest report in September, denounced the persistence of a climate of fear and intimidation of all persons who do not support the ruling party. The Commission also raised red flags at the serious human rights violations that were committed, some of them constituting international crimes. I do not, however, believe that we should just accept as inevitable that things can only get worse from now on. That is not in anybody’s interests and most certainly not in the interests of Burundi and its people.  I wish to assure you that the European Union has no intention of abandoning Burundi. Through its development cooperation, the European Union remains strongly engaged in the country, also working with civil society and human rights defenders and building up the resilience of the population. In the next four months, the time leading up to the elections, it will be crucial that Burundi strives to ensure a credible, transparent and inclusive electoral process, open up political and civic space and bring an end to human rights violations and impunity.  Respect for the spirit and the letter of the Arusha Agreement is key. I encourage Burundi to take this path, noting that there are elements to build on, such as a Code of Conduct broadly supported by political parties and the President’s reconfirmed announcements not to run for a fourth mandate.

However, I believe that we would do well to make it clear in our resolution – and we are doing so – that it is not a war of religions in Nigeria. It is a question of the distribution of resources, and we are also making it clear that the climate crisis will already have an impact on living conditions today and not at some point, that the climate crisis is already having a decisive influence on economic stability and local conflicts. Terrorist organisations are hitting fertile ground where people have no prospects, little orientation. We should also be clear: perhaps we can do a little better to help on the ground. I have the feeling, and I believe it can be made clear from figures, that our development policy on the ground is too often shaped by our own interests and not necessarily just by the interests of the Nigerian people. That is why it is good that we are once again saying in the resolution that development cooperation on the ground should serve precisely the objectives of combating poverty and not any other objectives. It may be that we want fewer people to flee Nigeria, but I think it is reprehensible for us to pretend that we can simply close the borders in Nigeria, to build pressure on the country.

These impacts, which can be measured, are added to cases of physical and sexual violence against women and girls, the lack of access to education and health care caused by conflict and the whole spiral of poverty and insecurity that results from it. Recent terrorist attacks reinforce the urgency of implementing the state's counter-terrorism strategy, stabilizing the territory, protecting its nationals, Muslims and Christians, from Islamic radicalism and preventing law enforcement authorities from continuing to be complicit and perpetrators of crimes against humanity. There is an urgent need to empower civil society and NGOs working on the ground to respond to malnutrition and ensure basic health care, especially for pregnant women and children. Climate change sharpens the situation experienced by the population, and it is essential to work in the medium term to create conditions for access to the country's available natural resources, which will be an essential part of peace-building as well as economic and social stability in the region.

For more than 10 years, violent extremist and jihadist groups, such as Boko Haram and Islamic State in West Africa province, terrorised the country. They attacked Nigerian police, military, schools, public institutions and religious buildings. According to a humanitarian organisation, more than 6 000 Christians have been murdered since 2015 by jihadist groups.

The EU should also increase its focus on inter-religious dialogue in its diplomatic relations with third countries.

First, support for the Libyan solution and control of the arms embargo on that region. Secondly, a guarantee that the exploitation of Nigeria's natural resources (oil, gas, but also metals) will allow people to develop.

Women experience a situation of widespread discrimination and violence, such as genital mutilation and child marriages.

According to international organizations, three thousand and six hundred children ⸻a half, girls⸻ have been detained and the army has consistently denied access to military detention centres.

And unfortunately this is not some personal impression of mine, but this fact, this claim is based solely on facts.  Just a few numbers. In 2018, more than four thousand Christians were killed worldwide. But not only that, the world's more than 245 million Christians have been victims of serious persecution for being Christians. That's 1 in 9 Christians in the world. I think we should all really imagine ourselves over that figure and over what she's saying. Unfortunately, perception in the West, especially in the Western media, is quite the opposite. Nigeria, in 2019, unfortunately, has just been at the fore for the persecution of Christians. There, 1,350 Christians were killed there because of religion alone, and more than 6,000 have been killed since 2015. If we look at the period of the last 10 years, more than 12,000 Christians have been killed in Nigeria for being Christians. So I think we should call the problem by its real name. This is not primarily about the conflict between north and south, about the conflict between nomads and farmers, this is about the persecution of Christians who are already almost bordering on genocide. So, of course, it's not just about the murders, it's about confiscating property on the principle of \"your country or your blood.\" It's about rapes, it's about expulsions, it's about systematic persecution of Christians at all levels in Nigeria, and it's a country where Christians make up almost 50% of the population. So they're not a minority. There are more than 80 million of them there, and now let's just imagine what it's like in many countries where they really are a minority.  In other words, the European Union needs to be clear in its stance on the persecution of Christians both in Nigeria and in other countries.

We are talking today and we are having this debate today because this terrible attack on Christians in Nigeria has occurred. It is not an isolated attack, they are attacks that are taking place over time, in the face of the passivity of the authorities in Nigeria. Just to give them some figures of what has happened, more than 6,000 Christians have died since 2015 at the hands of jihadist terrorists in Nigeria.  Of course Nigeria has other dramas and that Boko Haram, of course, is murdering Muslims and Jews. But this case—and this Resolution—is about a drama that is happening, which is persecution of Christians in the world, and we must not turn the spotlight away. And I regret to see how, when this resolution was negotiated, there was more interest, more emphasis, in removing the Christian word from the Resolution than in talking about what had happened, than in focusing on the very tremendous events that are happening. In the last Plenary we are talking about the attacks that occurred in Burkina Faso, and today we regret what happened in Nigeria, and of course I want to send my condolences to the family and friends of the victims.  But I would like to take advantage of the last few seconds I have left to remind you simply of a few figures, so that we understand that we are truly experiencing persecution of Christians in the world, before which the European Union cannot remain impassive. It must react, because we are talking about the values of the West, of the Judeo-Christian values on which the European project was built. Just to keep this in mind, we're talking about 4,305 Christians killed, according to the Open Doors report published in 2020. We can't remain impassive.

Since 2015, terrorist organisations such as Boko Haram have killed more than 6,000 Christians there. In the face of this enormous threat, it is extremely important that President Muhammadu Buhari condemns the attacks and wants to work to unite society.  Decisive action is needed to guarantee freedom of religion and the safety of citizens. We should therefore call on the Nigerian authorities to fight terrorism and to judge the perpetrators. However, this must be done in compliance with applicable law and human dignity. It is unacceptable to unjustifiably deprive citizens, including children, of their freedom and to keep them without trial without trial in conditions that are in breach of human rights, as the Human Rights Watch report has shown. Such conduct is incompatible not only with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, but also with the Nigerian Constitution itself. Moreover, military action is not enough to combat the threat of terrorism. Terrorist activity is the result of years of radicalisation. In order to really deal with this problem, interreligious dialogue must be conducted, freedom of religion promoted and social inequalities must be combated.  Nigeria is also facing a serious humanitarian crisis Nearly half of the population lives in extreme poverty. The European Union cannot look at this indifferently. Humanitarian aid must continue, but in the face of attacks on volunteers and aid workers, we must at the same time call on the Nigerian authorities to properly secure it.

Over the past year, terrorist attacks and armed conflict have continued to claim thousands of lives. I want to express our condolences to the families of the victims and our solidarity with the people of Nigeria, and in particular with the communities that have been so deeply affected by the insurgency of non-state armed groups, especially in the north-east of the country. The Boko Haram insurgency has killed more than 36 000 people in Nigeria alone since 2009. An additional challenge is the growing humanitarian crisis. More than two million people are estimated to be internally displaced, more than seven million are in need of humanitarian assistance and more than one million are estimated to be out of humanitarian reach.  The EU is following the situation very closely. We have promoted an integrated, multi-sectoral human rights oriented approach that focuses on peace-building, conflict prevention, humanitarian assistance and social and economic development at community level. The EU continues to stand ready to assist Nigeria in responding to its security, humanitarian and development crisis, in particular around Lake Chad but also in the north west, Middle Belt, Niger Delta and elsewhere, and in all these cases a comprehensive approach that addresses the root causes is necessary, in our view.  The EU is one of the leading contributors of humanitarian aid in Nigeria. It provides immediate assistance to cover the basic needs of the most vulnerable internally displaced people and host communities. Since 2014, the EU has allocated almost EUR 245 million to help people in need in Nigeria, and in 2019 we provided more than EUR 28 million in humanitarian assistance. The EU also aims to build long-term resilience through its development assistance, which addresses the underlying causes of violent conflict, as well as support to basic services and rebuilding livelihoods. Total EU support to the country under the European Development Fund amounts to well over half a billion euros for the period from 2014 to 2019.  Alongside these efforts, we are strongly committed to the fight against radicalisation and violent extremism. We continue to work on strengthening the military’s civilian protection policies and practices, demobilisation, disassociation, reintegration and reconciliation efforts and in delivering improvements to Nigeria’s criminal justice system.  Next week I will travel to Nigeria, including to the northeast, in order to convey a clear signal of the EU’s commitment at the highest political level. Indeed, we are deeply concerned with the issue of shrinking humanitarian access in the northeast and with the breaches of international humanitarian law. Continued dialogue with the authorities therefore constitutes a key priority for me. Furthermore, the next session of the EU-Nigeria human rights dialogue will be held on 18 February and this indicates again our strong commitment to defending human rights in Nigeria through ongoing dialogue and programme.

Therefore, a conference on the future of Europe can only make sense if it seeks to re-establish the link between peoples and European integration. The first step is to acknowledge the faultyness of the Lisbon Treaty, rather than pretending that this sad episode did not exist.

If so, which EU measures do you foresee to be impacted, and what is the timeline of the actions you plan to undertake? What will you do to ensure a timely response?

The main problem with three-dimensional printed firearms is not that they are defective and therefore subject to the Product Liability Directive. The actual problem is that these firearms were illegally manufactured and used. According to the Directive on the acquisition and possession of weapons, also known as the Firearms Directive, the manufacturing of weapons is already illicit unless it is authorised by a competent authority of the Member State where the manufacture or assembly takes place. And this applies also to manufacturing through 3D printing and using technical specifications available on the Internet.  Monitoring of the situation is currently taking place in the context of the EU policy cycle for organised and serious international crime. The Operational Action Plan 2020 includes an operational action aiming at raising awareness of the threat of the use of new technologies, such as 3D printers. Europol issued in October last year an intelligence notification for all law enforcement authorities on this subject.  The Commission is preparing a report on the application of the Directive, covering issues notably related to the impacts of new technologies such as three-dimensional printing. This report, which is due by September this year, will assess whether further action with respect to 3D printing is required.

We are talking about the possibility of production, the possibility of producing more and more with, in addition, larger tools and machines with greater capacity in the place where you want to establish the activity avoids transport, for example, as well. A democratization, in the end, as I said, of access to certain things. But it is also true, on the other hand, that it also poses a major challenge with respect to a lot of things. Security is one of them. Reference has been made before to what has to do with the possibility of, without going any further, building weapons. And we have had some examples during these last few months and these last years of the difficulty that still exists of control of certain things, certain planes, certain ways of building that can even be downloaded from the same website, from what is called the deep internet, from the deep web. And also, of course, it poses another set of challenges that, legally, are not yet well solved. And I would like to take this opportunity to ask the Commission to take this into account from the point of view of its own respect for intellectual property. And there are also a lot of examples of how, in some way, there is little control over the use of intellectual production of people or groups who have somehow been working on intellectual productions. And there is not enough protection yet in our legislation. More importantly, the exceptions being raised are too vague and too broad.

Well, allow me to continue in my mother tongue, Dutch. Mr President, 3D printing: it is a technology that has taken off and still has a lot of potential for European companies, both large companies and small and medium-sized enterprises. The possibilities are endless and it has already improved our lives. Think, for example, of printing prosthetics in the medical world, or in construction, where a small house can now be built in 48 hours.  But as with many innovations, this innovation also has a downside when it falls into the wrong hands, as we saw in that terrible event in Halle, Germany, where someone tried to enter the synagogue, killing two people and injuring two people. So while 3D printing does us a lot of good, we can't turn a blind eye to other possibilities and dangerous applications, such as printing weapons, explosives or drugs. We must therefore ask ourselves whether we have settled it well enough, and the answer is no.  The Commission has just indicated that it has taken steps, the Operational Action Plan. The police and prosecution authorities have also been put on the move. But the question is whether this is enough, because if you dive into it, there does indeed appear to be a patchwork of intellectual property rules, but also civil liability and, of course, the Firearms Directive. The Commission itself has already said that the weapons have been printed illegally. Yes, okay, how are we going to prevent that? Because yet this could happen.  So my question is to the Commission: you have already said what actions you have taken, but do we need new legislation and new standards? Because I believe that you really – and everyone here with me – believe that such an incident as in Germany should never happen again.", "language": "en", "original_language": "nl", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 137, "date": "2020-01-16.json", "name": "Angel DZHAMBAZKI", "mepid": "124873", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Group. – Madam President, Commissioner, honourable one, two, three, four colleagues in the Chamber, before I begin with the substantive issue raised by the honourable Member, I would like to address you, Madam President, and say something I said at the last meeting and the past, and I will continue to say so until measures are taken. The presence of so many people in the chamber on Thursday, on a working day, is an insult to taxpayers and a disappointment to those people there who come to watch the work of Parliament. It must be changed – either there is no meeting on the Thursday after lunch, or the living rooms are paid after the end of the meeting, or paid for half a day. Such a presence and such a debate on an important topic, I say again, is an insult to taxpayers and to the people who look at us here. So measures need to be taken. Please hand this over. Now on the topic: undoubtedly the entry of new technologies into all spheres of our lives poses new challenges. 3D printing is an important technology that leads to extremely valuable achievements in a number of fields such as medicine, construction and research. Just as no one can predict the impact of the steam machine in 1750 or the printing press in 1450, we cannot predict today what the long-term impact of 3D printing will be. It is clear that in addition to the undeniably useful applications of this technology, it will also carry risks. Weapons printing is a niche that is not regulated and needs to be carefully examined. It is irresponsible for people with no moral standing to have access to three-dimensional printed weapons after a few minutes of searching the world wide web. These weapons are untraceable, virtually undetectable, and can be accessed to any criminal, abuser or terrorist. But I would like to draw your attention to something else – the mere fact that there are people who resort to three-dimensional printing to obtain a personal weapon shows the following thing: the laws in a number of Member States of the European Union on the possession of personal weapons are unnecessarily restrictive and prevent conscientious citizens who want to protect themselves and their family. In my country, in Bulgaria, there is a huge problem with domestic crime per carried out by non-socialized marginal groups. For a number of citizens in small settlements who do not have access to police protection, owning a personal weapon is the only way to protect themselves and their family. Let me remind you that the only one who can stop a bad man with a gun is a good man with a gun. Whatever regulations and regulations are adopted on three-dimensionally printed weapons, they must not affect the legally acquired weapon. This hall has talked many times about limiting the possession of hunting weapons, sports weapons, limiting in the sphere, for example, the use of steel ball bearings, replacing them with lead, and others, to put it mildly, insane restrictions that, instead of being for the benefit of citizens, burden them and destroy old, traditional sports such as hunting and sports shooting. Let's take serious steps to liberalize the regime for acquiring not only the personal weapon, but also the sports and collectibles. You know that only the free man is the armed man.

The regimes are extremely strange because there is no difference between carrying and owning a weapon. According to my understanding in my home, which should be inviable and no one has the right to enter it, I can hold, if I like, a heavy machine gun. I think that's normal. Maybe I just like heavy machine guns. And I don't understand these strange restrictive laws in which people are forbidden to defend their own lives.

I will take this back and I can assure you that the Commission will look at this matter from all the angles that were mentioned today. But I can already give you some preliminary feedback on each of them.  I will start with intellectual property rights. The Commission recently commissioned a study on the intellectual property rights implications of the development of industrial three—dimensional printing. The purpose of this study is to analyse the intellectual property implications of the development of industrial 3D printing. The Commission will take account of the study’s conclusions and recommendations and will decide on the next steps. Obviously, the fight against counterfeited products, be it through 3D printing or any other production method, is of paramount importance for the Commission. On product liability, this is a matter that is covered by the Product Liability Directive. On this issue, I can tell you that the Commission published its fifth report on the Product Liability Directive and the evaluation of the Directive back in 2018. It also published a staff working document on liability for emerging digital technologies in the same year. In addition, the Commission is working on a guidance document for the implementation of the Directive and this guidance document should be available later this year. Furthermore, the Commission is examining whether it would be useful to amend the Product Liability Directive. Finally, on the illicit arms production angle, the incident that you mentioned in Halle was of course looked at very closely by the German authorities. Among others, the German Bundestag found that no legislative changes are necessary because the current German law explicitly sanctions the unlicensed manufacture of guns and firearms regardless of the method of their production. Nevertheless, the Commission will submit to this Parliament and to the Council a report on the application of the Firearms Directive, including a fitness check of its provisions accompanied, if appropriate, by legislative proposals, notably concerning the impacts of new technologies such as 3D—printing, but also the use of QR code and the use of radio—frequency identification.
