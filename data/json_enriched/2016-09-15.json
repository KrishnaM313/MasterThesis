Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. One of the objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy is to reduce the number of people at risk of poverty and at risk of social exclusion by 20 million. We are miles away from that. At present, more than 120 million Europeans are at risk of poverty and social exclusion, partly due to long-term unemployment, low wages and the erosion of social security systems. I would add that the methods of social dumping, as we decided yesterday, also lead to these results. This particularly affects the people of the countries most affected by the crisis, but not only. Major cities in Central Europe, such as London, also have up to 27% of people at risk of poverty and poor. In his inaugural speech in 2014, Jean-Claude Juncker pointed out that in future a decent income for all Europeans must be ensured. We must remember that. In an interview in May 2014, Juncker said – and this is particularly important in this House: \"I firmly believe in the future of the European social model, whose origin and future remains the social market economy.\" He went on to say: \"The core of this model is the primacy of people over the economy, but also the primacy of labour over capital.\" He continued: \"This almost inevitably gives rise to my idea of minimum social bases in Europe. In concrete terms, I am also referring to a statutory minimum wage, the amount of which is, however, determined in the country concerned and not in Brussels. I also mean,\" says Jean-Claude Juncker, \"a basic income, so that no one in Europe has to take to the streets or even starve. Especially when it comes to the social model, we have a model function for the world as well.\" What is clear is that it is employment – and I would add good work – that contributes significantly to overcoming poverty. But rules on the minimum wage can serve as key tools when it comes to safeguarding social security and increasing equal opportunities. In its resolutions of 20 October 2010 and, most recently, yesterday, the European Parliament stressed that an adequate minimum income should be at least 60% of the average wage of each Member State. This would cover the basic cost of living while maintaining a high level of aggregate demand, economic recovery and social convergence. However, the Commission's strategy on how to achieve this remains completely unclear. Yesterday's speech did not shed much light on this either. The Commission could support this approach in order to ensure that Member States implement an adequate and easily accessible minimum income in line with their national practices. With regard to Article 9 and Article 153(1) (h) and (j) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and Article 34 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs therefore asked the following questions: firstly, how does the Commission define the concept of 'reasonable income' and what is it characterised by? Secondly, when will the Commission examine the rules on minimum income in the EU and promote a comparison of performance and the exchange of best practices, as called for in Parliament's resolution of 14 April 2016? What programmes could help Member States manage? Thirdly, what measures will the Commission take with regard to a minimum income in order to follow up its recommendations? Fourthly, how will the Commission ensure that the financial resources made available for the guaranteed minimum income are not used to replace other social benefits in the countries subject to fiscal adjustment programmes? Fifthly, how will the Commission support the Member States in preventing people from being dependent on minimum incomes in the long term? We are asking you for an answer to these questions today, Commissioner.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "GUE/NGL", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2, "date": "2016-09-15.json", "name": "Marianne THYSSEN", "mepid": "1832", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, I would like to thank the Chair of the Employment Committee and the Members of the Employment Committee for this oral question and I will answer in order of the list of the questions that you raised. Firstly, let me tell you that there is growing evidence that high and rising inequality hampers both economic and social progress and fuels public mistrust. Well-designed income support schemes can contribute to fight poverty and increase labour market participation, and adequate income support should be high enough for a decent living and, at the same time, should not create disincentives to work or create dependency. Adequacy of income support is only one aspect of the overall policy design. Coverage, take-up, link to activation and access to services are equally crucial. The draft outline of the European pillar of social rights sets out principles to guarantee that adequate minimum income benefits shall be assured for those who lack sufficient resources for a decent standard of living. For those of working age, these benefits shall include requirements for participation and active support to encourage labour market reintegration. This builds on the 2008 Commission’s recommendation on active inclusion. This recommendation sets out common principles and practical guidelines for a comprehensive strategy based on three integrated pillars: adequate income support, inclusive labour markets and access to quality services. The 2013 Social investment package proposed to develop reference budgets as a way of assessing the adequacy of income support. They define poverty thresholds on the basis of a basket of goods and services that are considered necessary to reach an acceptable standard of living within a given country, region or city. They also show the link with the provision of adequate social services and the redistributive role of these services. As such, they can act as catalysts for policy debates on the adequacy of income support, especially in Member States with challenges in the field. On the assessment of minimum income schemes in the EU and promoting benchmarking, best practices and providing administrative support to Member States and the measures taken regarding minimum income as a follow up to the 2008 recommendation on active inclusion, I can tell you the following. First of all, the Commission monitors and assesses Member States’ progress in implementing the 2008 recommendation, including in the area of minimum income within the European semester. In 2016, six Member States received country-specific recommendations on improving the adequacy and coverage of minimum income or social assistance. These recommendations emerge from the assessment of minimum income schemes in the European Union, through the open method of coordination. As you know, social policies and the designing of the social protection systems are a Member State competence and the open method of coordination provides a forum for mutual learning and exchange of good practices on enhancing the effectiveness of social protection systems across the Union. Peer reviews, mutual learning and exchange of good practices on minimum income schemes took place in the past and will continue. In 2017, the Commission will report on the implementation of the 2008 active inclusion recommendation, and this will contain lessons learned and guidance for the future. The Commission has also been funding the European minimum income network, and is elaborating a methodology for developing cross nationally comparable reference budgets in Member States. This will serve as a means of helping Member States to design efficient and adequate income support. You next question is on ensuring that in countries under financial adjustment programmes, funding for guaranteed minimum income schemes do not substitute other welfare provisions. Contributory-based welfare provisions are, and should remain, the first line of protection. This means that the minimum income should not replace welfare programs, but should enhance existing approaches and complement existing measures in the labour market and social fields. There is currently only one country, as you know, one Member State under the financial adjustment program, and we are working together with the Greek authorities to enhance the effectiveness of the welfare system. The main objectives of the Greek programme are the expansion of employment support schemes, the modernisation of social welfare and the roll-out of a guaranteed minimum income scheme. The funding of the new guaranteed minimum income scheme will not be at the expense of contributory-based social welfare provisions. Lastly, on helping Member States providing opportunities to prevent long-term dependency on minimum income, I can tell you that the Commission has been encouraging Member States to better integrate social safety nets and activation measures, not only to bring the unemployed back into jobs but also to keep people in employment. A recommendation on the integration of the long-term unemployed into the labour market was adopted in 2015, you know this. The long-term unemployed should benefit from an individualised approach, simplified access and more transparent support, in particular through job integration agreements and a single point of contact. We are also working to support the Member States in improving work-life balance, including through care facilities, leave and flexible working time arrangements, as well as tax and benefit systems free of disincentives for second earners.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 3, "date": "2016-09-15.json", "name": "Heinz K.

On behalf of the European People's Party, I strongly support the question put by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, as explained by our Chairman Handel. I would like to begin by saying that, fortunately, the Commission has already been active on this issue, is and should continue to act consistently towards the Member States. That is the implementation of the legitimate demand that each Member State of the European Union must regulate the minimum income. However, it is not sufficient to avoid slipping into poverty and social exclusion. What is also needed are active approaches that make re-entry and entry into work attractive, and a process that makes lifelong learning mandatory in order to prevent inadequate vocational training and thus promote a way out of long-term unemployment. I am convinced that all investments in supporting jobseekers in Europe are well-invested money. The issue of minimum income must be dealt with comprehensively. I would also like to draw attention to the pension situation in Europe. What is striking is that 20% of people in retirement in Europe live in poverty due to the lack of minimum pension regulations. This is particularly true for women. Here, too, the Commission's pressure is absolutely useful, not least because of the recommendations of the European Semester. And I would like to call, in principle, on the Commission and also on you, Commissioner, to use the recommendations of the European Semester not only as a recommendation, but also as a hard instrument.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 4, "date": "2016-09-15.json", "name": "Sergio GUTIÉRREZ PRIETO", "mepid": "103488", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group – Mr President, thank you very much, Commissioner. Yesterday we all attended the state of the Union debate, and I think, from my point of view, we also expected a more social content. It is true that we have been accumulating for more than eight years of economic crisis, which has caused Europe to bring more than 120 million people at risk of social exclusion to the maples today. In Spain, for example, 720 000 families live without any income, as they have been given all kinds of public aid. And I don't know if it's a systemic failure, I don't know if it's a problem in our economy, or it's a problem that should concern all of us, moreover, morally and socially. We are asking the Commissioner to lead a European initiative to create a minimum income system at Community level; to help Member States find a solution precisely for so many people who expect more from the European Union than fiscal consolidation speeches; who also expect social cohesion speeches and initiatives to help exclude poverty from our continent. The euro area, the European Union, remains, with the United States, the most important economic zone in the world, and we have to ask ourselves whether that is compatible with 120 million people, as I say, at risk of social exclusion, without any public assistance. The European Union must also represent a sense of hope. The European social model must be compatible with a fair exit from the crisis, and for that I ask not only for speeches, not only complaints, not only complacency, but also an initiative that will finally give a little hope to millions of citizens through the European Union as a whole.

Good morning, again, Commissioner, and thank you very much for coming to answer this question. Look, the minimum income thing is not an economic measure, it is a social measure — it is not an employment measure either — and it is very important, because it corresponds to the social model and the kind of democracy — for us liberals — that European society wants and on which the Union is based, which wants coherence and convergence and which, above all, , wants there to be no marginalized people in one of the richest areas of the world. One of the instruments to combat this — and the Commission has already talked about this – is minimum income, basic income. There are several models and, above all, it is true that it must adapt to the reality of each country, its economic situation, its culture, its economic, industrial, business fabric, etc. But the fundamental principle and fundamental norms can perfectly come, they must perfectly come from an integrated Europe and from a Europe that believes in a solidarity citizenship and a citizenship that expects from it a social pillar, as well as an economic reality. That is why the Commission needs to start implementing a fundamental issue, which is to study minimum income systems, to see their involvement, to see how each nation needs to be adapted through benchmarking, to see also its effectiveness in combating inequalities. It needs to start producing initiatives and roles and, in the end, also address the conjunctural funding needs of countries with serious financial soundness problems that they cannot meet.

Mr President, once again we are completely out of step with reality, first of all because social protection is an eminently regal area and it must remain so. Talking about non-work minimum income - we agree that this is not a minimum wage - is a real failure of the socio-economic policies of some States, but especially of Europe. I would remind you that the euro area has unemployment two points higher than the rest of Europe. It is therefore a treatment of the consequences, not the causes.

This work is a source of funding for the minimum wage, while the minimum guaranteed income is financed by public funds. In practice, the financing of the minimum guaranteed income can only come from the specific work of citizens and not from politicians promising a guaranteed income. In fact, therefore, working citizens who pay taxes pay for everything, the state does not have its own resources. A responsible social policy must not induce the state despite its attractiveness in social perception. Responsible social policy encourages work and activates rather than teaches fidelity and dependency.  In the context of the minimum wage, it is right to fight to ensure that work is not exploited and that working people are far from the poverty line.

We agree that it is the responsibility of the Member States to set a minimum income.

The differences in minimum income across the EU are huge.

It is also my personal belief that we must do everything we can to reduce poverty. It must be done out of respect for the citizen, because too great inequality is hindering growth, with all its consequences, and because it is fair. We need to make Europe a place where people know how to protect themselves. But Europe, we are all together. These are the various European political institutions and all political levels. David Casa, Jutta Steinruck and others made it clear yesterday: if we want to develop a policy that people feel the result of, then we must do so together. Only then will people see the development of policies that will benefit them in their daily lives. In the answer to the oral questions at the beginning of this debate, I set out what is going on and how the European Commission is using its powers to promote a minimum income in the Member States. You know better than anyone that the European Union has no direct power to legislate in this area. But we are using the tools available and we are encouraging the Member States to do the right and everything possible. In this context, I would like to reiterate the wide-ranging consultation on the European Social Pillar, in which Parliament is very actively participating, for which thanks. The aim of this wide-ranging debate is to develop a new frame of reference that we can use to review and screen the employment and social policies of the Member States and the European Union. In this way, we want to see whether social policy ensures sustainable systems that are financially sustainable and adequate systems that adequately protect people. As you know, in the new semester approach to social protection, we are emphasizing two points: sustainability and adequacy. I hope that this consultation will help to reach a consensus across Europe on the need for more convergence in the European Union, rather than upwards. At the end of the day, we need to come together with all levels a policy where people know that we are leaving no one behind. In the meantime, we in the Commission continue to row with the belts we have. The powers we have are maxims. We are also working on the development of reference budgets, which help Member States to develop the right policies and help us monitor the policies of the Member States. The exchange of good practice is an important part of this. I can assure you that the European Commission will not let go of this issue. But, as one of the esteemed Members of Parliament has said, if we want upward convergence, if we want everyone to have opportunities, then a minimum income alone is not enough. That will depend on our entire policy. Someone has also explicitly said that jobs must also be created, economic development must be achieved that enables growth and jobs. That is exactly what this Commission's policy is aimed at: jobs, growth, investment and security. You heard that again yesterday at the State of the Union.

Europeans face poverty for reasons such as long-term unemployment, low wages and weakening social security systems, especially in the countries most affected by the crisis. It is not normal when working people's income is not enough to ensure the dignified life of their families. Economic growth in itself has not reduced poverty and social exclusion, the crisis only exacerbates poverty, and the minimum income allows the protection of the most vulnerable. Minimum income schemes are an important and effective way of overcoming poverty, supporting social integration and access to the labour market and enabling people to live in decent conditions. I would also like to point out that, even at the time of austerity, minimum income schemes should not be seen as a cost-enhancing factor, but as a key tool to combat the crisis, since early anti-poverty investments bring the greatest benefits in reducing long-term societal costs. Thus, in order to meet the commitment to withdraw at least EUR 20 million under the Europe 2020 strategy, the commission will be able to meet its commitment to withdraw the aid. the threat of human poverty or exclusion in the European Union, the Commission must take concrete action and propose solutions that guarantee a minimum income across Europe in the fight against poverty.

Basic income is intended to safeguard a certain standard of living for all, to encourage employment and to reduce the bureaucratic burden of social assistance.

In 2000, I was part of a human rights organisation network that advocated for the adoption of anti-discrimination legislation at the EU level. When the two equality directives were adopted we considered it an historical moment, because discriminating against other human beings is one of the most despicable behaviours one could imagine. Sixteen years later, I have the privilege as a Member of this European Parliament to evaluate how the Employment Equality Directive has been implemented. In 2000, a duty was imposed on our Member States to provide protection against discrimination in the areas of employment and occupational and vocational training. It comes as no surprise that, while some Member States have gone beyond its requirement by extending protection against discrimination to other areas, including access to goods and services, others are still pretty far from implementing it at the minimum level. The report highlights the necessity of collecting equality data both at the level of Member States and the European Union in order to make it easier to prove the existence of discrimination and, particularly, indirect discrimination. There is quite a discrepancy between the levels of discrimination experienced and discrimination reported. Awareness-raising, with the help of equality bodies and the social partners, is of utmost importance at all levels of society considering that the victims themselves still have difficulty in recognising discrimination, let alone fighting it. I cannot stress enough the role of equality bodies in awareness-raising and data election in helping the victims but also the employers to understand how to change their policies in line with equality requirements. The impartiality of such bodies must be ensured and their activity supported, including through adequate funding. I particularly want to emphasise the issue of multiple discrimination, which is often a consequence of the existence of fragmented rules and standards across Member States. If it is difficult for the victims of one type of discrimination to understand the situation and act, we can easily imagine their difficulties when they face multiple discrimination. It is important to note that access to justice is still limited in many discrimination cases, and the report strongly recommends that the Member States ensure that victims can obtain accessible legal advice and assistance at all stages of the legal process, including confidential counselling in person by equality bodies or appropriate intermediaries. Legal redress is not only important for the victims, but it also has an educational impact on society because pursuing court cases and ensuring adequate representation are still problematic in some cases. We asked the Member States to find ways to help victims including, for example, by means of court tax exemptions or reductions or legal aid and assistance from specialised NGOs. In fact, it is important to recognise the legal standing of NGOs with a legitimate interest in the relevant judicial or administrative procedures. Sharing good practices among Member States is a must. Acknowledging the importance of fighting all forms of discrimination, I truly hope that this House will adopt this report with a large majority.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 46, "date": "2016-09-15.json", "name": "Marianne THYSSEN", "mepid": "1832", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, honourable Members, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Ms Weber, who prepared this comprehensive assessment of the application of the Employment Equality Directive. Discrimination on whatever grounds has no place in the Union. Therefore, the Commission is strongly committed to ensuring that non-discrimination directives are effectively implemented, so as to foster a fairer and more inclusive society, including labour markets providing opportunities to all. The draft outline of the European Pillar of Social Rights specifies that ‘labour market participation of under-represented groups shall be enhanced, ensuring equal treatment in all areas, including by raising awareness and addressing discrimination’. We cannot deny that recent statistics raised certain concerns. According to the 2015 Eurobarometer Survey on discrimination, there is at least a widespread perception of discrimination in the European Union. 64% of the respondents were concerned about discrimination on the grounds of ethnic origin, 58% for sexual orientation, 50% for disability and the same percentage for religious belief. However, we see positive developments. The survey shows, for example, that citizens are increasingly aware of their rights in this area, which is the first critical step in order to improve their enforcement. Our joint implementation report from 2014 on the Race and Employment Equality Directives concluded that they were correctly transposed by Member States. The report also pointed to the necessity of combining existing legislation with appropriate policy action by improving, specifically, awareness of rights, and indeed access to justice. Your report rightly highlights, among others, all these aspects. The Commission is committed to make full use of the Directive on many fronts. Let me mention just a few examples.  Firstly, we promote analysis and research on the situation across Member States through the yearly comparative report on anti-discrimination in Europe referred to in your report; through the report on sexual orientation-based discrimination; through the report on reasonable accommodation for disabled people in the employment context in the European Union; through the report on intersexual discrimination in EU gender-equality and non-discrimination law; and through the ongoing study on equality data collection. We are fully aware that producing these reports is in itself not a solution, but understanding patterns of discrimination is crucial for informed policy-making and enforcement.  Secondly, the High Level Group on Non-discrimination, Equality and Diversity facilitates the exchange of best practices. To improve awareness of rights and access to justice, we support the strengthening of the national equality bodies. We have run training, seminars and conferences such as the 2015 Colloquium on Fundamental Rights, which focused on tolerance and respect, preventing and combating anti-Semitic and anti-Muslim hatred in Europe, and the seminar focusing on multiple discrimination. Moreover, we collaborate and support various organisations active in the field of anti-discrimination – the Academy of European law, the European Union Fundamental Rights Agency and Equinet, the well-known network of national equality bodies for the promotion of equal treatment.  Thirdly, in the legislative field, the 2008 proposal for an equal treatment directive aims at extending the prohibition of discrimination on the grounds of religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation into areas not yet covered, among others the areas of social protection, social advantages, education, and access to and supply of goods and services. It would thus align the protection to that provided on the grounds of race. Directives prohibiting discrimination on grounds of sex do not cover social protection, social advantages and education, as you know. I trust the proposal will be adopted soon by the Council.  We have also achieved progress in the discussions on the proposed Directive for a European Accessibility Act, both in Council and in Parliament. Accessibility is a catalyst for the full and equal participation of people with disabilities in society. I would like in this context also to mention the intense work in relation to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and the forthcoming review of the European Disability Strategy.  Last but not least, in 2015 we proposed a full list of actions to advance on LGBTI. Let us not forget our European Court of Justice, that also plays an important role in clarifying the scope of European anti-discrimination law. For example, we are currently expecting important rulings on two pending cases relating to dismissals of female workers wearing Islamic headscarves in private firms.  Lastly, I want to stress that inclusive labour markets can only be achieved through a partnership approach involving all stakeholders. Public authorities can help people gain skills to get jobs and contribute to growth. Companies can commit to diversity and, as a result of diversity, benefit from enhanced productivity, innovation and performance. Trade unions, NGOs and academia can contribute valuable insights and help in spreading best practices on diversity and non-discrimination. Thank you for your attention.

It is necessary to ensure that people with disabilities can also enjoy the free movement of people, which is often not the case now. For example, workers with disabilities often face a variety of obstacles, including administrative obstacles, which workers without disabilities do not face. Unacceptable anyway!

First of all, I thank the rapporteur, Renate Weber, for her good report and for our cooperation. Indeed, this directive affects each of us in the European Union, every citizen of the European Union, both young and older, disabled, and a man or woman. It is particularly important to realise that demographic changes in Europe, as well as the increase in the retirement age, make the issue of age discrimination against older people increasingly relevant in the area of employment. Therefore, if we are already making decisions in the Member States to increase the retirement age, then we must ensure that our seniors have every chance of remaining in the labour market as full-fledged workers. I would also like to call on the Member States to ensure the protection of older workers against unfair dismissal in the event of retirement age, because the rights of older workers are often violated in the States. Another thing I want to draw attention to is that we are still failing to protect the most vulnerable members of society, people with disabilities, from discrimination. Some Member States are indeed in breach of this Directive by failing to adapt jobs for persons with disabilities, not providing adequate living and quality working conditions, and not ensuring equal opportunities in education and vocational training. We must therefore again call on the Member States to use the Structural Funds to adapt jobs and provide the necessary assistance to people with disabilities in the workplace. We also need to address the problem of harassment at work, which can arise for various reasons, both on grounds of sex and age, because of religious beliefs, which offends human dignity, which degrades, and ultimately makes it really difficult for an employee to work in such a working environment. I therefore believe that it is very important to disseminate information and to campaign for people on their rights and opportunities at work and in the labour market, as well as on the responsibility of employers towards workers. Many of our citizens do not even know what rights are provided for in this directive.

Some of the issues are more straightforward and can be measured more easily. These include, for example, the provision of reasonable accommodation for people with disabilities, the use of universal design in public places, the inclusion of social clauses in public procurement procedures, the need to conduct a review of upper age limits for certain jobs and act on them, and also the need for Member States to work towards ensuring mutual recognition of partnership status, matrimonial regimes and parenting rights. But, equally, some issues are very difficult and very sensitive. Some have a significant impact at national level sometimes because of culture, history or more recent events.

Namely, the issue of creating a diverse labour market aimed at all regardless of gender, sexual orientation, age, ethnicity, social origin, religion or disability. It is to me that action in the field of equality and equal treatment must be seen as a showdown with the discrimination that too many people experience. If we just look at the situation of women in the labour market, we see excessive differences in wages and conditions of employment, despite the fact that they have the same training and duties as their male colleagues. Similarly, our minority groups in society fight against prejudice, and often against ignorance, among possible bosses and future colleagues. It makes their way into the labour market far too difficult and sometimes almost impossible. Our society needs to adapt to today's cultural environments in order to put an end to discrimination that is still too many people experiencing.

We have new sections of the population, especially within the labour market, who are suffering from inequalities. These are, for example, people who have been forced to raise the retirement age and who are somewhat discriminated against because they do not have the skills to adapt to the change in the labour market, as well as those people who, as victims of the economic crisis, have lost their jobs at an age when it is very difficult to relocate within the labour market. , so it's important.

The report highlights the need for adequate training for all relevant stakeholders: from employees of authorities of all kinds to law—enforcement bodies, judges, prosecutors and lawyers. However, I am now thinking that we, as public representatives, could also benefit from such training because I have a hard time understanding how the implementation of a fundamental right, which is provided for by Article 10 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, could be a matter of subsidiarity. We have well-established European Court of Human Rights jurisprudence on the restriction of the fundamental right to a certain extent, but more than that should not be accepted. Moreover, I am wondering how we could accept the non-observance of court decisions: that contradicts everything I had learned and thought over the past 30 years about the meaning of the rule of law. I want to stress that, for me, adequate training not only refers to knowledge of legislation in court decisions but also includes training on understanding cultural differences and on acknowledging unconscious bias. Since 2007, when I became a Member of this Parliament, together with many colleagues I have been advocating the adoption of a horizontal anti-discrimination directive outlawing discrimination in access to goods and services across the EU.

I just might mention, in particular, our colleague Jean-Paul Denanot from the Committee on Budgets.  I suppose our role here was to assess the activities, the impact and the added-value of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) and, of course, to look to the future, to indicate what our proposals are for a more effective and more efficient EGF. I am grateful to colleagues for the engagement. The EGF is small fund compared to the ESF, for example; it is also a new fund. I think that gives us a sense that we can help to shape it in a positive way. In this report we look to see: how we can help to make it more effective; what partnership models will deliver better outcomes for redundant workers who have lost their jobs due to globalisation; how we can organise the process so that it responds in a more timely way to the needs of workers; how we can ensure better value for money for both the workers and for EU taxpayers; and how we can spend that money in a more efficient way; how can we ensure we have relevant data that allows us to assess the outcomes from the funds without placing undue requirements on Member States; and, of course, crucially, how we can help ensure personalised, well-coordinated measures that are tailored to the individual needs of the redundant workers. In that way we do two things: we express our solidarity with them at a difficult time and, secondly, we assist them in the transition to sustainable employment.  So what makes the EGF different to the ESF? Well, the EGF is meant to deal with emergencies, more short-term in its approach, while the ESF is more structural. Both have their advantages, and indeed it has been very positive to see how Member States use the ESF as a complementary tool to the EGF. We also propose that Member States need to achieve synergies between EGF and ESI funds. We emphasize that ESI funds can act as follow-up measures in EGF areas of support by stimulating investment and overall job creation. So what are the positives? Well, timelines have improved considerably due to efforts by all actors: the Commission, Member States, Parliament, etc. The self-employed are now included. NEETs can benefit from EGF support in numbers equal to the numbers of targeted beneficiaries. The EGF is now part of the shared fund management system, and I commend the Commission on this. Co-funding has been increased to 60%, more Member States are using EGF and spending, under personalised measures, has been lowered to 35%. Indeed, in many recent applications that spending is considerably less. The Court of Auditors tells us that nearly all EGF beneficiaries were able to benefit from personalised and well-coordinated measures. The re-employment rate is around 50%, and as Member States become more used to the fund, their applications are more timely. But there are still negatives: Member States don’t use the EGF often enough and, crucially, do not often use the derogation. Funding has been cut from 500 million to 150 million, budget implementation is only 55% but improving. There is a concentration of applications in the manufacturing, automotive construction and aviation sectors. We need to take a different approach to NEETs and to redundant workers. So it is important to design the EGF in such a way that it can respond to their needs. The Member States need to make publicly available all relevant information in regard to EGF cases, and they need to set quantitive reintegration objectives so that we can measure the success. Finally, the most important point is that the EGF must guarantee EU added-value for redundant workers and taxpayers. Then we can strongly call for its continuation and expansion.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 77, "date": "2016-09-15.json", "name": "Jean-Paul DENANOT", "mepid": "94282", "text": "  rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Budgets.

Second, the fund is in fact intervening in hindsight and procedures should be expedited. Third, and I think that is the most important thing, it would probably be better to be in prevention than in repair. That is why I am advocating for an anticipation of the changes brought about by globalization, technological changes and trade changes in the world as well.

The report is very useful to us. Indeed, despite several improvements introduced in the regulation for the 2014-2020 period and subsequently reflected in the functioning of the Fund, there is still a margin for additional fine-tuning. The EGF is an emergency instrument with its own role. I share your view that in its current shape and budget, the EGF cannot be an intervention tool for job losses as a possible result of EU trade agreements. Some of the issues highlighted in the conclusions of the Court of Auditors report and the evaluation of the EGF have already been addressed in the current regulation, for example, the use of EGF funding to compensate national workers’ income support schemes with no European added value. The former lengthy EGF approval procedure has been reduced from 41 weeks on average to a maximum now of 28 weeks. I welcome your appreciation for the Commission’s efforts to develop standardised procedures for the EGF applications and management using the functionalities of the electronic data exchange system, SFC. Since 3 August 2016, the reporting module for EGF cases is also available in SFC and I am confident that the expectations regarding reporting improvement will be fulfilled once SFC becomes fully operational for EGF cases.  We expect the first results of the ongoing EGF mid-term evaluation for the 2014-2020 period by the end of this year. They will cover the current derogation giving access to EGF co—funding also to NEETs in certain EGF applications. The average share of beneficiaries aged 55 or more was three times that of beneficiaries aged 15 to 24. The inclusion of NEETs as eligible beneficiaries of Globalisation Fund support in the current EGF regulation by way of derogation helps to counterbalance this tendency and is an expression of solidarity with young unemployed persons in regions with high unemployment levels. The Commission shares your view that the EGF should continue to provide assistance to NEETs who live in regions eligible under the Youth Employment Initiative after December 2017, the date of expiry of the derogation. I am happy to announce that the Commission just yesterday tabled a proposal for the extension of this derogation as part of the mid—term review of the multiannual financial framework.  I take note of your concern that workers made redundant by SMEs have fewer chances to be supported by the EGF than workers made redundant by large enterprises. However, applying for EGF co—funding in support of workers made redundant by large enterprises or SMEs belongs to national preferences. Some Member States apply this almost exclusively using the intervention criteria of Article 4.1(a). Other Member States, for example Spain, apply it mainly using the intervention criteria of Article 4.1(b), that cover cases of at least 500 workers being made redundant, particularly in SMEs all operating in the same sector and located in one or two contiguous regions. I would like to recall that the Commission has promoted regular peer reviews across national exchanges or partnering in order to exchange good practices and implementing experience since the start of the Fund. The meetings of the EGF contact persons that the Commission organises twice a year are an established way for Member States to exchange best practices. We will further support the sharing of information so that mutual learning among Member States here, too, is reinforced.

I thank her for her action. The WEF does help workers who have lost their jobs as a result of major changes in the global trade structure. It is therefore obvious that, in a context of globalization as we live it today, we must defend this instrument, even strengthen it, because everyone knows that there are winners in globalisation, but there are also more and more losers. I therefore plead for more resources, but also to increase the levels of intervention and to activate the clause of exceptional circumstances in order to be able to modulate aid according to needs on the ground. I am also advocating for more prevention and I am a little concerned about what Mrs Thyssen has just said. She says that the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund must not compensate for trade policies. However, Mrs Malmstrom says the opposite. In her general policy, Mrs Malmstrom noted that the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund should be used to compensate for the negative effects of trade. What is particularly interesting is that, in the context of trade impact studies, Mrs Malmstrom says that there are no negative effects. It is therefore quite pecral to hear diverging speeches at this point.  In yesterday's debate on Africa, there was the same ringing: there are no negative effects on agriculture. We know that there are negative effects. If we deny them, we can't anticipate them.

I will go to the principles: all asymmetric shock, every economic evolution, every hasty timely change generates times of transition; it's a dynamic where there are going to be winners and losers. And Mrs Arena is right to say that TTE, a big trade change, may have short-term losers. The good thing about the European social model is that we are responsible for supporting and helping these losers during the transition. In this sense, this Fund is fundamental. It is essential to strengthen it and use it well with a sense of employment, recovery and re-inclusion of disadvantaged areas. And, of course, I would put the \"ninis\", for example, among the social groups that we must recover. But what problem can this Fund have? This Fund may need to be made a little more horizontal, because the problem is when it allows discrimination between one company or another or between sectors or others.

To echo what some of colleagues have said, the EGF is a worthwhile and positive fund, and I support it. But this Fund is often used to compensate for the damaging effects of policies that have stemmed from the European Commission.  It has been the policies of deindustrialisation and unfettered free trade which in the main have created the need for the EGF. Not only have these policies caused job losses but their fallout has undermined workers’ rights and caused irreparable social damage. Within the report, I agree with the call for greater government transparency and the reference to a mid-term review at Member State level so that Member States can assess the progress of the EGF in their countries and identify issues early that might need intervention. In many countries, such as my own, Ireland, there has been a severe underspend of EGF funds and it does not become apparent until the end of the term when the monies are handed back. This is unfair to workers as they are the ones that suffer when the funding is not put to the best use. I also welcome the reference to creating stronger working conditions and working relationships with the community and voluntary sector, as they are the ones that are best placed to assess, particularly, the needs of NEETs, and to raise the awareness of EGF opportunities with them.

For us Greens, the European Globalisation Fund is an important social and labour market governance instrument when people lose their jobs and threaten to fall into the poverty trap as a result of globalisation or the economic crisis. It is also one of the few instruments by which the EU directly supports its citizens, where it is not the economy that is at the forefront, but the human being – as is worthy of a social union as we Greens aspire to it.  We Greens will therefore vote in favour of this report, and we would also like to make it clear that we are pleased that the report includes the establishment of a gender impact assessment, that is, that women and men benefit equally briefly – and in the long term from the EGF. And, of course, the Fund must not be a solution to a misguided trade policy, nor a solution to the wrong group strategies, nor should it be a substitute for preventive measures, as the previous speaker, Jean-Paul Denanot, quite rightly said.  In any case, the EGF also needs major reform. For example, workers from all Member States should also be able to benefit from the EGF, not just the best informed, not just those in the large corporations. The quality of jobs should also be increasingly brought to the fore, and loopholes for Member States, as has already been mentioned, should in any case be closed again. After all, benefits that must be borne by Member States in labour market and social policy must not be passed on to the EGF under any circumstances.

I mean, in other words, capitalism. Secondly, the fear of reactions to redundancies prevents such restructuring. As part of this, the Globalisation Fund undertakes to defuse them by sharing \"aspirins\". For this reason, the applicants for his help are mainly employers. Training programmes, i.e. subsidising employers with unemployment benefit for the unemployed, if they end up in a job, are much worse than the previous one: the subsidised micro-enterprises are closing down, while funds from the Fund are being deftly stretched.

One of the issues that we have unfortunately not been able to agree on is the requirement for the number of employees who have to be affected in order for the fund to be used. I have a concrete example, namely a food industry in southern Sweden, Findus in Bjuv in Skåne. With today's rules, it is uncertain whether we could mobilise the fund to help the employees of Findus. I think we have to do something about it. Even in cases such as this, where so many people are affected, where an entire industry is under pressure, the Fund should be able to play a greater role than it does today. We also need to look at how the EGF can be used to mitigate the circumstances of companies affected by trade disputes. The Commission has previously said that the Fund cannot be mobilised for this. Parliament's interpretation is that it can. What does the Commission say today? We must be able to agree on the application of the Fund. It is clear that we have also listened to the Trade Commissioner, Cecilia Malmström, who has opened up to such an interpretation.

Today, the European Globalisation Fund cannot be used to anticipate the consequences of global trade; it has been designed to react to concrete situations such as the closure of factories. My personal view is that anticipating is always better than repairing the damage. It is therefore logical that trade policy be well coordinated with social and industrial policy to prepare our economy in good time for the changes triggered by a new trade partnership. Today, as you know, the preparation of trade agreements includes a social impact assessment. A trade agreement must, of course, generate overall a positive outcome for both partners, but within the globally positive deal it is not excluded that certain sectors of our economies could suffer. In that respect, I share the view of Cecilia Malmström that something should be done to address possible negative effects of global trade on specific sectors and, as I said, the EGF in its current design is not fit for that purpose.  I want to reassure Members of Parliament that, as your President said, I will ensure that for all policies appropriate gender indicators are used to monitor the respect of gender equality in particular in the labour market and we will of course further reflect on the ideas in your report when preparing the legal basis for the functioning of the EGF beyond 2020.

I will not be able to respond to all of the issues raised, but I will try to address a number of them at least.  Commissioner, you started by agreeing that the EGF cannot be used as an intervention tool in job losses in the case of trade deals, and that was re-echoed by many colleagues, particularly Maria Reina who quite rightly challenged Commissioner Malmström for suggesting at some point previously that a small EUR 150 million per annum fund could deal with the negative fall-out from proposed trade deals. Many colleagues spoke of the need to anticipate and manage change, and I think we need to broaden our thinking to see if earlier action or pre-emptive action could be more effective. Some colleagues suggested that employers are using the EGF as a means of evading their legislative responsibilities. I reject this assertion as in all cases Member States guarantee that the dismissing enterprises have complied with all their legal obligations. We might wish that those legal obligations were more extensive, but that is a separate issue. The core point is that the EGF does not replace the responsibilities of companies; it is a solidarity mechanism from the EU and employers do not benefit.  I was really pleased to hear the Commissioner say that the Commission going to come forward with a proposal to extend the derogation on NEETs. Because this  a new facet to the EGF, we have not had time yet to assess its impact, but we need to ensure that measures targeting NEETs are tailored towards their needs, and in that context I thank my colleague, Lynn Boylan, whose amendment on ensuring community participation will, I believe, improve the participation of NEETs.  Commissioner Thyssen, you spoke of the derogations with regard to 4.1(a) and (b), but we also have 4.2 where, in exceptional circumstances, there can be applications from small labour markets. I just want to ask you if there is any bias against those applications – I would hope not. And I agree with colleagues who say that workers in SMEs have not had the same access as workers in larger companies. Finally, I believe that if the suggestions in this report, which represent a compromise from all across Parliament, are implemented, the EGF will be improved and will serve our workers in a more timely, targeted and efficient way.

This does not lead to the end of the drug trade, which leads to brutalisation and uncontrolled violence in society. The Philippine government must immediately ensure that the police and military comply with international legal standards and stop calling the population to lynch justice, as it were. Not only extrajudicial executions, but also torture and enforced disappearances must be independently investigated and those responsible brought before civilian courts.

Since the beginning of the term of President Duterte there has been progress – or at lease continuity – in some important areas. An indefinite ceasefire with the National Democratic Front was concluded, the peace process in Mindanao has been reinvigorated and the ratification of the partnership cooperation agreement (PCA) is ongoing.  These positive steps are overshadowed by the war on drugs declared by the President. The fight against drugs was the number one promise in President Duterte’s election campaign and remains highly popular. He also promised the reinstatement of the death penalty. According to the latest official figures, there have been more than 2 400 people killed either during or outside police operations between 1 July and 4 September.  Against the background of these figures, in various statements we have expressed our significant consensus in several meetings with high-ranking officials. However, necessary responses to the drug problem must be carried out in full compliance with human rights, the rule of law and the right to due process. We have also reiterated our principal position on the death penalty. President Duterte has repeatedly expressed his administration’s commitment to human rights and he has warned the police against any abuse of authority. In the coming weeks and months there will be several high-level meetings with the Philippines to discuss this further and to share our concerns. We will be alert to see how President Duterte’s commitments on human rights are applied. The High Representative, Federika Mogherini, is expected to meet with her counterpart twice over the coming weeks. The GSP+ monitoring mission is scheduled for before the end of the year. We will hear – and this is more or less in answer to a question – and we will underline that during the next monitoring period, 2016 to 2017, we have strong expectations that the Philippines will strengthen its human rights legal framework. Following the entry into force of the PCA, we will engage in a formal human rights dialogue. We are also looking at ways to provide further support to the Philippines in a comprehensive approach to combat drug trafficking in line with our shared values. And, of course, we will continue to work closely with the Filipinos on this and other issues.

In 2016, we are 25 years away from the overthrow of dictator Barre in Somalia, a reversal that, unfortunately, has opened up a new blood cycle that remains open. As a result of these 25 years of interracial violence, Somalia is one of the poorest countries in Africa, with a life expectancy of only 55 years and one-sixth of the population living outside its borders. The upcoming elections, which normally have to be held by the end of the year, do not seem to be able to improve the situation in the country. The major issue for Western states is therefore to keep al Shabaab Islamists out of power. However, with their interventions, foreign powers do not have a constructive effect, as the experience of the last 25 years shows. The best thing for the European Union to do, therefore, is to stay away and not get involved in political games that do not concern it.

Regarding education, let me confirm that I have already put in place emergency projects for education in the country, which we want to sustain and expand. You know that I focus on education – and especially in this area in Somalia – and I think it is important to insist on this project. Somalia often hits the headlines, seldom positively. However, following decades of civil war in the area, over the past few years we have witnessed progress – albeit a bit slow – towards state building and democratisation. The forthcoming electoral process will not take the form of universal suffrage, the electoral form familiar to us. Some 14 000 people will be involved and, while they will represent only a fraction of the population, it is an improvement from 2012 when 135 clan elders selected the members of parliament. This should be a stepping stone to ‘one person, one vote’ elections in 2020. Female participation and representation are paramount. The EU has, throughout, consistently insisted on securing a Somali commitment to 30% female representation in parliament. More than two decades of civil war have had a devastating effect on respect for human rights. Women, children and minorities in general, displaced persons and persons with disabilities have often paid the highest price. Abuse, domestic violence and discrimination against women are flagrant and, although Somalia has ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, children remain victims of all the parties to the armed conflict. The EU delegation started implementation of a new set of measures in 2016 through the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR), specifically targeting the nexus between human rights and security. One of the main aims is to develop a better connection between human-rights activists and organisations and the government, including the police, the legal profession and the judiciary, in order to provide high-quality, accountable and rights-based safety and security services for victims of sexual and gender-based violence, and thereby break the culture of impunity for the perpetrators of such crimes. On the death penalty also, it is disturbing that Somalia has ended the de facto moratorium. Capital punishment is a serious violation of human rights and dignity. As Somalia embarks on the electoral process, the UN published last month a timely report on the right to freedom of expression. Freedom of expression is key in building a democratic nation, and even more so in times of political transition, with a view to providing space for public debate. Somali journalists censured for such debate are continually attacked, and harassed and sometimes arrested. Media outlets are being closed and proper investigation and prosecution remain rare – leading to a general sense of impunity. These and other issues confirm that building functioning justice institutions is one of the most important tasks in terms of ensuring the rule of law in Somalia. Communities in areas recovering from the activities of al-Shabaab must benefit from peace dividends, including in the form of justice delivery after decades of being left at the mercy of these militants.

The European Union attaches great importance to strengthening the rule of law, human rights and the consolidation of democracy in Zimbabwe, as set out in the government's own constitutional reform agenda. These are essential elements of our relations, which underpin inclusion and sustainable growth and development. Since the creation of the government of national unity in 2009, the EU has taken successive steps towards easing measures applying to Zimbabwe in response to improvements in the human rights situation, such as the adoption of a progressive constitution in 2013, overwhelmingly endorsed by the people of Zimbabwe, and secondly, a peaceful election the same year with a general improvement in the governance and human rights situation. Zimbabwe is now at a critical juncture. The economy shows increasing signs of extortion, which is leading to an increase in social tensions and in violence at public protests. The EU has publicly expressed its concern at this increase in violence in a statement of 13 August. The freedom to demonstrate and present a petition is enshrined in the Zimbabwean constitution along with freedom of expression and it must be respected. The EU has called upon all parties to ensure that these rights are exercised peacefully and fully respected by the authorities. Furthermore, the European Union has fully associated itself with the statement of the Zimbabwe Human Rights Commission on public protests and police conduct and joins its call for the authorities to ensure that the perpetrators of human rights violations are prosecuted. Through the process of re-engagement, the EU has now a broader scope of engagement on human rights and democracy issues through development cooperation, through which it supports the judiciary and Zimbabwe's electoral commission, as well as the implementation of the provisions of the constitution.  The European Union remains fully supportive of the Government of Zimbabwe's ambition to re-engage with the international community and international financial institutions. Economic reforms alone, however, are unlikely to be sufficient in achieving full re-engagement. They will need to be accompanied by a demonstrable commitment to uphold the rule of law and human rights, as set out in Zimbabwe's own constitution.

This report deals with the proposal for a Regulation of Parliament and the Council on a European travel document for the return of third-country nationals who are undocumented in the EU. The aim is not only to try to stabilise the current migration crisis, but also to relieve pressure on Member States and European agencies, whose capacity and resources are, as we know, limited.

In order to improve this adverse situation and reduce irregular migration, it is therefore necessary to establish a single Union document with high-quality technical and security features that the authorities of third countries can better accept.

Relocation is a form of internal solidarity between Member States, while resettlement and other forms of humanitarian admission or reception are forms of external solidarity with third countries hosting the majority of refugees.

Hungary government has challenged a decision at the Court of Justice of the EUROPEAN Union to take in migrants, which ignores the European Council's resolution in favour of voluntary re-ingation. This way of distributing asylum seekers remains not an instrument for resolving the situation, since it is the sovereign right of each State to determine who it accepts on its territory. Furthermore, mandatory re relationalation increases the pull effect and does not respond to the treatment of secondary migration movements. However, the relocation does not work in practice, with only 4,741 people relocated from the mandatory 120,000-strong voluntary resettlement quota and the 40,000-strong voluntary resettlement quota since September 2015. In my opinion, Europe and refugees have the same interest: that refugees can return to their home countries as soon as the causes of their escape are reduced or eliminated. To do this, it is not the migrants that need to be brought here and distributed, but the help that needs to be brought there. In addition to Turkey, assistance to other states hosting large refugee camps is also needed.

As a result of this pressure, they are incapable of providing adequate protection to asylum seekers. This is confirmed by the European Parliament Resolution of 12 April 2016 on the situation in the Mediterranean, which underlines the need for a holistic EU approach to migration and calls for the development and diversification of migration flows towards the Union.

Last year, Parliament presented the same report and it was completely ignored by the Council. Fighting unemployment, especially youth unemployment, remains a major concern across Europe and, although it is the Member States implementing the requisite policies, a constructive dialogue between the institutions must take place to address this issue. The report underlines the need for a holistic approach to tackling unemployment and reducing poverty levels. It calls for the realisation of the objectives set in Europe 2020 and notes with concern that these have not yet been met.

Together with my colleagues in the 5Star Movement, we managed to build consensus within Parliament so that we could resubmit last year's guidelines as a whole, but introduced a paragraph of strong criticism of the work of the EU Council. The latter's approach has proved to be contrary to the spirit of the Treaties by having the effect of weakening cooperation between the Institutions of the Union.

Europe is not only the destination, but is also a transitional market for these goods and their illicit supply chains, and much can be done to tackle this across a range of policy fields. Therefore, whilst we take this international step forward, we should also look at the domestic market and continue to encourage all Member States to end trade in illicit goods, and specifically in ivory.

Firstly, the traceability of wild species: all parties need to introduce a system of electronic authorisations, which is also useful in the fight against corruption, which is a key factor in the illegal trafficking of endangered species of flora and fauna. Corruption can be detected at every point in the wild species trade chain and affects countries of origin, transit and destination, damaging the effectiveness, proper implementation and ultimate success of CITES. That is why we must insist on the introduction of robust and effective anti-corruption measures and on greater judicial cooperation between Member States.

That's a whopping 144,000 elephants. The description of elephants as \"living dinosaurs\" is therefore particularly striking. But the illegal trade has other disastrous and often deadly consequences: the trade spends billions of euros a year in the hands of criminals, militias and terrorist groups, creating insecurity and instability. Moreover, trade is increasing dramatically: the illegal ivory trade has tripled since 1998. A major fight against these criminal activities is needed to ensure the protection of species and safety.

This report concerns the application of the Postal Services Directive, which has been fully competitive since 2008. The use of e-mails reduces the sending of letters, but the use of the internet and online purchases increases the number of parcels delivered to the benefit of online sellers and parcel delivery drivers.  The report offers us a series of contradictions and the end of the public postal service. For example, it wants the total separation of the functions of postal operator and postal regulation, or it deplores the fact that international intra-EU trade is no longer developing, and therefore asks the Commission to ensure that domestic prices in states are closer to international prices at the risk of raising the price of domestic shipments to compensate for the decline in international prices.

Mr Ferber looks at the situation of postal services, which were fully liberalised in 2008. As soon as the Commission wanted to liberalise a public service, it hammered out the following argument: more competition would necessarily lower prices while guaranteeing the quality of service. In 2008, the French bought their stamp 0.55 euros to send a letter to France, as in many neighbouring countries. In 2016, it costs them 0.80 euros for a courier to France and 1 euro to Belgium, for example. That's a 45% and 80 percent increase, respectively. For couriers that arrive less quickly. As for the universality of the service, go ask what the many French people who live in towns and villages where the post offices have disappeared or reduced their opening hours. Nevertheless, the rapporteur believes that the market lacks liberalisation, deplores the predominance of the incumbent operator while competitors focus on the most profitable geographical areas and segments.

Parliament reiterates the importance of markets functioning more effectively, increasing the coherence of regulatory supervision of parcel markets and promoting competition. It also underlines the need to increase price transparency in order to reduce unjustified price differences and tariffs paid by individuals and small businesses, especially in remote areas. I give my positive vote for the adoption of this report because I agree with the guidelines defined here.

Other sectors such as e-commerce, publishing, mail order sales, insurance, banking and advertising depend to a large extent on postal infrastructure. The EU postal sector therefore remains a key factor contributing to social, economic and territorial cohesion as well as the development of the Digital Single Market.  In recent years, the postal market has undergone a profound transformation, resulting in a decrease in the number of letters sent, a rapid increase in the number of parcels delivered, related to the popularity of e-commerce and the emergence of new customer needs. The European Union must therefore adapt its regulations to these changes. First of all, the focus should be on improving the quality and accessibility of universal service provision and making cross-border parcel delivery more accessible.

The number of letters has declined in the European Union and between 2012 and 2013 the average rate of decline in the EU-28 was 4.85%.

This is because they increase the financialisation of the economy, thereby reducing macroeconomic stability and growth. Improving the financing of SMEs would also require a strengthening of regulation to curtail the strength of the financial sector and bring it under State control and to establish a clear link between lending activity and actual production. The typical role of SMEs is to meet local needs and to participate actively in the local economy. If an SME wants to enter the international market, it can usually only do so if it is strong on the domestic market. This includes financial security, which deteriorates to the extent that funds move away from the place of work.

It is these multiple factors that are different in individual Member States that need to be taken into account when designing appropriate policy measures aimed at diversifying funding opportunities for SMEs.  It is important to support access to finance for SMEs throughout their lifetime and appropriate action needs to be taken to support them in preparing for business transfers. Tackling and fostering bank lending channels is the most effective way to ensure and improve access to finance for SMEs, so I supported this report.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1256, "date": "2016-09-15.json", "name": "Andrejs MAMIKINS", "mepid": "124746", "text": "  in writing. ‒ Micro enterprises small and medium-sized enterprises play an important role in the European economy in terms of employment and growth.

The report's observation is consensual: SMEs suffer in their access to finance while they are a key driver of the economy, regulatory constraints weigh on them in particular, it is necessary to include the SME dimension in all texts of economic scope.  There are a number of relevant proposals, such as the need for appropriate rules to make public procurement more open to SMEs and micro-enterprises, the development of local banks or the compulsory arrowing of certain ECB funds available to banks to provide loans to SMEs.  But, as always, it is the Commission that is supposed to remedy this, while its proximity to the major industrial and banking lobbies is a prohibitive obstacle.

This initiative report is a reflection on how to improve the lot of SMEs in the EU. It is part of the Capital Markets Union approach, which has already led to the redesign of the prospectus directive to facilitate market access for SMEs by reducing the requirements for small issues.  The observation is consensual: SMEs suffer in their access to finance while they are a key driver of the economy, regulatory constraints weigh on them in particular, it is necessary to include the SME dimension in all texts of economic scope.  The solution proposed by the Capital Markets Union is to facilitate alternatives to bank credit, i.e. financial markets and crowdfunding.

Rightly then, the report also emphasises the role of young entrepreneurs. It is they who will be more amenable to seeking out and trying non-traditional ways of mobilising financial support. Promotional and educational programmes specifically targeting young entrepreneurs, when launching new financial tools for SMEs, should have greater traction than with other sectors. That will have carry-forward effects since, as new generations come on stream, financing decisions will increasingly be tilted away from exclusive reliance on banks and toward other avenues.

This is not the problem of the rapporteur, who is supposed to look at a limited section. A holistic approach must come to the conclusion that the problem lies solely in the euro. The euro-zone provides a single interest rate for all SMEs. In view of the different regulatory and cultural frameworkconditions, it is quite clear that credit risks must be very different, for example in Portugal and the Netherlands. Until the introduction of the euro, these different conditions were satisfied by an individual interest rate from the national central bank. The euro has destroyed this mechanism. Now there is a euro that, as an average product, offers the soft-currency countries too harsh an interest rate environment, and provides financing subsidies in the hard currency countries, right down to the point of bubble formation.

While it is necessary to strengthen the banking channel, make it more reliable and adapt it to the specific ities of SMEs, alternative methods must be offered to put an end to excessive dependence on banks. The report analyses a number of possibilities for increasing funding for SMEs, some of which are unsustainable. Firstly, the Capital Markets Union, which, through greater financialisation of the economy, represents a major risk for SMEs and small operators who will have to deal with opaque and complex financial instruments. A return to securitisation, another risk factor par excellence, is also recommended. It endorses the EFSI plan, despite its complete inefficiency.

Some states, a significant proportion of their active population, work abroad, typically in EU Member States in Western Europe, reducing structural labour shortages in these countries.  The answer to this phenomenon may not be to close down, to reduce work abroad by all administrative means, but to increase wage levels in the new Member States.

On the other hand, it should be borne in mind that these jobs are not always of good quality. The sources of this situation should be looked for in the difficult situation of this segment of companies. Member State governments very often give preference only to multinational corporations by offering them special legal status and tax credits, and these privileges are not granted to local, small and medium-sized entrepreneurs. This unequal competition forces them to reduce their labour costs. Therefore, if we want to improve the labour market situation, we should first of all support small and medium-sized enterprises in their unequal fight against global corporations. This will not only create new jobs, but also improve the quality of existing ones. In this context, it also appears that the European Commission must assess the impact of the decision to grant market economy status to China on the quantity and quality of jobs in the small and medium-sized enterprises sector in Europe. There is a high risk that a positive decision on this issue will contribute to the deterioration of the situation of small and medium-sized enterprises and thus to the deterioration of the situation on the European labour market.

Although it does not directly call for the elimination or reduction of minimum wage standards, it says that \"high labour costs\" are one of the most important restrictions on job creation in the SME sector. It implicitly calls for an exemption from regulatory rules for SMEs, and suggests the move from direct imposition to indirect, clearly regressive taxation. It also stresses the importance of temporary employment in the SME sector and \"urges the Commission and Member States to support all forms of temporary employment\". That is why we voted against it.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "GUE/NGL", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1361, "date": "2016-09-15.json", "name": "Joëlle BERGERON", "mepid": "124740", "text": "  In writing.

Despite internal market rules, there are still significant differences in the regulatory framework for SMEs within the European Union, in particular as regards the stability and security of this framework.

Another major point that the report also agrees with is that there are large regional disparities and imbalances when it comes to SMEs’ access to funding and investments.

We know that unemployment of young people is present in EU countries especially in the east, south and central Europe, while in the western part small and medium-sized enterprises are among the main activities in the EU and we can call them the backbone of the EU economic system.  What makes the difference between Central Europe in the development of SME and other parts of Europe is a system that prevents the development of such a form of activity, which is limited by various administrative and regulatory barriers in other parts of Europe. This approach to small and medium-sized entrepreneurship is not good and encourages the departure of young educated people to western parts of Europe and puts pressure on.

The fundamental problem that we have not found an effective solution to is the lack of awareness of a discriminatory situation, both on the part of victims and of those who discriminate.

Therefore, specific action is needed on the part of the Union, the Member States and the social partners to promote knowledge of discriminatory behaviour and practices in the field of employment. Raising awareness will eliminate many pathological situations at a relatively low cost.

I believe that these events have a negative impact on social cohesion and respect for the fundamental rights on which the European Union is based. I regret that, despite positive results on some issues such as the inclusion of people with disabilities, the number of discriminatory incidents against Muslims and LGBT people are increasing. In this respect, It seems to me appropriate to increase the resources allocated to the national bodies responsible for awareness-raising campaigns. I also believe that these organisations should provide information and legal assistance in order to increase the number of complaints by victims of discriminatory incidents.

The document sees, inter alia, a threat to EU citizens legally employed in another Member State in the context of the free movement of services, in particular workers from Central and Eastern Europe. Instead of defining the concept of 'social dumping', the report sought to define the posting of legally employed workers to another EU country as social dumping. Under existing EU legislation, the report seeks to blur the status of legally posted workers to another Member State, as well as those providing cross-border services, typically hauliers, including undeclared workers and those working in the domestic, nursing and care sectors (in particular home care). As is well known, the proportion of posted workers in the EU is less than 1% of the EU labour market. The question arises as to why the European Commission forced the start of a review of the legislation in relation to posted workers when the deadline for transposition had not yet expired. It is also a well-known fact that western European businesses are much more capital-strong, while in Central and Eastern Europe, lower wage costs are one of the main elements of competitiveness.

One wonders why so many immigrants flock to Europe every year. By masochism, no doubt. Despite her distrust of the numbers, Ms. Weber uses some of them, which she considers reliable because they go in her direction, even if they have only a tenuous relationship with the subject: homosexuals who do not hold hands or Jews who do not wear symbolic clothing in public, without being told whether it is by choice or fear. , and out of fear of who. Minorities who are or say they are discriminated against.

Although many countries have included the prohibition of discrimination in their legal systems, this law is still not fully applicable. The labour market is one of the areas where discrimination occurs. This is illustrated, for example, by the fact that women are more affected by unemployment than men. It is mainly about pregnant women and mothers. This also applies to older people, among whom the unemployment rate is very high, and yet they can enrich companies with their experience and knowledge. In order to deal with this problem, we must seek to eliminate all forms of discrimination, not just those on the labour market.

Discrimination affects all aspects of people's lives and employment is just one of them. Any evolution involves change and our society must adapt to today's cultural contexts. The work environment must also be adapted; to do this, the Commission and the Member States should not only focus on legislation, but also on creating a work culture and on the well-being of everyone.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1672, "date": "2016-09-15.json", "name": "Pavel TELIČKA", "mepid": "124706", "text": "  in writing. ‒ The Employment Equality Directive was created to protect against discrimination on grounds of religion or belief, age, disability and sexual orientation in the areas of employment, occupation and vocational training.

I also agree that although the female reintegration rate is higher than that of men, in the case of women it is a mostly provisional and unstable reintegration of work because she must meet family care obligations while looking for a new job or attending professional recycling courses , as well as the lack of affordable and quality childcare and care for the sick.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1714, "date": "2016-09-15.json", "name": "Dominique BILDE", "mepid": "124771", "text": "  In writing. This report covers the activities, impact and added value of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund between 2007 and 2014. The WEF was established in 2007 to support the reintegration of workers in disadvantaged regions and sectors by opening up to international competition. The aim is to finance actions aimed at supporting the reintegration of laid-off workers into the labour market in addition to national arrangements, not by substituting them. Several problems: variable re-employment rates, difficulty in assessing efficiency and aid paid mainly to workers in large companies, not smes or self-employed people. The problem is that the European value of the EGF remains low. While the Fund is intended to enhance the effectiveness of national measures, one-third of THE funds allocated under the EGF are used to offset national worker income assistance programmes. Nevertheless, it remains effective in supporting groups or sectors that are not well-recognized at the national level. The WEF compensates for the destructive effects of globalization on workers, a globalization desired by the Free Trade Union.

The framework of this fund was extended in 2009-2011 and beyond after 2013. Although it is generally the case that people who lose their jobs need to be helped, it is also necessary to monitor whether the money spent is delivering results, whether it has helped redundant workers to re-employ themselves and whether these funds could be used in a different way with greater success.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I know that the Commissioner is late – not through his fault – but I am sure he will join us in concluding our speeches.  First of all, however, I would like to express, on behalf of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Common Security and Control, our full opposition to the fact that this debate, in accordance with our initial request, should have taken place at a much better time this week. It had not been possible and we had agreed on the first week of October. It is by no means fair that on Monday, without notifying the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Common Security and Control, nor myself, it was decided by the Presidency to propose another agenda which sees our debate brought forward to Thursday afternoon, not allowing many colleagues in the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Common Security and Control, as they would have liked, to participate. I have a duty to say this, because this must not happen again.  I would also like to say, going into the substance, that we are precisely in The European Week of Sport, the second edition after last year's. I would like to remind you that we inaugurated it with Commissioner Navracsics and the Slovak Presidency on 10 September in Košice, and it has reached an important stage because it is becoming an important event for young people, associations, all European sportsmen and women, but also for those involved not only in sports activities but also in physical and amateur activities. It is also interesting to see how the motto \"Be active\" suitably chosen, has been activated in many forms in European cities, starting from those involved in the beautiful experience of European capitals and cities of sport.  We agree with the Commissioner's announcement that the date of the European week should be moved forward from next year in order to involve schools more and provide greater organisational capacity, but he will have to take more advantage of the European fact of this initiative, and therefore its transborder character, by accustoming European citizens to do so with national flags, but also with European flags, as Elisa Di Francisca has effectively done. , in Rio, in the Olympics.  In this spirit, we have promoted many initiatives, including one here in Strasbourg, the exhibition 'Run for art', and then in September, on the 27th, there will be a conference promoted with many colleagues, including preparing the report of Mr Takkula's Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Common Security and Reformist Party on the universal language of sport. A language that these days is giving us extraordinary emotions in the Paralympic Games in Rio, with young people asking to be seen as athletes, and not as disabled, and with the victory of gold medals, yesterday, of great athletes, including Alex Zanardi.  Unfortunately, however, there is also the downside, there is a dark side to sport that Parliament has already addressed in the first Fisas report in 2011 and which we now want to address together with the issue of good governance, integrity and also accessibility in the Takkula report. We know that the manipulation of sporting events, linked to illegal betting, which is increasingly taking place online, is manifesting itself in scandals that have mainly affected football – but unfortunately not only, for example tennis and other sports – and constitute a real threat to the integrity, fair competition and credibility of national and European sport.  I would remind you that in December 2012 the Committee on Culture organised a public hearing on this very issue, on combating rigged meetings and on financial fair play, and in March 2013 it also adopted a resolution on the subject. I am delighted that in the same year the Council of Ministers authorised the European Commission – and this is an important turning point in the Treaty of Lisbon – to participate on behalf of the European Union in the negotiations that then went ahead with a process that led to the proposal to ratify the Council of Europe Convention against the Manipulation of Sports Competitions, which was opened in 2014 to the signature of individual Member States.  What are we asking for in our question? We call on the Commission to overcome these last difficulties, which prevent us from reaching all the Member States that sign and ratify this important Convention, and above all that we take those steps on the part of everyone – I very much hope in the Slovak Presidency, but also in the next Maltese Presidency, which is directly concerned – so that we really do not want to achieve harmonisation. , but at least to common rules that allow, in the face of what is now a transborder crime, which goes beyond both the national countries, the nation states and Europe itself, to be able to take joint initiatives, because that is now the dimension and we absolutely must be able to meet this challenge by promoting common education programmes. , prevention, investigation, punishing with harmonised rules criminal affairs – a real black economy – and the crimes that created this completely illegal illicit betting market.  I therefore believe that at this point it is also necessary to harmonise the rules of the gaming industry, which are one of the factors that is contrary to the fact that some countries are party to this Convention. This step must be taken. In conclusion, any action that the Commissioner and the Commission will take in this area, including at the cultural and educational level, will certainly find us willing to help and support these initiatives. I naturally hope that all Member States will be part of them.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1863, "date": "2016-09-15.json", "name": "Bogdan Brunon WENTA", "mepid": "124903", "text": "  On behalf of the PPE Group. – Madam President, i voted in favour of the report by Mrs Schwab At the outset, I would like to support what Mrs Costa said – we are here at this time, but let us move on to the substance. The aim of the Convention is to prevent, detect and combat the setting of the results of sporting competitions and the manipulation of sporting competitions. It calls on governments across Europe to take measures to prevent conflicts of interest between sports betting operators and sports organisers and to encourage sports betting regulators to step up the fight against fraud and illegal betting activities.  We appreciate the European Commission's commitment to the negotiation process and the proposal for the European Union to sign the Convention. Unfortunately, its entry into force has now been delayed. This is a very bad signal, especially as there is broad support from the Member States for the rapid entry into force of this Convention. Some countries are already ready to ratify it, but they cannot do so because of the EU's internal procedural issues and the political opposition of one Member State, which the President has already mentioned, Malta.  For more than 4 years, the European Commission has played a central role in the preparation and negotiation of this agreement. That is why it is now time to take political steps and decisions that will break this deadlock and lead to the entry into force of this Convention. Match-setting is a serious threat, it is a disease that destroys the integrity of the sport, seriously violates the values and trust of fans in their favorite teams or clubs. This problem affects many sports today, although in most cases this negative phenomenon specifically affects sports such as cricket, football or, as mentioned here, tennis.  The European Parliament has repeatedly emphasised its commitment to the fight against match-setting in online gambling resolutions (2009 and 2011), match-setting and corruption in sport (2013) and in resolutions on corruption in an organisation such as FIFA in 2015. In particular, Parliament stressed that the online gambling market 'is not a market like any other because of its risks in protecting consumers and combating organised crime'. That is why we have repeatedly called on sports organisations to take a zero-tolerance policy on corruption and to establish a 'common definition of corruption or sports fraud'. The Council of Europe Convention on combating the manipulation of sports competitions, which Parliament will of course support, is crucial in the fight against these problems.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 1, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1864, "date": "2016-09-15.json", "name": "Nicola CAPUTO", "mepid": "124851", "text": "  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, rigging matches is a real threat to sport, because it undermines values such as integrity, loyalty and respect for others and risks alienating fans and supporters from organised sporting activities. Rigged matches are often the preserve of organised crime operating on a global scale. This is a problem that has now become a priority for the sports movement and for law enforcement authorities around the world.  I very much welcome the fact that European funds have been allocated to public-private partnerships for the implementation of projects aimed at identifying risk factors for rigged matches and the development of tools for their management. I also very much welcome european regulations on online gambling and the creation of a European discussion platform for national gambling regulators, but that is not enough.  The European Union must play a greater role in the fight against match fixing. We have two organisations in Europe dealing with cross-border cooperation in the detection and prosecution of serious crimes: Europol and Eurojust. The Commission can call on these agencies to cooperate more closely with the sporting movement and pay more attention to match fixing. Member States should implement measures to prevent conflicts of interest between betting operators and sports organisations and to encourage sports betting regulators to step up the fight against fraud and illegal betting.  The European Parliament has on several occasions highlighted its commitment to match fixing, reiterating its full support for the Council of Europe Convention on the Manipulation of Sports Competitions, which is, in my view, the best instrument and legal framework for combating illegal sports betting at international level.  I think it is essential that the European Union and its Member States are involved in the establishment of a monitoring system and in the development of operational cooperation within the framework of the Council of Europe Convention on the Manipulation of Sports Competitions from the moment of its entry into force. I would remind you that Article 165 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union calls on the Union and the Member States to promote cooperation with international organisations in the field of sport, in particular with the Council of Europe. The European Union's action can make a decisive contribution to addressing the transnational challenges facing sport in Europe, such as match fixing, which require joint efforts and a coordinated approach.  One of the main objectives of the Council of Europe Convention on the Manipulation of Sports Competitions is to promote national and international cooperation. Chapter 3 of the Convention lays down a number of provisions to facilitate the exchange of information between all interested parties. The fight against rigged matches requires close cooperation between sports movements, governments, betting operators, law enforcement authorities and international organisations, and such a wide range of stakeholders is in itself a challenge. The European Union can help to create unity and ensure a more coordinated approach. The Member States are at different stages in the development of the fight against match fixing. The transnational nature of rigged matches is likely to involve cooperation between Member States with different levels of experience, creating the need for sharing good practice and developing skills. In this, the European Union plays an important role in capacity building as a catalyst for cooperation and ultimately as a support for the implementation of the Council of Europe Convention on the Manipulation of Sports Competitions.  There is broad support from the Member States for the rapid entry into force of the Convention, and some are ready to ratify it but have simply not been able to do so because of procedural issues all within the European Union. I would therefore like to ask the Commission what further steps it intends to take to break this deadlock and to allow Those Member States that have played a key role in the preparation of the Council of Europe Convention on the Manipulation of Sports Competitions to sign and ratify it as soon as possible.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1865, "date": "2016-09-15.json", "name": "Emma McCLARKIN", "mepid": "96919", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Group. –  Madam President, colleagues, let me begin by thanking the Committee on Culture and Education coordinators for putting together this oral question on illicit match-fixing. I regret that the Commissioner is not here to hear what we have to say this afternoon, and indeed that there are not more Members here. Perhaps a better time could have been found, because match-fixing poses a significant and worrying threat to sport, something that so many of us love.  For fans to follow their sport with a passion that we all want to see, it is necessary that they have the confidence and that any attempts to corrupt sport are cracked down on. They need to know the integrity of sport is there. The ECR are therefore supportive of the Council of Europe Convention and have a strong commitment to tackle match fixing. Match-fixing remains a black mark on sport with around EUR 12 million paid to players, referees, coaches or officials in order to influence matches in 2012 alone. In the last three months, 24 matches were deemed suspicious based on betting patterns across a variety of sports in Europe. Sport must remain inspirational and a showcase for the very best in human endeavours. we should therefore be doing all that we can to encourage Member States to combat match-fixing, but we should also be pushing for stronger cooperation and partnerships between the sports betting industry and sports governing bodies. It is our collective responsibility and one we must do together. But for this very reason the ECR has not been able to support this oral question because it singles out one nation. It dismisses the concerns of a nation that questions the legal clarity and definition of illegal sports betting. We must work together constructively between nations, between our public and private partners and at all levels within sport from the grassroots to the very top to protect the integrity of sport.

So I will do my best. On behalf of the ALDE Group I would like to welcome this very important oral question regarding a serious integrity problem in sports. In modern English, match-fixing is normally understood as the act of arranging the outcome of a match even before it has been actually played. It is obvious that match-fixing is widespread internationally, and this problem also concerns illegal gambling and organised crime. Match-fixing is a way of undermining fair sport. It is also a great temptation for sportspersons and a great threat to those of them who have to resist pressure from criminals. Chris Eaton, director of sport integrity at the International Centre for Sport Security has said that football is in a disastrous state, with the fixing of matches for the purposes of criminal gambling and fraud absolutely endemic worldwide. It is a daily occurrence. However, this is a problem not only for football, but also for other sports as well. On the regional level, we would like to highlight the Council of Europe Convention on the Manipulation of Sports Competitions. We call all on all Member States to ratify it immediately, if they have not done so already. Furthermore, Member States should establish match-fixing as specific criminal offence and ensure that match-fixing and corruption in sport are subject to judicial proceedings. We would like also to stress the importance of data sharing between sports bodies, public authorities and licensed betting operators. It is essential to detect, investigate and prosecute all forms of match-fixing. Last but not least, we believe that it is hard to overestimate the importance of an awareness-raising campaign, which also may assist us to fight match-fixing. We are looking forward to receiving the Commission’s response to this question and a concrete proposal from the Commission on how match-fixing can be tackled efficiently in the Union.

It seems timely and necessary. We address it to the Commission, I say, but we could also address it to the Council and address it to each Member State, and surely address it to ourselves. Surely also some Member States more than others, and one in particular: Malta. We should therefore begin by somehow embarrassing ourselves a little collectively because this question still needs to be raised; because this oral question is necessary and relevant; because we are still pending ratification of the Convention. We know everything, we have the information, we have an alleged political agreement, we have the will expressed by everyone, but nothing happens and procedural issues or the known issue of opposition from a state are alleged. Both explanations seem completely unacceptable to stop collective ratification. And we also know that everything remains the same or worse, that the reality is the same as when this Parliament adopted a resolution in 2013 or when the Council of Europe adopted the Convention in 2014. One might wonder, in that regard, whether, for example, FIFA scandals are directly or indirectly related, near or far, to what we are talking about. Illegal sports betting is an increasingly secondary branch of organized crime and pollutes more and more sports, as has just been said. This issue—believe me—is a black hole in our collective responsibility. We have worked in tax evasion, we have worked on the investigation into Luxleaks and now on the roles of Panama, we prepare Directives on money laundering, and we also know that this activity, this business, this organized crime would be impossible without the necessary activity of financial institutions and telecommunication services that must provide the necessary means of payment to make it possible. It is time for us to go into it thoroughly, and I also believe that we should, in order to finish, add a dimension to it, which we have not talked about and which is certainly not part of the question and does not have to be, although perhaps this is an opportunity to consider it, which is the tax aspect associated with the sports betting sector. Do we know what turnover we're talking about? Shouldn't this European Union, this Commission, have an estimate of what this entails and the tax cost to the whole european Union resulting from the lack of regulation of the sector? Could we not include a first effort in the Commission's response, in the active response to estimate that turnover of online betting and the tax performance that each country and the whole of Europe should expect? So we could, perhaps, propose adequate tax treatment, which can only be raised, by the way, in the area, at the very least, of the European Union. I'm done, President. If we do not do all this, I am afraid that even if we were to achieve universal ratification of the Convention, everything would follow or could remain more or less the same.

Delaying the entry into force of the Council of Europe Convention on the manipulation of sporting competitions seems to me to be a missed opportunity to restore citizens' lost confidence in the world of sport, especially at a time when scandals are taking place almost daily in the vast majority of sports. About a year ago in this very Parliament, we in the 5-Star Movement denounced the scandal that has affected the world of football, in which, as you will recall, the leading representatives of the International Football Federation were involved. Even then, we called for a reversal of course, something that would bring the world of sport back to its real and basic vocation, that of aggregating, of uniting, of a return to the culture of sport, which embodied those values of equality, loyalty and social integration that are the basis of civil society. In recent years, the increased commercialisation of sporting events and their media exposure have fostered a substantial increase in economic interests, turning every sporting competition into a mere means of achieving ever greater profits. Criminal organisations, of course, have sniffed the possibility of profit and have begun to act, first at national level, then at transnational level, becoming, in fact, surveillance something extremely complex.  It can be inferred from the recent scandals that the efforts and measures carried out so far have not had the desired effect and the motivation is the lack of cooperation between the various countries. To avoid, like Don Quixote, continuing to fight against windmills, we need teamwork based on information sharing and best practices. I have been informed by the president of the Rugby Intergroup of a remarkable initiative: it is called Keep Rugby Onside and consists of an online information portal to educate and protect players, coaches, race officials from the dangers of betting and rigged matches. I therefore call on the Commission, when it arrives, to do everything in its power to overcome this impasse and to bring about the rapid entry into force of the Convention, which is the first real step towards greater cooperation in the fight against the manipulation of sporting competitions. I would like to point out that the failure to ratify international conventions by opposition of one or more Member States in the Council, in worthy cases such as this, is a real insult to the 500 million citizens we represent. Enormous pressure is being exerted in this House and enormous sacrifices are being demanded in the name of a general interest of the Union, but strangely enough when the interests in question are those of the citizens of Europe, this House is all too often silent. The deafening silence of many in the case of the shameful, for example, failure to ratify the Marrakesh Treaty is just one of many examples that is still being added to and repeated today with the Convention on Sports Manipulation.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1869, "date": "2016-09-15.json", "name": "Michaela ŠOJDROVÁ", "mepid": "124710", "text": "   – Madam President, we have asked this question to tackle the fight against the manipulation of the results of sports matches, because we want to stop the abuse of sport for individual and organised illegal enrichment. This endangers sports competitions in which the best are to win.  Sport is not only fun, but it is an activity that is beneficial individually, but also socially. Corruption and manipulation of results harm sport by demotivate athletes, demotivate fans who may lose confidence and also lose their willingness to support the sport.  Manipulation of results is therefore a topical and poignant problem, and this is also linked to illegal betting practices that need to be countered. The need to cleanse sport of these ills, which go against the principle of sports ethics and break down the fundamental values on which sport is exposed, is therefore appropriate at the moment. The Council of Europe Convention on combating the manipulation of sports competitions is an appropriate tool to tackle these problems and to address them effectively. Match fixing is an international problem and it is therefore appropriate that we also address it at the level of the European Parliament. I very much welcome the work of the Commission and the possibility for the European Union to sign this Convention with the Council of Europe. I stress that most Member States have already expressed their support and the close entry of this convention into palatality is therefore ready. However, what is worrying is the situation in Malta's approach, which is preventing the process from ending so far.  I therefore strongly urge that the process of accession to the Convention should not be hampered, that steps be taken so that it is signed by the European Union as soon as possible and can be applied.

In general, the practice of the Commissioner coming to the chamber in the middle of a discussion does not stand up to any criticism. In fact, this attitude towards the issues to be debated here in Parliament, I do not know... I can only ask a rhetorical question... or the Commissioner to spit simply on what the heart goes for.  On this subject, I can tell my fellow members that the business of making illegal and legal bets is tempted by many athletes and coaches not to engage in sports, but to engage in fraud with the results of a sporting competition and to make money with it. This process is extremely dangerous for many reasons. Firstly, fraud itself is a crime that results in materially suffering the population. Secondly, such action undermines public confidence in public institutions, as they cannot effectively prevent this type of crime. Thirdly, it discredits sport as such. One of the most important functions of sport is the propaganda of a healthy lifestyle, especially among young people, and if fraud reaches large volumes and sports competitions become chemists who invent new forms of doping, or the result of the competition becomes a commodity in itself, sport can be irreversibly discredited in the eyes of young people and its positive potential is greatly reduced.  The characteristic of such crimes is that they are usually of an international nature. That is why the European Union has a duty to engage in the fight against this type of crime. Without coordination or without a common approach, a significant result cannot be achieved. A good instrument has already been developed: the Council of Europe Convention against the Manipulation of Sport Competitions, to which the European Union could join.  The Convention provides for the introduction of certain standards at international level affecting national institutions, sports organisations and gambling operators, as well as the establishment of an international body for effective supervision. This document summarises international practice, based on world experience on how to combat such violations in sport, and also calls for criminal liability in national legal frameworks for more serious crimes. Unfortunately, the entry into force of the Convention has now been postponed. Many Countries of the European Union are prepared to ratify the Convention, but this process is hampered by the internal procedural issues of the European Union and by some differences in national positions.  I would like the European Commission to be more actively involved in this matter. Clearly, not everything depends on the Commission, because the Member States also play an important role in this process. But I would like to call for everything in the Commission's power to be done so that positive changes can still happen.

Along with doping, it ranks as one of the most serious problems of our time. According to Interpol data, only for the period of one year between June 2012 and May 2013 there was data on settled results in 70 countries, and only in the field of football. The International Football Association has presented evidence that organised crime earns over €13 billion from this type of activity and sees it as a safer alternative to the drug trade, prostitution and trafficking in human beings. According to Interpol, sports betting attracts around one trillion euros a year, with nearly three-quarters of that amount pledged to football. Although football and tennis are the most frequently affected sports, similar practices have unfortunately been observed in recent years in boxing, basketball, handball and volleyball. Settling sporting outcomes undermines confidence in sport and can seriously undermine sporting values.  I believe that the Council of Europe Convention on the Manipulation of Sports Competitions has the potential to become one of the important, if not one of the most important documents and instruments in this field.

And especially the rigging of results since the betting started. But it started back in ancient times. So, match-fixing has been going on since the ancient Olympics. Since then, humanity has failed to solve this problem. And how are we going to solve it today, when there's so much money spinning in that dirty business? I'm not sure we're just going to work it out and maybe it'll take a few hundred or thousand more years.  Namely, today it is evident that we still have a number of scandals present in the sports that we all love. Of course each of us will mention football. I will never forget one game that was in 1982 between then West Germany and Austria when, by fixing the results of those two countries, those two teams, they actually agreed to prevent Algeria from going further in the world competition. A German fan burned the German flag, the Algerians threw money into the pitch and showed how they felt about such match-fixing.  It is already known at the US Open in tennis or the Australian Cup. One good example is known, the example of tennis player Novak Djokovic who, when offered money to set one tennis score, reported it to the tax authorities, reported it to the police and showed that there is also fair play in sports, that there are those who do not want money at all costs and that they are not bribeable and fortunately so in relation to these thieves we are fighting there is also a lot. However, let's not forget that the issue of match-fixing in various sports is from the top, as I said from national teams, from the Bundesliga, from the Premiership, from all the big leagues of world football to the smallest ones, to those little leagues that are played, so to speak, in certain small regions within the European Union or the world. There are score-fixing everywhere. Not to say that there have been horrific situations – it is known when three Lebanese referees were once convicted for asking for sexual favors for their match-fixing in football. There was that, too.  So, what I wanted to emphasize with this speech is that we have before us one great neman that will not be easy to contain and I am convinced that our message to young people and our message to the fans must be the same. We want to reduce this evil as much as possible, and of course the preconditions are the engagement of the European Commission, the engagement of the Member States, the signing of the Council of Europe Convention and the credibility in all this.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1873, "date": "2016-09-15.json", "name": "Seán KELLY", "mepid": "96668", "text": "   – Go raibh maith agat a Uachtaráin, fáilte romhat, a Choimisinéir, déarfainn go raibh cuid de na feisirí beagáinín ródhian ort.

Madam President, the Lisbon Treaty has given us certain competences in sport, and we would like to put emphasis on promoting sport. Sports week is a good example of that, and I compliment the Commission and everyone involved in trying to promote it. But there is the downside, which we are discussing now, especially in relation to match-fixing. It came as a surprise to me, and maybe to my colleagues too, when we had the Sport Intergroup meeting here a couple of months back dealing with this issue, when tennis was seen as the game there was most afflicted by this.  In some respects it is not surprising because it is much easier to fix a match involving two people then involving 22, as would be the case in a soccer match. But the same time, there is a good image of tennis, and of course we must look at the reasons, and in some respects of course it is easier to fix it. If I was playing Jim Nicholson in tennis and he was clearly a better player than me, he could allow me to win and take a package. But of course he would not do that. But you can see the point I am making and for that reason, I think there is a need for rules, especially in relation to banning gambling on games you are involved in yourself, on games involving minors and on what I call in-play betting. All those things have to be looked at. There is also need for proper governance, and I think we should ask the forthcoming Maltese Presidency of the Council to try and look at this so that we can get the convention adopted. That would be a good help. We have to have, of course, codes of conduct, and we do not have to look much further than recently, when in the middle of the Olympics, rather strangely, referees were stood down by the boxing authorities. Now that is rather strange, but it just shows you again that there was a lot of controversy prior to that regarding the results. There are all sorts of opportunities, not necessarily to fix matches but certainly to give wrong results, etc. We have a huge task ahead to try and come to grips with it, but at least today we trying to have a debate here in the European Parliament and then we can progress from there under the guidance of the Commissioner, I also look forward to seeing the Maltese Presidency, especially, doing something about it.

Even though it is on a Thursday afternoon I certainly enjoy it.  We are all rightly proud of the achievements of our athletes from across the different sporting codes and disciplines. I was delighted to join the thousands of others from Northern Ireland recently to watch our national football team play in the European championships with great honour. It was also a great pleasure also to watch the Olympic success of Team GB this summer who were quite astonishing from my point of view.  However, all too often we see the bodies purportedly governing sports and others tarnish the integrity and reputation of their sport through various forms of corruption. I wish the newly-elected President of UEFA well, and I certainly hope his appointment sets football’s governing bodies back on the right direction after recent controversies.  Match-fixing, wherever it may be found, is a blight on our sporting communities, as has already been outlined here this afternoon. In Europe and across the world and at every level, action must be taken to root it out. For the sake of the future of sport, all corruption, including match-fixing, must be tackled in the strongest and most measured way possible. I am therefore supportive of the Council of Europe Convention on the Manipulation of Sports Competitions.  The Commission should take a consistent and fair approach to all Member States in relation to this.

The proposal for the signature by the EU of the Convention has been one of the priorities of the new Commission, and a matter of particular importance to me. On 2 March 2015 the Commission submitted a proposal for the signing of the Convention on behalf of the EU. This proposal took the form of two Council decisions, one with regard to matters related to substantive criminal law and judicial cooperation in criminal matters, and one on other matters, such as cooperation between sports organisations, betting operators and state administrations. Under the Latvian and Luxembourg Presidencies in 2015, discussions took place within the Council on these proposals for signature. While the contents of the proposals were agreed at Coreper in November 2015, the proposals were blocked as the Council requested confirmation of a common accord by all Member States before proceeding to a vote. This allows one Member State to continue blocking the process. The Commission disagrees with this approach. The applicable procedure and voting is clear: the Treaty clearly stipulates qualified majority voting for this kind of Council decision. The Court of Justice has also confirmed in a recent judgment that the rules regarding the manner in which the EU institutions arrive at their decisions are laid down by the Treaties and are not at the disposal of the Member States or of the institutions themselves. However, this viewpoint was not shared during the discussions in Coreper in November 2014 when the Presidency refused to proceed to a vote. This is a question which the Council and the Presidency must find a solution to. Despite the efforts of the Dutch Presidency, they were unable to find a compromise which would enable a breakthrough.  The Commission regrets the current stalemate. The Commission is fully aware of the benefits of the Convention, and we would like it to enter into force as soon as possible. For the Convention to come into force, five signatories must ratify it and three of those five have to be Council of Europe Members. To date, there are two such ratifications. If there is no agreement in the Council, the Convention will enter into force without the EU and most EU Member States being on board. That would be a regrettable situation. Given the nature of the Convention, which links matters of national competence with EU competence, including exclusive EU competence, the Commission considers that a coordinated approach to the signature and ratification of the Convention by Member States remains necessary in accordance with the principle of sincere cooperation. The Commission adds its voice to the call by the honourable Member for all parties to continue to seek a solution. The Commission, for its part, will continue its efforts to convince all Member States to support the signature and ratification process. We will use all opportunities to underline the importance of EU participation in this Convention. We fully support the Convention as a valuable tool in the fight against match-fixing. For the states that choose to ratify it, it will be the first legally binding international tool to fight match-fixing – representing a solid basis for ensuring pan-European coordination and cooperation in the fight against match-fixing. The Commission needs your support in trying to find a breakthrough. I would like to thank you for the positive contributions you made during the debate. It is not an easy task to fight complex issues like match-fixing. The Convention is, indeed, an important tool but we must continue to look at match-fixing from all angles. In the Commission, colleagues dealing with sport, betting, organised crime and corruption will continue to work closely in this field. We will continue to finance projects to fight against match-fixing and to raise awareness about the problem. There is also an EU-funded pilot project which supports four major activities, including one preparing Member States for the entry into force of the Convention. We count on your support to help the Council find a way to overcome the current stalemate and enable the Member States and the EU to sign and ratify the Convention as soon as possible.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1878, "date": "2016-09-15.json", "name": "Dominique BILDE", "mepid": "124771", "text": "  In writing. Tennis, football, basketball, boxing: so many sports are dirty by the mafias who organize match-fixing to get rich. Recently, Europol, the European police agency, revealed the existence of the largest investigation of all time into alleged match-fixing. He suspects a criminal network, based in Asia, with connections in Europe, of having rigged 380 football matches played between 2008 and 2011, across 15 countries.  Initially, most of the world's major criminal organizations have put their noses into sports betting, it is to launder money from drugs, arms sales or prostitution. The crime world knows that to make money clean, you have to agree to lose 30 to 40% of your dirty money. Laundering it through sports betting reduces the risk.  It is necessary for EU Member States to participate in the establishment of the monitoring system and the development of operational cooperation within the framework of the Convention as soon as it comes into force. For these reasons, for the spirit of sport, let us ratify and sign the texts to combat the scourge of rigged betting as soon as possible.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ENF", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}]
