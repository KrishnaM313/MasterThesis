Ladies and gentlemen, at the December European Council meeting, two main items will be on the agenda: investment and Ukraine. The financial and debt crisis has led the European Union to rethink its economic strategy. The European Council is at the heart of this strategy, just as investment will be at the heart of the European Council.  Europe needs investment. There is a considerable pool of investment projects that can be exploited, but ambitious projects do not always find funding even when their European potential is enormous. Of course, there are reasons behind this situation. The crisis has had an impact on everyone's behaviour: sovereign operators, economic operators and, above all, private investors, who have taken a cautious stance, not being certain of the expected profits. But this situation cannot and must not continue. One of the main objectives of the European Council will therefore be to restore confidence. Investment must be stimulated and the investment framework in Europe improved. The European Council will provide guidance and guidance in three main areas. Firstly, through the establishment of a European Fund for Strategic Investments, which will mobilise new investments between 2015 and 2017. The joint help of our two institutions will be needed. As co-legislators, we will have to act quickly on the future legislative proposal so that new investments can start as early as the first half of 2015. At the same time, the EIB will start its activities from its own funds. Secondly, by actively continuing structural reforms and growth-friendly fiscal consolidation. These are preconditions for growth. There can be no investment without sound public finances, the right fiscal framework and regulatory certainty. Thirdly, by creating a favourable and predictable environment for investment. Here, too, our role as co-legislator will be crucial to improving the regulatory framework, including by pursuing an ambitious programme to improve the legislature. Tomorrow's European Council will provide political guidance and set priorities, in accordance with its task and responsibility as defined in the Treaties. But translating these guidelines and priorities into the real economy is our task and our responsibility. It will be necessary for the European Parliament and the Council to work hard and quickly to achieve the results that our citizens expect of us. The Presidency of the Council – and they can also speak on behalf of Latvia, which will succeed us – will do everything possible to make this investment framework a winner. I have no doubt that you will be equally committed to achieving this objective, as demonstrated a few weeks ago during the debate on the investment plan for Europe, proposed by Mr Juncker. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to conclude with a brief reference to Ukraine, where the situation remains precarious. Developments in the east of the country are a source of continuing serious concern. I am aware that these concerns are also shared by many Members of this House. The European Council will closely monitor developments in this regard and is ready to take further action if necessary. As you know, this week the High Representative, Federica Mogherini, is in Kiew and will certainly share with the Council the experts of her visit. At the same time, the new Ukrainian Government is determined to carry out political and economic reforms. We must all encourage it and further facilitate and support the reform process in the country. Thank you for your attention and I look forward to hearing your views on this matter which – I assure you – will be forwarded to President Tusk before tomorrow's meeting.

Two elements stand out when we look ahead to the European Council meeting. Firstly, Europe needs a new approach to investment, and we will have to concentrate on improving the investment climate in Europe. We will also have to help our eastern neighbour, Ukraine, stabilise the situation in the East, master the challenges of the winter and pursue the path of reform. We will have to focus our efforts to successfully implement these objectives. Let me start by making a few remarks on our new approach to investment. On 28 November, the Commission presented its 2015 Annual Growth Survey, which is part of a comprehensive jobs, growth and investment package. The Commission proposes an integrated approach built around three main pillars, all of which must act together and must be pursued in joint action of EU Institutions and Member States to be successful and deliver long-lasting benefits: boosting investment; accelerating structural reforms; and promoting fiscal responsibility by pursuing a responsible growth-friendly fiscal consolidation. Let me briefly go through these three points one by one. First, we need a coordinated boost to investment: generating the right conditions for more and sustainable investment is the first priority for this Commission. Weak investment slows down economic recovery in the short term and hurts growth and competitiveness in the longer run. Investments in Europe are today – on average – 15% below pre-crisis levels, and we must take action to change this. As I mentioned when presenting our Investment Plan to you on 26 November, we will set up a European Fund for Strategic Investment together with the European Investment Bank. The aim is to kick-start a string of public and private investment projects in Europe that would not have happened otherwise. The purpose of this new fund will be to invest in those Member States hit hardest by the economic downturn.  The Fund will work in a wide range of areas and choose the financial instruments most suitable for the project in question: from energy interconnectors to broadband; from education infrastructure to innovative SMEs; from renewable energy to high-tech healthcare. As you will understand, I can certainly not commit to financing of specific projects here and now. All projects have to be screened in light of their economic viability. The list published by the Taskforce on Investments last week contains over 2 000 examples. Obviously, not all of these are new, strategic and economically viable. Nevertheless, there are many interesting examples, like infrastructure for energy-connections in Finland, Poland and the Baltic States, reform of school infrastructure in Italy, or modernisation of regional hospitals in Belgium, just to mention a few examples. To set up the fund, we need one legal act, to be adopted in codecision. The Commission will put forward a proposal in January 2015 and we count on your support for swift adoption during the spring. The common aim is that the Fund is fully operational by mid next year. In order to start delivering on the ground as rapidly as possible, we count on the European Investment Bank to be able to start certain activities using its funds at the beginning of 2015. The European Investment Bank has also agreed with this basic idea. Much has been said about how Member States can contribute to the fund. The new Fund is self-standing. However, its impact would obviously be much greater if Member States contributed to it. Several Member States have signalled their potential interest in doing so, and I am now awaiting concrete proposals to this end. I do hope that the European Council tomorrow will indicate its intention to contribute to these stakes. I need not only words, not only ‘parole parole’ – I need money. For my part, I have signalled the Commission’s intention to take a favourable position towards such capital contributions in the context of the assessment of public finances under the Stability and Growth Pact. We will come forward with detailed guidance on this in January. Let me also assure you that in order to guarantee that projects are chosen on their merits, investment decisions should be based on an independent and expert analysis of the intrinsic merits and economic and social viability of each project. There will be no sectorial or geographic pre-allocations or ‘quotas’. However, technical assistance will be stepped up so that project promoters and relevant authorities in all countries will be able to present viable and investible projects. And a transparent pipeline of projects will allow all interested parties to access potential projects in a quick and efficient way. These efforts will be accompanied by concrete proposals to improve the investment environment by removing regulatory barriers in our single market. Deuxièmement, nous avons besoin de réformes structurelles. Rappelez-vous le triangle vertueux que je vous avais décrit en présentant le plan d'investissement, complété par la consolidation budgétaire et les réformes structurelles. Ces trois éléments du triangle ne s'opposent, mais ils vont de pair. Nous avons été assez efficaces dans notre effort collectif consistant à réduire les déficits budgétaires. Toujours est-il que les niveaux de la dette publique sont trop élevés dans un certain nombre d'États membres et qu'ils constituent des entraves à la volonté – qui peut être celle des investisseurs privés – d'investir en Europe. I expect tomorrow’s European Council to give the Commission full support for taking forward the implementation of all the elements of the Investment Plan. I also expect the European Council to agree to double the overall use of innovative financial instruments under the European Structural Funds for the next programming period. This means a more efficient and more intelligent use of public funds and higher impact on the ground. I am obviously also looking forward to the Parliament’s continued support. The other point on tomorrow’s agenda concerns Ukraine. The new government in Ukraine was elected for its reform agenda. We have seen an ambitious Coalition Agreement and a bold Government Action Plan. We should also welcome the government’s determination to carry out political and economic reforms. The Union and its Member States must continue to facilitate and support the government’s work. The challenges it faces are enormous. First, it must bring peace to Donetsk and Luhansk. Over the past week, we have seen less violence, but the lull must become a ceasefire. Weapons should be withdrawn from the line of contact and the peace process should resume. We must continue to do everything in our power to stabilise the situation in Eastern Ukraine by insisting that all parties implement the Minsk agreement.  Second, Ukraine is experiencing a deep recession. This is the result of long-standing macroeconomic and structural problems. In this difficult context, the European Union has provided unprecedented financial support. We are about to complete implementation of our two Macro-Financial Assistance programmes. A total of EUR 760 million in long-term loans has been disbursed in just the last two months, following on from the EUR 600 million already extended in the summer. Under these programmes, EUR 250 million more can be disbursed early in 2015 if the policy conditions are met. But Ukraine will need more help. The assessment of Ukraine’s financing gap has been completed by the IMF. Ukraine will need USD 15 billion in addition to what is already planned. The European Union can only help within its budget. The relevant EU budget line has been squeezed. There is only a small margin of flexibility for additional financing next year. If we fully use our margin for Ukraine, we will have nothing to address other needs that may arise over the next two years. So, we will need to be able to meet Ukraine’s request for EUR 2 billion. As the European Union is not able to do that, Member States will have to contribute and to give us greater flexibility in the budget. Third, the Government must secure Ukraine’s energy supply. The ‘winter package’ gas agreement reached on 30 October is being implemented. Ukraine has ordered a first consignment of one billion cubic meters of gas, which was prepaid on 5 December. Delivery has begun. The Commission will continue monitoring the implementation of the agreement and will continue to encourage the Ukrainian Government to order sufficient gas from Russia in January and February. These are the main indications I wanted to deliver. We will see during the European Council, and afterwards, what sense of responsibility Member States will show.

We are in the Advent season, just before Christmas. We can express our wishes. I would like to express my first wish, with regard to the forthcoming Council, that perhaps we should put behind us the old eternal debate on austerity and flexibility, the battles that we have been fighting in the European Council for months and years, because Jean-Claude Juncker, the new Commission, has put forward good proposals to overcome this debate. Specifically: the Investment Pact. Jean-Claude Juncker, the new Commission, has presented a new method – we have discussed this intensively: not to make new debts, but to mobilise EUR 315 billion of private capital. The GROUP of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats supports this proposal. Europe is doing what we as Europeans can do. And now the issue is on the Council table. We are asking for support, and we are asking for support! We need this investment boost for Europe, and the national level is invited to make contributions. I say that I would like as many states as possible to make it clear in the next few days that they are making contributions. I also say to my country, Germany, that it would be good if Germany put its own contributions on the table in order to support the investment pact. It would be an important step that we are taking to create momentum. With to the 2 000 project applications, I would just like to say that it is good that the EIB will decide at the end of the day. Many of the projects put on the table by the Council, by the Member States, correspond more to a wish list than a list of priorities, which is actually needed for the future of Europe. The second part is then the debate, the invitation to those who advocate flexibility, who advocate more time, the offer of Jean-Claude Juncker to give until March to give France, Italy more time to invite to make the necessary reforms. Do not use the outstretched hand from Brussels, but invite you to tackle the structural reforms that are necessary. Here, too, the offer of the new President of the Commission to receive this outstretched hand is on the table. I must say that the second largest country in the European Union, France, is a concern for us. If there is now a debate in France about opening a few Sundays so that we can shop there for longer, only in tourist areas, that certain exceptions are being made for notaries, then it is obvious to everyone that this will not solve France's major structural problems. More commitment and commitment is needed to revitalise Europe's second-largest economic power and prepare for globalisation. We are concerned about this, and I would like to say explicitly that without a strong France, Europe has no future. Let me touch on one more aspect of this, because we have also had the discussions on Greece in the troika over the last few days: when I see what the European partners are now demanding about Greece, a country that has done a great deal, which has been asked a great deal – and also with the support of the Italian Finance Minister and the French Finance Minister – what we are asking for with regard to Greece and what we are asking for France at the moment. , then I wonder whether we are treating all the Member States in this European Union fairly. This is the question we must ask ourselves as Europeans. That is why everyone should now, please, take the outstretched hand of the Commission and tackle it. It would be good – if I may open my wish list – if Germany puts money in the pot and if France tackles committed structural reforms. That would be good for Europe. For us as the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the focus of discussion over the next few months will be on structural reforms, because they will decide the future of Europe. I would just like to say one more thought about our debate this week on the Commission's work programme: we in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats support Frans Timmermans in limiting, prioritising, concentrating on the important tasks of our time. The Social Democrat, Frans Timmermans, has our full support for this. I would also like to make it clear that, when it comes to taxation, which was highly controversial among the Socialists, I believe that the Commission is putting forward good proposals on this. Because we in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats have confidence in the Social Democrat, Mr Moscovici, who is responsible for this issue of taxation. We believe that he will put good proposals on the table on this. I would like the Social Democrats to have as much confidence in their Commissioner Moscovici as we have. I can't say that very clearly Address. I would like to highlight two points. The first is TTIP. I am pleased that, following the debates in Australia with the Americans, the Council is now prepared to give gas, perhaps even a target date, to conclude by the end of 2015. The world is not waiting for us to reach an internal agreement. We need commitment there. We want to uphold the standards that make up us Europeans. But we also want to make progress in world trade. That is why we very much welcome the Council's commitment to move forward there. Finally, the point that probably concerns us the most when we look at the current political situation, namely developments in Ukraine and Russia. With a result of Ukraine, our President of the Commission has said what is necessary. I would like to say a few words about Russia: this week, the Russian Central Bank decided to raise the key interest rate from 6% to 17%. This will also choke off the domestic investment climate in Russia. These key interest rates will not normally be used to invest. The ruble stabilised somewhat yesterday, but is still falling. We could say that the sanctions work. But we are not happy about that. But we hope that the development of Putin and also Moscow will make it clear that the path Moscow is taking is the wrong path, the wrong way to go is the wrong way for his own country. We hope that these developments will make it clear that the outstretched hand of the Europeans still exists, that we want partnership with Russia. We hope that Russia, too, will return to respect for international law and thus also to make sanctions superfluous.

Four years ago, in 2010, a young Tunisian, Mohamed Bouazizi, set himself on fire. The Arab Spring started from that event. Bouazizi was 26 years old and had lost his job that same day. Without a job, you don't just lose a source of waste, you lose your dignity, your reason for living. Because work is a value that makes sense of our lives. Every hour in Europe, 100 people lose their jobs. It's a real war bulletin. An entire generation is sacrificed. We cannot pretend anything and I do not make cheap rhetoric: either we react strongly or we will be overwhelmed by the despair and anger of those who have nothing left to lose, because they have already lost their dignity. It is to this Europe that it is suffering, and I say this to Mr Beazley, that we are in a state of crisis. Della Vedova, that tomorrow's European Council must speak. The speech you have made is a step in the right direction. The investment plan is heading in the right direction, Mr Juncker. We appreciate the significance of this plan. We appreciate the turnaround. It is important to have a European investment fund. Manfred, that's the real priority. We don't think so much about the figures, the accounts. Think of the people who suffer and why people don't suffer, we need investment, growth, sustainability and work. Now, we need to follow up on this plan. With speed, with clarity of objectives. The new fund must focus on the riskier investments and certain sectors, which have been indicated by Mr Juncker.  The best response to Lima and the fears that we are too timid on the fight against climate change will be to ensure that we finance projects that accompany the energy transition in Europe. We need a more powerful plan with more resources, which is why we need the support of the Member States. We must urge the Member States to inject fresh resources into the fund. Mr Weber was right to appeal to his country. However, we must neutralise Member States' contributions to the fund's capital. Otherwise, none of the Member States will want to compete. We also need to reopen the debate on the neutralisation of Member States' co-financing to projects financed by the investment fund, and the communication on flexibility, which is being prepared, may be an opportunity to address the issue of incentives to be addressed to Member States that undertake to support the investments in the plan. In order to achieve all this, the Commission needs the support of this Parliament and we will not leave you alone and we will not allow us to weaken the European Commission, as some people want, outside this House and also, probably, within this House. But you too must not leave us alone. Parliament must be fully involved in the preparation and approval of the new European Strategic Fund and must be able to have its say on its governance. The European Council must speak to the Europe that is suffering, as I said at the beginning. But I also see some bad signs. It is unacceptable that, as things stand, only a few words should be said in the work programme against tax evasion, while the resources are not found to finance the investments that create jobs. Hundreds of billions are taken from the coffers of the Member States. This is a strong Europe with the weak and weak with the strong. But this is a Europe that we do not want. Europe's opponents are not outside our borders, but it is those companies that do not pay taxes, it is those white-collar companies that are complicit in tax evasion and avoidance. The European Council must address these issues, Mr Della Vedova. The European Commission has included in its work programme the measures we had asked for and we thank Vice-President Timmerman, President Juncker and Mr Moscovici. I note that Mr Weber has become a supporter of Moscovici. Better late than never. We have always been and we will always be supporters of Moscovici and any Commissioner who will do the good of Europe. Mr Juncker said that this is a good start and a new beginning. But for it really to be a new beginning you need a strong, passionate, intense and decisive work.

First of all: how do we bring investment to the countries of the European Union? But secondly: how do we make sure that we support those in Ukraine who believe in the self-determination of their country, of which my Polish colleague will say more later? We welcome the proposals on the investment fund, not necessarily for its content, but because it helps to kick-start a debate. Not just a debate about EUR 315 billion, but a debate about how we unlock the trillions of euros of private money that could be invested in EU Member States to create jobs and growth. Of course, questions need to be answered. How will the investment fund select and prioritise projects, as Manfred Weber asked? How will the fund leverage private investment? How will the fund avoid a situation where we privatise profits while nationalising losses? But the wider debate now being held in the EU about competition and investment must be turned into action. After all, we are trying to create an EU-wide market in goods, services and capital. In none of these areas have we completed our work. In the last of these – the single market in capital – we have hardly even begun.  But let us not talk about a capital markets union if all it leads to is yet another regulatory union. What we really need are open, transparent and well-functioning capital markets so that firms and others do not rely so much on banks. We need to remove the barriers to private investment across the EU. Not just private investment for infrastructure projects, but private investment for small businesses and entrepreneurs to turn their ideas into goods and services. Why is it that non-bank finance, such as venture capital and crowdfunding, are underused in Europe? Let me give you a specific example: I am a regular lender on a website called Kiva – kiva.org – where entrepreneurs from poorer countries can go to raise loans for their businesses. I and over a million other people lend USD 25 at a time to entrepreneurs in poorer countries which are crowdfunded into larger loans. But why is it that I can lend USD 25 to an entrepreneur in a poorer country but I cannot yet lend GBP 25 to an entrepreneur in a poorer community in my own constituency? Working to solve this problem with others, I have found that we do not need state intervention. We just need to work with entrepreneurs and crowdsourcing websites, such as CrowdPatch or ForCommonCause in the UK, because the money is there. However, the will needs to be there to unlock that money; there needs to be an aggregate of individuals across the EU who are willing to lend small amounts of money. So breaking down the barriers to private investment and competition must be our top priority. However, this cannot be done in isolation. It must be part of a wider economic reform programme. Now the Council will repeat its commitments to addressing Europe’s energy challenges, developing the digital single market and concluding bilateral trade agreements. On all these issues, the European Conservative and Reformist Group has launched working groups that will present new ideas. So where we disagree with you, we will meet those challenges with our own ideas. But it is pointless for European leaders to come to Brussels and call for a culture of competition that will unlock private investment when they then go back home to their capitals and fail to take the tough decisions that are urgently needed. Many of these structural reforms are unpopular, and we know that they will be opposed by vested interests, but there is no other way.  In my country, we adopt resolutions for the New Year. My personal one will be to do more exercise. But let us ask the EU leaders at Council to adopt their own resolution: a resolution to reform their own economies; a resolution to break down the barriers to investment and a resolution to cut red tape so that entrepreneurs can create new jobs. And let us hope that 2015 is a year that we get the EU back to work. Happy New Year!

What we need now is an ambitious response from the Council on Thursday and Friday.  And I have to tell you, Mr Della Vedova, that I have seen the draft conclusions: I know about Cola Light, you know what that is? Well I would say that these are Council Light. If these are the Council conclusions for tomorrow and the day after, it seems like – not zero but near to zero, Mr Lamberts – and my impression when I read them is that a number of people in the European Council are not even aware that Europe is in crisis. It is all about ʽwe call forʼ, ʽwe supportʼ, ʽwe inviteʼ, ʽwe callʼ, it is a standing invitation to participate by the Council.  I want to be very precise. What you need to do is take key decisions on a number of points that will help the Commission go forward with their ambitious programme and I have seven points to make. The first is that you have to decide with the 28 Member States to enter into the guarantee scheme of the fund. That is a decision to take – not to invite the countries to participate, maybe next year. No! Take the decision: the 28 Member States enter the guarantee scheme. That is the decision to take and you do not need to change the Stability Pact for that, you can do that under the rules in force today. Secondly, to help the fund by saying, maybe at national level, that OK, national states should not put taxation on the income of that fund, so that not just institutional investors but also normal citizens, European citizens, can invest in the future of Europe. Three, you have to decide on conditionality. You have to decide with the European Council tomorrow that the first investments are going to go to those countries which are carrying out positive structural reforms, as a positive incentive to carry out these reforms. The fourth point: the telecoms package. You are asking how we are going to emerge from the crisis? We have a Council. Decide on the telecoms package! It has been on the table of the Council for months already and the only thing you are doing is going backwards: not getting rid of the roaming charges, not in fact establishing net neutrality, not in fact harmonising spectrum policy too. Decide on this! This is a package that has already been more than a year on your table, so that you can create a digital market in Europe. The fifth thing to decide: a second package on digital, because we need as fast as possible one regulator in the digital market. Half of the countries in Europe still cannot use Spotify, cannot use Netflix, because we do not have one regulator and we do not have one copyright regime. Next thing, take the decision finally to launch the energy community. Take that decision so that the Commission is backed by this Council to do the legislative work. And then finally: Mr Kamall was talking about this, it is fine that Mr Kamall has now discovered the advantages of a unified Europe; OK we are on the right track now because he has talked about capital markets. Yes indeed, we do not have one credit market, we do not have one mortgage market in Europe. If you have an asset in one country you cannot use it to have credit in another country from a financial institution. So those are the decisions that you have to take. Not these fake conclusions that we always see after a European Council. If we see how deep this crisis is, if we see the lack of investment that we have seen since the outbreak of the crisis in 2008, what I expect from the Council, not only from the Italian Presidency but from the 28 Member States, is that now for the first time they take firm decisions to help this Commission and to help us emerge from this crisis in the European Union. That is your task and my request to the President of the Council – I know that you are there, Mr President, you are always invited at the beginning of this European Council – is that you spread this key message tomorrow when you start your speech.

Mr President, I would like to thank the I would also like to address the Council first.  For me, the question arises as to what has really changed after the meeting of EU finance ministers in view of the Council meeting that is taking place today and tomorrow, because what progress is actually being made? Is it really to be seen here that there is a willingness on the part of government representatives to put real sustainable investments on a strong financial footing and, above all, to set priorities for investment? I don't see that, but it's also a bit of the crux that we're dealing with here. When Mr Juncker took up the post and applied for the Presidency of the Commission, he presented a programme which was primarily intended to promote social, environmental and sustainable economic developments in the Member States.  I have the impression that, although Mrs von Storch has not understood the content of the investment programme, I am quite right, she did not understand it, but for me the absurd ity is that, despite her lack of understanding of the problem, she has hit the nail on the head by saying: 'I am not at all in favour of the public investing heavily here, but everything is to be made private'. And that is exactly the field in which we are moving here.  I still consider it a huge problem that necessary investments, sustainable investments, above all, are not made through public funds. I am in stark contrast to the AfD, or even to the direction of this programme. Now I ask you all: do you have so much confidence in the Heads of Government that they are really in a position not to present their old projects representing yesterday's snow and to say that they are now the big investment providers? Where do we actually take the certainty when, in the end, Minister for Economic Affairs Gabriel of the Federal Republic of Germany declares that the whole thing is voodoo for him?  So I think there is still a lot of work to be done here if we really want to invest in sustainable investments aimed at social and employment needs. I do not believe in it and you will have to work here to convince us that it is indeed the case. We now also know that there is a prank list in connection with this. Now I would like to know what impact on investment conditions, for example, is the deletion of the maternity leave directive? What impact, for example, does the question of whether ecological standards are being scaled back, that something that we have democratically agreed with each other here, for example, is simply taken down from the discussion? I am thinking here of the Clean Air for Europe programmes and on waste management. What impact does this have on this?  Are all those sitting here really aware that this strike list has the least impact, but that the creation of the necessary investment environment means, first and foremost, that environmental, social and employment standards must be dismantled within the national framework?  In the end, no one can answer the question why, for example, for projects such as those that have now been collected, private investment has not been submitted long before. So if I want to make a difference, I want to change conditions at national level. You need to be clear about that.

I have also noticed the draft resolution that the Council is entering the new parliamentary term with the inauguration of Donald Tusk with a pronounced bunny-footed approach to the challenges. I have the impression that all the lessons we thought we had learned from the euro crisis are being set aside. I see no sign of the willingness in the Council that we absolutely need in order to keep the euro stable in the long term and to really get out of the crisis, namely all the measures that would serve to really integrate into the economic policy of the European Union. Without a common, clear economic policy, we will not be able to keep the euro stable in the long term. I do not know what you are going to make of it. I know that there is a prevailing view in the Council that we no longer dare to defend these ideas in the public eye. But how do we cope with the loss of trust in the European public? Take the example of LuxLeaks. Here, too, I see a large gap in this motion for a resolution. The consequences of LuxLeaks, an announcement by the Council that we will finally ensure that large companies pay their taxes back where they make the profits – that would be a measure, but you could immediately regain the confidence of European citizens. I have the impression, when I look at this brief Council resolution and, on the other hand, I also see the investment list, which has grown to the level of several source catalogues, that the two organisations – the Commission and the Council – think that we can create lasting work throughout Europe through free trade, the dismantling of social standards, environmental dumping and the investment in well-heeled large-scale projects. I don't think so! And I believe that Mr Juncker and Mr Timmermans are very much in demand to ensure order in the face of this mega-Christmas wish list. You are, of course, regarded as a good cleaner, Mr Timmermans. Make sure that only those projects that are really capable of achieving sustainable economic recovery are really approved under this investment programme! And please also ensure that an industry such as the nuclear industry, which is not competitive after 40 years, suddenly celebrates a resurrection again through these subsidies, which are to be made possible. I actually find it regrettable that the whole investment plan is now so overlaid by projects that seem to be from the past. It was a good idea. I hope it will also be well implemented. On Russia, I think it would be better if the Council document did not keep talking about Ukraine, but about what we actually have, namely a deep crisis between the European Union and Russia. What do we learn from the news of the last day? We are not the only ones who depend on Russian energy imports. Today, unlike in the Cold War, Russia belongs precisely through its interconnection with the international community. Everything That Europe has decided so far has been right with regard to Russia. The Council must not allow itself to be divided, whatever attempts on the part of Moscow.

It is as if things get discussed over and over again and nothing ever happens.

Now, Mr Juncker, I know you like a drink. I know you like a cigarette, but I do hope that you are a betting man too or, to use a British phrase, you like a flutter on the horses.  If you do, I have come up with a more realistic plan for you to increase your money 15 times over. At Ludlow racecourse today at 15.00, a race called the European Breeders’ Fund is taking place. There is a perfect horse running for you, and it is pricing at 15/1. It is called ‘Dream’. Alternatively, there is another running at Tampa tonight. It has got an even better name, and I think you should go for it: it is called ‘Super Fantasy’.  Now, there is a serious point to all this, Mr Juncker, because your investment plan is an economic dream based on super fantasy economics. The Commission has described the funds forecast leverage as, I quote, ‘prudent estimates from historical experience’. Well, you can excuse me if I say: we do not believe you; because these are the same eurocrats who told us ten years ago that the euro would bring us growth and jobs. Mr Juncker, Europe is sinking under global competition, and the European Union is not the answer. Unfortunately for the European people, your investment plan is the biggest turkey on the table.

This summit is indeed crucial for The European Economic Recovery and I hope that the Member States are aware of this. The peoples of Europe are tired of suffering and not believing in the future. However, the Council's statement today seems to me to be particularly bland and very chilly. It is true that the Council has accustomed us to lead us from disappointment to disappointment, simply because of the lack of ambition, which allows us to move forward, and the absolutely necessary spirit of solidarity within the European Union. The time is no longer for procrastination, but for action. Heads of state and government must provide outspoken and massive political support to the Juncker Commission's strategic investment plan. The tools are on the table. It is now our duty to implement them as soon as possible. But beware of chimeras! Indeed, there will be no sustainable growth without economic and monetary stability. This investment plan, based not on debt but on the stimulation of private capital, is well adapted to the reality of the economic situation. The Commission and the Council will also have to be uncompromising on compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact, because real growth can only come if the Member States finally have the courage to carry out the necessary structural reforms. Those who do not resolve will have to take responsibility for their people. Gone are the days when Europe assumed the lack of courage of national governments. This investment plan is therefore only the first act of the European recovery; I also welcome the new approach that guides the Commission's work programme and is more focused, more focused, less bureaucratic. This should allow us to go to success. Because success will only be there if we restore confidence. In the case of the transatlantic agreements, I really want Europe to be strong, so as not to be marginalized by the new orientation of the United States towards Asia.

Included in that regulation is the issue that has been referred to: the development of the internal market, which some Members are also fond of. Let me now just make one remark: I am sure that the investment plan could have been fine-tuned a bit, could have been more inspired by some inputs, including some from our group. I might have certain minor hesitations about some of the elements but it is a good plan and this is what the European Union, our citizens and businesses were looking for. It is not comparable with what the previous Commission was submitting. I am also not yet convinced by some of the elements and I did not really receive yesterday an answer on the better regulation. I suspect the basis is a solid one but I very much hope that we will progress on that. Let me refer now to the Council. Minister, I found your intervention at the very beginning very disappointing. Basically very general, not concrete, not addressing the issues as if the Council is completely unaware of what is really going on in Europe. Mr Verhofstadt has spoken about the telecoms package, something that citizens and businesses have been waiting months for, if not years. What is the progress on roaming, on net neutrality?

We have not really even started and we have a debate that we will be splitting the technical part and the governance part. No. Businesses will invest if we progress on those.

We would have liked, for example, this Council to take into account the OECD report entitled 'Inequalities damage growth'. The OECD's response is that inequalities do a great deal of damage to growth. In 20 years, rising inequality has resulted in a loss of GDP growth of 8.5 points. This has affected the weakest classes in particular and continues to be not only a very serious social problem but also a macroeconomic one. Therefore, only one thing is needed to revive growth: to combat inequalities; change economic policy; investing in education and welfare; establish a citizenship income at European level. You talk about stability for investment but you give precariousness to citizens. Talk of confidence when the President of the Commission is involved in one of the most serious scandals relating to tax evasion. Talk about an investment plan that looks a lot like monopoly money.

Research in all fields, in universities, in major research centres, which, unfortunately, have reduced their capacity. Research must, of course, be promoted in the industrial sector and in favour of alternative energies. A major investment is also needed for a youth policy, particularly in education, vocational training and employment. Social and scientific research and a policy for youth and research are the key to our future, which must be prepared today, because if the crisis strikes tomorrow, it is in fact already today. I want to be concrete not only because these areas seem very important to me, but also because I am surprised and very surprised that the Spanish Government was the only government in the European Union to present half a page of incredibly vague petitions, which favour very flexible interpretations, even absolutely arbitrary policies.

Six months that we had long awaited, creating expectations for our citizens and for growth. Of course, Merkel will have her responsibility, as does the European Commission. But the responsibilities of Italy and the Italian Government are certainly the heaviest and most serious. The Italian Government has completely forgotten some priorities. In order to achieve a recovery in the labour market, job opportunities need to be reconstructed and these opportunities will not exist unless some crucial issues are resolved, at least as far as manufacturing-related sectors are concerned. It is certainly useful to reduce the burden on new hires, but it is impossible to create new jobs when small and medium-sized enterprises and the craft sector continue to close. They close because of too much tax and too much, incomprehensible, useless and complex bureaucracy that grips Italy and Europe. The Italian Government has wasted the opportunity to resume the battle over Made in, an essential tool to give European companies breathing space and freedom of choice for consumers. It has wasted the opportunity to talk about counterfeiting and illegality due to the lack of a common customs system in a free market such as the European market. Nothing has been done about the protection and development of the company, just as nothing has been done to deal definitively with the issue of the salvation of immigrants and, on the contrary, you have made a shameful profit for 40 years – and a scandal has now broken out in Rome in this regard – on immigration and on those poor people too, and that will not help us. , will not help Italy, nor will It help Europe. This mismanagement is repeated in all the regional administrations, over which this Presidency should have exercised more control and has not done so. He kept quiet.

In other words, to concentrate and not to proceed in the way that I think is happening in the governments at the moment, a kind of watering can – a bit for each Member State. No, that cannot be the answer, but it is about focusing on important innovation and tasks for the future, of ensuring that jobs are created in high-quality areas such as the digital agenda, such as sustainability, the energy sector, of concentrating on infrastructures, so that jobs are actually created that our citizens also have something of.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 44, "date": "2014-12-17.json", "name": "Mark DEMESMAEKER", "mepid": "117477", "text": "    Mr President, I would like to return to the situation in Ukraine.

Secondly, Spanish voters believe that it is important to continue working for a true Energy Union, which assures our citizens of a competitive and sustainable market with sufficient energy interconnections to ensure a reasonably priced supply. Thirdly, we need Europe to remain a safe and secure place. We must intensify the fight against terrorism, solve the problem that will pose us the return of foreign fighters and create our own energies to face new challenges. By the way, Mr President, the European Union must react to the murder of more than a hundred children in Peshawar, a hundred children who have died in a school. Every time a child dies in a school it must be as if a child dies in a school in Europe. Malala's spirit must accompany our struggle for freedom and terrorism always. Fourthly, we need solidarity to develop a common border policy that places irregular immigration as a priority on our external agenda. Now that there are no internal borders, I can say that the city of Melilla or the city of Ceuta are also borders of France, Germany or Sweden: they are borders of all.

There is agreement between Parliament, the Commission and the Council that the European economy needs to be stimulated. I support the objectives of the investment plan myself. However, I have doubts and comments on how it will be implemented. On the one hand, in fact, outside the EIB resources, there does not seem to be any new money for the investment plan. In fact, the sums transferred from the Connected Europe Facility and Horizon 2020 resources to guarantees are mostly just transfers of money from one pocket to another.  On the other hand, the multiplier effect proposed by the Commission is, in my view, overly optimistic. Unfortunately, on the basis of the information available, estimates of metastases are unrealistic and therefore there is a great need for further involvement by Member States.  Thirdly, taking into account the above concerns, particular attention should be paid to the selection of projects. Only a high-quality project list can result in long-term growth. We can only achieve the desired invigorating effect by supporting projects that serve all aspects of our goals. My fellow Members, I would like to thank you for your support. In my opinion, energy projects are exactly like this. Let us therefore seize the opportunity and take a big step towards solving the issue of security of supply in Europe. The Barroso package has already placed emphasis on energy infrastructure, but we are still talking about dependency and lack of connectivity. The central and eastern European region continues to be at the forefront of vulnerability. European citizens and companies can only be provided with a secure and affordable energy supply through the creation of a single energy market. In the longer term, it is the cheaper energy price that can make Europe more competitive.

This is the basis of a report by the Court of Auditors, including five airports, including one in Italy, but also in Greece, Spain and Poland. 666 million was invested in those airports, which turns out to be quite pointless. It is about investments in airports that were not actually necessary, that were too close together, which are not profitable. Why do I say that? One, because of course it is always terribly embarrassing for people who really have a heart for Europe to read that in the newspapers. I'm not saying that because I don't think we should invest. We have to invest. The Socialists and Democrats group is a very strong supporter of investment policy and wants to give a serious push to it. We are also asking the Council to do more, to invest more, but – and that is my message – not in any way. Not in a prestige project of some minister or of one Member State, but in the future. Let us apply criteria, criteria that have to do with sustainability and jobs, and let us prepare the future.

I think Parliament is going to back it, from what I have heard this morning. It is in some respects rather sad that the President had to come in and ask Council to commit to the proposals and to give the guarantees that are necessary. Member States also have an obligation to carry out the structural reforms which have been committed to. As our leader, Mr Weber, pointed out this morning in answer to Madam Berès, Ireland – which four or five years ago was regarded almost as a basket case – did take the hard medicine, despite the suffering of many people, and is now reaping the rewards of structural reform. We have about 4.8% growth this year. More importantly, Mr Juncker was speaking about trust – that means confidence, it means optimism. 30% of SMEs in Ireland hope to take on at least one extra employee next year. That is what is needed because, as is often said, if every SME took on one extra employee, we would solve the unemployment problem in Europe.

This is all the more so because many of the questioners have since left the Chamber. I would just like to point out once again – just to make it clear – that in order to be able to implement this investment plan, we urgently need the help of the European Parliament. We will deliver the necessary text documents to Parliament in January. I hope that Parliament will act quickly on this plan. The investment programme itself also needs the active participation of European governments. Newspaper reading – which I sometimes come to, though not regularly enough – tells me that there are at least six Heads of Government who have so far said that Parliament is good, that a first step has been taken, but that the package has been a bit rickety and small. But no one has yet said how many billions they actually want to contribute to this guarantee. I expect that the European Council will collapse tomorrow and the day after tomorrow amid the flood of money that has been set in motion. If everyone adheres to what they have said about the investment plan in recent weeks, then we will have no problem in getting the programme up and running. The programme starts where it needs to start. We do not have public money that we can put into the table without widening deficits and without increasing the debt piles. So it would be intelligent, I think, to bring the mobilizable money from the European budget into the direction of investment and to provide investment in the real economy. Who is to invest in Europe, if not the private capital that is plentiful? (Applause) Should we now put taxpayers back to account, instead of taking on the responsibility of those who have the money they need? The Commission will not select these projects that will be accompanied by itself. I repeat: if the Commission does what many people call on it to do, instead of experts who understand something about the economy and economics, then we will be under constant pressure, every day and every hour, to do this or that programme, because a government or because an MEP would like to do so. (Applause) It is important to me that projects with long-term growth-enhancing potential are supported and financially supported. We should not build new cathedrals, because we are already struggling to fill the churches and chapels with believers, not to build tunnels through mountains that can also be crossed, you do not have to pass them all through. Meaningful projects, not just projects for the sake of projects. That is why I would also like to counter the impression that we have nothing else in mind than to finance the nuclear industry, additional nuclear power stations. That is not the Commission's intention at all. In any case, the energy mix is a national matter and not a matter for the Commission. Pour le reste, Madame la Présidente, je ne suis pas du tout impressionné par ceux qui, depuis quelques jours, m'enjoignent de me taire lorsque d'autres m'invitent prendre la parole.

The European Council must address the key issue of Jean-Claude Juncker's recovery plan. Unfortunately, the lack of ambition of this plan was confirmed a few days ago by the disappointing long-term investment figures proposed by the ECB to encourage private investment. Despite the extremely favourable conditions, only 219 billion have found a buyer while the ECB wanted to reach the 400 billion loans. This probably definitively demonstrates the need to promote public investment in the recovery plan and job creation and thus get out of austerity that does not solve anything socially and economically. Several important steps can be taken in this regard. First, finance this investment on very favourable terms. Second, neutralize the impact of productive public investment in debt assessment. But we must go further here than immunizing investments that would pass through the European Strategic Investment Fund. Finally, to remain consistent, the brakes on these public investments will have to be questioned as the strict application of the SEC2010 accounting standard.

Beyond the announcement effect that could backfire on the Commission but also against the European institutions in general, if this money is not found, there will be no stimulus.

The rules imposed have forced The Member States to comply with strict rules that have brought European citizens to their knees. The same rules have been applied for everyone indiscriminately, not taking into account the different starting situations.  15 years after the entry of the euro, the European institutions have not yet shown that they are capable of managing the single currency.

Debt mutualisation would have prevented the debt crisis from escalating, thus curbing all the Eurosceptic currents that have spread across Europe.

The result will be to avoid reversing the upward trend that currently characterizes trade between Ecuador and the EU. However, in order to materialise the common benefits of extending existing trade preferences, they should be subject to several conditions, such as Ecuador's compliance with the rules of origin, cooperation with the European Commission in making information on Ecuador's compliance with these conventions available, and making continuous efforts to sign and ratify a free trade agreement with the EU.

The negotiations between Parliament and the Council have been difficult, but the difficulties that have accompanied them go away in oblivion just as some of the outstanding bills will go away. An additional €4.25 billion to settle unpaid bills from 2014, including more than €4 billion in contingency margins, will certainly help stabilise EU debt. A permanent postponement of their payment would only drill holes in the next annual budgets. We must make every effort to make the promise of a full fiscal balance by 2016 a reality.

This amending budget also takes into account the amount of UK corrections and how they are financed, which will have a direct impact on the distribution of Member States' contributions. This PBR 4 also contains forecasts for other revenues and in particular fines.

The underlying assumption is that the methodologies deployed to gather data are fit for purpose across all Member States of the EU in a comparable manner. It is necessary to continually review this assumption.  For example, are estimations of services inputs across economies really comparable when ranging from larger countries to the smallest like Malta? And from countries with the largest reliance on services to those with the smallest? Similarly, estimates and time phasing of re-exports in national accounts have little importance for larger countries, but could distort the picture enormously for the smallest ones. Meanwhile, despite the pretence, current data about public revenues and expenditures are still far from being measured on an accruals basis. What’s more, the criteria used make no allowance for the fact that some tax structures, like VAT, carry a higher fixed cost per capita for smaller states than for larger ones. The use of so-called objective criteria and data give the impression that the allocation of contributions is a fair distribution of burdens among Member States.

This is certainly very good news for the beneficiaries of EU funds.  It is worrying, however, that this was another year in which the budget negotiations took the form of an open war between the EU institutions. The main reason for this push between Parliament and the Commission and the Council of the EU was the issue of unpaid bills, which have been rolling over from year to year for several years. Of course, Parliament understands the budgetary problems of the Member States, but a situation in which countries do not want to give payment appropriations resulting from commitments they have made themselves undermines the credibility of the EU among its citizens and internationally. All the more important to appreciate Parliament's success in winning an additional more than €4 billion in unpaid bills in 2014.

The Commission, for its part, clearly stated that such 'illegal cabotage' was excluded because the original Regulation establishes a clear list of categories. It does not contain the category of 'illegal cabotage' and therefore the implementing legislation of the original Regulation cannot extend the scope of the basic Regulation.  If the EP wishes to include an additional provision on 'illegal cabotage' in the implementing regulation, the basic regulation should be added first. I would suggest that we do not politicise the issue of cabotage and support the Commission's proposal.

US oil companies, as well as Repsol, together with the Governments of Canada and the US, opposed oil typology differentiation and the penalty of the most polluting ones head-on. After eight years of delays, due to pressures from Canada, the U.S. and large oil companies, a regulation is finally passed according to their interests.

An important instrument in this context is certainly the specific total annual total allowable catch (TAC) quota. Since there are strong biological interactions between cod, herring and sprats, they are extremely important components of the Baltic ecosystem. Environmental conditions in the Baltic can have a strong impact on the productivity of Baltic fish stocks, in particular cod and sprats, so the Council's decision on total allowable catches aims to reduce quotas (7 % to the western part of the Baltic and 22 % eastern) with a view to preserving this species.

I call on the Commission to provide in the documents for adequate funding for the new security strategy 2015-2019, as well as the financial resources needed by european union security agencies, such as Europol.  Also, the strategy needs better co-ordination in terms of fighting serious crime.

Even the EU signed this agreement as a witness, so it seems we can question this signature now.

This is intriguing after 13 years. Besides this, although I do recognise the rights of the Palestinians, recognition today will be an extra barrier to the peace negotiations.

The push for unilateral recognition of a Palestinian state by the Member States in the absence of political conditions is, in my view, a hindrance to this important objective in the present situation, bearing in mind that recognition should be the result of a peace settlement, not a means of resettling it.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hu", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1673, "date": "2014-12-17.json", "name": "Karima DELLI", "mepid": "96868", "text": "   Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let us not be ungrateful to ourselves.

The European Parliament has rightly demanded that all Palestinian factions, including Hamas, recognise the existence of the State of Israel in accordance with the 1993 declaration of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO).

The EPP Group also welcomes the fact that the resolution rejects any form of violence and terrorism from all sides and warns against a potential religious dimension in the conflict. For EPP Group MEPs, the only sustainable solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict will be the one achieved by peaceful and non-violent means. ‘We are gravely concerned at the growing tension and increasing violence in the region, and we urge all parties to refrain from any action that would worsen the situation.

Nevertheless, realities must be recognised, and therefore a peace solution should not be narrowed down to regulations in which tens of thousands of Israeli citizens become homeless.

This is countered by security concerns, which relate on the one hand to the well-being of the Jewish population of West Jerusalem and, on the other hand, to the vulnerability of the government institutions of both sides.

Mr. Eder is the CEO of the largest Austrian steel company – Voestalpine AG. This company was very much in the media this year because it outsourced its production to the USA. The company cited the high tax burden in Austria, the high energy costs, the high environmental requirements and the lack of willingness to reform by the Federal Government as reasons for this outsourcing. In addition, the company has criticised the expensive and strict CO2 requirements as far as the EU is concerned. From 2020 alone, Voestalpine AG expects to receive EUR 230 million per year for the purchase of emission allowances. This situation is characteristic of the steel industry and of the energy-intensive industry in Europe as a whole, and is leading to the deindustrialisation of Europe.

Europe must therefore draw up a road map to put the steel industry back at the centre of industrial policies and turn it into a sustainable and profitable sector. Therefore, the Commission needs to use part of its investment package to develop and disseminate the best available technologies, in order to implement large-scale industrial projects, including energy efficiency and low-carbon projects.

In relation to human trafficking and smuggling, while ensuring strong criminal sanctions may be a deterrent, strong preventive measures, which include the identification of smuggling routes and trafficking gangs through closer cooperation between Member States and third countries, are necessary. The effectiveness of information campaigns addressed to those who end up being victims of trafficking or smuggling is dubious unless the causes that lead persons to become victims are seriously addressed.

However, there have also been some serious concerns and differences regarding certain aspects of US counter-terrorism policies. The European Union has been in dialogue with the United States on these issues for several years. Today we are going to be discussing a Senate report on a previous US programme that formally ended almost six years ago. We share President Obama's view that these techniques are contrary to our values and not just useful in the fight against terrorism. It is important to ensure that this does not happen again. That is why we welcome the publication of the report as well as the subsequent public debate. This demonstrates both transparency and openness in learning from past mistakes. The Council has repeatedly stated that the fight against terrorism must take place in full compliance with international law, including human rights law, international humanitarian law, and the international law of refugees. Respect for international law is an essential element of the European Union's counter-terrorism strategy.  When the existence of the CIA's secret detention centres was revealed in 2006, the Council stressed that the European Union remained strongly committed to a total ban on torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. It is clear from the Senate report that the legal justification has helped to authorise the various techniques mentioned in it. Since 2006, the European Union has initiated regular dialogue with US legal advisers on the international legal aspects of the fight against terrorism. This dialogue has enabled us to submit a number of issues and concerns to the United States and has given us the opportunity to insist on the need to respect international law and human rights. It is important to note that President Obama formally ended the CIA program just days after he took office. By decree, President Obama had then banned all forms of torture and ill-treatment, as well as so-called 'enhanced interrogation techniques' and secret detention. He had asked that the CIA no longer run detention centers and had banned the use of interrogation techniques. Subsequently, in a joint question issued in June 2009, the European Union and the United States welcomed ( and I quote) 'the thorough review of US policies on detention, transfer, trials and interrogation in the fight against terrorism and greater transparency on past practices in relation to these policies as well as the elimination of secret detention centres'.  We can only tackle terrorism if we live up to our fundamental values. The violation of human rights and the rule of law can, in themselves, give rise to resentment and even lead people to resort to terrorism, even if such acts can never be justified or excused in any way. These policies, although intended to combat terrorism, can in fact create conditions conducive to its spread. Over the years, the European Union has not only engaged in dialogue with states on these issues, but has also taken specific steps to promote changes in US policy: for example, in 2009, the European Union established a framework that facilitated the reception by EU Member States of former Guantanamo detainees in support of President Obama's goal of closing Guantánamo within a year. This support was provided as part of an in-depth review of US counter-terrorism policies, in line with the rule of law and international law, pending a solution to the underlying political issues. With the exception of specific armed conflicts such as in Afghanistan, Syria or Iraq, the European Union has adopted a criminal justice approach in the fight against terrorism. Terrorists should be properly investigated, prosecuted and convicted in accordance with the common rules of criminal law. The criminal and ordinary courts have a long history of handling terrorism-related cases. Law enforcement investigations are crucial to obtaining information about terrorist networks and to thwarting their plans. Fair trials before ordinary criminal courts have put hundreds of terrorists behind bars. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Treaties of the European Union national security remains the exclusive competence of each Member State. This means that the work of the member states' intelligence agencies is outside the remit of the European Union and its institutions. It follows that investigations into the alleged involvement of Member States in the CIA programme are the responsibility of the Member States and not of the European Union. In conclusion, the Member States and the European Union are bound by the European Convention on Human Rights and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. The actions taken to combat terrorism are monitored by the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. In addition, since the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Court of Justice has had jurisdiction to review EU legislation on internal security. This provides a solid regulatory framework that provides an adequate framework within which we can and must combat the scourge of terrorism.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "NI", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2081, "date": "2014-12-17.json", "name": "Dimitris Avramopoulos", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "  Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the Commission, which I represent here today on this matter, is, like you, appalled by the findings of the United States Senate Select Committee on the intelligence study of the CIA’s detention and interrogation programme, part of which was released on 9 December. As you know, most of the inquiry remains classified. This report raises important questions as regards serious violations of fundamental rights by the US authorities and by other persons in the service of the CIA between late 2001 and January 2009.  As President Obama rightly said this week, the actions taken under the CIA programme were contrary to US values, recognising that one of the most effective tools to fight terrorism is to stay true to the values and ideals the United States stands for. This is what led him in 2009 to unequivocally ban torture – an act which we applauded. I recall this because this is the real point about torture: it is just wrong. Not only is it wrong, it is a crime – it is a criminal act – and it should never be used.  While shocking, the Senate Committee findings are not a complete surprise. The existence of secret detention facilities, rendition flights and the allegations of torture and ill-treatment of prisoners under CIA custody in the context of the fight against terrorism by the United States have been a concern since they became public some 10 years ago. Since then, several United Nations human rights bodies and special rapporteurs – as well as the Council of Europe and the European Court of Human Rights – have been unequivocal in condemning the practices now documented in the Senate Committee study. This House has been engaged in this issue since the start, with the decision to set up a committee of inquiry leading to two own-initiative reports in 2007 and in 2012 condemning the practices in question and voicing the need to promote and protect fundamental rights. As the European Union, we have raised these issues with the United States on several occasions, including in letters by the Presidency of the Council and in our regular dialogues on counter-terrorism and human rights.  The Senate Committee study is a positive step in confronting publicly and critically the way in which the CIA’s responsibilities were discharged in relation to the allegations of torture and ill-treatment against suspects in United States custody abroad. The Commission believes that full clarity should be brought to bear on those practices, in accordance with international standards, including as regards individual responsibilities for those facts.  The EU condemns all forms of torture and ill-treatment under any circumstances and works towards the prevention and eradication of all forms of torture and ill-treatment within the European Union and worldwide as a priority of its human rights policy. As the Commission has repeatedly underlined, efforts to combat terrorism should be conducted in a manner that conforms to the rule of law, respects our common values and complies with our respective obligations under international law – in particular, international human rights law, refugee law and humanitarian law.  The Commission has consistently stressed, since the beginning, that all concerned Member States should conduct in-depth, independent and impartial investigations to establish the facts with regard to CIA activities. They should have established responsibilities and enabled victims to obtain compensation for damages. This was recalled in a joint letter sent to all Member States in 2013 by then Vice-President Reding and Commissioner Malmström. We note that the judicial authorities of several Member States have in the past undertaken investigations and the prosecution of persons, including CIA agents involved in the abduction, rendition, illegal detention, torture and ill-treatment of suspects under the CIA detention and interrogation programme.  On the same day that the Senate Committee study was released, we learned in the press that the US military’s Bagram Detention Centre in Afghanistan had been closed. Two of the prisoners who have been turned over to the Afghan authorities had been in US custody since 2002, including several years under CIA detention without trial. However, 136 detainees still remain in the Guantánamo detention facility, including detainees who will not be brought to trial and have not been cleared for release. The European Union will keep monitoring the situation and keep raising the human rights-related aspects of the fight against terrorism with the United States.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2082, "date": "2014-12-17.json", "name": "Monika HOHLMEIER", "mepid": "96780", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Mr President, Commissioner, I greet the Presidency of the Council, ladies and gentlemen. The report presented by the United States Senate Committee is a frightening one. When President Obama says that the report shows a frightening action by the CIA, and that america's image in the world has been significantly damaged, I can only agree with that 100 per cent. It is actually a key question, which is: can we protect our ideals by flouting and destroying these very ideals? The answer to this question from the point of view of the PPE and from my personal point of view is: no, we cannot trample these ideals underfoot. The fundamental rights and dignity of a person are inviolable. Of course, a person's dignity also includes his security. But to preserve the safety of people, using every method, including torture and the most brutal interrogation methods, is not part of the catalogue of what is acceptable. Waterboarding: John McCain has accused the public of this from his personal point of view, which is very credible, by saying that The Americans once sentenced criminals to long prison terms for waterboarding. What they themselves have blamed others cannot be accepted for them, even if their own CIA does.

Don't blame me for my immediams, but I think it's necessary.  The following examples remind you: the defendant was stuffed into an undersized cage, the cage was hung and left hanging, and the defendant died of sun or cold. The defendant was hanged and released over a kol that penetrated his anus or vagina. Water torture was popular.  If that's what you thought of the Middle School, the Inquisition, the executioners, the gloom, you're right, that's what we learned about at school. What do the following examples remind you of: during torture, the defendant died of hypothermia because he was handcuffed naked to the concrete floor, or he spent 13 years in a crate smaller than a coffin (the presiding officer interrupted the mp and asked him to speak more slowly because of his fellow Members and interpreters). If that's what reminded you of the Middle East, you're wrong. These are so-called special interrogation methods of the CIA, and that's what happened today.  There is another difference: in particular, in the last century, a number of conventions, charters, legal bases, the Constitution on human rights have been written and symbolically signed, you have mentioned, practically in all countries of the world. The US is a signatory to the Convention Against Torture, which explicitly prohibits torture even in emergency situations.  I deliberately made a very crude introduction, and I'm deliberately speaking in the plural, because we're complicit. It has been more than seven years since the adoption of the European Parliament's final report on CIA activities in Europe, I repeat, seven years. The countries of the European Union, however, have still not come out with the truth. Practically nothing happened. No one has been called to account.  The fight against terrorism and, do not laugh, respect for human rights is not mutually exclusive. And the victims of the war on terror deserve justice, too.  Torture is illegal, it is immoral and unacceptable. The involvement of Europe in any form, in any illegal CIA activity, is a disgraceful, unworthy democracy and the foundations and values on which the European Union has grown.  We therefore demand a full investigation and clear answers from the Member States. Impunity is unacceptable, as is the unacceptable preteaction, that nothing has happened and that we are not involved. We demand measures that ensure effective, democratic control over the work of intelligence agencies. We are asking for safeguards to ensure that nothing like this happens again in Europe.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as we all know, this House has always had a particular interest in the CIA's transfer and detention programme and the alleged transport and illegal detention of detainees in European countries under the CIA. Six resolutions have already been voted on in the last two parliamentary terms. The recent AMERICAN report has concerned European Member States admitting – I am thinking of Poland, which has admitted the existence of a secret detention site – that they were helping the CIA's practices. The transfer of terror suspects was considered ok by the intelligence services of certain European Member States too frivolously and too quickly. The value of the American report therefore lies mainly in the fact that it reflects our European practices. The European Union says it stands for standards and values of respect for human rights for third countries. Our European shared history is invariably cited here. But those principles also apply to ourselves and our allies, and not just useful in a human rights dialogue or human rights hearings. The fight against terrorism is indeed necessary and the balance between the protection of society and the infringements of personal freedoms must be correct. Today we see the consequences of the anti-terror policy that has been pursued. We see that extremists in Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan have been able to reunite and become bloodier and more powerful by the day. The reputational damage that Europe has suffered is considerable. Without wanting to undermine the need to fight terrorism, respect for human rights is an absolute prerequisite for ensuring the effectiveness of any anti-terror policy and, above all, to maintain citizens' confidence in the EU's democratic system. By uncritiquely cooperating with the CIA programme, the European Union has violated this trust.

I think this reminds us – and I think Ms Hohlmeier said it very rightly – that what sets a democracy apart from a dictatorship is accountability and moral authority. None of us around the world are immune to these tendencies. We all have this kind of violence in us, but what makes us different is that we have accountability and there is no impunity in a democracy. Therefore I am very pleased to hear all colleagues from all political groups insisting on accountability and on the need for Europe to come clean with regard to its role in this whole CIA programme, because we can point at the Americans, but Europe has supported the CIA counter-terrorism programme – all aspects of it.  I am glad that Poland finally made an admission, but let us not forget that there are a number of Member States that are close allies of the US – the Five Eyes and the Nine Eyes – and this Parliament has expressed itself several times. Therefore I am actually shocked to hear the commonplaces uttered by the Italian Presidency. Italy is the one country that has actually prosecuted CIA agents. You have convicted 24 CIA agents. Will Italy, will the Italian Presidency, insist on extradition by the United States and bring those people to trial, just as everyone else who is responsible for torture should be brought to trial? No, Mr Obama, we cannot draw a line under this until those responsible have been brought to justice. That is why we are a democracy and the others are not. I have another question: I read a statement in the press by the Head of INTCEN, the intelligence centre which is a kind of vague, unclear, embryonic European Union secret service. He said there is no way of knowing whether the intelligence that INTCEN receives was obtained through torture. Excuse me? This is an EU body paid for by EU money, processing information that may have been obtained from third countries, processing information that may have been obtained from torture? Well maybe he does not, but then we should know; we should finally get answers on the nature and the activities of INTCEN; answers we have asked for many times.

Confirmation of the cooperation of European governments and the existence of CIA prisons on European Union soil; confirmation of the futility of torture beyond its despicable character; confirmation that the actions of the secret services must be supervised and scrupulously controlled, their abuses punished; confirmation, above all, that the fundamental rights of citizens cannot be sacrificed in the name of the indispensable fight against terrorism. The publication of this report calls for a new stage in the mobilization for the building of true international justice. The scale of the crimes forces us to be imaginative and legally daring. Do you not think that it calls, also and above all, the European Union, whose leaders have directly collaborated on this programme, to transparency and action? The facts are there, the elements clear. The European Union and its Member States must assume their responsibilities and facilitate legal proceedings. The European Parliament must continue its work of investigating and reviving transparency so that the whole truth is clear: organising hearings and delegations of the LIBE committee on the premises of secret prisons is a bare minimum. Now that the facts have been confirmed, and we know that the fundamental rights of the Union have been violated, do you not think that Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty of the European Union should be applied and the necessary sanctions implemented?

This virtue, which is typical of the US legal system and the spirit of its institutions and its citizens, cannot, however, make it possible to ignore and consequently prevent us from denouncing and condemning any form of violence against human rights.  The words of those who have tried to justify torture on suspected terrorists as a useful tool for gathering information for national security are therefore unspeakable and unacceptable – and this is the second aspect of my reflection. There is nothing, neither in peace nor in war, to justify torture which, as we know, not only violates the inalienable right to integrity of the human being but which, moreover, cannot in any way be regarded as an instrument for the search for the truth. The US Senate report, in particular, highlights a number of abuses, lies and misapsreaches committed by the CIA.

Systematically and against any international law, the CIA has tortured people all over the world, including in the EU. The CIA has always maintained that it has received such valuable information to prevent terrorist attacks. A lie.  But regardless of this, torture is not a means of combating crime, but a crime itself. Torture betrays the core of our value system. Human dignity is at the heart of our actions. This distinguishes us centrally from fundamentalist extremists. We must speak a different language than violence in the prevention and investigation of terrorist crimes, otherwise we will provide extremists with arguments to incite rejection and hatred against our democracies. This is not just a question of morality, but simply international law. Torture is never allowed. Torture must always be prosecuted by any state. It is a disgrace to Europe that the EU states turned a blind eye when it came to illegal transport of prisoners or the provision of prisons. As early as 2007, the European Parliament called for comprehensive clarification – to this day without any result. Who caused people, including EU citizens, to be kidnapped, transferred, arrested and tortured without charge, and who knew about it? Just last week, senior representatives of Poland and Romania confirmed the existence of secret torture camps. Will there be consequences? National governments alone seem unable to do so – they are too entangled in crime. That is why we need effective EU mechanisms to prevent our Member States from blatantly violating fundamental European values.  The CIA tortures show what happens when a terrorist regime emerges past the rule of law. No one is protected, but our democracies are threatened as a whole. It is up to us as Europeans to take a firm stand against this, and I can only hope that the Commission will actually stand by us in this.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2094, "date": "2014-12-17.json", "name": "Zdzisław KRASNODĘBSKI", "mepid": "124891", "text": "   Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking The fact that torture may have been used on the territory of Polish caused a stir and outrage among the Polish public, regardless of all the security reasons that these practices are trying to justify, and the fact that it was about the suspects of murdering many thousands of innocent people.

However, as so many times before, when the effects of torture have been investigated, it has been shown that the method is meaningless.

Unfortunately this is not new. The five techniques were used by the British Government to torture 14 Irish men interned over 40 years ago. As a result, the Irish Government brought the British Government to the European Court of Human Rights, which was the first time a Member State took another to that Court. That happened in 1978 in a landmark Ireland vs UK case on the hooded men. However, the Court ruled that the five techniques amounted to inhumane and degrading treatment – not torture. The Bush administration justified the used of these torture techniques in Iraq, Afghanistan and Guantánamo Bay by quoting the EU Court ruling on the hooded men. However, information recently discovered by the Pat Finucane Centre shows that the British Government lied to the European Court of Human Rights on the effects of these techniques, and that the 14 hooded men were indeed tortured. These torture techniques were sanctioned at the highest level of government by the then British Minister of Defence, Lord Carrington. Only last week, the Irish Government confirmed it had referred the case of the hooded men back to the European Court of Human Rights to revise its judgment. Britain is guilty of torture.

It shows that, unlike Russia and China, the United States of America is always able, when it has built crap, to put things right in a self-cleaning process. That is the big difference between a democracy and a dictatorship. For this, the democracies should not be insulted. However, it is true in substance: this procedure is not legally tenable, there is no reason to justify it, and it is completely lawless. It is inhumane and must be criticised. That is quite clear, and that is why I myself visited Guantanamo and have always been clear on this issue; since these practices are unacceptable and do not comply with international humanitarian law, this must be strongly criticised. But please do not hypocritically, as if the United States of America were the greatest perpetrator on earth. We must also see that this was a consequence, a consequence that cannot be regarded as an alibi, but a consequence of acts of terrorism carried out against American citizens, which are hardly named by anyone here. Because there is a history, which you have to express. I repeat, however, that the balance between freedom and security cannot be so misplaced that it destroys fundamental human rights. That is the criticism. The Americans are in the process of restoring the balance. And I think it's a crucial point to be critical of it, but to understand that connection.

She was brave then, and she was brave on this subject. She faced huge pressure on the question of making this report happen. We should be very aware – and Mr Coelho will agree – that we have now been vindicated on our 2006 CIA rendition inquiry and our report, which were happening in a very different context in a very different time. I would remind colleagues that, in 2006, when we in this Parliament investigated with secondary sources – not the primary sources that the US Senate had – all of these terrible and horrific brutal torture methods, it was under severe pressure. We were investigating our own governments in that context in a very fragile way, but we have been vindicated, because many of the same conclusions were reached in this Parliament. That was a very difficult thing for us to do.  What conclusions did we come up with? We came up with what John McCain said. He was a Republican, a man who had been tortured, and someone who understood the difference between interrogation and brutal torture. What he said was that it was legally and morally wrong. But he also said that it brought no new information in the fight against terrorism. These are people who are not soft on terrorism. These are people who understand the qualitative difference between interrogation and torture, and the qualitative difference between having no information and bad information. That was John McCain, and that is why people are quoting him today. So let us understand that we were vindicated in our enquiry. This is not the end of the road. We have people languishing in Guantánamo Bay today who should be free, like Shaker Aamer. These are people whom our governments are requesting to be freed, who have been tortured and who have families, but who are actually languishing in prison. The story is not finished. It has only begun. These are our citizens – EU citizens. They are languishing in prison and they have been tortured repeatedly. We want them back and we should be representing them.

These inadequate parliamentary scrutinies allow inadequate scrutiny of the kinds of actions that we now see which allow this extreme kind of torture which ends up with the kind of Senate report that we see today.

Clearly, in order to combat certain phenomena, we must be prepared to do certain things. Otherwise, terrorism will never be combated. In Italy, too, there has been terrorism: the Red Brigades. You fought how? With imprisonment, of course, but also with the repentant, with those who tried to say things. He made sure he did something. Of course, on even more serious matters, it is clear, I repeat, that the Americans have only done well and if others do so, I say to combat Islamic terrorism, everything is fine, as long as everything is defeated.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "NI", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2121, "date": "2014-12-17.json", "name": "Carlos COELHO", "mepid": "1892", "text": "   Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, in 2007 and 2006 this Parliament investigated this case through a committee to which I had the honour of chairing. Some said at the time that it was impossible for a rule of law like the United States of America to commit the illegal acts assigned to them. U.S. authorities claimed the allegations were unfounded. Lied! In September 2006 we had a witness that we had not asked for: George W. Bush, then President of the United States of America, confirmed to the world the extraordinary renditions program and acknowledged that kidnappings, the non-subjection of detainees to a court, the existence of secret prisons, were not subjected to torture. He lied once again, as seen by the now published U.S. Senate report. This Senate report leaves us with four important messages. First, it takes courage to have moral authority, as Senator Feinstein pointed out, and well, only an adult democracy is able to review its own mistakes and help prevent them from repeating themselves in the future. Second, we can't give up on bringing the truth to the fore. Without us being it, it is not clear that the truth always comes to the fore, especially when national governments create obstacles to what has happened. I reiterate what I have said more than once in this House: under no circumstances can state secrecy be overstood with inalienable fundamental rights. This Parliament must continue its efforts and contribute to the full clarification of what has happened in the European Union. Thirdly, the ends do not justify the means. Torture is not morally acceptable, condemned by international law and is not even effective, as this report proves and, moreover, has already been stated by Senator McCain. And finally, there is a deficit in democratic control of the secret services. The report is proof that for several years democratic control over the secret services has not worked. The secret services must be subject to greater democratic control and this must also happen in the European Union.

Freedom is the foundation of the Western community of values, and protecting it is a priority for any state that feels it belongs to it. There is no doubt that, in certain situations and under certain conditions, restrictions on these rights may also be necessary. September 11 was such a situation.  Unfortunately, the CIA report confirmed the concerns of many at the time that these measures were not merely thought of in a case-by-case and proportionate way, but rather overdrafted and ultimately turned into their opposite. There was a paradigm shift in Western security policy: more control, more surveillance, and more repression. At times, it seems that the West wants to move to a permanent state of emergency. With little success, by the way. The threat of terrorism has rather increased.  A German magazine said these days: \"Perhaps this was Osama Bin Laden's greatest triumph: \"[...] that America now stands as an unjust state.\" One must agree with this, but with the addition that the handling of these inglorious events by the majority in the American Senate shows just as impressively that the United States does not want to be an unjust state.

These things have led nations around the world – and not just the United States – to unite their efforts in a common endeavour, abandon their defensive attitudes and react. Today's situation, when Islamic State manages to recruit more and more of its true estrets, perhaps also because of a polarisation of society, shows us that the peace, security and safety of the citizen are always at risk. Innocent people fall prey to ferocious acts of terrorism every day, and recent tragedies show us that these threats take a domestic form, in other words they come from European passport holders.  Detention centres have emerged as a consequence of the fact that terrorism does not take into account borders and, at the same time, the need to identify its causes and, in particular, to find answers to what is to be done in order to remove or at least diminish the phenomenon.

It has cast a shadow over security services that are supposed to protect the citizens of the world and, as President Obama said himself, the image of the US has been tarnished. Indeed the report has thrown up many questions for European citizens, as well as European governments.  When you condone the use of torture and extreme methods of interrogation, and when you ignore the very values that you are trying to defend, you give fuel to those extremists who are looking for weaknesses. The fight against terrorism is a fight about values and acting contrary to those values is therefore not just wrong but is counterproductive.  The justification of ISIS and similar terror groups is that they are fighting a just war against a powerful tyrant. Torture to the extent that it was spelled out in this report gives fuel to that notion. What message does it send to those who are intent on killing innocent civilians, beheading charity workers and killing aimlessly? The message we send is that there are no limits to depravity. Not only do we fail in our standards of humanity, but we encourage others to disregard human life and suffering. We may now face a scenario whereby seemingly dangerous men and women who are currently detained can use this report to prove that they were tortured to the point of becoming psychologically unstable and their admissions and evidence can no longer be relied on. One could question how many other ongoing trials will face disruption due to the revelations in this report. There are those who argue that the end justifies the means when it comes to protecting our lives. Indeed the Washington Post reported that a new poll shows that 51 % of Americans described the CIA torture methods as justified in that they gleaned information that prevented terrorist attacks.

We must not allow these conventions that have been ratified by nearly every country in the world, including the United States, to be set aside and to be rewritten to serve an end. We must not allow standards of humanity at times of conflict to be neglected. We must show leadership in democratic states.

Kidnappings, disappearances, days of sleep deprivation, imprisonment in small boxes, sexual abuse, waterboarding – the list of CIA torture practices is long, and it's just creepy.

In other words, the full truth about what happened under the guise of the fight against terrorism is still in the dark.

Any use of torture blatantly violates our values.  But pointing the finger at the US is not enough. Whether the motivation was misunderstood loyalty to the alliance or even money flowed, who in Europe was partly responsible for the illegal CIA practices, must be held accountable.

And it is worth welcoming this report. I note that all the forces of the democratic arc in this area strongly condemn torture and any practice that moves outside the limits of the rule of law, respect for human rights, the principles and values on which the European edifice is founded. I said in my recommendation that torture is a crime and those who are accountable are the responsibility of the states themselves to punish them. But there has also been criticism in this area: that Europe has in many cases tolerated them. I want to assure you that Europe has never adopted these practices that offend democracy and human rights. In fact, for the short time I have been with you, what I see in front of me every day is our obligation to protect them. The work of today's assembly as well as the investigation of the United States Senate Committee demonstrate the fundamental role played by democratic control, democratic oversight of national security and law enforcement. The practices that have emerged through the debate and that we have discussed here today show that the defence and promotion of fundamental rights require constant efforts and vigilance. And, yes, I will agree with you that the responsibility is shared by everyone – and by the Member States. And I am sure that the President-in-Office of the European Council, who is here today, will take Parliament's concerns and concerns to the Member States. But I would remind you of something very important – because some aphorisms have also been heard: that the investigation of the Committee of the United States Senate is the result of democratic and parliamentary scrutiny. We welcome it as a mature reaction of a democratic society and remind ing that democracy has the institutions, it has the strength and the will to protect people and their rights. At this point I would like to make a reference to something important, in my opinion, that President Obama said, who, as you know, banned torture when he took over as President: \"Today's report can help us leave these techniques where they belong - in the past.\" Some of the Members referred to Guantánamo. You have heard the Commission's position at the beginning, and I repeat it. And our position is clear and consistent. Yes, we're calling for the closure of Guantánamo. We have consistently adhered to this attitude not only with regard to the indefinite detention of terrorism suspects at Guantánamo but – I remind you – also to the death penalty, the imprisonment of minors and other important human rights issues. Reference was also made to counter-terrorism cooperation between the European Union and the United States of America. This cooperation is very important for European security and the protection of our peoples. At European Union level we have concluded agreements with the United States of America on a number of initiatives that facilitate this cooperation and make it more effective and always in line with fundamental rights. The European Union and its Member States as well as the United States of America have a shared responsibility to ensure that their counter-terrorism cooperation fully respects fundamental rights and the rule of law and, where appropriate, international humanitarian and refugee law. We, and I would like to assure you of this, will continue to raise and discuss these issues with the United States of America and, where necessary, express our concerns and concerns and our proposals for situations that are contrary to the values and principles on which the European Union is founded, to the same values and principles on which the American democratic structure is based. The particular attention paid by the European Parliament to these issues gives us political support and democratic control, to ensure that all concerns are addressed in a balanced and correct manner, which at the same time does not allow us to rest. The main conclusion from this debate today is that the European Union and its democratic institutions are the guardians of our fundamental human rights, human dignity and democratic conquests.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2149, "date": "2014-12-17.json", "name": "Benedetto DELLA VEDOVA", "mepid": "4739", "text": "  Mr President- in-Office of the Council. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you for this frank and open exchange of views. As I have already said, it is important to ensure that the abuses referred to in the US Senate report – and which have been mentioned today – never happen again and that human rights are fully respected in the fight against terrorism. I believe that the European Parliament has an important role to play in the transatlantic debate on counter-terrorism and international law and human rights. It is important for you to be able to address members of the US Congress to express your views on counter-terrorism policy and we have already seen that the concerns expressed by allies may influence the policy of the United States of America. Congress is now discussing the important issue of surveillance and data protection and respect for privacy. Congress voted against a bill that would reform one of several programs that fundamentally affected Americans. It will be important for the European Parliament to express its views in the UNITED States Congress, to respect the protection of the privacy of the citizens of the European Union. The European Parliament could also play an important role vis-à-vis the parliaments of the countries of the Middle East and North Africa, in particular those involved in security reforms, so that effective control mechanisms are put in place in these countries. As I said at the beginning, cooperation between the European Union and the United States of America on counter-terrorism is and remains essential. The European Parliament has an important role to play with regard to the relevant instruments: the terrorist finance tracking programme and the passenger name record between the European Union and the United States and the Safe Harbour Agreement. It is important to have effective instruments to protect privacy and fundamental rights. Both the European Union and the United States of America are facing a serious terrorist threat today, particularly from ISIL and foreign fighters. We also need sophisticated data tools to deal with the threat in a way that respects human rights.

Last Sunday, raids by the Turkish police led to the arrest of numerous journalists and members of the media in Turkey. We have all followed this matter very closely. The High Representative/Vice-President, Mr Mogherini, and Commissioner Hahn issued a statement on Sunday afternoon, stressing unequivocally that the attacks and arrests that have taken place are incompatible with the freedom of the press, a fundamental principle of democracy. The declaration also expressed the hope that the principle of the presumption of innocence would be respected and recalled the inviolable right to an independent and transparent investigation, in the event of alleged wrongdoing, in full respect of the right of defence of the persons concerned.  Obviously, illegal acts must be punished, but always within the framework of the rule of law and respecting the principle of proportionality. Yesterday, the Council also discussed the situation and adopted clear and decisive conclusions on the expectations of the European Union and Turkey's obligations as a candidate country.  The Council of Europe's Commissioner for Human Rights, Nils Muižnieks, expressed deep concern about Sunday's events as a serious step backwards for media freedom in that country. This Parliament has also made its voice heard, and there are many of you, together with President Schulz, who have expressed your concerns about the latest developments, and this debate must enable us to strengthen the message we want to send to Turkey. We all agree that Turkey, as a candidate country, must aspire to the highest levels of democratic guarantees in terms of both standards and practices. This includes full respect for freedom of expression, which is essential for the real and exercise of a number of other human rights, including freedom of association and assembly and freedom of thought and religion or belief. Democracy cannot exist without these freedoms. In its 2014 progress report on Turkey, the Commission welcomed the positive developments in turkey, such as the democratisation package, the action plan against human rights violations, the rulings of the Turkish Constitutional Court and the active efforts to find a solution to the Kurdish question. At the same time, the report expressed concern about a number of developments which, on the other hand, threaten, in particular, the independence of the judiciary and freedom of expression. The problems with freedom of the press and freedom of expression in Turkey are not new: we have seen repression against journalists and social media, following the protests at Gezi Park. During the recent political dialogue and in bilateral meetings, the European Union reiterated that the accession process remains the keystone of relations between the European Union and Turkey and, at the same time, expressed its concern about the rule of law and fundamental freedoms, in particular freedom of expression, stressing that the main driving force behind this process is developments on the ground in Turkey in the first place, with regard to the rule of law and fundamental rights. During their recent visit to Turkey together with Commissioner Stylianides, High Representative/Vice-President Mogherini and Commissioner Hahn stressed that the rule of law and fundamental freedoms are essential areas in which Turkey must make progress. All turkish interlocutors reaffirmed the importance of relations between the European Union and Turkey and welcomed the joint visit. They have all expressed their commitment to the process of accession to the European Union and the strong political will to take it forward and to advance political reforms. High Representative Mogherini and Commissioners Hahn and Stylianides reaffirmed that this strong commitment to the European Union expressed by our Turkish counterparts during the visit must be translated into action. The Member States of the European Union have repeatedly stressed that Turkey is an essential partner and agree that it is important to send a clear message to it on the need to advance reforms aimed at establishing appropriate checks and balances in order to fully protect freedom, which includes freedom of thought, expression and the press. The Member States also recalled that the progress of the accession negotiations depends on respect for the rule of law and fundamental rights. The European Union stands ready to support Turkey's efforts in this area. We believe that the accession process remains the best framework for advancing and support reforms in Turkey. The European Union's position on this point is very clear and has been conveyed to the Turkish interlocutors with absolute clarity and consistency. The European Union has the right and the duty to follow issues of this kind closely in a candidate country and we now await a constructive engagement on the part of Turkey with regard to these concerns. In my opinion, this means continuing in good faith on the road to accession, we must make the most of the instruments we have and Turkey needs to cooperate with us. I hope that the Turkish Government's commitment to the European Union will bear fruit. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to assure you once again that this issue is a priority for the European Union and that we will continue to follow it closely. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your attention and I look forward to hearing your views in the debate.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "NI", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2161, "date": "2014-12-17.json", "name": "Cristian Dan PREDA", "mepid": "96838", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, I would like to say at the outset that I speak as a friend of Turkey. I am not, in other words, one of those politicians who are building a career by opposing this candidate country to the Union.

At this point it seems to me that the intention of Turkish politicians to join the Union and build a democratic society is no longer at all clear, and I ask them directly the question: 'where in this regard?'. Those who have remained, I believe, the main supporters of accession, the Turkish businessmen, are also extremely concerned and this, of course, must raise a question mark first and foremost with the authorities in Turkey. As far as I am concerned, I continue to support the setting of benchmarks for the opening of negotiating chapters 23 and 24. It is a position that has already been voted on in the last resolution on the progress report on Turkey. I believe that in this way we could contribute to the debate taking place in Turkey on these subjects.

Free and pluralistic media are an essential component of any democracy. I am therefore deeply concerned about what happened last Sunday when media outlets were raided by the Turkish police and critical journalists were arrested. At times when Turkey was already coming in for criticism about press freedom and judicial independence, this counts as another blow. Should the detainees be charged with alleged wrongdoings, we expect that a due process will be conducted whereby the principle of presumption of innocence will prevail, and an independent, transparent investigation will be conducted. Last week I visited Turkey as the European Parliament’s rapporteur. There was a clear understanding from the side of the government that further reforms are needed. Therefore I welcomed the statement by the government that the EU accession process, further democratisation and the Kurdish settlement process are its first priorities. The fact that we are concerned about the deteriorating situation of fundamental rights and the rule of law in the country actually shows our commitment to the accession process. But in the end it is the Turkish Government which sits behind the steering wheel. The events of 14 December caused serious concerns in the EU about Turkish willingness to make progress in the field of democratic reforms. In the weeks to come, therefore, it is up to Ankara to convince us that it is still truly committed to moving closer to the EU and its core values. The accession process is a unique opportunity for Turkey to develop a strong pluralistic democratic system with solid institutions for the benefit of all citizens of Turkey.

So far, only one chapter of 33 has been opened and closed, as Turkey still refuses to recognise the Republic of Cyprus. The decline of secular Turkey and the rise to power of the Islamist AKP has posed new challenges as President Erdoğan’s increasingly erratic authoritarian approach takes on the students, the army, journalists and now the rival Islamist group, the Gülenists, who have dared challenge the corruption and obstruction of justice in that country. Erdoğan has also backtracked on the PKK ceasefire negotiations, and only under huge NATO pressure has he finally agreed to allow support for beleaguered Kurdish forces in Kobani, as he sees brutal ISIS as less of a threat to Turkish interests than the secular PKK.

I was among those critical friends of Turkey who argued that an ongoing membership process helps reforms, but reality suggests the opposite. Last weekend’s arrest of journalists is part of a trend of government-led breaches of fundamental freedoms and the rule of law in Turkey. Only a week after a high-level EU delegation visited Ankara, relations have now hit another low point. There was reason for concern before. After corruption allegations included Erdoğan – then Prime Minister, now President – and key members of his Cabinet, hundreds of police officers and prosecutors were relocated and threatened with prosecution. Those threats have now materialised and are also being used on journalists, while Turkey already held the world record for imprisoned journalists. The obvious question is why the EU would act firmly only now. It comes down to our fears of Turkey sliding ever further away from democracy if the negotiations were to stop. Yet too many watershed moments have passed without serious criticism from Europe, from the banning of an unpublished book by Ahmet Şik to mass arrests and trials without due process. The witch-hunt of Gülen supporters is only the latest in a long list of rule of law violations. Members of the Fethullah Gülen Hizmet Movement and the AKP have created monsters together by helping each other in a coalition that long turned against everything on their combined path. Now they are turning against each other, leading to even more violations of the rule of law. Today there are masses of people in Turkey who live in fear for their future – women, academics, artists, business leaders and, frankly, anyone who is critical of the government. Losing a job or a licence, receiving a tax fine or even being prosecuted for attempting to overthrow the government have become common tools to punish opponents, while laws were passed placing members of the security establishment and government officials above those laws.

This must not be forgotten in this debate as common challenges. Nevertheless, it is right to be critical, very critical, about what happened last weekend.

Journalists are arrested and the media are constantly subjected to pressure and censorship. No country has been convicted as often in the European Court of Human Rights for violations of freedom of expression as Turkey. It is a clear repressive policy, but it is wrapped in beautiful covers and sounding words. Despite pressure from the EUROPEAN Union, Turkey has not changed its mind, and I welcome the fact that the Commission is protesting against these systematic crimes to which Turkey is subjecting its citizens.  Some previous events worth mentioning are the newspaper Azadiya Welat which has been closed as many as 8 times. The former editor-in-chief of vedat Kurşun newspaper is serving a 166-year prison sentence and nine journalists from the same newspaper are in prison. A few years ago, the reporter Ersin Çelik was sentenced to 6 years in prison, and at the same time the journalist Metin Alataş from said Azadiya Welat was found hanged in a tree.

The restrictions on freedom of expression and the press in Turkey, which is really not new, we have had for years.

Social media has been shut down and now the latest act: last Sunday's raid and arrests.  But this is, of course, incompatible with our fundamental values in the EU. Freedom of expression and freedom of the press are indispensable in a democracy, as we obviously cannot say enough to Turkey. A state that so arbitrarily restricts these fundamental rights and freedoms is undemocratic and can never become a member of the European Union. However, Turkey does not meet the other Copenhagen political pre-accession criteria on any single point. This is also evident, for example, in the prevention of the investigation of allegations of corruption against the political elite, against members of the government a year ago. Files were confiscated, officers who investigated, transferred or dismissed in the police and jurisdiction. To this day, there is no enlightenment, because President Erdogan does not want it. After all, his son is also under suspicion. So the rule of law does not exist in Turkey either, only the self-aggrandism of President Erdogan.

Those are the words of a human rights defender speaking to me on the phone earlier from the front line in Turkey. Why are they not safe? As Federica Mogherini and Commissioner Hahn said in their joint statements, the police raids and arrests of a number of journalists and media representatives in Turkey today are incompatible with freedom of the media, which is a core principle of democracy. Human rights activists, ordinary journalists and people opposing the government are deeply worried by a pattern of curtailment of media freedoms and questions being raised about the independence of the judiciary.  This week’s wave of harassment, under accusations of founding a terror organisation seeking to overthrow the government, indicates the problems with Turkey’s broad based anti-terrorism law, as these accusations are some of the most serious charges which can be levelled under the country’s penal code. Human rights activists in Turkey have told me that those arrested are not clear of what charges they are being arrested under; they are being arrested and detained, and I quote: ‘without concrete evidence, under vague charges and without a clear indictment’. This is clearly in contravention of the European Convention, Articles 5 and 6: the right to liberty and to a fair trial.  I appreciate that Volkan Bozkır, the Minister of EU Affairs, provided assurances to the Commission – as he has done to us – that Turkey seeks to uphold the rule of law. It is right that Turkey, with its geographical and political role in the on-going fight against terrorism, has anti-terrorism legislation. However, if it is correct – as widely reported – that members of the opposition and journalists are getting arrested and having to prove their innocence while prosecutors fail to provide evidence of any criminal activity, then Turkey may be talking about the rule of law, but failing to uphold it in practice. Finally, Mr President, for those who have queued up to use this yet again to make threats about the accession process, the lesson in this for me is more engagement with Turkey not less. Let us have our resolution in January condemning, in strong terms, the treatment of journalists, but let our rapporteur do her job in committee to draw up a resolution in the interests of Turkey as a country and of the Turkish people.

People who took to the streets during the Gezi protests are also now being charged for allegedly making coup attempts, while police forces who have used violence are not being prosecuted. President Erdogan is obviously trying to keep any criticism of him quiet and to prevent it. But this is completely the wrong way to go about an emerging democracy. Turkey can only benefit from a vibrant civil society and a critical press. I hope that Erdogan will finally see this. Without the rule of law and without democratic standards, Turkey will not make progress. But the EU, and the Member States in particular, have also done something wrong here. Because if Member States always block the accession process, close chapters, when they say that Turkey cannot join anyway, no matter what it does, no matter what standards it complies with, then we are not helping civil society, then we are not helping the critical voices, but we are preventing us from having a lever now, for example, to really have serious talks with Turkey.

It was appropriate to take this opportunity to take note of the serious concerns about the most recent events in order to formulate an unambiguous position and to convey it with absolute clarity and consistency to our Turkish interlocutors. We must continue to monitor the situation very closely. The European Union must continue to promote freedom of expression, opinion, assembly and association, both online and offline, because a democracy cannot exist without these rights. Turkey is a privileged partner with which we are negotiating accession; we can and must communicate with her frankly. As President Schulz said, the relationship with the candidate countries must be honest and open. I just wanted to pick up on the points that have been raised that relating to funding, which is certainly a point that deserves attention. The European Union does not finance the Turkish budget but mainly NGOs and institutions that promote the rule of law and human rights, mainly through two instruments, namely the pre-accession instrument and the European Instrument for Human Rights. The Commission is examining how to make this form of intervention more effective, and I would stress, among other things, that the per capita allocates to Turkey are, in any case, the lowest among the candidate countries. The framework for enlargement is the right one to engage in the process of deepening and consolidating democratic reforms.

Today, we are taking a very important step towards showing new opportunities for Georgia and its people to build a stable, successful and successful future for Europe. Georgia has always been a European country, but Georgian culture is an important part of European culture. According to a recent survey, 69% of the Georgian people support the signing of the Association Agreement. Such strong aid places a great deal of responsibility on the authorities, the executors of this agreement. Today's ratification of tomorrow is a logical follow-up to the work launched by the European Union and Georgia initiating an EU-Georgia action plan eight years ago. Five years ago, the European Union and its partners launched the Eastern Partnership programme, in which many projects were successfully implemented. At the outset, the full realisation of these plans seemed too optimistic, but the example of Georgia shows that the road will not be done by those who talk about the difficulties, but those who are focused and persistent in doing their job. I was pleasantly surprised, colleagues, to see how much the Georgian Government and the Georgian people did. It was not easy to make changes in so many areas of society and the economy in such a short period of time. It is very difficult to convince the public, entrepreneurs and political elite that rapid but sometimes painful reforms are needed. Similar reforms in western European countries had been carried out over the decades, but Georgia had to do so within a few years. Colleagues, much work has been done in the previous period, but there are many issues that require increased attention in the future – such as the continued political polarisation of Georgian society, the fight against corruption, problems with the territories of abkhazia and Chinvali and South Ossetia, and other important issues. The Association Agreement imposes responsibility on both parties. The European Union must help Georgia fight corruption, continue to build an independent judicial system, strengthen media freedom, protect minorities and do everything to ensure that the Georgian people receive all the benefits of their European choices. Honourable colleagues, I would particularly like to note that, thanks to the Association Agreement, Georgia could hope for a series of positive changes. These include: increasing trade, creating new jobs, facilitating the visual regime and, in the perspective, inwardvising visa-free travel, improving investment opportunities, and many other positive moments. The European Union, for its part, can receive the opportunity to carry out joint sustainable projects in trade, energy, transport and other sectors. European entrepreneurs will be given new opportunities in Georgia, where they will be able to invest their funds safely, buy or sell their goods and services. To conclude, I would like to thank all my colleagues who have taken part in the preparation of this report and in the implementation of the ratification of this treaty, especially shadow reporters from all the political groups, those Members who tabled their proposals. I very much hope, dear colleagues, for a constructive discussion and a positive vote. Honourable colleagues, I would like to say to each of you that the georgian people deserve positive change, and I hope that we MePs will vote for them.

The European Parliament’s strong support will be an important message for the reinforcement of our ties with Georgia and it will create excellent conditions for closer cooperation with Georgia.  Georgia is one of the frontrunners of the European Union’s Eastern Partnership policy. The Association Agreement before you today is the result of Georgia’s European aspirations. It is also the result of our determination to promote building a democratic, stable and prosperous country in a region that is of key strategic importance to us. Georgia will transform itself as we implement our joint agenda. Georgia will, as a result, move closer to the European Union, deepening its political association and economic integration with the EU. Georgia will introduce reforms that will build into its public life core European values such as a pluralist democracy and a deeper respect for due process and the rule of law. Following the signature and the provisions of application of the agreement, we have had our first EU-Georgia Association Council under the agreement exactly one month ago in Brussels – the first step for the implementation of this agreement. On the same day we concluded that Georgia meets the first phase requirements of the visa dialogue and that the second implementation phase of the action plan could be launched. This was yet another important step in the process that will bring Georgia closer to its goal of a visa-free regime with the European Union.  It is difficult to say that Georgia has made important progress in its democratic development following parliamentary and presidential elections in 2012 and 2013 as well as local elections in 2014. But this message was also given and was well received. The political climate in the country needs improving. Political confrontation and polarisation should be avoided and space for opposition and cross-party dialogue needs to be ensured. In the same vein, Georgia needs to continue efforts to reform the judiciary and ensure the rule of law. I am pleased to report that the provisional application of the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area of the Association Agreement since 1 December is already showing first results. Trade statistics for September are positive and stable. The effect of the agreement is yet to be confirmed but the September 2014 figures indicate a 50% increase in imports from Georgia into the European Union, mainly in nuts and mineral products. The European Union will further assist reforms in Georgia and help small and medium enterprises adapt to the new regulatory framework with a EUR 51 million programme under the Annual Action Programme of this year. Let me now turn to the most recent developments in the Georgian breakaway regions, mainly the so-called Strategic Partnership Treaty between the Russian Federation and the Abkhazia de facto authorities. Reports on a similar undertaking with the South Ossetian de facto authorities are equally disconcerting. Just like earlier agreements signed between the Russian Federation and Abkhazia, this so-called treaty questions the sovereignty and integrity of Georgia. It is also detrimental to ongoing efforts to stabilise the security situation in the region, and it does not contribute to de-escalation. It also contradicts principles of international law and commitments taken by the Russian Federation. Let me reconfirm the European Union’s unwavering support for Georgia’s territorial integrity. We remain fully committed to supporting conflict resolution in Georgia including through our co-chairmanship of the Geneva International Talks and our monitoring mission in Georgia. Let me also, again, underline our appreciation for Georgia’s contribution to the European Union’s mission in the Central African Republic on the basis of our framework agreement for Georgia’s participation in the European Union’s Common Security and Defence Policy missions. To conclude, let me say that the partnership between the European Union and Georgia is a strong one. It will become even stronger with the European Parliament’s verification of our Association Agreement.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2217, "date": "2014-12-17.json", "name": "Olli REHN", "mepid": "2119", "text": "  rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on International Trade. - Madam President, Georgia has been a reliable partner and pursued closer political and economic ties with the European Union, despite significant pressure from Russia.

The growth has been driven by the liberal trade regime of Georgia.

The draft resolution before you is the result of the patient work of the representatives of the factions to whom it belongs thanks. We've been through many pitfalls, let me mention two of them. First of all, when processing text, we tried to call things by their real names. Let's go back 25 years. Russia annexed Abkhazi. Two years later, the Chechen war began, killing 80,000 civilians. In 2008, Russia's 58th army occupied South Ossetia. It was the same army that killed in Chechnya. This year, the Russian Federation again grossly violated international law twice. It occupied Crimea and started a hybrid war in eastern Ukraine. We did not use euphemisms to formulate our draft resolution, and we clearly called the occupation an occupation. I think that the position of the European Parliament and of the entire European Union must reflect the possibility that the Russian Federation will continue to violate international law and that the Russian military will commit war crimes. If we do not take a clear position, we may bear some of the blame. If Europe had clearly condemned the aggression in Chechia and Abkhazia, there would have been no aggression in Ukraine. This is also evidenced by the fact that the Russian Federation has concluded a new agreement with Abkhazia, which may lead to the direct annexation of certain parts of Georgian territory and their integration into the territory of the Russian Federation.  In the Tex negotiations, we have not neglected to point out that georgia's new regime, even though elected democratically after many decades, criminalizes members of the former political class.

It's also something that's fundamental. It is not against anyone, it does not mean any contradiction with what are the legitimate interests of any country, and in this case – let us say it by name – of a great country, which is Russia, which has to be more than just a great neighbor: it has to be a great friend too, a great friend of Europe.

Everyone's choices represent a sip of water poured or removed inside the glass. In theory, whoever gets to fill it with the last sip without dropping a single drop of water wins. If someone makes a risky move, the glass overflows and floods the table, but not with water, with blood. What is Europe doing around this table today? I'm afraid he's pouring water copiously, with a carefreeness and superficiality that make me shiver. I would like to clear up any misunderstanding: we in the Five Star Movement are in favour of a European perspective for each country that meets the Copenhagen criteria, provided that this is also the unequivocal will of their partners and our peoples. This also applies, of course, to Moldova, Ukraine and our friends in Georgia. We are not asking ourselves whether but how and when: we have enormous doubts about them, and that is why we will not vote in favour but will abstain. Both the Eu ropean Union and Russia are getting closer and closer to the red line. NATO shows its muscles in the Baltic in Poland with nine intervention forces and the Russians, who obviously have very heavy responsibilities, respond blow by blow, relaunching. The chasm is getting closer and closer, seemingly for no reason. Are we really sure? In a statement on November 14, 2013, Victoria Nuland, deputy US Secretary of State, openly mentions a link between the Eastern Partnership and TTIP, a treaty that has huge risks and dubious benefits for us. A treaty that is more devoted to the exclusion of those outside than to the inclusion of those inside. And it is no coincidence that TTIP has been called the \"NATO of the economy\": the continuation or rather the anticipation of a hypothetical conflict by other means, paraphrasing von Clausewitz. So what are we voting on today? Are we voting for our safety and well-being in Georgia, or will many of us on the other side of the Atlantic be thinking exclusively of millions of new consumers for our markets, whatever the cost? To accept a terrible risk to the lives of millions of people, in order to increase the turnover of the large defence multinationals? The enemy's rhetoric may be convenient at times, but we are by no means Putin's supporters of Russia, quite the contrary. But we are also realistic and we are indignant when principles are only remembered when it suits us. The sanctions imposed so far are damaging all the parties involved, but strangely little for the United States. We must not follow President Obama's line calling for further reinforcement. Twenty-five years ago, the Berlin Wall collapsed and nato's original assumptions were being thosed; now the European Union and the United States are evolving another one further east.

Its record, both in terms of enlargement and association agreements, can be summed up in two points. First, it is about the impoverishment of the European Union. No country that has joined the EU since 2004 had a GDP per capita above the EU average of 28 in 2014. The transition in 2007 from EU 15 to the EU 28 represents a relative loss of 12 percentage points of GDP per capita, which means that a US citizen now has one and a half times more purchasing power than a citizen of the European Union. It is therefore clear that your desire to association with Georgia, as with Ukraine or Moldova, will only exacerbate the impoverishment of the European Union.  Secondly, this is your record in terms of widening the divide between the European Union and Russia. We live alongside Russia, which has its own interests and sphere of influence. The strategic aggression against this neighbour that is THE continued expansion of NATO is a mistake we are paying for today.

Apparently, you like this kind of Soviet authority, under which we decide for others.

In a society which overwhelmingly supports integration of the country into western institutions, including the EU, it must be the duty of the main political forces to work in the spirit of consensus for implementation of reforms which stem from the Association Agreement.

The agreement anchors Georgia's european course when it comes to shared values. A multiform political system, responsible governance, independent justice and protection of fundamental rights. There is a government that is willing to work hard for a prosperous future. The task of them is therefore to combat polarisation. Civil society also plays an important role in this, in a supportive sense, but also as a watchdog on the necessary reforms.

Unfortunately, all these three countries are in the context of frozen conflicts, conflicts of this wider or close neighbourhood of Russia, where it seeks to position its influence strongly towards the freely decided orientation of these countries to join the European Union.

The situation of minorities in Georgia can be a key issue for the future of the country. Although there have been positives about laws affecting minorities since Georgia became independent, even today the relationship between the majority and the minority is characterised more by mistrust and inconsistent minority policy. This can also be decisive for Georgia's territorial unity, but the need for reconciliation also manifests itself from time to time.

I would like to express my personal satisfaction and that of the Presidency for the active participation of the European Union and its Member States, which has been crucial in ensuring its success. We all agree that cooperation with the countries of origin and transit of migrants, in a spirit of dialogue, partnership and shared responsibility, is essential for the effective management of migratory flows. The Khartoum Process, set up by the Ministerial Conference in Rome, is a particularly valuable framework within which we can discuss immigration and related issues with various important partners in East Africa. After a series of unsuccessful attempts, this is the first time that the European Union and its Member States have been able to start cooperation on immigration in this way. This also means that we would be able to have a regular dialogue with the countries of the Horn of Africa and East Africa, regions of origin and transit of significant migratory flows to the European Union. The significant increase in migrant arrivals from the central Mediterranean area is largely related to the pressure that originates in those regions or stems from existing routes in the region used for transit purposes. At this early stage, cooperation will focus on the fight against trafficking in human beings and trafficking in migrants. The declaration adopted by the Ministerial Conference identifies a number of concrete operational measures to be implemented and we are all aware of the need to take urgent measures to prosecute smugglers and traffickers and dismantle their criminal networks. They constitute a serious threat to the lives of the migrants themselves. In the medium term, as clearly underlined in the declaration, the aim is to broaden the framework and achieve a dialogue that includes all four areas covered by the global approach to migration and mobility: legal migration and mobility, irregular migration, migration development and international protection. I would like to take this opportunity to emphasise that the Declaration recognises the promotion and respect of human rights as a cross-cutting issue in our cooperation. It also expressly recognises the need to respect and fully implement the principles of international protection with a clear reference to the 1951 Geneva Convention. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have established a new framework for cooperation for the Khartoum process, and I believe that this is a good start. Now, starting from this base, it's time to move on to a more active phase. My call on the European Union and its Member States to contribute actively to the development and implementation of this new process.

I hope that the travelling will end early tonight, Mr President, as we are all exhausted, but this issue is of great importance, it is true. This House has witnessed many debates on the need to save lives along the perilous migration route to Europe. It is also in this House that I have heard repeated calls to the Commission and the Member States to make practical responses to the critical reality of migrant smuggling and human trafficking from the Horn of Africa. To achieve these objectives we needed a framework for dialogue and for implementing concrete action together with the countries in that region.  This is what the Horn of Africa Migration Initiative is – a political process on migration with the countries of the Horn of Africa, along with the main Mediterranean transit countries, covering countries of origin, transit and destination along the migratory route from the Horn of Africa to Europe. More specifically, it should bring together Djibouti, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan and Sudan as well as Libya and Tunisia. Beyond political declarations, we will assist partner countries in providing better responses to migrants in vulnerable situations, enhancing the ability of the law enforcement and judicial authorities in the European Union and African partner countries to fight traffickers and smugglers in a more effective way.  We must not forget that migration flows do not only bring challenges, but also bring opportunities both for countries of origin and for countries of destination. This is why I strongly believe that our cooperation with the partner countries in this process should not stop at fighting irregular migration. We must set out high ambitions and look together at the root causes of the migratory phenomenon. You, the honourable Members of this Parliament, have called several times for effective cooperation with third countries, both of origin and transit, for this very purpose. The Horn of Africa Migration Initiative is one of the responses to these calls. In line with the declaration on migration mobility adopted by the Heads of State and Governments at their fourth EU-Africa Summit, we must look at expanding our dialogue to include development and legal migration opportunities, as well as catering for effective international protection of those in need. The Horn of Africa Migration Initiative can also help us to better understand each other and to identify the common challenges we face across our continents and look for solutions in a spirit of shared responsibility. I know that many in this House will have questions about how the human rights they mention are integrated in this process, especially with countries where democratic values are not respected. I can reassure you that promotion of human rights remains an absolute priority for our migration policy and its external dimension, and this is fully reflected in this framework of dialogue.  On that basis, we can continue developing this process and ensure that it stays continuously adapted to our political objectives – objectives that are shared, fully accepted and voluntary. I look forward to the swift launch of practical action and projects to put this dialogue into practice and to achieving tangible results soon.  Concerning the two main themes, we would firstly, on the issue of stranded migrants, mainly aim at developing regional frameworks and national strategies for voluntary returns and the reintegration of migrants. I am glad to announce that for this purpose initial funding of EUR 5 million has already been identified from the European Union development cooperation instrument.  Secondly, on the issue of the development of national and regional strategies to fight organised crime, in particular smuggling and trafficking in human beings, we have set aside EUR 750 000 from the International Security Fund to finance this action. The individual projects are currently being developed by the Commission, and their implementation will start next year. We will encourage our African partners to consider these proposals and to engage in putting them into practice. Member States have expressed their interest in taking the lead in implementing initiatives in relation to these two areas. The peer-to-peer exchanges that these activities will foster are essential for strengthening ties and identifying durable solutions. To conclude, improving the current dramatic situation lies in our hands. I strongly believe that establishing a sustainable dialogue and implementing it through concrete cooperation on the ground is part of the solution. We must act now and we must act together. Only by joining forces as a European Union can we, the Commission, the European External Action Service and the EU Member States, seize this unique opportunity. The Commission is counting on Parliament’s political support for this process.

We sat here at the table to talk about 'how do you keep your migrants at home?' with regimes that kill people! Because that's what it comes down to.

During their journey, their hopes for personal safety and for a better future are often destroyed by organised criminal gangs of smugglers and traffickers, by lack of food and water and by unsafe transportation while travelling. Once here in Europe they are often welcomed with racism, exploitation and exclusion.  However, if we step up efforts, our policies will change the lives of millions of people. Our decisions will improve the well-being and the living conditions of immigrants. To do this we must first make sure that our development policies address the root causes of immigration. If we support governments, civil organisations and individual citizens in developing countries to implement good governance and to create a more prosperous society that gives a chance to its citizens, then migration finally becomes a free personal choice.  Secondly, we must remember the benefits that well-protected and integrated migrants have for development, in fuelling growth, innovation and entrepreneurship both in the countries that the people come from and in those they move to. Well-managed migration can reduce poverty in the countries of origin by remittance transfers. Job opportunities can motivate young people to acquire appropriate skills. There will be a rise in the exchange of goods, capital and knowledge. We are all aware of the fact that migration will only rise in the future, but if we can make it clear in our own minds and to the general public that there is an undeniable positive interconnection between migration and development, then migration will cease to be another world problem and will start being part of the solution.

I do not deny at all - I hear quite what is being said on all these benches - the contacts that can be had with certain governments and I think that, in these cases, it is better to have contacts with the opposition, NGOs or civil society.

This requires stopping the sending of EU-subsidised products, which compete with farmers, and working for the self-sufficiency of a number of countries. We are talking about substantive reforms. We must also be able in Europe to cooperate, with Africa, in the fight against all human trafficking and we must also reform and harmonize our right to asylum.

The strategy that we would like to adopt to control migratory flows from East Africa seems to be lacking in the protection of human rights. On the one hand, it declares its desire to combat the activity of criminal networks that profit from migrants and trafficking in human beings; on the other hand, repressive, bloodthirsty and liberticidal regimes are involved, which are the main cause of migratory flows. We need only think of the case of Eritrea, a de facto military dictatorship, with thousands of political opponents imprisoned or the case of Sudan, where genocide and crimes against humanity have been committed for decades. Other governments, such as the Egyptian government, Egypt and Somalia, have also shown that they do not shine for respect for human rights. Eritrea and Libya have never ratified the 1951 Geneva Convention on the Status of Refugees, despite the fact that it has stated that it wishes to promote cooperation in the field of asylum and international protection on the basis of the principles of international law, referring to the Convention itself. Libya, one of the countries where thousands of migrants are concentrated trying to reach Europe, did not even attend the meeting in Rome on 28 November. On that occasion, the joint declaration of the Khartoum Process was signed, with a view to establishing reception centres outside Europe' s borders. The cases of asylum seekers should be examined here with a view to subsequent resettlement in Europe. More than fighting the causes of immigration, it seems that the goal is to find agreements on how to fight migrants before they arrive in Europe, risking repeating the experience of the Libyan-Italian agreement between Gaddafi and Berlusconi. There is a fear that reception centres, if set up in countries where there is a serious democratic and civil emergency, in the absence of adequate controls, may become ghettos and refugee camps where the protection of human rights cannot be guaranteed.

Most of the migrants lost their lives drowning, starving and freezing, and were from Africa and the Middle East.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I firmly believe that it is essential to establish a continuous and balanced dialogue with the countries of the Horn of Africa. The question is not whether or not we should cooperate with these countries, but how we can do so in order to prevent migrants from falling victim to the networks that facilitate their smuggled entry into Europe by sea. The Khartoum process is only one part of a comprehensive strategy. I share your concerns about the objectives of this initiative. Nevertheless, I want to make it clear that our policy does not legalize regimes in the region: the aim is to engage states and hold them accountable for saving lives and combating those responsible for human trafficking. They must keep their word and their commitments. I assure you that we will be following this process closely. On the other hand, one of my priorities is to strengthen the links between the internal and external policies of the European Union, in order to deal, in a coherent and comprehensive way, with the migratory pressures we are facing. I want to expand on this point in the European agenda on migration which was launched yesterday as part of the Commission's work programme for 2015. There is also no doubt that we must offer safer solutions to those who need international protection to reach Europe. The Commission is currently exploring all possibilities, including the development of a common approach to issuing visas on a humanitarian basis so that refugees can come to Europe and apply for asylum. At the moment, the relocation of refugees is the main route to legally enter Europe. This is an act of solidarity that the Commission encourages because for every refugee welcomed into Europe, it is a life saved. I am pleased that the total number of places offered by the Member States has increased this year. Regional development and protection programmes are the other instrument at our disposal. In this context, the European Union is supporting African countries to welcome refugees in the best possible conditions.

I wanted to pick up on a subject that has been raised in several speeches, which is the objectives and risks in the field of human rights. The Khartoum process is intended, yes, to develop technical cooperation with the authorities of the Countries of East Africa and the Horn of Africa and, as the Commissioner said, it is certainly not and certainly wants to be an endorsement of the regimes of those countries, but technical cooperation, focusing at this stage on two issues: trafficking in human beings and trafficking in migrants. There is no doubt that we must make all the necessary efforts to try to save the lives of migrants who face dangerous journeys to cross the Mediterranean. In order to achieve this, our priority should be to take action to prevent and stop the horrific crime of trafficking in human beings and to combat the trafficking of migrants. That is the objective. In the development and implementation of this cooperation, which could be extended to other areas, in line with the global approach to migration and mobility, the European Union will be consistent with the fundamental principle of full respect for migrants' rights, which is at the heart of the European Union's migration policy. I believe that facilitating contacts with the authorities of a number of countries with which the European Union and the Member States had not so far been able to enter into a dialogue could have a positive impact on raising these countries' awareness of the promotion and respect of human rights. Another point to stress is that the declaration repeatedly and unequivocally reiterates the need for full respect for the principles of international protection. It stresses the importance of offering protection to refugees, asylum seekers and assistance to migrants in vulnerable situations. It also stresses the need to ensure effective protection for refugees, asylum seekers and internally displaced persons and to provide for due access to asylum procedures, in line with international law. I have heard the expression of many concerns, to which the Presidency is far from insensitive, but I repeat what the objective is and I repeat that in this objective the protection of the human rights of migrants is central. The Presidency believes that this is a good initiative which must be followed up and, in doing so, of course, the principles laid down in the Rome Declaration must be fully respected. For the success of the initiative and also to avoid the risks that have been feared, I believe that it is essential to support the institutions of the European Union, as well as the active participation of the Member States, and I would like to stress that this Parliament has an important role to play and I would like to assure you that you will be kept informed of developments in the process.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "NI", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2310, "date": "2014-12-17.json", "name": "Ryszard CZARNECKI", "mepid": "28372", "text": "   I close the debate.", "language": "en", "original_language": "id", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ECR", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}]
