I have been working on this mandatory regulation for more than three years. As rapporteur, I have had the same intention from the outset: to provide Europol with a Regulation which had the necessary tools to effectively fulfil its tasks and objectives.  The main objective of the European Union Agency for Police Cooperation is to support and strengthen the action of the competent authorities of the Member States and their mutual cooperation in the prevention and combating of terror, serious crime and thirty other offences, such as drug trafficking, trafficking in human beings, illicit trafficking of organs , kidnapping, illegal detention, hostage-taking, racism and xenophobia, blackmail, counterfeiting of currency and means of payment, computer crime, illicit trafficking in weapons, ammunition and explosives, sexual abuse and others, as well as up to thirty. During the first reading we managed to avoid the merger between Europol and Cepol, which was backed by this House by 610 votes in favour. This result was also achieved through the good collaboration and work of the shadow rapporteurs, whom I pay tribute to with gratitude. In the process of second reading, the degree of cooperation and consensus of my colleagues has again been remarkable. I would therefore like to reiterate my gratitude for all the effort you have made during these three long years of negotiations. I held a total of ten tripartite dialogues: three under the Italian Presidency, three under the Latvian Presidency and four under the Luxembourg Presidency, with whom I reached a good agreement on 27 November; I also want to thank all of them. I would also like to highlight and thank Victoria Amici, the Commission representative, for her high professionalism.  From the result achieved at this second reading I would like to point out: Europol plays a key role in the fight against the terrible scourge of jihadist terror. The Regulation will therefore provide it with better capabilities and instruments in this area. Highlights have been the creation in January of the ECTC ( European Counter-Terrorism Centre – a unit that combines resources of information, intelligence and support to deal with terror. In addition, it will provide legal basis to the IRU (Internet Content Notification Unit). It is a fundamental tool for combating terrorist propaganda and online extremist activities. This unit within Europol will identify extremist online content and contact internet service providers to get them removed as quickly as possible — deleted, I mean the content, of course.  The Agency, in order to attack all forms of crime for which it is competent, collects, preserves, processes, analyses and exchanges information, including criminal intelligence. It also develops threat assessments, strategic analysis and operational analysis; all this always under the support of the police agency, i.e. national units and liaison officers, which are the link between Europol and the competent authorities of the Member States. For example, it will be national units that are necessarily notified without delay of any information and connections between criminal acts affecting them. In addition, Europol has the possibility to coordinate the organising and conduct of operational investigations and actions to support and strengthen , two key words , the actions of the Member States. For the first time, Europol will be able to process data from private entities, always under a high degree of privacy, but which will allow Europol to better combat crimes as terrible as child abuse. All this always under a robust data protection architecture, among other things thanks to the role of the European Data Protection Supervisor, who, as an independent body, will always cooperate with national data protection authorities. In addition, there will be special treatment for sensitive data, all always following the premises of the data protection package, approved at the last plenary session.  Under this new mandate, the governance of the Agency will be improved, increasing its effectiveness, in particular as regards the Governing Body and the Director of Europol. And this Regulation will set a precedent for the other agencies with regard to parliamentary scroverny. Article 88 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union clearly calls for Europol's activities to be controlled by Parliament, together with national parliaments. That is why we have set up a joint parliamentary control group. Finally, I would like to stress that prevention against organized crime is the best operational cooperation between existing agencies. Europol will therefore allow Eurojust access and consultation of its data.  It has been a long legislative path, but the result has been satisfactory and will allow Europol to continue working twenty-four hours a day, every day of the week.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2, "date": "2016-05-11.json", "name": "Dimitris Avramopoulos", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, let me start by expressing my thanks to the rapporteur Mr Díaz de Mera García Consuegra. He and his team have done a great job in adopting this critical piece of legislation, after three years of tireless work, to reach this compromise. I can congratulate him on the result and express my thanks for the excellent cooperation we had.  What makes this regulation critical is that our fight against terrorism is at the very top of the political agenda. 82% of the citizens of Europe tell us in a very recent survey that they want the European Union to intervene more on terrorism than now. Once this regulation is applied in spring 2017, it will give us the right framework for this to happen, first of all, by making Europol an information hub for law enforcement in the Union. Paris and Brussels showed this very clearly. Information exchange is our Achilles heel. Member States have to coordinate more closely and effectively. Complex investigations have to be supported by sound analysis. Europol can have clear added value in this respect. The other major improvement is the democratic scrutiny by this Parliament. Our new rules will ensure this accountability on Europol’s activities, together with national parliaments.  The protection of personal data will also be strengthened. I consider, therefore, the outcome of our work on this file to be positive. Europol’s legal basis has been aligned to the Treaty of Lisbon, and the objectives of the Europol reform – to make Europol more accountable, effective and efficient – have been fully achieved. Nonetheless, I would like to refer you to the two declarations that the Commission made in Council already, which I would like to highlight today as well. The first concerns the governance of Europol. We remain convinced of the benefits of establishing an Executive Board as part of the governance structure of Europol and other agencies. We will keep following the situation on the governance of Europol, and within the next two years we will examine whether further proposals on this point are necessary. The second concerns the need to ensure coherence between the Europol Regulation and the Data Protection reform package. In the light of our recent adoption of the new EU data protection rules, and the upcoming review of the data protection rules for EU institutions and agencies, we need to ensure consistency and avoid duplication. It should be clear, therefore, that functions exercised by the Cooperation Board set up in this regulation, will in the future be exercised by the newly created European Data Protection Board.

There are several reasons for this: among other things, that we have invested too little in defence and security. We have fallen into a security vacuum, and today we face security threats. This has been met by aggressive Russian policy, this has been perceived by terrorist networks, everyone competing with the European Union in a global market where the position of the European Union, the largest economic power in the world, is inadequate.  In the current sensitive security situation, it is of the utmost importance that, after three years of negotiations, the European Parliament and the Council have finally reached an agreement on the European Police Office. I am pleased that we will be voting today on a new regulation that will give Europol more powers in the fight against terrorism, cyber and organised crime and other serious criminal phenomena. It will have the opportunity to create specialised rapid intervention units. The exchange of information between Member States and Europol will also be better.  I am also proud of my political group, which in the negotiations has ensured the inclusion of a legal basis for the full functioning of the Europol unit, including the prevention of terrorist propaganda on the Internet.

Madam President, I would like to thank the president for her Tomorrow is a big day – we will adopt the Europol regulation at second reading. It took us more than three years and more than 80 meetings. It has been a persevering process and Mr De Mera has managed this process with care and collegial control. I would like to thank him very much for this, and also for all the colleagues who have cooperated with him as shadow rapporteur – it was a very good working atmosphere. The regulation adapts the provisions to the Lisbon Treaty. However, it also brings improvements for the security of Europe's citizens. It de-bureaucratises cross-border cooperation and makes it possible to combat organised crime and terrorism more effectively.  This regulation is able to make Europol's structures more efficient and democratic, to strengthen parliamentary control and to have strict data protection rules in place.  It is particularly important that parliamentary control should be carried out jointly with the national parliaments. This is one of the few pieces of legislation that focuses on interinstitutional cooperation with national parliaments. This common supervisory body could and should also be a school in other areas. Interparliamentary cooperation is one of the important pillars of the European project. I also think it is important that we have succeeded – we managed to follow up on this data protection legislation in the last session of this plenary, which adopted the data protection package – and to bring the new provisions into line with these developments. This will strengthen Europol's credibility, and this is a prerequisite for more efficient cooperation, for greater acceptance of the authority and also for the willingness to increase the exchange of data.  The merger of CEPOL and Europol was also an important issue. We decided to fend off this because we wanted to strengthen the focus of the individual institutions. We have also taken this pragmatic approach in other areas, such as the Internet Observatory, where I still believe that a separate piece of legislation would have been better. But time has been running out, so it made sense to go down this path. I believe that we will adopt a good regulation. It will improve Europol's work in the interests of our citizens and is also a good basis for further integration in police cooperation, which are, of course, necessary.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 5, "date": "2016-05-11.json", "name": "Timothy KIRKHOPE", "mepid": "4542", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Group. – Madam President, Europol needs new tools to face new challenges. Today, after a long period of negotiation, we are finally providing ourselves a renewed mandate to tackle the huge security challenges we all face. Under the excellent leadership of Rob Wainwright, Europol has become a critical hub for cooperation, operational support and intelligence exchange throughout the EU. This regulation gives Europol the legal tools needed to respond more swiftly to threats and it gives our constituents and our Member States confidence that Europol is conforming to extremely high standards of data protection and transparency. It allows MEPs and national parliaments to keep watch over their actions to ensure accountability, something which can only strengthen trust in our law enforcement cooperation across the Union. More importantly, this regulation gives a solid basis for the work of Europol’s Internet Referral Unit to be stepped up. With terrorist organisations increasingly using social media as a recruitment tool, and thousands of Twitter and Facebook accounts being created for recruitment purposes, we need to work together to take down this material as soon as it is posted.  Through this regulation, Europol can work directly with social media providers – providers who have frankly too often washed their hands of responsibility for the propaganda posted on their platforms. Europol is not a European FBI, and it does not need to be. It should continue to operate as a hub for information exchange and for cooperation and coordination amongst all of those in law enforcement. Our fight against terrorism and serious crime is one where we are too often several steps behind our enemy. This regulation is an important step in closing that gap. Europol has made Europe and the UK a safer place for nearly 20 years, and, Mr Díaz de Mera García Consuegra, I congratulate you on your hard work and your persistence in making sure we get a quality regulation which will aid Europol in its continued fight against human trafficking, child exploitation, terrorism and, of course, smuggling.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ECR", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 6, "date": "2016-05-11.json", "name": "Morten PETERSEN", "mepid": "124872", "text": "  for the ALDE Group. Madam President! Let me begin by thanking Mr Böge. I would like to take the necessary information, i.m. to Mr Díaz de Mera, the rest of the rapporteurs and the European institutions for the hard work. It has been a lengthy process and I am convinced that from next year Europol will be much better equipped to support Member States in the fight against serious, cross-border crime and terrorism. As ALDE's rapporteur, I personally would have liked Europol to have been strengthened even further so that Europol could ask the Member States to launch investigations and at least to justify its refusal. I would also have liked the sharing of information between Member States to be made compulsory in order to prevent some Member States from having to hold knowledge that other Member States could use.  This is happening right now on a voluntary basis, and that is not enough. The transnational nature of the Paris and Brussels attacks underlines that information sharing and police cooperation are essential to counter the terrorist threat. Unfortunately, there are far too many examples of the exact opposite. Let me just say a simple: the terrorists from the Paris attack in November travelled by car from Belgium to France, were stopped at the border, but they were released again because the French authorities did not have access to image identification. Unfortunately, there are several examples of both lack of information and lack of coordination.  Going forward, it is therefore essential that we become better at sharing information between Member States. This is the prerequisite for us to be able to prevent new tragic events together. To the Member States, I would say: 'Do not wait for the next tragedy to take place before you step up your joint efforts with Europol!' I say 'yours' and I say it with envy because Denmark, my home country, stands to have to leave Europol because the people voted 'no' to Europol in a referendum last year. The coming months will show whether it is possible to negotiate an agreement on Europol in time. It is, of course, my hope that Denmark can become a full member of Europol. However, in my book, incomplete parallel agreements are not the optimal solution, either for Denmark or for Europe. I congratulate everyone on the new stronger Europol.

That was our ambition. The question is: has Europol lived up to this? We believe that there are undoubtedly some improvements, but overall we are not satisfied.

And in addition, they want to cooperate with third parties, with private actors, and ultimately decide on this exchange of data, what is good and what is evil on the Internet. We reject that.

The most recent terrorist attacks have increased the need for a stronger European police agency, with greater capacity to facilitate cross-border cooperation and the exchange of information between Member States. In this context, Europol needed to be adequately equipped to support Member States in the prevention, analysis and investigation of crimes throughout the Union. However, the more powerful Europol is, the greater parliamentary control of its activities and the greater the legal guarantees must also be to avoid illegitimate mass surveillance of citizens or indiscriminate exchange and analysis of personal data, which could be disproportionate, unnecessary and contrary to the fundamental rights of those to whom it should serve. Europol operates within the European Union. However, organized crime does not stop at our borders. Better cooperation with third States and international organizations is therefore also needed. The Regulation we are debating today has aimed at strengthening Europol and avoiding certain risks of police meddling in our lives. I should also mention that there are issues in the text that still displease my group. For example, to quote only two: the fact that the Executive Director of Europol does not respond directly to the European Parliament in the exercise of his duties, but to the Council; or how the legal basis has been introduced so that the IRU (Internet Referral Unit) can continue to perform functions that it already began to develop on July 1, 2015.

However, I would like to thank Mr Díaz de Mera for his efforts to improve various aspects of the text. My group will obviously vote in favour of the amendment we have tabled, but it also supports the text as a whole, and it does so because it is now a necessary and unass alternative instrument in view to achieve better and more effective cross-border cooperation between European Union law enforcement agencies and to improve the exchange of information with third countries in the fight against transnational crimes.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 9, "date": "2016-05-11.json", "name": "Petr MACH", "mepid": "84175", "text": "  on the efdd group. – Ladies and gentlemen, when we vote on this proposal, you will find one single motion to vote, and that is my proposal to reject this standard, made on behalf of the Europe of Freedom and Direct Democracy faction. We do not have the opportunity to table amendments to the text at all and I think this is a denial of the principle of parliamentary democracy. Originally, a few years ago, the European Commission put forward a completely different proposal. It was at the heart of the merger of Europol and the European Police College (CEPOL). This has completely fallen out of the way and, outside this Parliament, Europol has been transformed into a completely new organisation. The intergovernmental service organisation of police forces has become a police agency, essentially a secret police, subordinate to the European Commission, subordinate to the Council. By its decision, the Commission will be able to transmit data collected by Europol to other international organisations. At the last meeting, you agreed that private companies, airlines, would have to automatically transfer data, account numbers, addresses and people's names.

It intervenes in the Member States by setting up national liaison centres with Europol. It has the right to require them to prosecute a wide range of offences. Under the convenient pretext of combating terrorism, it becomes a centre for a huge amount of personal data, even for the social interactions of everyone, a hub for the exchange of this information with security authorities and secret services of the Member States and third countries, in particular the United States, even with individuals such as, for example, by monitoring the Internet in liaison with business groups in the sector.

It is important that changes do not remain on paper and effectively represent a change of mentalities and practices.  As the terrorist attacks in Paris and Brussels have tragically exposed, one of our biggest challenges is the lack of coordination between police and security agencies at national and European level, which takes advantage of increasingly transnational organised crime, including terrorism. This Regulation requires the strengthening of democratic control to be exercised by the European Parliament in association with national parliaments. It is therefore our responsibility to require our governments to share information through Europol and to cooperate with Europol. There can be no greater consideration than the security of our citizens and, in this sense, it was also important that Parliament was able to impose in this regulation respect for the principles of the protection of personal data, which is essential to facilitate the interoperability of police databases as well and to strengthen the internet reference unit. This regulation is the recognition of Europol as essential in the fight against terrorism and other organised crime, as recently illustrated in the dismantling, in collaboration with the Portuguese police, of a mafia network of Russian origin, which laundered capital through the control of football clubs in Portugal.  But this cannot hold states accountable for doing what they have to do at national and European level against organised crime and terrorism at the police, judicial, legislative level, cooperation between intelligence services and the articulation of internal and external security strategies and policies.

It is also an important step that it contains clear data protection rules, that we also bring them into line with the data protection package that we have adopted.

Madam President, one of the side effects of globalisation is the increase in threats against the countries of Europe and their qualitative upgrading. These threats relate mainly to terrorism, cyber attacks and organised crime. The peoples of Europe feel insecure and the security of their personal data is being undermined. The European Police Office, Europol, is the body that is called upon to deal with these threats in cooperation with the police and judicial authorities of other countries. In order to be able to carry out this task successfully, it must exchange information with these services and with services from third countries, and at this point we must pay particular attention.

Many of us pointed out that stronger European cooperation and coordination in this area are essential, and with this a stronger and better—managed Europol.

Europol will have more access to the relevant data, which in consequence will be processed more efficiently. There will be the data from Member States, but also from non-public parties, which is important for effective prevention and investigation.  The new Internet Referral Unit (IRU) will play an important role in combating terrorist propaganda, radicalisation online and organisation of crime groups. The recognition made by IRU and the new model of cooperation with internet providers, will allow to leave out the violent content or start early—warning investigations. On the other hand, we have strengthened the data protection rules that apply to Europol so that we can keep the balance and built trust. We have strengthened the possibilities of Europol cooperation with other European agencies also, for better synergy and efficiency.

The reform will improve the exchange of data between them. In addition, modern administrative structures ensure greater efficiency. In the future, Europol will also be able to respond more quickly to threats, in particular through the creation of special forces. It is equally important for the reform that we have adopted high common standards for data protection across the EU, for businesses, but also for law enforcement. And these standards will now also apply in principle to Europol. The call for hatred and violence on the Internet can lead to crimes in the real world. It is therefore necessary for obviously illegal content that is publicly available to disappear quickly from the Internet. The Internet Reporting Centre created for this purpose now has a solid legal basis. In addition to effective action, robust data protection rules are important in exchanges between Europol and Facebook and Co., and that is precisely what is ensured.

Updating the regulatory framework governing Europol's activities is, in fact, an indispensable measure to increase the efficiency of cooperation between the authorities involved in combating crime, and therefore for a safer Europe. In recent years Europol has made an effective contribution to the fight against the most serious cross-border crimes, providing national authorities with intelligence analysis and logistical support in carrying out joint operations. And today it is all the more necessary to approve the reform of Europol, given that the new security threats in Europe urgently need a common response. In the light of the tragic events in Paris and Brussels, there is an increasing need to strengthen police cooperation instruments in the European Union. Europol will now have a new legal basis specifying its powers and extending its powers, while respecting data protection rules and fundamental rights. In this respect, the decision to introduce a mechanism for monitoring Europol's activities by the European Parliament together with the national parliaments is to be welcomed. It should also be emphasised that the new regulation will ensure a robust data protection regime, in line with existing instruments at European level, including through the provision of a personal data protection authority at Europol and the involvement of data protection guarantors at European and national level.

It is an essential aspect that a police force can itself be, shall we say, scrutinised and scrutinised by the European Parliament.  On the other hand, too, the set of guarantees given in the case of data protection. Effectively combating crime today, in many cases, today, the collection of data, coordination and exchange of information, of a lot of information, which is sensitive, and therefore the data protection regime must be properly taken care of.  I would like to make a point here: many people have said that crime is living without borders today. It is important to understand this: she already lived without borders; those who lived with borders were the Member States.

The common denominator of almost all here is that we must respond to the need of our citizens for more safety and this is what we are trying to do through this reform, because we all know that terrorism and serious transnational crime – as you mentioned, and of course I endorse this point of view – does not acknowledge borders. Our law enforcement authorities are responsible for the security of our citizens. To effectively track the perpetrators they need a true hub for information exchange, with full operational and analytical support. With the improved framework we are putting in place, Europol will be able to connect the dots and give Member States the support they need to fight terrorism and serious crime. Europol will be able to do this more efficiently and more effectively. It will now be more accountable and will work in full respect of our data protection rules.

It is a question of us having an Agency that is a powerful information exchange centre and that has very developed its analysis capacity to protect Europeans.

I give you a summary: there have been forty-two interventions; based on knowledge of cause; others, in intuitive knowledge. In any case, all of them are worthy of valuation and worthy of respect. Very grateful for the coincidental ones, and regret the disagreeants, but they are in their rightful right.

However, I am critical of the fact that this debate and recommendations are only being taken up now. There is no doubt that we must significantly improve the effectiveness of the fight against terrorism in Europe and respond more quickly to threats. Experience with the fight against terrorists shows that it requires much closer cooperation between countries and a stronger role for Europol. This European office based in The Hague should create and update databases on terrorist threats. EU Member States should be required to provide Europol with data so that they can use the information contained in one integrated database themselves, rather than seeking it in each of the 28 EU countries.

I have had the pleasure of working together with several very competent presidencies also and here a special word of gratitude needs to be expressed to the Luxembourg Presidency for their enormous efforts on this dossier, without which I doubt we would be standing here today.  Competitiveness is all about attracting excellent intellectuals from all over the world to come to the European Union and make their contribution in our different Member States. The excellent researchers, entrepreneurs and students of the world will help us develop the growing competitive business of tomorrow. In doing so, they will be the ones to bring economic growth, employment and social progress to our economies and societies. For far too long, this continent has crippled itself completely unnecessarily, imposing bureaucracy and hindering creative and productive minds that only want to make their contribution to our societies.  Let me give you some concrete examples. When we started working on this directive, my home country, Sweden, had a system where graduate researchers, doctors, engineers and others who had received a PhD from outside Europe were given 14 days to basically leave the country once they had completed their studies or their research projects. Instead of putting to use the knowledge and experience of these people whom we had helped to educate and had invested a lot of money in, we pushed them away and most of them went to other places in the world – to the US, to Canada and to Australia – and made their contributions to society there.  With the directive we are about to vote on tomorrow, all masters students, as well as researchers, will now have the possibility to stay up to nine months in the EU to apply for jobs or start a business after they have concluded their studies or research. The mobility regime for students will be greatly improved by the new directive. Students will be able to move from day one with a simple notification. Before, they needed a full application. As for researchers, mobility is also improved with the extension of short-term mobility up to six months, compared with three months before. The minimum time that students are allowed to work will also be increased from 10 hours to 15 hours a week.  Before the revision of the Directive, the entry into the EU of family members of researchers was previously fully discretional upon Member States and they had absolutely no right to intra-EU mobility and no right to access the labour market. The present proposals constitute a major step forward by ensuring that family members can easily accompany researchers to Europe and they are allowed to work. This is very important for the attractiveness of European universities when they are competing to attract the best minds from all over the world.  Finally, the scope of the directive will be increased. Trainees are now added as a mandatory category and European Voluntary Service volunteers are added as a mandatory category and au pairs as an optional category. It should be noted that this is actually the first time ever that we have granted protection to au pairs through an EU instrument. Before the review, unremunerated trainees were optional, they are now covered. In these days when we talk mostly about migration – internal migration policy – I think it is especially important that we manage to conclude on a major dossier which promotes legal migration to the EU. We need far more of this in the days to come and I hope that we can continue to be ambitious in this regard.

Today I fulfil also my commitment that I gave you during the hearing one and a half year ago. This updated directive makes the EU more attractive for talents from abroad and, therefore, makes the European Union more competitive on the global scale. I would like to express my thanks, in particular, to Ms Wikström and the shadow rapporteurs, who have done a fantastic job. Thanks to your excellent work we have managed to keep a really ambitious text.  Κυρία Wallström ξέρω ότι μιλάτε και ελληνικά και θα ήθελα να σας πω και στην κοινή μας γλώσσα ένα μεγάλο ευχαριστώ! Η συμβολή σας ήταν και είναι καθοριστική. The conclusion of the negotiations is important for several reasons. Firstly, we have clearly improved the immigration rules for students and researchers. Their rights are now more clearly defined. Secondly, intra-EU mobility rules have been improved so that knowledge and skills can circulate more freely within the European Union. Thirdly, students can now work a minimum of 15 instead of 10 hours per week, which means they contribute more to our economy and they can also be financially more independent.  With the new instrument, graduates and researchers have a right to look for a job or to set up a business once they have finished their studies or research. Finally, we now also have binding EU-wide rules for trainees and volunteers within the European Voluntary Service. In parallel, for the first time we will also have common rules for third—country national au pairs, though only optionally.  Let me also underline that the agreement sends out important messages in these challenging times. First of all, we welcome talent from outside of the European Union to come to us to study, carry out research, learn or volunteer. Those who would like to stay longer to work or to create a business are invited to do so. Equally importantly, we show that the EU sticks to its commitments to improve legal migration routes.  Understandably, a lot of focus is now on the refugee crisis and people seeking protection. But migration is not just about asylum. It is also about mobility and empowerment, and facilitating that through legal channels. This is an important part of our overall migration policy and we deliver, as promised.  Overall, could we have done better? Yes, there is almost always room for improvement. The Commission, together with this Parliament, has insisted throughout the negotiations that Member States’ discretionary powers with regard to rejecting an application may only be used when strictly necessary and, of course, justified.  We made it clear in our joint statement to the political compromise that such discretionary power by the Member States should only be used on a case-by-case basis. It should take into account the specific circumstances of the third—country national and the principle of proportionality, and on the basis of evidence or serious and objective reasons. I can reiterate that the Commission will ensure that Member States implement this provision in line with this interpretation when transposing the directive and will inform Parliament and the Council thereof.  Today Europe attracts 45% of international students worldwide but the international higher education landscape is changing rapidly. Such students and researchers are an asset and a contribution and I welcome the agreement on the revised EU rules to facilitate that contribution even more.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 63, "date": "2016-05-11.json", "name": "Anna Maria CORAZZA BILDT", "mepid": "96674", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, the PPE Group also very much welcomes this agreement. Europe needs to be attractive in the global competition for talents. We have a knowledge—based economy and facilitating the entry of researchers, students and unremunerated trainees to bring their skills to Europe is important to sustain European growth, innovation and jobs. We need to train, develop and keep talents in Europe to match the needs of our companies, our academic institutions, our universities and other research institutions.  The PPE goal has been to have a system that strikes the right balance between facilitating access and, at the same time, preventing abuse. I am glad that we have reached our goal. With this directive we move from cumbersome, long, fragmented procedures to common, clear and simple rules across Europe. We are cutting red tape, we are providing legal certainty. One of the main achievements is the intra—EU mobility, the possibility for students and researchers to continue their activities in another Member State without having to leave Europe and reapply again for entry. This will, of course, encourage cross—fertilisation, exchange of knowledge, people—to—people contact and also the possibility to finalise research projects or degrees. Let us be clear. This directive is not about letting more people into Europe. The rules are clear. Member States will continue to decide how many entry permits are granted and they will also have the possibility to do labour market checks when deciding on admission. This is not about students and researchers taking European jobs. On the contrary, it is about them contributing to creating jobs in Europe. So students and researchers will be given the possibility to work, but the rules of the labour market will remain national. Applicants for admission have to clearly show that they are able to support themselves and they are not living on social benefits.

Europe has still not fully recovered from the consequences of the economic crisis and the demographic picture remains unchanged. Due to complex and long bureaucratic processes and modest investments in development, research and education, we are lagging behind the world's most advanced in the acquisition of young talent. We're wasting a lot of potential, and they're going somewhere else.  The revised rules will make it easier for many young people to stay and work in the European Union, give them more rights, allow them to work more and research while studying, and the possibility to stay in Europe for another year after completing their studies. More rights will now be enjoyed by their family members. The fact is that they are more successful in attracting young talent to the rest of the world today, and if we do not change that, we have an uncertain future ahead.  The revised rules, which we will be voting on at noon, and I believe we also get strong support, are the result of long and difficult negotiations, but we have managed a great victory. Through the efforts of socialists and democrats, we have succeeded in ensuring that young foreign students, researchers, practit professionals, volunteers and nannies have simpler and faster procedures for obtaining visas or permits to enter, more social or labour rights and health and legal protection. It has been the case so far because of a lack of legal protection that has often led to exploitation. They will now be included in the legal framework. We must stop the exploitation of foreign young people once and for all, and Europe must set an example.  I am convinced that these new rules will have a positive impact on cultural, scientific and social cross-border ties and people-to-people contacts. Only an innovative and more competitive Europe will create new jobs and make it more attractive to young talent from all over the world.

Mr President, Commissioner, first of all, I take my hat off to the remarkable work that has been done by our colleague, Cecilia Wikstrom. Congratulations, dear colleague.  To live up to its ambitions and destiny, Europe must at least meet three challenges. First, invest heavily in innovation, i.e. intelligence to boost growth and create jobs. Second, maintain and strengthen its social model by guaranteeing equal rights and combating all forms of discrimination. Thirdly, not to fall back on itself but to radiate in the world the original synthesis that it wants to promote between its growth model and its unique social model.  It is in the light of these three requirements that I fully support the proposal before us today. Its aim is, first of all, to facilitate access to European territory for highly qualified people. Tomorrow, thanks to this proposal, a student will be able to come to Europe more easily, he will have more opportunities for work and mobility and the right to stay for twelve months in the Union in order to look for a job. Furthermore, I welcome the more favourable conditions offered to researchers, both in terms of family reunification and mobility, by allowing them to continue their research in other Member States than the one that provided them with their residence permits.  But I also intend to emphasise, with the same vigour, the contribution of this proposal to the development of the European social model. I am pleased that status is finally being offered to au pairs and unpaid trainees, which are fragile if any, and therefore susceptible to exploitation. Europe is thus true to itself, both in its economic ambition and in its social vocation.

Quite often this kind of migration actually does have a positive impact on society, so I am not going to stand here and argue that international students coming to the UK, paying fees to British universities, helping some of the top universities in the world to survive, is in any way a bad thing. In fact, in a lot of ways I would rather have non-EU students than EU students coming to the United Kingdom under the current rules, because we actually get a rather rough deal when the British Government gives EU students loans which are often not repaid.  So what is the problem? Well, although people coming to the UK to study can be a good thing, it is also a decision that we should take as the British people ourselves, based on common sense and thinking about what we need for our colleges and our universities and what is right for the United Kingdom. This EU nonsense, expecting us to extend these changes not just to those who wish to study or do research here but also to their families and also for an additional 18 months after the course of study is completed, is likely to result in something approaching a free—for—all.  At the moment, we in the UK do have an opt—out, so the side in the British referendum campaign which is currently busy claiming that Brexit will lead inexorably to World War III are going to be the ones that will accuse me of scaremongering. But an opt-out is only an opt-out until some bright spark decides that they want us to opt back in. After that, it is too late, because of the ratchet principle of the acquis communautaire in this Union. Maybe you trust David Cameron not to opt back in and maybe you trust Jeremy Corbyn, but watch the Labour Party in today’s vote, because if Labour votes for this today you can bet that any future Labour government would vote to opt us back in. So whenever we have an opt—out, you have to ask yourself: do you trust Cameron, do you trust Corbyn, and do you trust every future British Prime Minister?

Indeed, the agreement reached with the Council makes it possible to clarify and improve the conditions for trainees, volunteers, students and non-European pupils for the benefit of the Union and its Member States, as well as countries of origin. I would like to highlight three things. Firstly, this directive will have to be used by the Member States to achieve the Europe 2020 targets. The entry and stay requirements for students and researchers, in particular, will encourage faster internationalization of our teaching systems. It is about making the Union more attractive, more competitive and achieving a Europe of knowledge and innovation: that is our objective, and we are taking a real step forward today. Another important asset of the text, which can be welcomed, is that it presents measures to ensure better protection for trainees by giving a Member State the opportunity to ensure that the internship does not replace a job. Finally, I call here for this new directive to be taken into account in the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy.  Education, research and the promotion of cultural exchanges remain objectives and ways to build bridges between Europe and its neighbours, especially with the Mediterranean region. This directive makes perfect sense if it is used with our neighbours. It is a mutual investment between us and our neighbours for, in particular, young people, and we know how crucial it is to provide opportunities for young people in certain countries in our neighbourhood.

With today's vote, we are paving the way for a future common migration policy based on channels of regular access to the European Union. Of course, these are still temporary economic migration measures, but a first step has been taken. Thanks to the changes made by this House during the legislative procedure, third-country nationals will have the right to enter, reside and carry out part of their research or studies in one or more Member States. The same right will also be granted to pupils, volunteers and equal workers. We recognise the right of these same persons to treat them in the same way as the Member State concerned. Students and researchers recognise the possibility of staying for a period after the expiry of their studies or research in order to enable them to find a job or start a business.  Demographic challenges and multiple labour shortages, not only highly specialised, require us to review fragmented national policies on economic migration, to focus on general rules on the entry and residence of workers from third countries. Opening up channels for economic migrants would also be the most effective measure to counter the modern slavery that is increasingly taking root in our territories, through the exploitation of labour by migrant workers, especially women.

As the context on migration and mobility evolves, it is understood that so should our rules and policies.  The agreed text is a very important element of our overall migration approach. It sends the important signal that the European Union is a globally competitive and welcoming destination for much—needed students and researchers from abroad. At the same time, it provides for a clear legal framework which does not mix up other categories such as asylum seekers or refugees, and it does not touch on Member States’ competences to grant access to the labour market. This agreement is ambitious and balanced and will allow Europe to attract more talented students and researchers in the future who can contribute to our societies and to our economies. As many of you have insisted on this, I will repeat that the Commission has insisted, together with you, that Member States’ discretionary powers with regard to rejecting an application may only be used when strictly necessary and justified, and we will of course be monitoring this. As I mentioned earlier, let us not forget that migration and mobility are also about empowerment, creativity and socio-economic development. COMMISSION STATEMENT Joint declaration by the European Parliament and the Commission on the grounds for rejection (Article 20) The European Parliament and the Commission understand point (f) of Article 20(2) of this Directive as allowing Member States to reject an application only on a case-by-case basis and taking into account the specific circumstances of the third-country national and the principle of proportionality and on the basis of evidence or serious and objective reasons. The Commission will ensure that Member States implement this provision in line with this interpretation when transposing the Directive, and will inform the Parliament and the Council thereof, in the framework of its obligations under Article 39.  The European Parliament and the Commission consider that the inclusion of this provision in this Directive should not constitute a precedent for future legal migration instruments.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 98, "date": "2016-05-11.json", "name": "Cecilia WIKSTRÖM", "mepid": "96677", "text": "  rapporteur. – Mr President, we live in a globalised world where competitiveness between countries and continents is increasing. It is all about attracting the most skilled people: intellectuals, entrepreneurs and researchers. The EU must invest in intelligence, and this revised directive provides a lot of added value compared to the current directives. By improving the conditions for students and researchers, we are fostering growth and prosperity in the EU, and this is very much needed. When we talk about migration today, we tend to talk about asylum migration, but asylum is just one part of the migration scheme. Legal migration is the second part, and this is one instrument of legal migration that is indeed needed. We need many more in order to strike the right balance between asylum and legal migration. Today’s achievement  strengthens the academic status of European Union universities worldwide, it makes the EU more attractive, and it allows knowledge and excellence to flow more freely.  I am proud today of my team in this House. I am happy that this directive is one instrument that will foster growth and prosperity and give us hope for a better future, where entrepreneurs, innovators and researchers will help us to maintain our welfare all over the EU and also to increase and improve it.

The recent terrorist attacks in Paris and Brussels have shown that there are serious shortcomings in cooperation between Member States and that Europe's security is at stake.

Simplifying and improving their conditions of entry and residence is, at the same time, both a duty and a moral obligation. The EU faces major demographic and economic challenges. Enabling third-country nationals to acquire skills and knowledge during a training period in Europe can therefore help to form a pool of potential workers and encourage the circulation of brains.

The new rules clarify and improve conditions for trainees, volunteers, students and au pairs from outside Europe. Thus, the new rules will allow students and researchers to stay in the EU for nine months after completing their studies or research in order to find a job or to develop a business. Mobility within the EU, from one Member State to another, is also facilitated, and only notification of the State of destination is required without applying for a new visa.

Thus, implementing the Europe 2020 objectives means widening macroeconomic inequalities between Member States and within each of them (think of the gap between Padania and Italy which, due to the crisis and austerity policies, has never been wider). In other words, this paradox applies: the more European funding you use (so you are 'virtuous'), the more you need to increase public spending (co-financing) but, at the same time, cut services due to the constraints of the Stability Pact.

Extensive damage was caused to homes, communities, and businesses.

We need to make sure that people who need protection actually receive it. This is our moral duty as well as our legal responsibility. And we must find ways to help these people without them having to risk their lives on dangerous journeys. We need to take them out of the hands of smugglers by putting in place safe and legal ways to the EU for those in need of protection. Cooperation with third countries, protection in the region and resettlement from there to the EU should become the model for the future. We will come forward in June with proposals on how to work better with third countries as part of our work towards a more sustainable approach to managing migration. Recent experience also shows that we need a better approach to large-scale arrivals of people at our external borders. Those who do not seek protection should be returned. Those who do claim asylum should have their case processed efficiently and get a decent reception.  But we have seen how our existing European asylum rules are not doing that. We all know the weaknesses. In the past year a few Member States came under incredible strain. This results directly from the shortcomings of the Dublin System in its current form. Dublin was simply not designed to deal with situations such as these. It does not deliver effective solutions and it does not ensure solidarity and a sustainable sharing of responsibility. A month ago we presented options for reforming our Common European Asylum System and we heard your reactions as well as those of the Member States in the Council. The simple truth is that, if Member States do not find a common approach to sharing the responsibility in handling the refugee crisis, at the end of the day not a single Member State will be able to handle that responsibility on its own. We either face this challenge together, or we give up on facing it at all, with dire consequences for all and with unacceptable consequences for refugees who flee war and persecution.  If we take leave of our common responsibility, we will take leave of our common values and weaken the very fabric upon which our societies are built. That is why the Commission has presented a proposal that will make it possible for all Member States to take their responsibility. So we propose to introduce a corrective mechanism in our Dublin System. It will be triggered automatically so that, whenever a Member State has to face a disproportionate number of asylum applications, responsibility for new applicants – of all nationalities – will be transferred to other Member States. Once the pressure is relieved, that Member State will again take responsibility for new applicants. Each Member State’s share will be based on clear and simple criteria – population size and GDP. Their resettlement efforts will also be taken into account, in line with our objective to provide safe and legal pathways to Europe. All Member States will be required to contribute and show solidarity. This may, under conditions, also take the form of financial solidarity. If – temporarily – a Member State does not relocate asylum applicants, they will need to support those Member States which do. The new system will also be much more efficient and fairer with shorter processes for assigning responsibility and processing applications. It will discourage abuses, with clear obligations for applicants and safeguards against ‘asylum shopping’. At the same time, we will better protect the rights of those who seek refuge through better safeguards for unaccompanied minors and stronger guarantees that families will be kept together. I trust this House to examine our proposals with the urgency this issue merits.

We know the weak points in our current asylum system, and the smugglers know them, too. To address them, we started last year to strengthen the control at our external borders with our proposal on the European Border and Coast Guard. I am glad that the discussion progresses well, but, as you have indicated in your report on the Holistic Approach to Migration, Europe also needs to set up a robust and effective Common European Asylum System. The reform of the Dublin Regulation, the reinforcement of Eurodac and the transformation of EASO into a true European Agency for Asylum, are the first major steps in this direction. These proposals are all based on the same principles: solidarity, responsibility and pragmatism. We cannot abandon any Member State to face a crisis alone. A country’s place on the map should not decide its share of the work. I am convinced that our proposal to reform the Dublin system strikes the right balance to achieve two objectives. First, our proposal will allow establishing a sustainable and fair system for determining the Member State responsible for asylum seekers. It is based on a European reference system, with an automatically—triggered corrective solidarity mechanism. Once the number of asylum applications in a Member State exceeds 150% of the allocated share based on GDP and population, the corrective mechanism will be automatically triggered. All new admissible applications will then be shared proportionately between the other Member States which are below their share, based on the reference key. The objective is to avoid that a Member State carries a disproportionate burden.  Second, the new Dublin Regulation will better prevent secondary movements within the European Union. The current shifts of responsibility between Member States will no longer be possible. It is important to see the Dublin Regulation as part of a package together with the reform of EASO and of Eurodac. Indeed, the existing European Asylum Support Office (EASO) will be transformed into a fully-fledged Asylum Agency.  The tasks of the Agency will be considerably expanded. One of its other essential tasks will be to ensure greater convergence in the assessment of applications for international protection across the Union. And, as we have proposed for the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, we see the clear need to strengthen its operational role when needed. Therefore, we suggest a reserve of 500 experts from Member States to be available when needed in urgencies, if a Member State is subject to disproportionate pressure and needs support. Finally, the reinforced Eurodac Regulation will continue to support the application of the Dublin system. The new regulation includes the possibility for Member States to store and search data belonging to third country nationals or stateless persons who are irregularly staying in the Union. This will facilitate their identification and therefore the enforcement of return decisions in line with data protection standards. These are only the first proposals for the reform of the Common European Asylum system. We are now working on a second stage of legislative proposals towards achieving more convergence in the asylum procedure and the rights we need to grant to those in need. In addition, we are working towards increasing the legal avenues to Europe, and we will come up soon with a structural resettlement scheme. As President Juncker said in this plenary in April, we want to build a Common European Asylum System that is the best in the world – and I have full confidence that this House will help us to build a fairer, more equitable and more sustainable system that Europe needs and will need in the future.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 893, "date": "2016-05-11.json", "name": "Roberta METSOLA", "mepid": "118859", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioners for their detailed presentations and for their constant leadership in trying to address the crisis in very tough circumstances. Your proposals, Commissioners, contain a number of very good elements and show some clear progress in addressing the issue. Strengthening the Malta—based EASO is essential and I am pleased that the proposals contain concrete measures in this regard which will see staff and resources increased. We need to keep proving to our citizens that there is an understanding among politicians in Brussels that Member States on the front line should not have to face disproportionate pressure on their systems alone. This is crucial, and any change to our systems must have this as its central theme.  The Commission’s idea for a corrective fairness mechanism is a good step in the right direction in addressing this concern and will go some way to pushing forward a sustainable solution to disproportionate pressures faced at the external borders. However, I think that the Commission’s idea for Member States to be able to pay their way out of the mechanism is provocative, and it does show just exactly how far away Member States still are from real sharing of responsibility. I can perhaps sympathise with the thinking behind the idea, but that some countries will be able to exonerate themselves from responsibility by payment is not, in my view, the best road towards effective solidarity. We need to do more to ensure that there is the political will to move forward.  Overhauling Dublin is essential. It is a system that has perpetuated a disproportionate responsibility on some Member States which feel left alone. It has poisoned the debate on migration and has allowed extremist elements to hijack the narrative. It must be changed. Solidarity must be part and parcel of being an EU Member State.

A month ago, this Parliament voted by a large majority for the Kyenge-Metsola report, which called for Dublin to be overcome and for the unfair criterion of the first port state to be overcome and went further, to the point of calling for the centralisation of the examination of asylum applications, which would become European responsibility.  The message from this House was clear: Dublin must be overcome and it is absurd to keep it alive artificially. We were calling for a genuine ambitious and necessary reform, and unfortunately this has not been the case, the principle of the first country of arrival has remained intact and a decision has been taken on an emergency basis. When, for years, 6 out of 28 Member States alone deal with almost 80 % of asylum applications, it may no longer make sense to talk about an emergency, because it has become structural. The 150 % criterion triggering automatic distribution is strictly mathematical and abstract, and does not take into account the resilience of reception systems, some of which are already collapsing. With regard to financial solidarity, the frontline countries have already been financially supported, but this has not been enough. Are we sure that we can monetise the solidarity, rights and duties that also result from our treaties? It is a good thing, however, that the new mechanism applies to all asylum seekers, without creating discrimination on the basis of nationality, and also that we want to strengthen family reunification and protect children more. It is bad, however, that no account is taken of the preferences expressed by the applicants, as this Parliament had already requested. Commissioner, dear Commissioners, we will have a lot of work to do. I hope that together we will find together the bravest spirit of the European immigration agenda, isolating the selfishness of governments and aiming higher.

Because the Dublin system is dead, and now it is to be revived. The so-called corrective or fairness mechanism in the event of exceptional migratory pressure in the Member States does not change this. It is naive at best, because refugee admission is understood as an automated calculation example, as a calculation result, but it probably fits rather on completely different contexts.  For example, on items. items such as potato sacks. You have too many potato sacks somewhere and send them exactly where there aren't that many yet – nutritionally perfectly okay, I very much agree with that. But this principle cannot be applied to refugees, because they are not objects, but human beings. And then there is something else: if, for each refugee who has not been admitted, one can supposedly buy oneself free with EUR 250 000, then I think that is basically a distraction.

How are the principles of solidarity and fair sharing of responsibilities observed between Member States, which are principles enshrined in Article 80? How is the first country of entry protected, which still has the greatest burden in the responsibility and examination of asylum applications and in the management of landings? Why wait for a country to collapse, to be in extreme difficulty, and then trigger the automatic relocation mechanism? If this mechanism then works, because a Member State can decide to wash its hands of it, to pay the fine of EUR 250 000 and therefore not to accept any asylum seekers.  We have long been aware of the failure of this Dublin system. The 5 Star Movement loudly asked for its modification, but intended a strong, effective, true change. A change that unfortunately did not come. The Commission has in fact confined itself to proposing an implementation of the old Dublin system, maintaining the status quo, and so we are essentially continuing to make the same mistakes once again. Relocation on a voluntary basis, as we have seen, has not worked. We have seen that it has not worked and we must acknowledge that the Commission has tried to make an attempt to penalise Those Member States that are opposed to the relocation of migrants. Yet here too, instead of providing for a fine – which then falls on the pockets of the citizens, falls on the taxpayers – we foresee something stronger, something that really can act as a deterrent, we envisage the suspension of the right to vote for those countries that refuse to cooperate, for those countries that violate Article 80 of the Treaty.  We keep repeating it, we repeat it: to foresee once again an implementation of the old system does not work. We need a European management system for asylum applications, on the basis of common criteria that are applied by all Member States. Asylum seekers must be seen as people seeking help, who are asking for solidarity with the whole of the European Union, not with the individual Member State. We must implement a permanent relocation system that is truly compulsory, we must provide for a binding European resettlement programme, the creation of humanitarian corridors, those legal access routes that are still lacking today, which will allow applications for international protection to be submitted to the Embassies of the European Union of third countries, and thus guarantee legal and safe access routes to the European Union.

We know that this system is inefficient, unfair and expensive. The current crisis stigmatizes these dysfunctions and reminds us that it is urgent to rethink it. However, the Commission did not make that choice. I understand why, but I don't share it.  Two expressions come to mind to describe this proposal: tinkering and red rag. Why patching up? The foundations of the Dublin system had to be pushed together, they will be maintained. The Commission adds a touch of solidarity, providing a one-off relocation mechanism in the event of a crisis. However, the basic mechanism - distribution - is the same, and it is flawed.  Of course, the Commission provides for significant financial penalties for recalcitrants, but if this fine is intended as a deterrent, one can legitimately think that this financial solidarity is realistic. Unless the amount of financial penalties also serves as a red rag and proves useful in diverting the spotlight from certain provisions criticised in the new regulation. I am thinking in particular of the quasi-punitive measures envisaged to combat the secondary movements of applicants.  I am also thinking of the primacy of the concepts of 'safe third country' and 'first country of asylum' before any designation of the Member State responsible for the review. The golden rule of the Dublin system of the first country of entry is not only maintained but strengthened. This mechanism will therefore continue to pose a large number of logistical challenges in front-line countries to ensure individual review, redress and a dignified reception of these populations.

The criteria should also include population and the number of refugees received, including children. When so many are coming at the same time the issue remains how to create the political will for Member States to take shared responsibility. I believe more in carrots than sticks and that means: more support for countries facing disproportionate pressure, strengthening Frontex, the Asylum Office, Eurodac and the hot spots. But the EU’s assistance should not be a disincentive for Member States to build reception capacity.  The solidarity pillars should be: resettlement – countries must speed up procedures and increase their quotas; relocation – Member States must take asylum seekers from Italy and Greece, as agreed; and return – we should save all, but we cannot take all in Europe. The EU has to negotiate more readmission agreements and fast adopt the list of safe countries of return, including Turkey. More humanitarian aid to assist refugees in Lebanon and Jordan and the EUR 3 billion for refugees in Turkey are urgent.

It is a realistic set of measures that should have been taken even with the collapse of the Dublin Asylum Regulation. Allow me a few more comments.  Firstly, the fact is that only reforming the asylum system will not put an end to the migrant crisis. The new asylum system is only one of the key parts of an integrated approach to tackling the crisis, and the main pillars are the protection of external borders and the effective and rapid return of migrants to the countries of origin. If these principles had been adhered to since last year, only a third of the newcomers who are here would enter Europe.  Secondly, while the European Commission has maintained the rule of the first country or country of entry in its proposal, it has added a new corrective mechanism for justice to ensure that, if there is a disproportionate number of asylum applications, a Member State on the so-called first front, including my Slovenia, does not be left to its own.

Mr President, first of all we must all admit what all the citizens of the Union are saying, but the political leaders continue to say that they do not understand it. Europe's asylum and immigration policy has failed, because from the outset it has been based on the wrong foundations, on the wrong foundations. Europe does not have the capacity, nor will its peoples, to welcome all those who wish to come here, expecting a better life, taking advantage of the absurd provision of allowances, at a time when our continent is experiencing a very important economic crisis. We are already experiencing the social upheaval that has come from the policies you are implementing and our future holds even greater problems. Especially as you choose to close your eyes to peoples' reactions or, even worse, when you try to describe those who react as 'misanthropes'. If we really want to solve this great problem, first of all we need to redefine who is really entitled to asylum, since we all know that it has been abused by people who have never been in any real danger and, most importantly, western countries must stop constantly interfering in the internal affairs of third states.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, I thank you above all for your speeches. Today's debate has made it clear that the status quo is not an option. It has also shown that there is a wide range of opinions on how to improve the functioning of our common European asylum system. Judging by your interventions, the Commission's proposal seems to me to be balanced. An approach to greater integration of our asylum systems may be desirable.  If you ask me if I'm happy, I'll tell you I'm satisfied. Our proposal today is both balanced and realistic. It is also ambitious because we propose to go beyond the current Dublin Regulation by introducing a fundamental change, an automatic redistribution mechanism. It is realistic because we are proposing the changes needed to create a system that will be sustainable and equitable. Indeed, our reform simplifies the rules for determining the responsible state. The basic principle is that only one Member State will be responsible for the examination of an asylum application. At the same time, we propose an automatic mechanism for distributing new asylum seekers when a Member State is faced with a disproportionate number of asylum applications.  This is a strong expression of the solidarity that must exist between the Member States. This solidarity can take various forms, including financial ones. The important thing is that it speaks out. With the support of the European Funds and the new European Union Asylum Agency, each Member State must develop its capacity to manage a fair number of asylum applications, which can be up to 150% of its reference value. The threshold has been set to allow intervention before a state is facing a crisis. To do this, the possibility of triggering the mechanisms will be examined weekly.  Secondly, let me clarify what we are proposing to adapt the rules that apply to unaccompanied minors to the new logic of the Dublin Regulation. Our proposal specifies that the responsible Member State will be the one where the minor files his first application for international protection. This Member State is not necessarily the first country of entry. In any case, Member States will have to ensure that it is in the best interests of the minor. The new regulations provide safeguards to ensure that this review is carried out.  Finally, we propose stricter rules to deter secondary movements that call into question the functioning of our asylum system. Strengthening EASO's expertise, human and financial resources, and strengthening Eurodac will facilitate the implementation of the Dublin system.  I really want to work closely with you on our proposals without wasting time. Too many parameters depend on it. An effective common European asylum system is the prerequisite for a borderless European area. The experience we had over the past year has made us more determined, not only to manage the migration crisis in the immediate future but to create a functioning and just system for the future.

The main direction of the proposal for a fairer system based on solidarity between Member States, with the redistribution of asylum seekers from the Member State of first entry, if this is disproportionately weighted, to the other Member States is also correct. There are, of course, a number of individual issues which need clarification in the context of the dialogue now under way between the Institutions of the Union. But in addition to managing refugee flows, the European Union needs to take their causes more seriously. Refugeeisation is not a natural phenomenon. It is the result of wars waged by some states in our wider geographical region against ethnic minorities on their territory, such as the war of the semi-authoritarian Erdogan regime against the Kurdish minority, or even the consequence of the action of criminal organisations such as the \"Islamic State\".

An EU citizen may feel that the state spends more on a refugee than on its own citizen. Costing a Member State EUR 250 000 per refugee leads to social tensions, as the value of EU citizens' GDP per capita is far below that in many Member States. The Commission's interpretation of European solidarity is a one-sided approach, and solidarity cannot be enforced with sanctions. Instead, the definition of solidarity already formulated by the BIÜT in 2012 should be enforced.  Therefore, the People's Party's desire to interpret this concept of solidarity more broadly, including efforts to protect the external borders together, is to be welcomed. This proposal shows that if some Member States do not comply with the rules, for example at the external borders, the answer will be to create new rules instead of enforcing existing ones.

Solidarity cannot be enforced by disciplinary measures, it shouldn’t put the validity of subsidiarity principle under doubt. The proposed mechanism will enable a MS to buy itself free from solidarity. I am afraid that instead of contributing to more solidarity this will create more tension and induce new cracks in EU unity. The EC proposal doesn´t address one of the major problems – the massive, organised human trafficking by criminal gangs. According to Europol 90% of asylum seekers in 2015 had used the services of human traffickers, thus creating them a profit between EUR 3-6 billion. This extorted money flows mostly to organised crime and Islamic extremists. EU needs a rapid and comprehensive solution to clamp down on international criminal networks.

I find it particularly comical at present to have the idea of such a common system between the EU and Belarus, Russia, Moldova, Turkey, Kazakhstan and the Caucasus Republics. The European Union's asylum system really needs reform. However, the European Commission's efforts to command participants in asylum procedures in which country specific persons can find asylum and in which they cannot must be refused must be fundamentally rejected. What is also strange is the sudden declaration of \"safe\" by some countries. I consider it an absolutely outrageous attempt to order EU states how many refugees and from which countries they must accept on their territory. Similar efforts by colonial powers in the 20th century led to tragic consequences. And their result in the current implementation may be a threat to EU cohesion. The adoption of such a Regulation may result in the formal fulfilment of the obligation to exote the parties to the asylum procedure in the event of non-compliance with the conditions of residence.

Unfortunately, the proposal is flawed and hasty in many points. Why? Because until there is a common external border guard and the collection camps outside the EU's borders are not operating until there is deportation, this could be the EU's rustiest coffin angle, let alone its saviour.

Without any doubt, it has brought important benefits to European citizens and businesses alike. Yet over the past months, the system has been severely tested by the migration crisis, leading several Member States to reintroduce internal border controls. Now as you all know, the aim is to ensure that any and all remaining obstacles are removed by the end of the year at the latest, for the costs of losing free movement within the Schengen Area would be huge. Now to overcome what emerged originally as a patchwork of unilateral decisions, we are developing a coordinated European approach, within the framework of the Schengen rules of course, and let me also underline that the practice of waving through has now ended.  Clearly, securing the EU’s external borders, ensuring efficient border controls and improving the functioning of the asylum system are prerequisites for restoring normal free movement within the Schengen Area. This is a shared responsibility involving all our institutions as well as the Member States. In other words, proper control at our external borders is our common responsibility, hence the need to reinforce our collective ownership over that common good.  Now, as we all know, last December the Commission presented a proposal for a European border and coast guard. It is imperative that we adopt this proposal as soon as possible so that it becomes operational and it is therefore of great importance to work together in order to start trilogues in June and strike a political agreement soon thereafter. In February, the European Council made itself very clear. Member States must grant access to asylum procedures for all applications made at their borders. At the same time they should refuse entry to third country nationals who do not satisfy the entry conditions of the Schengen border code and who have not submitted an application for asylum despite having had the opportunity to do so. The European Council also underlined the importance of restoring the normal functioning of the Schengen Area in a concerted manner while giving full support to Member States facing difficult circumstances. I am of course referring to Greece, whose external border has been under immense pressure.  Now fortunately this pressure has, since the EU—Turkey statements of 18 March, significantly reduced. However, serious deficiencies in external border control persist today – even if many of them have been, and are being, tackled by Greece. That is why the Commission presented on 4 May a proposal on Article 29 of the Schengen Borders Code, a proposal recommending a coherent EU approach to the reinstatement of internal border controls until the structural deficiencies are remedied, as well as proposing border controls only at the sections of the border where they are necessary and proportionate.  Now in closing, the effective application of all these policies and measures taken together, and the effective application by all of us, should contribute to fully reinstating free movement within the Schengen Area and I sincerely hope that we will succeed before the end of the year.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 978, "date": "2016-05-11.json", "name": "Dimitris Avramopoulos", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, the Schengen Area, as you know, is an area of free movement without internal borders. We have repeatedly said here that it is maybe the most tangible achievement of the European integration. This Commission, from the very beginning, has done everything in its power to make sure that we preserve it in accordance with the steps set out in our Back to Schengen roadmap.  Our objective is to return to a normal functioning of the Schengen Area with no internal border controls as soon as possible and within six months at the latest because the costs of internal border controls are already visible. We see transporters complaining about increasing delays and costs and we see the tourism industry in some Member States suffering and this is only a small part – a fraction – of what would happen if border controls were systematically re—established. But the political cost of non—Schengen would be much greater still. It would be a highly symbolic reversal of a major achievement of European integration. This is why we need to take coordinated action at European level, making use of the tools that the same Schengen Borders Code provides us with so as to allow Member States to do what is necessary in the current circumstances, while preserving Schengen as a whole. This is what our proposal under Article 29 of the Schengen Borders Code is meant to achieve. Let me first acknowledge that Greece has made significant progress in the last few months. However, not all deficiencies identified in the management of external borders control have been remedied. This concerns in particular sea border surveillance, reception capacities and registration on the mainland of migrants who were not registered upon arrival in the islands.  Despite the reduction in the flows due to our cooperation with Turkey, the sustainability of this reduction still has to be confirmed. Moreover, a number of these unregistered migrants remain in Greece or in other countries of the Western Balkans. They may seek to move irregularly to other Member States. In other words, the reasons that led several states to unilaterally introduce temporary border controls still exist. The persistent threat of secondary movements puts at risk the overall functioning of the Schengen Area. Therefore a coherent, coordinated and sustainable common approach to temporary internal border controls, as foreseen in Article 29 of the Schengen Borders Code, is needed at EU level. Article 29 is a tool to safeguard the functioning of the whole Schengen Area and this is the first time that the Commission has made use of it.  As a result, we propose that the Council recommend that Austria, Germany, Sweden, Denmark and Norway maintain their internal border controls at specific border-crossing points for up to six months. Controls will be regularly reviewed by the Schengen states concerned and adjusted to the level of the security threat addressed. The states concerned will also report to the Commission every two months. Let me be clear about two things. Article 29 is not a sanction against a Member State nor a means to expel it from the Schengen Area. I want to be very clear on that. We do not propose the introduction of border controls at Greece’s Schengen border, namely at airports and ports. In addition, we clearly state that the controls introduced should be proportionate and limited to what is strictly necessary to respond to the serious threat and safeguard public policy and internal security. They should impede border crossing for the general public as little as possible.   The Commission will continuously monitor the situation and will report to this Parliament and the Council, after four months, on the possible need to adapt the application of its initial recommendation. The principles of necessity and proportionality are the guiding principles for this and any future decision. Let me therefore reiterate that our proposal is an exceptional – temporary – measure to ultimately allow for the safeguarding and return to a normally functioning Schengen Area as soon as possible. It is expected that, by the end of the six—month period at the latest, the implementation of other tools will allow the lifting of all internal border controls and a return to a normally functioning Schengen. I refer in particular to the European border and coast guard, to the further sustained implementation of the EU—Turkey statement, and the full application of EU asylum rules, as well as the swift agreement by the co-legislators on the recently presented proposals for reforming parts of the Common European Asylum System, in particular the Dublin System.

The fact is that, in light of past developments, COREPER has today adopted the European Commission's proposal for a semi-annual extension of border checks at internal Schengen borders. It is true that in some places these boundaries are still sensitive, that the situation has not yet been fully and definitively stabilised. However, it is far from alarming. Rather, the reasons for this extension appear to be questionable. We must not agree on the principle of prolonging internal controls as far as \"in stock\" and at the will of individual members.  This creates further internal tightening, including between the new and old members of the Union, which is absolutely not needed at the moment. Nor do we need to use changes in border control for political campaigns, as Austria recently afforded when it sent an army to an otherwise empty burden.  This kind of creation of some frightening situation and the apparent fight against an invisible enemy is a very bad signal for European citizens. However, we must insist that the Commission prepare a report as soon as possible after the introduction of the extension of internal border controls, whether and to what extent this measure is proportional. It must also do so in the light of the fact that the introduction of border controls in some Member States has paralysed the transport and logistics sector of the whole of Europe and that the consequences of this control will result in between €5 billion and €18 billion in direct costs per year, in particular in road and freight transport, as well as in tourism and cross-border mobility.

We seem to think that it is a kind of replacement for a fully-fledged refugee and security policy or a replacement for a European border and coast guard, but this is in the hands of the Member States. The Member States should take their responsibility and no longer hesitate about a common asylum policy, the common security policy and a border and coast guard, rather than reinstating border controls.  I think it has been said by others that Schengen is a great achievement and the current border controls come at a huge economic cost, so we have every interest in abolishing the border controls as quickly as possible.  I would really like to know from the Commission: how do you assess the recurrent requests from the Member States for authorising border checks? Quite frankly I have not seen many cases where the Commission has said: sorry, this is simply not justified. When we say it has to be ‘exceptional and temporary’ we are talking about, I believe, six Schengen countries now, or eight, for a very extended period of time. That does not sound like exceptional and temporary. I understand that you are under a lot of pressure from the Member States who want the Commission to actually clean up the mess left by the Member States, but I really hope that you will resist the pressures.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 983, "date": "2016-05-11.json", "name": "Kostas CHRYSOGONOS", "mepid": "125061", "text": "  on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. Mr President, the free movement of people is one of the cornerstones of the European Union and the creation of the Schengen area has contributed to a more effective exercise of this freedom. However, the pressure created at the external borders due to the influx of migrants and refugees has led seven Member States to reintroduce controls at certain internal borders within this area. Since then, however, conditions have changed radically and, in particular, with regard to Greece, the country has taken decisive steps to control its external borders. The future of Europe without Schengen is at least in doubt. The reintroduction of borders between Member States would cost European economies many billions of euros a year, with heavy implications, particularly in the transport sectors of trade and tourism. Furthermore, there are disadvantages that are not costed, such as the decline in the quality of life for the approximately two million European citizens who cross borders every day in order to get to work.

Borders that used to be once the cause of war could be crossed easily in the past, and I believe it is really at the borders where European citizens can see and experience the true value of the European idea and what Europe really means. But the fences and the borders that have been erected in the past month destroy pretty much all of that. They divide people, it is harmful to the economy and it destroys the fundaments of Europe. Just look at the Brenner Pass, look at Malmö and Copenhagen. Then look at the French-German border, and look at how all these border regions have integrated and how we are trying to do that much more to the East, and all of that is being disrupted – if not completely destroyed. That is why I believe, and that is why we believe, that this closing of borders has to end immediately and not just in a couple of months, at the end of the year, or whenever. And our internal borders are on the way to be coming as deadly as our external borders are. Slovak border guards have been shooting at refugees; a boat sank just yesterday in the sea between Denmark and Sweden. This is the situation we are in right now.

The current migrant crisis, however, has severely damaged the possibility of Schengen’s further unaltered functioning. Every state has the right to promote its security by whatever legal means available, but the introduction of internal border controls within Schengen takes place mostly unilaterally, without any serious assessment of the underlining systemic consequences. As a result, should the border controls ever be fully re-established, the EU economy, cooperation and development across many areas shall severely suffer. That, quite frankly, makes the estimated yearly costs of EUR 5 to 18 billion a serious understatement. Ensuring better protection of the external borders and assisting the Member States that suffer the most is absolutely necessary. However, since one of the main reasons for reintroduction of border controls was and still is their thoroughness, revision of internal cross-border security measures is highly warranted.

Ms in ‘t Veld and Ms Fajon, I will answer your concerns. What prevailed is the need to ensure a coordinated and coherent European approach. We have set a timetable; a roadmap, and we implement it. We clearly state that we will be monitoring the application of our recommendations. Member States are expected to adjust the controls to the level of the threat. And yes, some Member States have stopped the controls when they were not necessary.  And yes, on a different case, on the Brenner for instance, I have sent a very clear letter that we do not agree with the reintroduction of border controls and border checks as the situation currently stands. Our very constructive discussion gives me confidence that most of us in this House believe in, work for and support the need for more Europe. The message is clear: we will walk this way together – together and united with a spirit of true solidarity and responsibility as our Treaties expressly stipulate. Going back to Schengen will allow the reorientation of our common European endeavour towards a deeper and more integrated Union – an achievement with tangible important benefits in the everyday life of the citizens of Europe and businesses. May I now draw attention to those who are in favour of building walls, erecting fences and fortresses, afraid of outside enemies. Beware of the Trojan horse carrying xenophobia, racism, populism and extremism. Europe has suffered in the past from elements like this. Border controls should take place only as long as required to address the threat to public policy and internal security. It is an exceptional measure to be used only in exceptional circumstances; it should not obey myopic, short-term domestic policy and tactics. Since you asked me about Greece, allow me to answer as well in Greek now.  Ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Kailis, you have raised very important issues with me. The European Commission is putting an end to the scenarios and paraphilia, which it is paradoxically still holding, for expelling Member States from the Schengen Treaty and imposing so-called penalties. Article 29, which we are triggering for the first time, is intended not to punish, but to ensure the protection of the proper and safe functioning of the Schengen area. There are no controls imposed at airports and ports. With the full support and support of the European Commission, as I had the opportunity to say in my protology, Greece has made considerable progress in recent months in the area of effective management of our common external borders. Certainly, we do not overlook weaknesses and shortcomings, because, yes, they still exist. But we do not overlook the fact that Greece has had to deal with migration and refugee flows of unprecedented intensity. It is on the right track, but it must complete the effective response to all the issues that have been highlighted to it. We activate every available financial resource. We mobilise all available technical assistance, we have a concrete and coherent plan, implementing a holistic strategy, the first results of which have already begun to be felt In this context, the initial implementation of the European Union Turkey Agreement as well as the ongoing operations of FRODEX and NATO, particularly in the Aegean, have contributed to a drastic reduction in the number of irregular migrants and asylum seekers.

That is why we have a duty to save Schengen, not only to guarantee our citizens and workers their right to free movement and movement, but above all in the name of the far-sighted political project of European integration, as the founding fathers of the Union had imagined. In order to achieve this objective, I hope that the timetable laid down in the Commission's roadmap for a return to normal operation of the Schengen area, which provides for the elimination of all internal border controls by the end of this year, to modify the European asylum system and to strengthen the control of the external borders, will be strictly respected. I hope that much faster progress will be made by the Member States in implementing the Commission's Roadmap, before it is too late to safeguard one of the main achievements of the European Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1020, "date": "2016-05-11.json", "name": "Ivan JAKOVČIĆ", "mepid": "124754", "text": "  Written. - The space of free movement of the so-called Schengen between European countries is the highest value of European unity.

From the outset I must however underline that my own comments will be preliminary. The Council has just started examining the report presented by the Commission; in other words there is no Council position yet.  First of all I would like to stress that visa liberalisation for Turkey is a long-standing commitment. It was decided to start this process back in 2011. The roadmap was adopted already in 2013 and what did the EU-Turkey statement do on 18 March? It accelerated the existing process. Secondly, I would like to stress that visa freedom for Turkey is something that benefits, at the very end, all parties concerned. Not only can Turkish citizens travel to Europe more easily, but the millions of Europeans visiting Turkey for holidays or business, for example, can also do so more easily. It will facilitate people-to-people contact. It was, I believe, one of your MEPs, Judith Sargentini – I do not know whether she is in the Chamber today – who said it is also about the Turkish human rights defenders who will be able to travel to Europe freely to tell their story. In other words this is not just a present for President Erdoğan, neither should it be seen as just a concession by Europe to Turkey. It is something from which we all, at the very end, benefit. Now in the Commission’s third report it is concluded that Turkey has achieved remarkable progress. However it also becomes abundantly clear that Turkey has not yet managed to fulfil all 72 benchmarks. Seven benchmarks remain unfulfilled. Regarding two of these seven outstanding requirements, the Commission has noted that for practical and procedural reasons, Turkey needs a longer timeline for implementation.  With regard to the biometric passports, the practical solution consists of limiting visa freedom to the holders of the latest generation of biometric passports. When it comes to Turkey’s obligation to build up a track record under the EU-Turkey Readmission Agreement, we simply need a bit more time as this agreement only becomes effective next month. For the other five requirements, the Commission has invited the Turkish authorities to undertake urgently the measures that are necessary to fulfil these benchmarks. In other words, Turkey has a lot of homework to do and I also, from this chair, urge the Turkish Government to intensify its efforts. Now as you know, we have, besides Turkey, visa freedom proposals also on the table for Georgia, Ukraine and Kosovo. At the same time the Commission has presented a proposal to amend Regulation 539 with a view to revising the current suspension mechanism.  The main objective is to strengthen this mechanism by making it easier for Member States to notify circumstances leading to a possible suspension, and by enabling the Commission to trigger the mechanism on its own initiative, and yes, at a time when we are considering granting visa liberalisation to a 130 million citizens, it is only natural to look again at the current suspension mechanism.  The Commission’s proposal responds to a broadly-felt need in the Council to have a more effective mechanism and we are grateful to the Commission for this proposal. It will undoubtedly facilitate decision-making. It is now up to us, Parliament and the Council, as co-legislators, to start working on the different proposals and as I said work in the Council has started. The Council’s Visa Working Party met this morning and if one thing becomes clear from the initial discussions, it is that this is by no means an easy decision.  What also came out of the discussions is the firm determination of all Member States to stick to a merit-based approach. We will not take a decision based on political expediency. Turkey needs to fulfil the benchmarks and I do trust that this House shares that conviction. There is broad consensus within Council to advance quickly on the revision of the suspension and monitoring mechanism with the aim of agreeing a position at the Justice and Home Affairs Council of 20 May. That is the good news. In closing, the Presidency will take the necessary measures to make sure that all proposals are discussed in a timely manner in the Council and that talks with Parliament are started as soon as you are in a position to do so.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1023, "date": "2016-05-11.json", "name": "Dimitris Avramopoulos", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, on 4 May the Commission presented its third report on Turkey’s progress in fulfilling the requirements of its visa liberalisation roadmap dating from 2013, in parallel to comply with the strict timeframe set by the EU Member States Heads of State and Government and on the understanding that the Turkish authorities will take the necessary measures to fulfil all the outstanding benchmarks. On 4 May the Commission also presented a proposal to transfer Turkey to the list of visa-free countries. The Commission’s proposal opens the way for the European Parliament and the Member States to decide to lift Turkish citizens’ visa requirements once the benchmarks have been met. It also gives – and it is equally important – adequate time for consulting the national parliaments on this issue. Let me underline that in the last months, the Turkish authorities have made really substantial progress in fulfilling the visa liberalisation roadmap, with a further acceleration since the 18 March EU-Turkey Summit. As a result of this, for example, they are now fully cooperating with Greece on readmission. We see a clear reduction of the number of irregular arrivals in Greece from 6 000 a day in October 2015 to around 140 with a continuing downward trend. We also have to commend Turkey for hosting around 2.7 million Syrian refugees and more than 200 000 non-Syrian asylum seekers and refugees, granting to all of them free access to healthcare and education, and now also to legal employment. Meanwhile, they are also improving the asylum procedures. They have ratified all international conventions and protocols and judicial cooperation indicated by the visa liberalisation roadmap, and as requested by the roadmap they have also adopted several pieces of legislation, for instance on trafficking in human beings and on judicial cooperation and on equality and anti-discrimination, and action plans on social inclusion of citizens with a Roma background, on corruption , in the fight against drugs trafficking, in the fight against organised crime which they are starting to implement. But let me be clear as well that there is still progress to be made. This implies for Turkey to take the following steps: to adopt measures to fight against corruption in line with the recommendations of the Council of Europe; to align its legislation on personal data protection with EU standards; to conclude an operational cooperation agreement with Europol; to offer effective judicial cooperation in criminal matters to all Member States; and last but not least, the need to better align with the European standards its legislation and practices on terrorism. In the EU-Turkey statement of 18 March, the Turkish authorities expressed their determination to fulfil all benchmarks of the visa liberalisation roadmap by June. I am confident they remain committed to implement all aspects of that statement. In any case, the Commission will continue to monitor closely the fulfilling of these benchmarks, and naturally I and my services will ensure that you are regularly updated. We have to remain optimistic that the Turkish authorities will give that final push before the end of June. I want to be clear: this agreement is beneficial for both sides. We are not watering down our standards in order to provide visa-free, but we are doing everything we can to provide support and expertise to the Turkish authorities to accelerate what are also quite important reforms in their own right. What is also important in their path towards the European Union? The implementation of visa reforms will not only contribute to the internal welfare of Turkey but will also help the EU and Turkey to develop effective cooperation within the framework of the global strategy that we are building with this key neighbour. We are confronted with the same challenges. Cooperation is necessary. I will give an example. Only yesterday Turkey was hit by another terrorist attack. I take this opportunity to express my thoughts for those injured, and my indignation. Terrorism must be condemned in every form and everywhere. And we know how sensitive the issue of terrorism is for Turkey. But this proves how beneficial the close cooperation with Europol is for both sides. For this to be achieved, Turkey needs to further align its data protection standards to the European ones. Not just because this is required by the roadmap, but because the reforms required by the roadmap are the basis for an even stronger cooperation on both security and migration, with sensitive data exchanges that need adequate protection. It is true that Turkey is considering this cooperation as a catalyst, I would say, to reenergise our relations as well as its European perspective. Indeed, it is an opportunity for Turkey to come closer to the European standards on all issues. The fulfilment of the visa liberalisation roadmap is an important step towards this direction. I would now like to mention another element of the package, adopted on 4 March. The Commission also proposed to revise the existing suspension mechanism of the visa-free regime. I want to be very clear on this. The suspension mechanism is not about Turkey. It is a horizontal provision which will apply to all visa-free countries and not only Turkey. I hope that the co-legislators will look favourably at this proposal, although it should not delay the deliberations and the adoption of the visa liberalisation proposal.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 1, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1024, "date": "2016-05-11.json", "name": "Mariya GABRIEL", "mepid": "96848", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Madam President, Commissioner, Madam Minister, we have heard clearly – important and accelerated steps have been identified on the progress of the visa liberalisation roadmap with Turkey.  We support the agreement between the European Union and Turkey, but we also have a very clear position on visa liberalisation. In this context, I draw attention to three aspects: First, support for visa liberalisation with Turkey can only be given if all the criteria are met. It is the Commission's responsibility to formally confirm that all the requirements have been met by Turkey and not to have only a time frame in which we expect this to be done. The implementation of all indicators will ensure the reliability of the process. In one sentence: in the European Parliament, we cannot vote on such liberalisation until the criteria are met and before the Council has given its consent.  Secondly, I welcome the Commission for linking visa liberalisation to the implementation and proper implementation of the Agreement between the European Union and Turkey. This means a steady small number of migrants coming from Turkey and effective readmission.  Thirdly, I congratulate the Commission on the proposal to revise and optimise the safeguard mechanism for visa waiver. Our efforts must be aimed at creating an efficient, including emergency brake. The mechanism should also be introduced in parallel with the possible adoption of the visa liberalisation decision and not there after.  Finally, relations between the European Union and Turkey are at a key stage. A clear sign of efforts to change legislation where necessary is needed to meet the criteria and effectively and sustainably implement what has already been adopted. Sustainability and dialogue are key to our partnership with Turkey.  Finally, I believe in our constructive role as a European Parliament, in which as co-legislator we will take the necessary time to analyse all the details thoroughly and thus make our decision.", "language": "en", "original_language": "bg", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1025, "date": "2016-05-11.json", "name": "Tanja FAJON", "mepid": "96911", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group.  I could be sure of how very tangible the measure is, how it has a strong, direct and two-way impact on political and social dynamics. That is why I have considerable reservations in supporting the visa waiver for Turkey at the moment.  Whatever conditions, whether economic or political, which we place at any time in the European Union, are not intended to develop the imagination of politicians, but are created on the basis of half-century of development of integration and are intended to advance and develop for the common good. The European Union's relationship with Turkey is very important in order to resolve the migrant crisis at the moment, but that does not in itself mean that Turkey is granted benefits without all the conditions being met. Turkey has been placed on visa waivers with 72 measures, which it has so far failed to fully comply with.  This is a simple fact that we cannot and must not overlook. I am concerned that, for example, legislation in the fight against terrorism and data protection are not met – in my opinion very crucial conditions– in the fight against terrorism and data protection. Turkey will have to address this and the remaining unresolved areas very seriously before we are able and willing to initiate the legislative procedure in the committee responsible.  The abolition of visas is a process that requires not only a strong commitment in principle to meet the criteria, but also actual fulfilment.

This is really incomprehensible. The asylum agreement with Turkey clearly states that there will be no special visa conditions for Turkey. The Commission itself recognises that Turkey does not meet all 72 conditions, but wants to push this forward. But Turkey is not fulfilling its part of the agreements. For example, Turkey has still not implemented the requested anti-terror regulations and anti-corruption measures. Especially in these times of terror threat, seizures of critical newspapers and the arbitrary arrests of journalists, these are not futility. It is sufficient to refer to the newspaper Zaman, the German stand-up comedian Jan Böhmermann and the Dutch-Turkish journalist Ebru Umar.  Instead of making sweet buns with Erdogan, the European Commission would rather stress turkey's failing and worsening policy on, among other things, freedom of expression.

Yet I am unhappy with the debate we are having because, quite frankly, I have great personal respect and appreciation both for Minister Hennis and Commissioner Avramopoulos, and I realise that you have to represent the official view of the Council and the Commission. But we should really be having this debate with the architects of this unsavoury deal with Turkey, where they made a trade-off between the reception of refugees and granting of visa liberalisation. We want to judge Turkey on its merits and not because there has been a sell-out by, amongst other people, Mr Timmermans. The criteria must be fulfilled, and, if I listen to the presentation – also on Monday in LIBE by the Commission, who says: well, we are nearly there, there are just a few little details to be concluded here and there – they are not details: we can all see what is happening in Turkey. So what you are saying, on behalf of your institutions, is simply not reality. Anybody who watches television or reads a newspaper knows that that is not the case. Just today we hear that, through his office’s advisers, Mr Erdoğan makes it known to the European Parliament that, if the European Parliament takes the wrong decision, he will let the refugees travel to Europe.  That is blackmail in my book – and why is Europe open to blackmail? Because we are weak and divided. Why are we weak and divided? Because the national government leaders fail to agree on a common EU refugee policy.

This is a key point for Mr Erdogan, the only real issue for him, as he visibly prepares for a new election campaign to seek, once again, the majority needed to change the country's constitution.  As the European Union is obsessed with migrant issues, Mr Erdogan is holding his tool of blackmail. No matter what happens in Turkey, it does not matter if the Kurds are slaughtered when the United Nations has just drawn our attention to this point, once again. It does not matter that their elected representatives are sent to prison, like all those who dare to denounce these facts and that democracy is increasingly called into question in this country. Worse, next week, Turkey's national assembly is expected to amend its constitution to collectively lift the parliamentary immunity of some 130 deputies. A detail!

The escalation against every opposition in Turkey, against every critic of President Erdogan last week, was truly of new quality. When I observe this, it is becoming increasingly clear to me that President Erdogan is dividing his country ever more deeply. The preparation for waiving the immunity of more than 100 Members of the Turkish Parliament, supported also by the chairman of the opposition GROUP CHP, shows this very clearly. We have seen the shooting of Can Dündar, we have seen the incredibly high penalties against Dündar and Gül, the forced resignation of Davutoglu and, in the end, shots fired at refugees on the border with Syria. That's the incomplete list last week. My group is aware that nothing should be imposed on Turkey. However, we also know that the European Union must not become an actor who simply overlooks these systematic violations of the rule of law. The conditions for visa liberalisation that we are talking about are so important because they affect social development in Turkey for better or worse. And as much as we want freedom of travel, we cannot give freedom of travel in support of President Erdogan's authoritarian path. The events of the last few days, which I have described, are actually an appeal to the European Union to shape its policy on Turkey much more carefully. Turkey, like turkey, is an indispensable partner for us if we are to achieve security and stability in this region beyond Turkey. We have known this for a long time. However, I think in recent days that we are learning that we are making a mistake if we improperly mix up the European refugee strategy and our necessary positive policy towards Turkey, our efforts towards Turkey. We urgently need – and this was long overdue – this deliberate strategy towards Turkey in terms of visa liberalisation negotiations. But the European Union must not rely centrally on Turkey in its refugee strategy. We must shape our refugee strategy independently. Nor must we base the design of our management of the external borders on Turkey.

He's right. Many Europeans believed in good faith in the dream of the European Union that had been skilfully sold to them. Today, this project has become the nightmare of the European peoples.

The latter exerts a real migratory diktat through a terrible blackmail where, in exchange for illusory protection against the migratory surge, Turkey demands 6 billion euros. With this blackmail, Mr Erdogan has also secured from you the relaunch of Turkey's accession negotiations to the European Union. It now orders you to grant its nationals free access to the territory of our nations, with the abolition of short-stay visas. Who knows if, tomorrow, it will not be tens of millions of Turks from Turkey, but also Turks from the Caucasus and Central Asia, who, thanks to the Turkish passport which can be granted to them, will be entitled to a one-way ticket to Europe. You disarm the states and peoples of Europe by going so far as to demand their financial participation in the migration submersion through this delusional european Commission project of a fine of 250,000 euros per rejected migrant. You have decreed the lands of our peoples \"land open to mass immigration and Turkish influence\". President Erdogan is just playing with the cards you left him.

Normally I am obviously available for all debates, but I will have to leave a bit earlier, so I would like to make just a few remarks in response to the contributions. Firstly, I heard a number of negative comments about the EU-Turkey statement of March 18. I understand, and I am the first one to admit that this agreement is by no means perfect, but let us also remind ourselves of the positive effects that this agreement has yielded so far. The vast and uncontrollable flows of irregular migration across the Eastern Mediterranean have been brought to a halt. The tragic loss of life has dramatically reduced. We have started an orderly process of resettlement and readmission. We are not there yet, but we have started it. The smugglers have been increasingly put out of business. We are regaining control over our eastern borders, so it might not be a perfect agreement, I agree, but it was and is the very first effective response to the migration crisis. Secondly, let us not forget that the use of biometric passports by Turkey will allow us to better control who enters the EU. It will contribute to our safety. The UNHCR has obtained better access to refugee facilities in Turkey. Refugees have obtained the right to work in Turkey and have gained better access to Turkish social facilities such as schooling and health care. These are just a few examples. But what I would like to underline is let us not lose sight of also the positive developments. Thirdly, a lot has been said today about the human rights situation in Turkey, and I agree with everybody in this House who says that the situation is far from perfect. I also worry about the freedom of speech in Turkey – and let me stress every human rights violation is one too many – so we will need to continue to engage with Turkey on human rights issues, because only through engagement will we be able to achieve improvements. At the same time, I would like to remind you that Turkey is hosting around 3 million refugees, so the efforts of the Turkish Government to provide a safe shelter for all these people fleeing war and conflict is impressive at the very end, and Turkey deserves our support in coping with this enormous challenge. Finally, as I said before, it is difficult for me to communicate at this stage a Council position, since our work has just begun but, as I said at the beginning, it was important for me to hear your views and your concerns. Let me stress once more that visa freedom can only take place once the Commission has reported that it is satisfied with the efforts of Turkey to meet the required benchmarks.

The point of contact for Europe in Ankara, Prime Minister Davutoglu, has been pushed aside.

A low point has been reached and we cannot afford to remain dependent on the whims of the Turkish President. Europe must be able to control its own borders and control the flow of refugees. This requires a European plan and that plan, which is apparently being worked on. Can the Commission confirm this?

This statement was made by a former Turkish EU Minister some years ago, and I believe it is still valid today. The lengthy and bureaucratic procedure to obtain a visa is of great nuisance for Turkish citizens who want to travel to the EU for business, studies or simply for enjoying their holidays. It is therefore good that the EU and Turkey started negotiations two years ago in order to lift this visa requirement. As part of the EU—Turkey deal on refugees, it was agreed that the EU is willing to accelerate that process if and when Turkey meets all 72 criteria. But while accelerating that process was part of the deal, lowering our standards certainly was not. Let us be honest: Turkey over the last few months has come much closer to meeting the set of technical standards than any of us would have thought possible, but the Commission has also made it clear that there are still five criteria where Turkey does not fulfil the benchmarks. Among these are the fight against corruption, an independent data protection authority and, most importantly, Turkey’s very broadly defined anti-terror legislation – the same anti-terror legislation which has been criticised for many years by us here in Parliament, not because Turkey does not have the right to fight against Islamic State, PKK or other terrorist groups, but because this law is used to jail journalists and silence academics. Labelling all voices of dissent as terrorists is what makes this law unacceptable. Just like the current attempt to lift the immunity of 129 Members of Parliament, including almost the entire HDP parliamentary faction, this will certainly not bring Turkey closer to European standards nor bring it closer to restarting their much needed peace process.

Turkey is also a country that is becoming increasingly authoritarian, that is shooting at refugees, imprisoning journalists under terrorist laws, where corruption is rampant high in the dwellings of power, and where a war is taking place with the Kurds. There is a road map with 72 criteria to meet. A few of them have not been met, two of them not at all: number 42 on corruption and number 65 on terrorism. The last thing, Erdoğan has expressly said that he does not intend to comply. It is a very remarkable statement by a man who has entered into an agreement with us, knowing that all the criteria will be met. For me, it is difficult to give Erdoğan such a victory as visa facilitation means, unless the terrorism criterion is also met, and it is far from being met and will be difficult to meet. But on the day That I vote 'yes' to visa facilitation for Turkey, it will be for the sake of turkish citizens, and not to give Erdoğan some feathers in his hat.

This is despite the Erdoğan regime being accused of a catalogue of human rights abuses: air strikes against Kurds fighting Daesh, a clampdown on the freedom of the press, and a highly controversial anti-terror policy. But any EU opposition to these totalitarian measures has crumbled in its haste to ease the migrant crisis while still maintaining Schengen, despite these terrible acts being directly opposed to its own principles. The fact is, President Erdoğan has realised he is now in a position to hold the entire block to ransom and make demands of the EU that even two years ago would have been unthinkable. And to understand just what a stranglehold Erdoğan has achieved, consider his ‘we’re going our way, you go yours’ outburst in rejecting EU demands for changes to Turkey’s anti-terror laws. This is a law that is more often than not used on opponents of Erdoğan’s regime, yet it is a law that the Commission has chosen to give way on as it pushes ahead with giving Turkey visa-free EU travel as a reward for their cooperation.

We have put forward a proposal to comply with the strict timeframe provided for in the 18 March statement. You all remember that. The decision is now to be taken by you and the Council in the co-decision procedure. The Commission hopes that your final decision will be positive, provided that all the criteria of the roadmap are fulfilled by Turkey. We have been very clear from the very first moment on that. I would like to conclude by underlining, one more time, the strategic importance to give a successful conclusion to the visa liberalisation process; a process which the European Union and Turkey have jointly started already since 2013. Successfully concluding this process by fulfilling all benchmarks of the roadmap will be indeed very beneficial for both the European Union and for Turkey. It will not only contribute to create a higher level of security and a better management of migration and mobility for our citizens; more than that it will create further possibilities for people-to-people contacts between the citizens of Turkey and those of the European Union, thus facilitating mutual knowledge and building confidence. Ultimately, I am convinced it will represent a decisive step forward for Turkey as a candidate country in the process of its legal approximation towards EU standards in the field of justice and home affairs. In this perspective, I am convinced that the Commission took the right decision to present the proposal. It is now clearly up to the Turkish authorities to do the last effort, to walk the last mile, allowing to fulfil the outstanding requirements of the roadmap. The European Union must, and will, stand by Turkey in its efforts to accompany the country in its endeavours.  The Commission will continue in the weeks to come to stay in close contact with the Turkish authorities and provide assistance and advice to ensure that jointly the European Union and Turkey will be able to conclude this process. As I said in my introductory remarks, it is beneficial for both sides. Let us approach this in a positive way, because we have already the first tangible results and outcome of this cooperation.

The purpose of this legislative offensive is to radically reduce the scope for aggressive tax planning, tax evasion and tax avoidance and create a level playing field for all businesses in the EU. I congratulate the Commission for this initiative. The purpose of the present proposal is to further strengthen and improve administrative cooperation between tax authorities in Member States and to increase transparency of tax policies across the EU. The directive proposal provides for the mandatory automatic exchange between national tax authorities of information regarding country—by—country reports filed in each Member State by multinational enterprises involved in cross-border business activities. The obligation of filing country—by—country reports extends to all multinationals with a combined turnover of more than EUR 750 million. The directive proposal is in line with accepted international standards and specifically with the OECD report on the action plan on base erosion and profit shifting – the so-called BEPS report. The OECD package was also endorsed by the G20 leaders. It is therefore essential for the good functioning of the internal market that Member States transpose political commitments until BEPS enters their national legal systems. We broadly support the Commission proposal. We think it is timely, proportionate and goes in the right direction. We propose however two amendments. First, we want to involve the Commission to become part of the automatic mandatory exchange of information between Member States and this is for two reasons. Firstly, we want the Commission to be able to control the process of exchange of information in order to ensure the compliance of multinational companies and of Member States with the directive. Secondly, there is a state aid dimension to tax exemptions granted by Member States and the Commission should have access to this information to make sure that no illegal state aid is involved. The second amendment we propose is to request the Commission to report systematically on the results achieved under this directive and to present publicly the aggregate summary of country—by—country reports. There were also two other changes proposed by some MEPs. The first proposal was to lower the threshold required for filing country—by—country reports from EUR 750 million down to EUR 40 million. The other proposal was to make all country—by—country reports public. Both these proposals were rejected in the vote in the ECON Committee because they would introduce double standards – one more demanding for EU companies and the other less demanding for non-EU companies. If accepted, these two proposals would clearly put EU companies at a competitive disadvantage vis—à—vis non-European companies. Mr President, dear Members of Parliament, I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs for their cooperation in preparing our report and the parliamentary services for technical support.  I call on this House to vote in favour of our report.

Mr President, Mr rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased to be here today to continue our debate on tax transparency, which will keep us busy throughout this term. I promised you that the transparency revolution was underway. A new step has been taken today, thanks to Parliament, whose action I welcome.  You know that the Commission has been particularly active in recent months on the transparency front. Last December, an agreement was reached in record time on the automatic exchange of information on tax rulings between tax authorities in the EU. Since January, the Commission and I have pushed this revolution by putting on the table two major proposals: a directive on the publication of country-by-country reports on the activities of multinationals, country by country report between the tax authorities of the Member States of the Union. That is what we need to discuss tonight. Finally, there is also a proposal to amend the accounting directive, which would make this type of report public, and you know that, from the beginning, that is the position I have been strongly defending. We are determined to push the boundaries of transparency even further with Parliament's strong and constant support for this work. Our current work is thus moved in three directions.  The next immediate step for the Commission is to examine whether and to what extent the transparency requirements in the Anti-Money Laundering Directive could also be used to combat tax evasion. As early as next month, the Commission will present a proposal for an amendment to this directive. She is also thinking about how to shed more light on the activities of tax planning scheme proponents- including tax advisors, this happens to them - used by taxpayers to evade tax.  Finally, we are working intensively on the development of a European blacklist of non-cooperative jurisdictions. There is one, but it is too much the result of a compilation of national lists, which are themselves heterogeneous; all of this would be a precursor to an OECD list. I had the opportunity to speak on this subject again last week with the OECD Secretary-General, Angel Gurra, and our teams are working in perfect intelligence This is the global framework before we now get to the very point of the debate. Why is the automatic and compulsory exchange of information between the tax authorities of the Member States so important? Quite simply, because it is a fundamental mechanism for them to be able to quickly detect and respond to harmful tax practices. Clearly, this mechanism, as you have explained, will allow for better tax control and ensure more virtuous practices on the part of multinationals. A word, first of all, to explain how this proposal fits with our international work. As you know, this is a proposal that transposes Action 13 of the OECD's BEPS action plan into EU law. This has already been agreed at OECD level and approved by the G20 in November 2015 in Antalya. The Commission's intention is therefore not to create a new EU standard but simply to fully implement the OECD recommendations. We must at all costs stay the course of what has been agreed, avoid creating loopholes that could be exploited by multinationals. The benefits of an initiative at European level are, in my view, extremely clear. This will ensure a coherent, effective and comprehensive approach to the European Union and will enable country-by-country information to be published in the internal market. This initiative also provides greater legal certainty for tax authorities and businesses, and will contribute to the development of an international standard for the automatic exchange of country-by-country information. I now come to the heart of the proposal itself. With regard to substance, this proposal requires large multinationals to report to the tax authorities the tax they pay in each jurisdiction in which they operate, as well as other relevant tax information.  As far as its scope is concerned, all multinationals that reside tax-based in the European Union or abroad but are active in the internal market will have to comply with the new rules.  As far as the timetable is concerned, the directive will come into force in 2017. The first exchanges of information will therefore focus on accounting exercises that begin on or after 1 January 2016. Date. I turn to the rapporteur, Mr Rosati - in fact, I have not stopped turning to him - to thank him very warmly for his report, these thanks are of course true for all those who have contributed to it. I know that Parliament would like to go further on several aspects. So I would like to bounce back on some of the points of your work as well as some of the progress that is being made.  First, there are plans to make the information public by country. This is progress, as you know, that is close to my heart and which I have supported since I took office at the Commission. I am therefore pleased that the Commission has adopted the proposal amending the accounting directive which provides for the advertising of the activities of multinationals, the publication of country-by-country information, and as part of this initiative, the Commission is working to respond to the urgent demand from citizens and the European Parliament for more transparency, with a concern that you share for most of you. , which is to preserve the competitiveness of European companies. Therefore, from now on, it is a proposal that is in the hands of the co-legislators. We took the first step, it was not a simple decision to make but we made it, and we hope that now we will be followed.  With regard to the role of the Commission, it is hoped that country-by-country information reports will also be shared with the Commission. As the Commission is not a tax authority, with no jurisdiction in the administration of the enforcement of member states' national tax laws, it cannot receive or have access to the content of the publication of information by country, which is expressly intended for national tax administrations. The information exchanged should essentially be used by the tax authorities to assess the risks in the area of transfer pricing and better target tax controls, areas in which the Commission, too, is not competent. Member States and the OECD also believe that sharing the publication of country-by-country information with the Commission would not be in line with the confidentiality clause of the OECD agreement. So I would like to agree with you, but you see that there is little room for manoeuvre. Another point: the content of the reports. Some amendments provide for the inclusion of additional information. Again, this would not be compatible with the primary objective of this initiative, which aims to implement and transpose BEPS within the Union. To depart from it would be to create a new standard of the European Union and, therefore, a new stratum of reporting obligation, which would thus increase the administrative burden for multinational companies. Honestly, we want to identify fraudsters, we want to fight tax evasion, we want to limit the erosion of tax bases, we do not want to overwhelm businesses. Last point, it was proposed that the Commission draw up annual reports to the Council and the European Parliament that assess the effectiveness of the automatic exchange of information between Member States. But the directive on administrative cooperation already exists. Member States provide the Commission with all the information necessary to assess the effectiveness of this cooperation as well as an annual evaluation of effectiveness including the practical results obtained. In addition, the Commission must also produce a report on the application of automatic exchange of information by 1 October 2018 and submit a report on the implementation of the Directive on Administrative Cooperation to Parliament and the Council every five years. We believe that these provisions are sufficient, proportionate and, indeed, already respond to the legitimate concern that you express and which I fully share.  In any case, be assured that the Commission will closely monitor the implementation and impact of the directive, and that it will propose, if necessary, relevant amendments.  Ladies and gentlemen, I conclude, to strengthen transparency, to strengthen the fight against fraud and tax evasion, these are the objectives which are at the top of our political priorities and which are very clearly at the very heart of my mandate in the Commission.  We have already made significant progress with a tight and ambitious timetable. We are helped, it must be said, by a public opinion revolted by the successive revelations: those of last year, those of the Panama Papers, more recently. We must, without a doubt, build on this revolt to move things forward decisively. Your Parliament and the Commission, I believe, actually work in the same spirit and hand in hand. I am often in this House to present to you the proposals that we are drawing up, which are a very concrete manifestation of this commitment. I have an ambition and I know that you share it: that the European Union should be a leader and a driving force in the now global fight for tax transparency.  At the beginning of my speech, I was telling you that I would come before you to talk about these issues throughout this mandate. Yes, for sure, our work is far from over. There are still key proposals to be discussed such as the Anti Tax Avoidance Package Directive, which is on the Council's table - I hope an agreement on this in a few days at the Ecofin Council - as well as the proposal on country-by-country public reporting.  I have heard dissatisfaction. I think we must also be aware that in doing so, we will really be the first in the world to make such a proposal. It is essential that we continue to work together. I am happy to do so here in plenary. I do so in the relevant committees, before the TAXE Committee, before the ECON Committee because I know once again that, without cooperation between the Commission and the European Parliament but also without the conviction of the Member States, these proposals would remain an empty shell.

I believe this is one of the key components as it will provide the tax authorities with data about the taxation on the level of the group and not just on the level of individual countries. This should allow the tax authorities to make a better decision about which tax check of the firms deserves the most attention. This is just the beginning of the process, but I believe we can succeed, and we are actually succeeding. Maybe some of you have noticed a recent article in the Financial Times stating that a lot of firms are warning shareholders about future profits because of expected higher tax checks, not because the taxes would be rising, but because of our efforts to collect taxes better. Let me just make three points concerning the report. Firstly, it is good that we are separating the debate about public CBCR from the CBCR itself. CBCR should be implemented as soon as possible and the debate on publication will be complicated. Secondly, we were facing the problems in debate with the Council.

As the Commissioner quite rightly said at the time, there is exasperation among our fellow citizens because, revelation after revelation, they realize that one of the most sacred principles of our democracies - that is, equality before tax - is flouted and undermined by a number of practices such as aggressive optimization, tax optimization, which make a number of multinationals pay a ridiculously low tax and , in countries where they have no real economic activity. Indeed, Mr Moscovici, you have said that there are dissatisfactions. I would say more about the requirements, but at the same time we recognize - because we have to admit - that this work that is presented to us today - the tax package that you presented in committee and in plenary - is definitely going in the right direction. That is what our fellow citizens expect from us and, from that point of view, it is good. Then there is a debate that Mr. Rosati alluded to at the time.

The rapporteur, Mrs Rosati, has taken this important matter forward vigorously, and I would like to thank her for that. Country-by-country reporting will provide authorities with better tools in the future to monitor multinationals paying their taxes to the Member State where the profits have been made. The proposal is based on the work carried out at the OECD, which has now moved to EU level. Aggressive tax planning is an international problem for which international solutions are needed. At the latest, data leaks such as Luxleaks and the Panama Papers have revealed how brashly international big business avoids the taxes they are due to. In public, however, companies want to present them as honourable and socially responsible bodies in every way. However, country-by-country reporting and exchange of tax information by public authorities are not enough. Transparency is also needed. The ECR Group is positive about public country-by-country reporting, but it does not consider disclosure to be covered by the Assistance Directive. Moreover, the majority of the ECR is not in favour of lowering the reporting thresholds from 750 million to 40 million. Personally, I believe that it is precisely in terms of greater transparency and thresholds that the proposal will remain halfway through. It is important that competition between companies is fair and that everyone also pays their taxes on the result in accordance with the same rules of the game. It is important that citizens can see what the company's tax footprint is like. Transparency is the best way to create more public pressure on businesses and to ensure that the right income is reported by country and taxes are paid.

However, as we see the realisation of all these plans, it is absolutely clear that the ambitions have been revised down. What we see is the adoption of minimalist measures and far below what is necessary. It is ironic that this negotiation is being made under the Dutch Presidency of the European Union, and the Netherlands is one of the most important tax havens in existence, as the Starbucks scandals, among others, demonstrate. What the European Commission proposes is to follow OECD rules by proposing a confidential country-by-country report in which multinational companies will provide tax administrations with information on their activity and taxes. As is acknowledged, the confidentiality of this information takes away the full effectiveness of the measure and, in particular, its deterrent effect.  We therefore call on the Commission to make it compulsory to advertise this information, as is the case with banks. We do not understand the 750 million euro limit, which exempts the vast majority of multinational companies from this measure.

We need this information to be publicly available and for all multinational companies, not just a few of the large ones.  The EU can, and should, be a global leader in ambitious actions for tax justice. The leak of the Panama papers exposed the extent of the network of tax havens and overseas territories that help wealthy people hide their money. The data make it clear that the UK is at the heart of the web of offshore tax havens. Over half of the companies listed had been registered in the British Virgin Islands, and when you trace the people or companies behind these shell companies the UK itself ranks fifth for linked companies. David Cameron has a real opportunity this week to demonstrate his commitment to tax transparency as he hosts the UK Anti-Corruption Summit. He can put an end to shell companies by requiring British overseas territories to introduce a mandatory public register of beneficial ownership.

Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner Moscovici, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his EUR 70 billion is lost annually to the Member States of the European region through aggressive tax planning by multinational companies. That is why combating tax avoidance and aggressive tax planning is a priority for national budgets. However, it is equally important in order to create conditions of competition that are the same for multinationals and for small and medium-sized enterprises. We know that SMEs or small and medium-sized enterprises in Europe pay on average one third more corporation tax than multinationals.  It is also important for transparency – the report we are discussing today is particularly important – but also in order to create effective taxation at the place of value creation, that is to say, profits should be taxed where the economic activity takes place. Tax evasion is a global problem, which is why global solutions to this problem are also needed. The OECD-BEPS initiative, a 15-point action plan to combat profit reduction and profit shifting, is a very important point in this context. What is important here is the international coordination on the taxation of company income and the closing of tax loopholes, but also the increase in transparency. More than 100 countries around the world have already committed themselves to the international exchange of information, including Panama, as we have already heard today, but only the United States. Delaware has more letterbox companies than residents. However, Europe is already one step further in this area, namely with country-by-country reporting, a mandatory country-by-country reporting for multinationals with a turnover of more than EUR 750 million. These groups must disclose sales, profits and income taxes, both open and paid, to the tax authorities. However, this threshold affects a large number of companies, namely ten percent of all companies operating worldwide, and 90 percent of the sales that are made in this area – 6500 companies are affected.  What is important here is that Europe does not go it alone, but fits into this global concert, into these OECD BEPS provisions, as the rapporteur and also the Commissioner have said. No double standards for Europe, no competitive disadvantages for European companies! That is why it is important to leave the turnover limit at EUR 750 million, to coordinate the level of information exchange and also the nature of the disclosure.

For this reason, of course, I welcome the OECD initiative on the one hand and the Commission's proposal on the other, which goes beyond that, because the reporting also goes to the Commission, because once a year there is a report from the Commission to the Council and Parliament, and because small and medium-sized enterprises are largely excluded and therefore no longer burdened. Nevertheless, it must be made clear that this can only be a first step. Country-by-country reporting must be made global and public, because only the public ensures that we can clearly see which countries are promising which companies what. SMEs pay taxes, and large companies have been able to do better in the past through fragmented tax legislation in Europe. This must finally come to an end! This is not about trade secrets, it is about greater transparency and comparability in the European internal market. Tax competition requires equal tax conditions.

I think this is really a crucial step in the fight against social dumping and tax avoidance. This is a fight that many of us are fighting here in the European Parliament with you, Commissioner. I think it is really a struggle for the fierce defence of a fairer vision of society in which everyone has the same chance of success, because of course we cannot accept that the richest, the best organized or the least scrupulous manage to evade taxes and let others pay the bill. When Google, Facebook, Amazon, Apple or others organize themselves not to pay taxes in Europe, it is obviously SMEs, the middle classes, workers and civil servants who go to the checkout. We all know that tax is the funding of our schools, employment aid, public transport, security; it is really all that allows us to live together in a society that tends towards more justice. That is why I regret a little that the amendment to this directive concerns multinationals so little. Our goal is not to target only the largest multinationals, the most high-profile ones or those whose stores we frequent on weekends. Our goal is really to cover as many multinational companies as possible. And why? Just to avoid tax evasion. I think this is the necessary condition for re-establishing the same market conditions between multinationals and national companies in Europe. It is therefore essential that the threshold for the application of this standard be set for all multinational companies considered to be large companies by the accounting directive: 40 million euros in turnover and 250 employees. Without this, the directive would affect only one in ten multinationals. So, rather than restoring some fiscal justice, we could even create a little more injustice, by creating two categories of multinationals: those that can continue to organize massive tax evasion with impunity and others.

In this respect, I think it is very good that the European Parliament has sent out a clear signal here too. This problem is also a competition problem. Those companies that pay their taxes fairly are at a disadvantage compared to those that do not – whether those who pay their taxes fairly are large corporations or medium-sized businesses or small businesses. But there are the black sheep who don't. We are now doing something about this by making it important that the Commission, which is responsible for illegal aid, which is responsible for distorting competition, is also informed of what taxes are paid and what taxes are not paid.

Then the recommendation: here and there, we are in the process of putting in place a whole range of laws on the information obligations to which multinationals are now subject. These texts are necessary to move from the era of darkness to the age of transparency.

Sometimes, when there is such a debate, I think many citizens think that it is really quite absurd that we live in a global world where these standards do not yet apply. That is why I believe that the European Union has a huge role to play in being at the forefront of implementing these things, also at global level, in the OECD, in the G20 and in other contexts, and in fighting for the standards we are developing here in Europe to become global standards as well.  We know that in Europe alone eur 1000 billion a year is being swindled and tax-cheating if both companies and individual citizens' tax evasion are taken into account. Money that could have gone to welfare, money that could have gone to create new jobs. We know that small and medium-sized enterprises, which create 85% of all jobs in Europe, have a tax burden that is 30% higher than that of the large multinationals. That is why what is going on with tax evasion and tax evasion for large companies is destroying jobs in Europe.  I believe that transparency, effective cooperation and common standards are the three things that are needed, and I would like to say that this proposal is very good.

The OECD agenda is the agenda to follow and I think Commissioner Moscovici was right earlier when he said: ‘the key question now is on implementation’. We now have under Chapter 13 of the OECD BEPS Action Plan clear sets of obligations and actions on the part of EU Members. We must ensure that we follow those actions up and we must ensure also that where the Commission feels that Member States are not living up to their obligations under the OECD agenda, that they say it clearly. Secondly, on the question of automatic tax exchange of information. I come from a country, Ireland, which signed with the United States of America a FATCA arrangement, the second country in the world to do that, which is arguably the gold standard of tax exchange information now, where effectively the tax authorities give information on an annualised basis. It is not just important in terms of the tax paid, it is also crucially important in ensuring that we diminish loopholes and that we try to understand how companies get around the taxation system. I want to put on public record my support for Commissioner Moscovici’s proposal for an effective blacklisting of territories and Member States that may well be regarded as tax havens.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like once again to thank you, all of you, for your comments and the collective impetus that this Parliament is giving to our joint action for fairer and more transparent taxation. I am once again convinced that our two institutions - beyond the differences in sensitivity that can emerge here or there - are on roughly the same wavelength, simply because we have the same objective - more transparent, more efficient and, at the same time, fairer taxation. I also welcome the level of ambition that some of you have mentioned and which Mr Rosati's report has of course reflected. In this regard, I would like to assure you that the decision to limit the application of this directive to multinational groups, whose turnover is above the threshold of some EUR 750 million per year, is not - contrary to what I have heard - the result of some cowardice or weakness on the part of the Commission, but simply of in-depth reflection and common sense which is also based on the conclusions. Many of you have told us that we must not build a new stratum, a new standard, or that we should still complicate things. Not all multinationals are affected by this threshold, but it is important to know that this threshold is actually very effective, as it covers 90% of the revenues of multinationals in Europe. If it were lowered, a new administrative burden would actually be imposed on companies that account for only 10% of the revenues of multinationals, but companies that are not themselves subject to this obligation, if we follow the country-by-country reporting rules of the OECD. It would therefore be very expensive, very cumbersome and, in truth, totally ineffective. That is why, if we want to change this threshold, we can understand it, and to understand even more the revenues of multinationals, it is at the OECD level that we must act to try to bring down, in the collective framework of the BEPS project, this threshold which is still, I believe, quite remarkably effective. With regard to the role of the Commission, I have heard those who want it to be stronger, and I would like to thank them, even those who are members like Mr Lucke who are usually more critical of this Commission. After all, if they decide, for once, to express their appreciation, I can only thank them too much. But there are the simply legal and legal limits that I indicated in my introduction. I would like to assure you once again that we will be extremely vigilant, attentive and strict in order for this directive to be properly applied within the framework, of course, of our powers. By the way, I will also tell you that I am getting tired of this antienne which consists of systematically targeting the President of the Commission, in the name of his nationality, or the President of the Council, the current President of the Eurogroup, on behalf of his own. As it happens, the President of the Commission is Luxembourgish, the previous Presidency of the Council of the European Union was Luxembourgish, the President of the Eurogroup is Dutch and the current Presidency of the Council is Dutch. You will judge the result, and I would like to tell you that the work with the Luxembourg Presidency has been quite remarkable, since it has enabled us, in seven months, to conclude the directive on the automatic exchange of information on tax rulings. The work of the Dutch Presidency is equally remarkable. I hope to come back to you in June with a positive conclusion on the package of measures on the fight against tax evasion. I note a remarkable support from Jeroen Dijsselbloem. Finally, I can assure you - and I say this all the more to those who are kind enough to consider that I have done a voluntary job here - that I have the full support of President Juncker. I have never been left with — and I know I will never happen — being held back in what is not zeal, but simply a commitment. Today, I truly believe that the Commission and Parliament are taking another step - a new step - in the right direction. I have heard your comments, I think they are helpful, and we will take that into account. I know as you do that this fight is not over, and it will never be over, because every time, technology, legal, accounting and financial tricks will try to find circumventions or deviations, and this is humanity — not the newspaper Humanity - as it is. So there is work to be done me for five years, work for you for five years and work for my successor, my successors, the successors of your successors. We are engaged in a rather new approach, which we must welcome. We must continue it together and take decisive steps towards this revolution of transparency that I call for. Nothing is ever perfect, we would always like to know more and go further. It is true that we are entitled to ask the Member States to do their job, but at the same time we do not act as if we do not need them. We know what our rules are, what the Commission is proposing, that Parliament is a co-legislator and also that, without the Member States, we cannot do anything. That is why we must push them collectively in the right direction, but at the same time be able to greet them when they take a good step forward, which, I assure you, is happening. It is not always spontaneous, it is not always easy, they too listen to the opinion. However, I note that, of course, in tax matters, it is extremely difficult to move forward. I have talked about tax harmonization, I want it, and as a politician, I am in favour of it. I also know how complicated it is, simply because of the unanimity rule that is blocking. On the other hand, I note that when it comes to transparency texts - because there have been the LuxLeaks, the Panama Papers, because there is the European Parliament, a voluntary Commission - it is much better and much faster. It is customary to say that it takes about five or seven years for a directive on tax legislation to come to the end of its journey. On the tax rulings, it took seven months, on the Antitax Avoidance Package, I am hopeful that five months will suffice. So where it took seven years or five years, on these subjects, it takes five months, which is to say how fast and hard we work, and will continue to work fast and hard together. I invite all of you to contribute, as you obviously do, to ensuring that this debate is always at the forefront of our Union's political agenda, building on - it is true - this formidable citizen demand that turns to us. Europe is criticised, too criticised.

I am very happy to see this overwhelming unity in which we all share concern about the growing scale of tax evasion and tax avoidance across the globe. This is a very worrying phenomenon as it undermines national budgets, as it puts small and medium-sized enterprises in a disadvantaged position and of course undermines the fairness of the taxation systems in all our countries. I would like therefore to express my satisfaction that we all agree that this issue has to be tackled and that we all agree that taxes should be paid where the value is created. On several contentious points let me make a quick comment. On the threshold, I think Commission Muscovici has explained what is the rationale behind adopting this relatively high threshold. If we went for a lower threshold that would certainly cost us much more, with marginal revenues from that move diminishing, so that I think we have to be ambitious, but not perhaps ambitious to the point as to undermine the efficiency and effectiveness of the tax system. If we manage to collect more than 90% of taxes within this system with a threshold of 750, I think we should start with this; but of course, if we are able to start negotiations at the OECD level in order to lower this threshold, I would be all in favour of that.  And the same holds true for the publicity, for the transparency. I am also in favour of that, but simply, my point is that we would not like to adopt unilateral obligations because they would certainly undermine the competitive position of our EU companies. If we can find a system that would not undermine the competitiveness of the European Union, I again would be very much in favour of more publicity and more transparency. One last point is on the role of the Council. I have to say that I regret that the Council has taken its decision before Parliament actually prepared its opinion. This is against the rules. Although the decision is up to the Council, the Council should take a decision at the end of the whole procedure after the Parliament has expressed its opinion. I think in future we will not have this kind of unfortunate practice.

It is ironic that this negotiation is being made under the Dutch PRESIDENCY of the EU, and the Netherlands is one of the most important tax havens in existence, as demonstrated by the starbucks scandals, among others. The European Commission proposes a country-by-country report – confidential – in which multinationals will provide tax administrations with information about their activity and their taxes. Confidentiality compromises the effectiveness of the measure and its deterrent effect.

Madam President, I would like to thank the president for her Commissioner! The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has once again addressed the growing inequality in Europe. It has been growing steadily for years and has never been so crass since 1961. That is not what I am saying, as the OECD says. This will not worry those, including those in this House, who are more equal than others. However, we should not only be alarmed, but we should be absolutely appalled. The richest 10 percent have 9.6 times higher incomes than the poorest 10 percent. The richest 10 percent of households own 50 percent of net wealth– the poorest 40 percent own just three percent. Downhill it wasn't just the poorest – it went downhill with the bottom 40 percent of the population! A quarter of people in Europe live at or below the OECD poverty line. This Europe is about to squande its credibility with a growing number of people – with all the political consequences that are already visible.  But not only that: growing inequality is hurting everyone. It is not only the social and political problems that are increasing, but also the economic problems. This is detrimental to inclusive and sustainable economic growth. There is a growing consensus in international organisations: the increase in income inequality and wealth inequality must be addressed. The OECD concludes: \"The challenge is therefore to find appropriate packages of measures that are both growth-friendly and contribute to reducing inequality.\"  This, ladies and gentlemen, requires a holistic approach, including social and macroeconomic measures. After all, the effects of asymmetric crisis shocks ultimately affect all countries. The proposals to combat this problem are manifold – they have not yet been addressed. It is proposed to improve the quality of social policy instruments such as unemployment insurance. It is proposed to increase minimum wages, not only at country level, but also to create a level at European level. It is proposed to create better social benefits – for example, for the social situation of single parents. And there has long been a proposal to create more work from which one can live on one's own poverty-free basis, instead of creating more and more precarious working conditions. The Commission seems to have understood that the proposal now before us for a pillar of social rights is to be welcomed. But I say that beautiful headings will not suffice.  The Committee on Employment asks: firstly, does the Commission consider that its Work Programme 216, in which it describes inequality as a major challenge, adequately addresses the decline in growth resulting from increasing inequalities among EU citizens and sees the need to promote upward social convergence?  Secondly, if so, can the Commission explain the relevant policy areas of the programme in more detail? Thirdly, what measures and specific strategies will it propose in its next work programme to promote inclusive and sustainable economic growth by reducing inequalities and improving upward social convergence?  I firmly believe that Europe needs a social state constitution. We need a Europe with social justice, with good work, from which one can live independently and poverty-free, good education for all, more public services of general interest and an economically and ecologically sustainable economy. An anti-social Europe, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, is doomed to failure – with devastating consequences. A social Europe, on the other hand, will be good for everyone – people and the economy.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "GUE/NGL", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1126, "date": "2016-05-11.json", "name": "Vytenis Povilas Andriukaitis", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, at the very heart of the Commission’s work programme for 2016 we focus on two mutually reinforcing priorities: more job-related growth and enhanced social convergence. For the return to robust and sustainable growth, we have proposed action on two fronts: firstly, investment in Europe’s sources of jobs and growth, and secondly, the completion of the European economic and monetary union to create the conditions for lasting recovery.  President Juncker’s EUR 315 billion investment plan will reach its stride in 2016 and then, combined with European Union funding instruments, it will deliver to citizens in almost all walks of life. This will accrue in parallel with an upgrade in the investment climate, thanks to the digital single market, the single market strategy, the energy union and the capital market union. Moreover, central to the Five Presidents’ Report on completing the European monetary union is the idea that fair, well-functioning labour markets and welfare systems are vital to the success of the European monetary union and are part of a broader convergence process towards more resilient economic structures within the euro area. To this end, the Commission is delivering on upward social convergence through the European pillar of social rights, as well as a number of targeted initiatives outlined in the Commission work programme for 2016. The aim of the pillar is to foster convergence by setting up a number of essential principles to support well-functioning labour markets and social protection systems within the euro area, thereby contributing to efforts to achieve for Europe a social triple—A rating. The pillar will build on and compliment the acquis in order to guide policies in a number of fields. The pillar should become a reference framework to screen employment and the social performance of participating Member States and to drive for reforms at national level.  The Commission put forward a first preliminary outline of the European pillar of social rights on 8 March. Public consultation is open until 31 December. The results will inform the final proposal to represent it early in 2017. Between now and the end of the year, the Commission is actively engaging with other institutions, national authorities and all kinds of stakeholder at EU and national levels to discuss and get their opinion on the pillar. Social partners have been invited to play an active role in shaping the pillar. In line with the principle of subsidiarity, Member States are primarily competent for their employment and social policy. Action at EU level is needed in order to promote greater social progress and cohesion and to conceive social policy as a productive factor which reduces inequality, maximizes job creation and allows Europe’s human capital to thrive.  Indeed, we need to screen whether the European social model is still fit for purpose. We are confronted with long—term challenges like globalisation, an ageing society and changing work patterns. We are also still confronted with the aftermath of the crisis and the great divergence in employment and social outcomes between euro zone countries and a divergence which is a threat to its long—term sustainability. In order to achieve upward social convergence, these challenges need to be confronted and met head—on. The Commission work programme for 2016 contains concrete initiatives to address inequalities. The forthcoming skills agenda will focus on skills as an innovator to employability, as well as creating the right environment to allow skills to drive competitiveness and fair and balanced growth. Moreover, it will set out actions for a reinforced engagement with businesses and for a shared commitment to deliver a skills rich Europe. The Commission’s proposal to revise the posting of workers directive aims to ensure equal remuneration between posted workers and national workers. The preparation of the fresh start to the work/life balance will aim to fight inequality between men and women on the labour market, equipping the European Union with a legal and policy framework to allow parents and carers to better and more fairly balance their work and carry out their responsibilities.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1127, "date": "2016-05-11.json", "name": "David CASA", "mepid": "28122", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Madam President, Europe is once again facing huge societal challenges.

Madam President, I would like to begin by thanking Theresa May for Now we are standing here again and have to say that the gaps in europe are widening both between countries and between people. Last year, unemployment in the Member States ranged from around 5% to more than 25%. The fact that the increase in unemployment is often met with unilateral austerity and welfare cuts has further aggravated the situation. Jobs have also become more precarious and temporary. High unemployment and deteriorating social conditions also erode faith in the ability of politics to change society. Extremism is growing and it is worrying. More people must therefore have the chance to enter the labour market. More people need to get the chance to get an education. And equal pay for equal work is a given. In fact, it is already a treaty-entrenched right, and should be something that was already in place. Here, the Commission, and not least President Juncker, is now being challenged by yellow cards for further work on the Posting of Workers Directive. Of course, this must not delay or change the work on this core directive. This means so much to everything else we talk about. It is crucial if we are to recover a labour market that works, and thus reduce disparities. At the same time, the European Youth Guarantee must be given more muscle. Women must be given living conditions that allow them to be in the labour market just like everyone else. And, we need to strengthen – not cut back on – welfare. The economic crisis has shown that countries where the social partners, and wage formation, were attacked during the economic crisis have more difficulty than everyone else to get out of it.

That's a classic. And besides, we went into a vicious circle. Why? Because it negatively affects economic growth, then there will be more unemployment, then there will be more financing problems, more pension costs, etc.; then there's going to be less growth. That has to stop it now, because we've gone too far. But you have to look at it from the point of view of economic policy. Both the OECD and the International Monetary Fund have said this: it is already going too far. And here comes the crun of the matter. Look, indispensable social policies serve to alleviate: to alleviate poverty, to alleviate unemployment, and so on. They don't solve structural problems. Structural problems must be solved with appropriate economic policies, fiscal policy—fundamental, fundamental—, redistributive policy, income policy, investment policy—essential—, sectoral policies... Those are the ones that are going to break an unequal economic dynamic. And that's measured, measured, Commissioner. These are the Palma indices, the Gini indices. I'm talking about very basic economics.

Madam President, we will not reduce inequality if we do not invent a new type of development, if we do not loosen the stranglehold of austerity by increasing labour pay and small and medium-sized pensions and if we do not get out of the precariousness of work. Even with a level of wealth produced equivalent to what existed before the 2008 financial shock, the population is now living worse, inequality is growing, there are more people and working poor. We must therefore move away from current logics and create the conditions for a new distribution of wealth and a new way of producing it.

They are not only a national problem– they can have very negative effects on economic growth and the competitiveness of the European Union as a whole. I would like to call on the European Commission in particular to include appropriate instruments in the 2017 work programme to improve the socio-economic situation in Europe. Action to reduce inequalities should consist of a number of policies. Today I would like to focus on three key points, in my opinion. Increasing social and economic inequalities are very often at the root of the family. Poverty, unemployment, lack of adequate education are passed on from generation to generation. Our focus should therefore be on supporting families in a responsible and sustainable way. The key is professional activation, the creation of flexible forms of employment combined with adequate social security, as well as quality childcare facilities. Ordinary transfers of money will not have the desired effect, on the contrary, they can push women out of the labour market for a long time, for example. Another very important issue is education from an early age based on innovative teaching methods adapted to today's modern realities. The priority should be to create a level playing field at the very start. We can achieve this by developing pre-school and early childhood care, and by giving all children, regardless of social status, access to education as early as possible. The last thing I would like to draw attention to is social investment. I am convinced that Europe needs a new, more innovative and bold thinking today.

That economic outlook no longer focuses on reform, but this time the Commission expresses its concerns about growing inequality in Europe.  Better half-turned than completely lost. I fully endorse this analysis. A more equal society is not only fairer. It is also a proven recipe for economic growth. It was also the reason for the OECD to ring the bell and call on countries to take action. The Commissioner just said that our social model is 'fit for purpose'. But if so, we would not be dealing with growing unemployment and growing inequality. In recent years, the European Commission has been unequal in its interest in the unequal results of the compelling advice to the Member States to cut back on the welfare state. Austerity that has hit the weakest hard and pushed up inequality in many countries.  That is why I am very curious to see the consequences of the Commissioner's own new insights. Are the policy recommendations to the Member States now taking a different direction? Will there be a policy that combats inequality rather than strengthens it? And secondly, will there also be a more important role for trade unions? After all, labour incomes have been falling for years. The workers get an ever smaller part of the pie.

I conclude by quoting another Nobel laureate, Joseph Stiglitz, who says that \"what Europe needs, rather than structural reforms in its member countries, is a reform of the structure of the eurozone itself and a reversal of austerity policies that have failed time and time again in their attempt to re-ignite economic growth.\"", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "GUE/NGL", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1136, "date": "2016-05-11.json", "name": "Claude ROLIN", "mepid": "125107", "text": "   Madam President, the latest OECD report shows how bad inequality is for people but also for economic growth.

Inequality also weakens our democracy and the European project, which, as a reminder, aims in particular to bring together the economies of the different States and also to bring about a harmonisation of social conditions.  Inequality must be denounced, but it is even more important to have concrete policies that will reduce them. In this regard, I would like to emphasize four elements. The first is jobs, the creation of sustainable and decent jobs, sustainable jobs. This is the first element to reduce inequality and, in this sense, I support the Commission's investment plan initiative. The second is to ensure professional transitions in a constantly changing economy. The third is to combat all forms of exclusion, in particular school exclusion.

Inequalities produce individual tragedies and also threaten the very essence and future of the European project, as well as being a real obstacle to growth and economic progress.  As the OECD study shows, today the richest 10 % of the population earns 9.5 times more than the poorest 10 %, reaching a peak compared to the last thirty years.

However, the root cause of inequalities is the very unequal distribution of wealth generated. so in Germany, where unemployment is only 4.5%, according to deutsche welle's tv show the day before in that country, Germany, there are currently the greatest social inequalities in the European Union, since 10% of the richest part of the population has twice as much wealth as 40% of the poorest part of the population.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1143, "date": "2016-05-11.json", "name": "Vytenis Povilas Andriukaitis", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, of course the crisis has led to unprecedented divergences among Member States, with higher unemployment and increasing inequality having disrupted social cohesion in many of them. Unbalanced growth in some countries before the crisis often went hand-in-hand with lower productivity, a decline in competitiveness and too little investment in human capital. While there are some signs that divergences between Member States are starting to decline, this remains an issue of concern for us. Inequality hampers growth and undermines political and social stability and progress, and it undermines one of the European Union’s raisons d’être, namely fostering economic convergence and improving the life of all European citizens. Of course I agree with you when you mention all the questions about income policies and about how to address inequalities. But, as you know, speaking about the income policies, speaking about the minimum income for example, the EU has no competence to adopt legislative measures setting requirements on minimum income at EU level. As minimum income schemes aim to combat poverty and social exclusion, they fall within the remit of Article 153 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union: the legal basis for the adoption of measures in the field is therefore Article 153.2 and it lies in the hands of the Member States. Nevertheless, the Commission has been providing policy guidance to the Member States to help them to develop adequate levels of minimum income, notably through the 2008 Commission communication on active inclusion, the 2013 Social Investment Package and various country specific recommendations within the European Semester. The Commission has also been funding the establishment of the European Minimum Income Network and is elaborating a methodology to develop across nationally comparable reference budgets in Member States. This will serve as means of helping both Member States, to design efficient and adequate income support, and the Commission, to monitor the adequacy of income support at Union level. Of course we must strive for upward convergence in employment and social policies. That means ensuring that no-one is left behind: that people’s quality of life is improved as the European economies strengthen. Since its first day in office, a key goal of this Commission has been to create a Europe worthy of a social triple-A rating. This requires fair and balanced growth leading to the creation of decent quality jobs, as well as equal chances for success and the protection of all throughout their life cycle. We have already put fairness at the core of our agenda. The Commission work programme 2016 made it clear that tackling inequalities in the Union requires a focus on two mutual reinforcing priorities: more job-rich growth and enhanced social convergence. This is not only our mission as a European Commission. It is a joint responsibility to achieve results in addressing inequalities. We need to activate the support of Member States, the social partners, and all the stakeholders. It is important that our citizens see that Europe is working for them.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Andriukaitis, today's debate allows us to debate an issue that is very important to our citizens. On behalf of the ENVI Committee, whose position I represent here, I would like to stress the need for compulsory indication of the country of origin or place of origin for certain foods. As a result of certain food scandals in Europe, there is an urgent need to guarantee clear information to consumers and greater transparency and accountability in the agri-food chain, and as direct representatives of the citizens we are the spokesman for these demands through this resolution. Specifically, the measure covers meat other than beef, pigmeat, sheepmeat, goatmeat and poultrymeat, processed meat, milk, milk used as an ingredient in milk products, un processed foods, single-ingredient products and ingredients representing more than 50 % of a food stuff. As a Eurobarometer survey shows, in 2013 around 90 % of EU citizens consider it necessary to indicate the origin of these foods, and it is clear from this that this is one of the factors likely to influence consumer behaviour. The ENVI Committee therefore believes that the obligation to indicate where it comes from on the label is essential to ensure transparency and traceability and to reassure European consumers who are asking for the indication of origin and to regain their confidence. On 20 May 2015, the European Commission published a report on the mandatory indication of the country of origin or place of origin, accompanied by a study on milk and other meat, according to which the costs of compulsory origin labelling for milk used as an ingredient in dairy products increase as the production process becomes more complex. The ENVI Committee considers that these costs are overestimated and that the European Commission's own study suggests that some Member States have overcalculated the impact of compulsory origin labelling on their competitive position, as there has been no clear explanation for the high expenditure forecasts they have provided. The report put to the vote tomorrow therefore calls for the establishment of a European Commission working group to further assess the report and its impact in order to determine whether these costs can be reduced to a level acceptable to businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises. The ENVI Committee also stresses that the overall willingness of consumers to pay for source information is relevant. Indeed, many consumer studies on WTP show that they are largely prepared to pay more for information on the origin of the products they buy, even though the European Commission has told us on this point that it considers this availability to be rather modest. Before I begin to conclude, I would like to reiterate that the ENVI Committee confirms that it is asking Parliament to support compulsory indication of the country of origin or place of origin and calls on the Commission to implement it accordingly by drawing up legislative proposals in the areas mentioned. It also calls on it to present legislative proposals making it compulsory to indicate the origin of meat in processed foods, in order to ensure greater transparency throughout the food chain and to better inform European consumers in the wake of the meat scandal and other cases of fraud. Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that it is our duty to give our European consumers complete and clear information about the origin of many of the food products that are part of our diet. It is a question of sharing the goodness of a general principle which will enable us to establish a system that allows conscious and transparent purchases. In conclusion, I call on the Commission to give us its point of view and I strongly urge that the political will of this Parliament be respected, if supported by the majority of Members, through the preparation of certain sectoral legislative proposals, which we are obviously prepared to deal with and analyse on a case-by-case basis and which will have to take account of the transparency and legibility of information for consumers. , while at the same time allowing European companies to operate in an economically viable manner.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1147, "date": "2016-05-11.json", "name": "Vytenis Povilas Andriukaitis", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, consumer sensitivity to the origin of the foods they eat has certainly grown over recent years. Consequently, origin has become of increasing relevance for businesses and also policymakers. As a result of this, the Union legislators required the Commission to assess the possibility of introducing mandatory origin labelling for certain food categories. In this context, the Commission has so far adopted three reports on meat used as an ingredient, on dairy products and certain meats, and on unprocessed foods, single-ingredient products and ingredients that represent more than 50% of a food. Turning to the oral question, on the first point inviting the Commission to present the findings of these reports to Parliament, I would like to remind you that the Commission has presented the reports in question to Parliament twice: to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on 16 July 2015, and to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety on 15 September 2015.  As regards the second point, the Commission report on meat used as an ingredient concludes that mandatory origin labelling does not appear in this case to be the most appropriate way forward at European Union level, taking into account first, limited consumer willingness to pay for such information, the administrative burden linked to the setting up of additional traceability systems and more generally , the impact that this may have, including on European Union competitiveness and trade.  Consequently, the Commission is not considering any legislative follow-up on the matter. This position has been communicated to Parliament in response to the European Parliament resolution of 11 February 2015 on country of origin labelling for meat in processed food.  The honourable Member’s third point calls for the Commission to define, I quote, ‘lightly processed foods and to look at the possibility to limit the scope of mandatory origin indication to that category of foods’. Here I should point out that it would be difficult to establish criteria to define what is ‘lightly processed’. It would be in practice a challenge to ensure legal certainty and clarity in order to be able to implement and enforce rules based on such a notion.  Such an approach could also have the unintended consequence of leading to price increases for lightly processed foods and consequently of directing consumers towards heavily processed foods. Therefore, the Commission is still of the opinion that voluntary origin labelling appears to be the most suitable solution, offering the possibility for consumers to select foods with a certain origin if they so wish, without imposing additional burdens and costs on all food business operators and authorities. We should also keep in mind that, as a general rule, origin labelling becomes mandatory when its omission may mislead consumers. The Regulation also reinforces the rules on voluntary origin labelling. When the origin of a product is given and the origin of its primary ingredient is different, this difference will have to be indicated on the label. Modalities for applying this rule still need to be fixed, but we are working on them. Finally, the Commission would like to recall that the Regulation provides a possibility for Member States to require mandatory origin labelling for specific categories of foods if this is duly justified. Two notifications on this matter are currently being assessed by the Commission.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1148, "date": "2016-05-11.json", "name": "Renate SOMMER", "mepid": "4282", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Madam President, I would like to thank the president for her We have just heard that the Commission has established that mandatory origin labelling for milk, milk and meat products, other meats, etc. would lead to price increases. And she has found that the consumer is not really interested in this. For him, price, taste and durability take precedence. But a majority in this House is ignoring this reality for purely populist and protectionist reasons. Some Member States want to close their market and the consumer is then suggested that national products are better and that they want to help them. Both are not true.

In the end, the additional costs are not paid by the consumer, which is paid by agriculture. After all, the food chains will put even more pressure on agriculture. Isn't our dairy farmers already doing badly? If you go to the factories, also to the processing, then you will see that sausage is not an \"easily processed\" product, and you may understand why one cannot define \"lightly processed\" so easily. Fresh milk must also be transported, stored and processed. In the case of compulsory origin marking, dairies need separate tankers, refrigerated tanks, processing machines and packaging for each origin. Can SMEs do that? The fact is that anyone who wants to buy nationally or regionally has been able to do so for a long time. There are products with voluntary indications everywhere, and every butcher knows where the meat he sells comes from. It's just a little more expensive than in the supermarket.

In 2011 when we dealt with the food information regulation Parliament voted for mandatory country of origin labelling for meat and dairy products. Last year this Parliament adopted a resolution calling for the mandatory country of origin labelling for all meat in processed food. Yet still the Commission says that voluntary labelling is enough. Well, it clearly is not enough because we know that consumers want this labelling. 84% of consumers support origin labelling for milk and 90% would like to see this labelling for meat in processed food. It is also supported by farmers and consumer organisations across Europe and actually the cost is really quite minimal.  At least Member States are now waking up to this demand, with France bringing in legislation for origin labelling for milk and for meat in processed food. Italy and Portugal are also considering similar legislation. So it seems as if everyone wants this labelling except for the Commission.  This is about clear, honest labelling which does not mislead consumers. It would allow consumers to make informed decisions about the food they buy for a variety of reasons: environmental, animal welfare and, yes, to support their local farmers if that is what they want to do. It should be their choice. It would also be positive for the food industry and would help restore consumer confidence, which has been very badly damaged in recent times.

Origin labelling indicates the origin but does not increase the quality, does not increase traceability, does not prevent fraud.

Just over a year ago we passed a resolution which urged the Commission, once again, to come forward with legislative proposals to make such labelling mandatory for meat in processed foods and, perhaps unsurprisingly given that we seem to be dealing with a Commission which is reluctant to legislate on anything at the moment, we have heard very little since then on potential proposals. So while not giving up on this resolution, in the interests of working with the Commission we came up with a proposal where, Commissioner, you could at least act on the lower hanging fruit so that you can demonstrate your willingness to stop sitting on your hands. But now, having listened to you today, I think that you have actually made the argument and the case for full origin labelling for meat in processed foods.  Consumer confidence in our food supply was naturally incredibly damaged by the horse meat scandal, and not just by the scale of the food fraud, but by the complexity and the length of the food chains revealed.

In this respect, we see a real paradox: the opacity of the situation on labelling and the lack of transparency create mechanisms of unfair competition that violate the rules of the free market, to which the opponents of origin indication on the label then appeal to highlight negative aspects of the indication of origin. A genuinely free market feeds on transparency, does not hinder but rewards production with high standards of food safety; a genuinely transparent market does not encourage competition in the dark, made up of imports of cheap agri-food products and dubious quality and origin.  The Commission's reports show that the costs of ensuring transparency in the food supply chain may be too high and that consumers, while interested in this information, would not be prepared to support it. Well, these reports are incomplete and do not take sufficient account of the positive aspects of product origin marking, such as increased consumer confidence in the products they consume and greater awareness of choice.

First and foremost, with 40% of all renewable electricity generation, hydropower is Europe’s largest renewable energy resource. Hydropower will continue to play a key role within the European Energy Union as it will contribute to the delivery of the three priority objectives of security, sustainability and competitiveness.  The Commission aims to give all electricity generators equal access to hydropower concessions. The granting of equal access will have a positive impact on investments, on local communities, thanks to higher fees paid by concession holders, on the integration of hydropower in the electricity market and ultimately, on consumers.  The Commission is well aware of the economic, legal, social and environmental aspects of hydropower generation. Member States remain, in principle, free to design their models for the exploitation of hydroelectric plants. We do not question the Member States’ competence to impose relevant obligations on hydropower operators when granting hydropower concessions. In this way, Member States can strike a balance between competition requirements and other legitimate interests. However, Member States must respect the relevant European Union law, for instance when a Member State decides to exploit those plants via concessions, European Union public procurement rules need to be respected. This ensures not only an adequate level of competition but also equal treatment and transparency among the economic operators. In this context, European Union public procurement rules are infringed when the initial duration of a hydroelectric concession is extended to the benefit of the incumbent concession holder without due justification.  The applicable European Union law may be different depending on the approach chosen, but that does not necessarily exclude the operation of hydropower generation from the scope of European Union law. Where applicable, national hydroelectric concession regimes should respect European Union energy rules, such as the Electricity Directive, as well. Indeed, competitive procedures for hydropower concessions and fair treatment of economic operators are important for a well-functioning energy market. Finally, when granting hydropower concessions, the EU Member States may be subject to EU competition rules, namely antitrust and state aid. A Member State that grants hydropower concessions to a dominant public company may infringe antitrust rules when this has anti-competitive consequences by creating unequal conditions of competition allowing the dominant public company to maintain or strengthen its dominant position on the relevant electricity market.  The granting of hydropower concessions may qualify as state aid if several conditions are met: if state resources are involved, a selective advantage has been granted to certain companies in the relevant electricity market and there is an effect on trade and a distortion of competition. First, state resources have to be involved, for example, in the form of state revenues or fees that could be foregone. Second, a selective advantage has to be granted to certain companies over their competitors in the relevant electricity market. Third, there must an effect on trade and a distortion of competition, which is likely to be the case since electricity is sold across Member States on competitive markets.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1193, "date": "2016-05-11.json", "name": "Antonio TAJANI", "mepid": "2187", "text": "  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, i.e. the european Union, we must not Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, the hydroelectric sector is crucial to achieving the decarbonisation targets and completing the single energy market.

There are countries with endless concessions, others with the possibility of renewal and others that are liberalising their market. This actually prevents a real level playing field for operators; The result is a loss of competitiveness on the part of our businesses. It is therefore clear that we need to promote a uniform regulatory framework if we really want to create a level playing field in market access on the basis of open and fair competition.

We therefore ask you to play a more active role in this area, not just to worry about compliance with the rules of competition. In fact, the existence of too many different licensing systems in the hydroelectric sector is yet another proof that the time has come to change the rules of competition at European level. These rules must be designed and developed in the service and in the interests of businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, and not by pursuing abstract bureaucratic processes that end up putting employment and growth in Europe at risk, but also in the competitiveness of our production system in the world.  Therefore, Commissioner, I realise that you are not responsible for the sector, and I am well aware – as you have done so many times – that the Commissioners on duty in this House are not responsible, but I would ask you to take a proactive part in a stronger initiative on the part of the Commission, because only action to monitor compliance with the rules is not enough if we really want to support the hydroelectric sector.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE-DE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1194, "date": "2016-05-11.json", "name": "Patrizia TOIA", "mepid": "28340", "text": "  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall not dwell on the importance of this sector, on its economic value ( just think that its economic contribution is equal to Slovenia's GDP), because you have already mentioned this importance, Commissioner. However, I would like to tell you quite frankly that the things you have told us are absolutely abstract and do not correspond to the reality of this sector, the problems and the need for action.  As has been said, there are obstacles to be removed. The first is the diversity, in different countries, of the granting schemes and the whole procedure for the use of hydroelectric resources: this has a distorting effect and has a very unbalanced impact from a competitive point of view, on investment certainty and on the possibility of using this source.  The second obstacle is that the Commission has different and opposing approaches, direction by direction, not day-by-day, but direction by direction. The competition directorate does one thing, the environmental management does another, and several countries are threatened or initiated by totally different and random infringements. I will tell you more: if there is no coordinated approach, we will arrive at the current paradox: some countries, such as my own, are penalised, there is a start on infringement because not all liberalisation has been carried out very quickly; other countries, which have ninety-year regimes, with no time limit and no competitive procedures for concessions, have no appeal, nothing.  I say this, Commissioner, because I too would like to ask you to make a very specific speech – it will not be up to you, but it will be up to someone in the College – to have a uniform regulatory framework, without which there will be no real competition and real market - the things you have told us about - and also to have a different and comprehensive approach to infringements.

Hydropower has a particularly important role to play in how we live up to the Energy Union's targets, as 16% of the energy produced in 2013 in the EU comes precisely from hydropower. In 2006, it was only 10%. However, the eu's increasing energy needs cannot only be met by better regulating existing resources. We also need to look at how we can use unused hydro-energy resources. There is enormous potential in the Balkans for hydropower, for example in Bosnia, Serbia, Croatia and Albania. That potential is far from being fully exploited. In Bosnia, only 37% of that energy is estimated to be used today. In Albania it is 35%. So, Mr President, let me be clear and repeat: it is not only by linking and better regulating existing resources, but we must also look at our neighbourhood in order to achieve the objectives of the Energy Union. It is at the heart of European cooperation that we have founded over the last 70 years – that we are getting stronger by doing things together.

I am concerned about competition issues. Regulated payments to hydroelectric plants have far exceeded the cost of investment and there are a number of cases of abuse, such as delays in reserve assignments or the return of concessions to the public sector.  I would like a specific answer on this situation, because I am surprised that the Commission , so active in other areas – seems to ignore the harm to consumers by companies active in the sector. And not just when it comes to concessions or regulated costs. Fines in Spain, for example, for the tactical use of hydroelectric plants to manipulate the marginal price highlight the need to consider that electricity regulation in Spain is favouring large producers. That's what we've been denouncing.  I ask this from the conviction that hydropower plays a relevant role in the energy transition, especially because of its ability to adjust production against the increased intermittency of other renewables. That is why its activity must be well regulated and respond to the general interest. To this end, consideration should also be given to its environmental and landscape impact and its compatibility with ecosystem preservation and agricultural activity.

Mr President, water dams are a real heritage for every European country. They can certainly produce electricity, but not only: they have also shaped landscapes, altered valleys and altered river flows. The stakes are not only energy, they are also strategic and safe for the population basins that have adapted to the river route. In the case of the renewal of concessions, the question is not whether the operator should be public or private, since, in any case, it will pay the same royalties. Rather, the question is what added value a new dealership will bring and, most importantly, how dealers will work together to manage the common valleys. A great danger looms with the renewal of concessions and their competition. The fragmentation of concessions and the lack of a comprehensive approach could threaten the proper management of a resource that is as vital as it is dangerous. Accidents are rare but are preventable, provided that dam activity is well coordinated, upstream and downstream, through a consolidation of dams in the same concession.

With 380 terawatts of hydroelectric power installed in the European Union, it is one of the most significant contributors to our energy mix. This equates to around EUR 24 billion per year of savings in fossil—fuel imports, and therefore 100 million tons of carbon emissions avoided.  The EU is moving to deploy more renewable energy, not only in response to climate change, but also to lower our EUR 400 billion yearly bill for fossil fuel imports. Hydroelectricity is an ideal complement to the variability of renewables, as when the sun shines or the wind blows reservoir levels can be allowed to increase to prepare for a time when there is no wind or sunshine. Let us remember also, at a time when more and more resources go into developing effective energy storage, that hydropower is the only large—scale and cost—efficient energy storage technology available today. Hydroelectricity offers cost—effective flexibility and firm dispatchable storage. So what’s the outlook?

In Europe – and the Commission must be aware of this – there are many ways of allocating hydroelectric concessions: there are countries that do not compete, as some of my fellow Members have said, there are countries that compete, but as a result of these competitions the concession then extends unreservedly, therefore without being replaced by other tenders. And then there are also countries where competitions are held regularly, so, at the end of the concession period, there is a subsequent competition.  In these countries there is a legal and economic problem which, it seems, the Commission has not considered properly, because if the depreciation of investments lasts longer than the concession, it is normal that at the end of the concession there should be a residual depreciation. Therefore, whoever wins the race will have to pay the remaining depreciation to the previous concessionaire. It is a very simple economic and legal concept. Well, the Commission has not understood this and has therefore intervened by punishing the countries that apply this rule, which is a rule of transparency and competition.  So, in my opinion, it is right to support those who make investments, but it is also right to support those who, through free competition, decide to guarantee investors the normal market rules.

The EU is more or less well on track to meet its 2020 targets, with a 16% share of total energy use. However, there are some Member States which, unfortunately, are not paying enough attention to the energy of the future. This includes Poland, which is re-dusting coal plants, or The Paks Nuclear Power Plant Expansion, which has opted for the expansion of the Paks nuclear power plant Hungary.  Renewable energy production in Hungary has not developed since 2010, despite the fact that, after Iceland, it has by far the best capacity in Europe in terms of geothermal energy, for example. In Hungary, the use of geothermal potential is only 6%, despite the fact that it would be suitable for generating electricity equivalent to four paks nuclear power plant blocks.
