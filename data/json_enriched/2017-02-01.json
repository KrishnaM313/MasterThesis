Unfortunately, we are now seeing in Romania that criminal law will be suspended tonight with government decree orders.

I would also like to underline one element. I fully agree with what my friends, Ms Fotyga and Ms Corazza Bildt, raised. In the Foreign Affairs Council on Monday, the situation in Ukraine will be on the agenda with the Foreign Ministers, and that will also give us an opportunity to restate our full support for the country and for the full implementation of the Minsk Agreement.  Turning to the issue on our agenda today, I would start by saying that Europe and the United States of America are tied by an old and deep friendship. Personally I have always looked – and I still look – at the United States with great respect and admiration, as a land where everyone can succeed whatever their social, ethnic or cultural background. It is a land of opportunities, a land of hope and dreams, a country that has always been great precisely because it has always been open and has always been a champion of freedoms. As a good friend of the United States, I believe Europe has a duty to be clear – respectful and clear – whenever disagreement arises, especially when it relates to our fundamental values. We certainly disagree with the executive order issued by the President of the United States on 27 January as, it seems, do many in the US too. As you know, the executive order introduces a temporary suspension, for a period of 90 days, of the entry into the USA of foreign nationals from seven countries: Iraq, Syria, Sudan, Iran, Somalia, Libya and Yemen. A temporary suspension is also foreseen, for a period of 120 days, of the US refugee admissions programme, in principle so that no new refugee application can be accepted until the US Secretary of State, in conjunction with the Secretary of Homeland Security, reviews the current application process.  There have been questions about which citizens are affected by the travel ban. I would like to tackle this issue immediately and then focus on what to me is even more important. The US Department of State clarified yesterday that European Union citizens will not be affected by the ban, even if they hold dual citizenship in one of the seven countries listed in the executive order. We welcome this clarification, but let me be absolutely clear that this does not change our overall assessment of the executive order.  (Applause) I have already made clear in recent days where the European Union stands on this. No—one – no—one – can be deprived of his or her own rights because of their place of birth, their religion or their ethnicity. This is written in our constitutions, both in Europe and in America. This is who we are, this is our identity, and this is something we cannot forget. Our European history has taught us to celebrate when a wall is torn down and a bridge is built. We learned from our own great, but also tragic, history that every human being is, first and foremost, a person with fundamental rights that cannot be put into question. Let me add, from a personal point of view, that I found it really sad to learn that this executive order was issued on 27 January, Holocaust Remembrance Day, that is first and foremost a day to commemorate millions of Jews killed by Nazis, but also to reject any discrimination and to reflect on our duty to host those who flee from persecution and protect them and their rights.  (Applause) Many of them – most of them actually – are fleeing from terrorist groups such as Daesh. They are victims of terrorism and, beyond being refugees, they are men, women and children with personal stories, dreams, fears and profound wounds. Most of all, they have a future to build, also for the sake of their own countries and our own security, because the social reconstruction of their countries depends on them. So let me – actually, I should say let us – be very clear. The European Union will not turn back anyone who has the right to international protection. This is where we stand. This is where we continue to stand. It would not be moral, it would not be just, it would not be legal, and it would not be in our interest, because this kind of measure has the potential to increase tensions and mistrust among peoples and nations. When I say among people, I also mean among people in our own societies. I am worried by the trends we are seeing inside American society at the moment, and that is why, with a lot of respect, I invited the President of the United States to pay attention to what is happening in his own country. Only respect and cooperation can make us more secure. Only respect and cooperation can help us manage the many crises around the word. This is the European way. We work together with the countries experiencing a crisis and with their neighbours – all of them. A travel ban can maybe – maybe – give a temporary illusion of addressing the issue, but it can only create more frustration and anger. We need cooperation, not closures. We need to engage and to build common ground, not to ban. The EU will continue to be a partner and a strong point of reference for all countries in the region, regardless of the religion of their citizens. They can count on us. We will continue to be a partner and a strong point of reference for all those in the world who believe in international cooperation, human rights and the rule of law. This is also why the European Union is the biggest donor in the world to the Syrian people and their neighbouring countries, with more than EUR 9 billion invested since the start of the fighting in Syria. So far, the European Union and the US have worked closely together, including at the UN Summit on Refugees in New York, because a global issue requires global common work. Bold commitments were made, both to protect the human rights of all refugees and migrants, and to counter hate speech against refugees and migrants. The EU is always ready to engage with the new US Administration to follow up on these commitments, as well as on the many other achievements we have managed to build together in recent years, and which are today key fundamental elements of our European Union policy – from climate change to the Iran deal, from the Middle East peace process to our support for the UN system and a free and fair trade system. On the basis of this very clear international agenda, we will work with the US administration as partners with full reciprocal respect. This is the European Union way. These are our principles, our values and our interests. I believe we have a responsibility, both towards our citizens and our partners in the region and beyond, in the world, to be true to our values and identity, and show leadership and strength.

Today we have the subject of entry regulations, but we all know and feel that there is more to it. We support the position that Federica Mogherini presented today on behalf of the Commission, but as I said, there is more to it. Trump is elected, he's in office. We respect that, it was a democratic decision. And we as the EPP want to work together, we just want to talk to each other - everyone has their own responsibility - to build bridges with one another. This respect for the election result has to be expressed first. We as the EPP also want differentiation. For example, when Donald Trump says he's fighting illegal migration, he has us by his side as the EPP. If he says he is fighting Islamist terrorism, then he has us as the EPP by his side. And we are also pleased that after the conversation with Theresa May and also after the phone calls with Angela Merkel, there is now a clear commitment to NATO. Thanks for that! But unfortunately the positive is not that which predominates when we look at the statements of Donald Trump in the last few weeks and at the activities of the last few days. America is actually the land of freedom, the USA is actually the land of immigrants. This is the image that I've had in my head since a young age. General suspicion for individual states, general suspicion for individual religious communities: This does not lead to friendship and the reduction of hatred, it leads to new hatred. The Canadian assassin who murdered Muslims in Ottawa made explicit reference to Trump. For me, the USA has always been the country of the free market, the free market economy. Now we are seeing an American president who wants to break off all trade, end the TTIP talks, tear up the transpacific agreement. As Europeans, we want trade, we want partnership in fair world trade, which is why we will also vote for CETA in February and thus send a clear signal. We also support Commissioner Malmström in all efforts to get in touch with Mexico, Canada, Japan and others and to strengthen trade. We want this deal. For me, the USA has always been - to give a third example - the land of fundamental rights, of human rights, for which people have fought for, for which people have died. And Trump is now standing up and saying that torture is effective and that he is giving his authorities a free hand to do it. When a state uses torture, that state becomes a criminal itself. And that's why it mustn't come to that. It has already been indicated today that a new US ambassador may come. We already have a US ambassador sitting here with Nigel Farage, but another is coming who sees the euro at the end, who sees the start of Brexit as the beginning. And that is the great new independence of Great Britain that you now have to go to Washington instead of Brussels and have everything approved. But I would also like to say on behalf of the EPP Group: if we had to welcome an ambassador from America here who questions the euro and who wants the end of the European Union, then he cannot be accredited by the European institutions. We cannot work with such a partner. Putin is expanding his sphere of power, he is betting on war to assert his interests, and he wants a weak Europe. Donald Trump has the economy, \"America First\" in mind. He sees that Europe and China are the two major economic rivals America can meet on an equal footing. He too wants a weak Europe, a divided Europe, a divided Europe. That is why the next few weeks, months and years will be about fundamental questions, namely whether we stand together or not. When we get to the story of the United States and also of the history of the United Kingdom, names like Roosevelt and Churchill come to mind. These were politicians who fought side by side for freedom and against totalitarianism and national egoism, who did not look at national egoism first, but fought for values. Reagan and Thatcher jointly brought communism to its knees with the NATO double resolution, they did not initially look egotistically at what is right for the country, but rather what is right for the world. Both couples that I have just described fought for freedom in this world. I would like today's leaders to do too. Unfortunately, Donald Trump and Theresa May stand for national egoism and no longer for carrying on the flame of freedom in this world. The world is fundamentally changing, and that is why I and my group ask that Valletta send out a clear, strong signal on Friday, which Donald Tusk laid the groundwork for in his letter. Le Pen says the EU is a protectorate of the US and I believe that Valletta can show that this is not the case, that Europe is united and strongly committed to what we call our values.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 34, "date": "2017-02-01.json", "name": "Gianni PITTELLA", "mepid": "4436", "text": "on behalf of the S & amp; D Group. - Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, some, let's face it, thought that Trump was going to be a joke, almost a joke, and instead he is turning out to be a nightmare. Let us not underestimate, what we have underestimated in history, some personalities who have turned into dictators and sowed wars and blood. As Federica Mogherini rightly said, friendship with the American people is beyond question. For us it is essential, fruitful, it remains a fixed point of our feelings and our actions, just as the admiration for the United States of America remains strong, for what they have been in history and for what they are. But for this very reason it becomes painful to take note of these proposals, of these measures that Trump is carrying out, which are an attack on European legal civilization, on fundamental values. Let's say it as it is, Hon. Weber: the travel ban, aimed at citizens only of some Muslim countries, has nothing to do with border management and the fight against terrorism. It is a demagogic lie. There is a ban for some and not for others, with whom Trump does business. Let's face it, because citizens need clear words. It is an attack on the right to asylum and the rule of law, it is an attack that comes along with other things, like the wall with Mexico. International relations are lost, relations with Mexico, with Latin America, the whole world is infected with this virus of instability, of perturbation. I say to the airlines: do not indulge it, do not refuse the boarding for the United States of passengers from the nations targeted by Trump. Jo Leinen is right, and Manfred Weber is right here too, when he says: if that ambassador were appointed he would not be welcome, because I can't like someone who says, even before being appointed, \"I'm going there to destroy the Union European \". And I tell the Mrs May and the United Kingdom Government: do not lend, Mrs May, and do not lend the United Kingdom government to play the role of Trojan horse to destroy the European Union.I also say that it would be good for the Member States (they are free to do so) to call their ambassadors and consult on what is going on in the United States.It would also be a symbolic act.And it would also be good if, on European soil, until this trend stops, Trump is not invited.I've finished.I too am, like Vice President Mogherini, for cooperation, but until Trump changes this line, the door of Europe can only be barred from him.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 35, "date": "2017-02-01.json", "name": "Syed KAMALL", "mepid": "33569", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Group. – Mr President, according to a study by the Cato Institute – a well-respected and classically liberal US think-tank – no American has been killed since 1975 on US soil by a national from any of the seven countries listed in President Trump’s executive order. So those of us who believe that law should be fair, that there should be equality under the law, that the primary functions of law should be enforcement of contracts and social order, will rightly be concerned by this arbitrary ban, which affects not only Muslims, but also affects Christians fleeing persecution and war. Sending a message that there is some inherent contradiction between being a good Muslim and being a good citizen of a Western democracy, simply plays into the arms of Daesh and other extremists who make exactly the same claim.  (Applause from certain quarters) It plays into their arms because they make exactly the same claim when they are recruiting disillusioned and disconnected young Muslim men and women as terrorists. But whatever we in this Chamber may think, the fact is that Americans voted for a candidate who said what he thought, and now they find that they have a President who does what he promised to do. We must accept that this President, his priorities and these policies are the consequence of a growing tide of discontent to be found not only in middle America, but also in many of our countries. Electorates have lost faith in mainstream politicians on both sides of the Atlantic; electorates that have lost trust in politicians’ ability to listen and act upon their legitimate concerns; electorates attracted by simplistic solutions offered by politicians on the edges of the political spectrum. While we express our concerns over President Trump’s executive orders, we must also realise that as long as the gains from globalisation are seen only in the portfolios of company directors and not in the pay packets of workers, as long as our migration and asylum policies are seen as more about compassion, diversity and political correctness, and less about ensuring integration, we will find politicians pursuing similar policies and making electoral gains in France, the Netherlands and elsewhere in the EU. So every time a mainstream politician dismisses those who disagree with the current direction of political travel in Europe and America, every time you dismiss them as racist or populist, this simply demonstrates an inability to offer a credible alternative.  In the meantime, no matter how strongly we feel about the current policies of the US President, let us all ask ourselves: what is more effective? The hot heads of protest or the cool heads of diplomacy? And let us make it clear to our American allies that decisions of the new US Administration in these executive orders, which lacked the support of Congress, which are arbitrary, which have been purely planned without preparation for the consequences, will not make America great again. Moreover, they will not strengthen, but only weaken, our transatlantic relationship.

I do not understand something in your intervention, Mr Kamall. First of all you say, yes, it is not done, and then you say two phrases later that we have to accept it because he is elected. No, it is not because he is elected that he can go against human values and the values of the United States of America. Even an elected President with a majority – and he has no majority of the popular vote in the US – has to listen to the American Constitution, has to listen to the American judiciary. That is the starting point of my intervention.  In fact, some people are saying in the US that it helps security. That is nonsense. You have given the figures. Since 1975, all terrorists in the US came from three countries – Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Lebanon. None of them is on the list of seven countries and nobody came from those countries since 1975 as a terrorist. So it is pure discrimination, and pure discrimination in a broader approach, because it is not only about this religious ban. It is about fuelling populism and nationalism – that is what the Trump administration is doing for the moment, and that is not only by appointing Mr Farage as his spokesman here in the plenary, but it is also by having the idea to designate Malloch as the ambassador and, more importantly, and let’s be aware of this, Steve Bannon, a member now of the National Security Council of the United States of America and a man who is openly saying that we want a worldwide right-wing movement to get rid of the European Union, to get done with the European Union, and they are sitting here. It is our Fifth Column, because Mr Farage is working with Mr Bannon. He sees him on a regular basis to effect one thing, which is to see how the European Union can be destroyed in the coming years. Not thinking, dear colleagues, of one thing, which is that it is a big risk to bid on nationalism and populism in Europe. We have had it already in the past. We have had it already in the 20th century. People would say that nationalism and populism was the solution for our continent and they created the most gross atrocities we have ever seen: 20 million deaths, Mr Farage, is what nationalism has cost in Europe. There is no family in the European Union which does not have a grandfather or a grandmother or a son or a daughter who was a victim of that nationalism and of that populism. And that is the reason why we created the European Union – to overcome that, to make a continent of peace.  Normally an American President – take Roosevelt, for example – wants to be the leader of the free world, and now I see an American President who wants to be the leader in the fight against the free world, against solidarity, and against tolerance. I think it is an existential moment for the European Union. We can only take one decision. We have the autocrat Putin who wants to defy Europe. We have President Trump, who has a populist nationalist view and wants to disintegrate us. We have the threat from the radical Islamists in the south and we have a bunch of people here who want to destroy within the European Union.  We can do one thing and that is unite, fight back as the European Union, and I hope in Valletta it will not only be the letter – and I support the letter of President Tusk on his behalf – that will be the conclusion. I hope for once that all European leaders have the courage to stand up together with the European Parliament and fight back against this bunch of nationalists and populists who want to destroy us.

We will certainly not have to deal with the politics of the United States, and particularly the Trump administration, for the first or last time today. And thank you very much, Ms. Mogherini, for also making the connection with the point in time when Mr. Trump published his decree restricting or stopping the entry of Muslim citizens - January 27th. It was not just thoughtlessness that Mr. Trump showed, but there is a system with him. It has a system, because at the same time - almost on the same day - he insulted the Democratic MP Schumer when he was talking about what it means when people were in the background of his biography, in view of the death of his grandfather and close family members in German concentration camps ostracized because of their beliefs, not allowed to enter, and Trump asked him what bad acting teacher he had.

So let us prove and actually oppose our values ​​to this contempt for Trump and let us use a different migration policy based on solidarity to ensure that people who seek protection are not seen as the root of the evil and as those who commit terror and crime to us, but that we remain committed to our values ​​here and act together here. I'll say it again: what Would the post-war democracies here in Europe have become after 1945 if many of the refugees, who were not allowed to stay at the time of National Socialism - the worst German fascism - when it was burning and murdering through Europe and the world, had not been allowed to stay? Where would we have gone How badly would we have missed them if the Nazis had got their hands on them? And that is exactly what obliges us not to get involved in these games. But don't just fight back wildly, but with what we can do better, prove that we have something to oppose and that we are also cooperating here with the American citizens who are defending themselves. Incidentally - and finally said: What has really given me hope these days is that immediately on the day of the inauguration and also in the days after that, thousands, hundreds of thousands of women all over the world and especially in the USA have opposed such an image of man. It's not just about discrimination against women, but generally about respect and respect for the individual - of people, whether women, whether marginalized, regardless of origin, nationality or belief. That’s what it’s about, and that’s what we have to push through with ourselves. Let's fight Trump and his ideology by, for example, also preventing him from getting into any situation that he actually triggers the button! Let's take care of security a little more, let's finally get rid of American nuclear weapons from EU soil! Some are still stationed in Germany.

Let us very clear: this ban on seven countries is not something that is put forward for security or one of the other reasons. It is very clearly a discriminatory act. It is targeting Muslims. Even though not only Muslims are hit, and even if it does not hit all Muslims, it is directed against people because of their religion.  Who could have imagined that such a thing could happen? Who could have thought that the freedoms and the rights that we all assume are normal and natural, that we have always had and think are guaranteed, can evaporate so quickly and can disappear so suddenly? This is apparently how liberal democracy dies. It vanishes very quickly with an executive order. The US built itself on religious freedom – that was one of the key figures of its founding – and on immigration. Now what is left of this American dream? How quickly did it vanish. But that is also the point isn’t it? All the rights, the freedoms and the liberties that we take for granted are actually not for granted. They always have to be fought for. They have to be fought for every single day. Democracy is not something that you set up, you write into your constitution and then, voilà, it is there. No, you have to defend it every single day. The same goes for human rights. They are never guaranteed. You have to work for them.  Here in Europe we pride ourselves on living in a union of peace, democracy and the rule of law. We are proud to defend the idea of human rights in the world as well, but do we really do enough to safeguard those values? Don’t we also restrict access at our borders? Don’t we also have walls and fences? Do we not also – even in this Chamber sometimes – hear people who discriminate against other people based on where they come from and based on their religion? And what are we doing about that? Every one of us, including the governments of the Member States, need to be clear on which side we stand. Do we stand on the side of hate and of walls, or do we stand on the side of democracy and of building bridges? I think we need to build our European Union stronger, and for that we need to get our act together when it comes to finally solving the economic crisis that is still leading to so much unemployment, especially for young people. We need to coordinate our foreign policy and we need to be champions of international law because there are not many other people out there in the world who will do so. We need to step up our role in the UN and also when it comes to climate change. Let us make Europe the counter—model to Trump, the light of liberty of human rights and the rule of law, and also of generosity. Let us be the ones who show justice and compassion. Let us make sure that we are not just speaking of those values, but are actually demonstrating them in everything we do. The Statue of Liberty was once given by France to the younger sister, America – sisters in freedom and rights. I think we should build more statues of liberty. We need to put them in Lesbos and Lampedusa, where people arrive full of hope and fear. We need to put them everywhere where people are standing up for their rights and also for their neighbour’s rights. Let us be the Europe that brings forward and champions those people who fight for their rights and the rights of others, no matter what their nationality, religion, sex or sexual orientation, and no matter where they come from. Europe needs to be building bridges and not walls. Let us do that together.

It seems to me that with all the anti—Trump rhetoric that is coming from everywhere, actually what we are hearing is the true nature of the European project, which is genuine anti-Americanism. Trump is motivated by protecting the United States of America from Islamic terrorism, whereas what has happened in this room and in governments around Europe is you have welcomed these people into your own homes. But can we just for a moment look at the facts, amongst all the hyperbole and the hysteria? All that Donald Trump has done is taken seven countries that were identified by President Obama as posing a risk to the USA. Obama had already put in place extreme vetting; what Trump has done is, for 90 days, to say ‘let’s examine that vetting and see whether it is good enough’. What I want to ask you, Mr Verhofstadt, and all the others, with your faux outrage today, is where were you when Obama in 2011 banned any Iraqi from going into the country for six months? Why do I hear no criticism in this Chamber, or from the Commission, of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain and others, who have refused to take a single – not one – refugee or displaced person from Syria. And how can it be that on Holocaust Day last Friday, not a single one of you criticised the 16 countries in the world that ban Israeli Jews from even going to their country on holiday? What is this hypocrisy? So perhaps what we need to do, Mr President, and through you to the Members, is to be a little bit more constructive. All of us here say we are democrats, well here is the chance to prove it. Let us invite President Trump to come here, to this European Parliament. I am sure that as democrats you would all agree that what we need to do is to have an open dialogue with the newly-elected most powerful man in the world. And if you throw that rejection back in my face then you prove yourself to be the anti-democratic zealots that I always thought you were.

This argument to improve border controls before allowing people to enter is completely valid. In the EU, we are directly suffering from the consequences of failing border control.

The cohesion of the European Union and the eurozone will be tested. The formation of other equally reactionary alliances with the European Union is also possible.

I will switch to English because that might be better. Respecting the role of the Commission – and in particular, in my case being a Vice—President of the Commission and also a High Representative – is also a sign of respect for this Parliament, because I was asked to do this job by the European Parliament, which, to my knowledge, is elected, and, by the way, also by the European Council, which is composed of Prime Ministers who are elected.  I see that there is a lot of confusion in some parts of the UK. The United States is a great country and a great democracy. America will have to deal with its own divisions and discussions. I know that, as Europeans, we specialise in making every crisis our own crisis, but it is clear that this is an American crisis that which will have to be dealt with by Americans. They will have to sort this out somehow, starting with the dangerous divisions and polarisations we are seeing in the American political, institutional and societal dynamics. But I am confident that our American friends will find their way out of these tensions and crises and continue to be the great country that most of you recognise that they are, have been, and will continue to be.  What is up to us here is not to try and solve the American contradictions of the present, but to be clear on where we stand, to affirm our own values, our own policies and our own interests, and be true to them. Those of you who underlined this are completely right. This is also up to you in this Chamber, and to many others in the European institutions. Be strong and show leadership. We might have lost one important partner on some files, but this makes our leadership even more important, relevant, and, I would say, indispensable. All around the world, be it in our region or very far away, people are now looking to the European Union – maybe not in the UK, but in the rest of the world – as a point of reference with regard to multilateralism, free and fair trade, human rights, respect – which for us is the basis not only of institutional relations but also of human relations – and our own, in Italian we would say ‘humanism’. I am not sure if that works in English. Europeans are like this. Sometimes we are not proud enough of what we are, who we are and what we can be.  I will end by saying that some great Americans, good friends, only a few months ago were reminding us, the Europeans – here in Brussels – that Europeans should believe in themselves as much as their friends in the world believe in them. I think that this is the time for us, as Europeans, to realise the potential we have, to realise the responsibilities we hold in this particular historic moment, and to be that strong point of reference that the world needs at this moment, in particular in our region. I was thinking of the paradox that we will have Prime Minister al-Sarraj from Libya here tomorrow. That was natural and the invitation came before the executive order came out, but a Libyan citizen will be here in Brussels discussing ways out of the Libyan crisis with us. When you ban something and build a wall, you might have the feeling that you are more secure, but you are actually building walls all around yourself and preventing yourself from having many opportunities. We Europeans are not like that. We will continue to be true to our values and to our way of working – the European way, which puts cooperation before confrontation.

Such a general ban, for people who have an individual entry visa and have therefore been deemed dangerous by the US authorities themselves, constitutes ill-treatment based solely on the fact that they are nationals of a particular nationality, without a state of war between the US and of these states. In fact, it is noteworthy that, at least in the case of Iran, there is not even any major internal unrest or anomaly. In its deepest sense, the decree of 27.1.2017 therefore targets people regardless of their individual characteristics, merely to serve some political expediency, symbolic or otherwise, ie indiscriminately turns the citizens of these seven states into objects of pre-determined ill-treatment the USA.

Moreover, it is clear that the personal business interests of the US President influenced the exact compilation of the list more than security considerations - otherwise there is no other explanation for Saudi Arabia, for example, being left out of the list. What Trump has achieved with this regulation is simply that it has further destroyed the already weak confidence on the international stage and increased tensions. However, the escalation of tensions is likely to lead to further conflicts and new refugees - the exact opposite of the official goal. Furthermore, it cannot be stressed enough that the regulation is also unacceptable in the context of the fight against terrorism: there can be no general suspicion of groups of people because of their origin and / or religion.

The selection of these seven countries has a special background, because in 2011 Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama, suspended visas for Iraqi refugees for six months. The states mentioned have been identified as \"sources of terrorism\" by the Obama administration. The Trump administration has exempted people with two citizenships from this entry ban. There are good reasons to criticize this undifferentiated entry policy; alone, the security aspect behind it is justified. It should also be mentioned that since 1948 Israelis have been banned from entering 16 Muslim countries. Most of them are in the group of states concerned.

As you may remember, Parliament was one of my first stops in presenting the first report as well, and this is no coincidence. It reflects the importance I see in working very closely with you, the European Parliament, in co-piloting the Energy Union. Only through close partnership can we ensure that the legislative proposals of the November package will be adopted over the next nine months.  This is the objective I presented last week in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE), in line with the December Declaration of our three institutions. A quick adoption is important so that our proposals can be swiftly transposed by the Member States and put into action. It would also send an important message to EU citizens that, when it comes to the Energy Union, we mean business. ‘We’ being all EU institutions. While negotiations on the legislative proposals are ongoing, my colleagues and I are not sitting and waiting. To the greatest extent possible, the Commission will already start the implementation of the Energy Union on the ground. This is one of the key messages of the second State of the Energy Union: while 2016 was a ‘year of delivery’, 2017 will be a ‘year of implementation’. What does that mean in practice? It means that, apart from the upcoming legislation on the low-emission mobility, we have delivered on all Energy Union proposals, and we are now ready for the next phase. The second State of the Energy Union serves exactly for that next phase. It give us a good overview of where we stand and what has been achieved both at EU and national levels. Our thorough analysis shows that the European Union is largely on track. For instance, among major global economies, Europe is one of the most greenhouse gas efficient. This creates significant ‘first-mover opportunities’ for European companies. But we are in no way in a position to rest on our laurels. Other parts of the world are also speeding up their efforts; they are also modernising their economies, and they are also increasing their competitiveness. There is no room for complacency if we want to remain global leaders in areas such as clean technologies.  The State of the Energy Union Report therefore also looks forward and identifies the work that still has to be done; it sets the political priorities for this year. In line with the Energy Union Strategy, these priorities go far beyond energy and climate alone. The Energy Union is about accelerating the modernisation of our entire economy: making it low-carbon; making it efficient in the use of energy and resources; making sure our economy is socially fair and consumer-oriented; and strengthening the Energy Union’s external dimension. In the current, ever-changing and volatile geopolitical context, we need European global leadership. This is true in the field of climate action but also for safeguarding our competitiveness, jobs and economic interests. Such an over-arching approach implies strengthening the ties between the Energy Union Project and other European flagship policies, such as the circular economy, the Digital Single Market, the Security Union, our Skills Agenda, the EU’s economy and climate diplomacy, our investment policies, and so on. What does it mean in practice? Simply put, when we look at the modernisation of our economy, we will also need to look at: the huge job potential of the green economy; the heavy economic costs of air pollution; the threats of cyber-attacks, and many other areas. It means we must make sure that each and every new measure benefits consumers, especially the vulnerable ones. It means that we will make real progress this year on providing the missing infrastructure links. We will look deeper into how we can avoid stranded assets, for example when preparing the next list of Projects of Common Interest. It means that we must step up even further our investment policies, and for this purpose we will set up investment platforms on the ground in all Member States. It also means that we will make Europe’s global leadership more concrete by helping the developing world, Africa in particular, jump over the fossil age. These are just a few examples to give you the gist of the report. As you can see, a lot remains to be done. With the State of the Energy Union, I am also launching a second Energy Union Tour. I will once again visit the Member States, and I hereby invite you to join me when I visit your constituencies. Even in the event that you cannot join me in person, I encourage you to help me bring the message of the Energy Union to your electorates. Help me convey the urgency of the energy transition, and the opportunities it brings to our citizens. As I have mentioned earlier, we intend to make 2017 the Energy Union’s ‘year of implementation’. I will therefore use this tour to campaign and push for the swift implementation of the Energy Union not only at national level, but also at local level, which is becoming increasingly important. I will discuss, with government representatives, the importance of presenting their National Energy and Climate Plans. We will together ensure that drafts will be presented by the end of 2017. I will also emphasise the need for a broad consultation of the plans not only within the Member States with all relevant stakeholders, but also with the neighbouring Member States on a regional level. At the local level, my tour will be a good opportunity to showcase some of the most promising and innovative projects of cities and regions. It is important that we provide such projects with a strong tail-wind and match them with financing. I am glad to share with you that we are actively working on that, in cooperation with the Committee of the Regions. Showing concrete progress on the ground will help our citizens to visualise and grasp the multiple benefits of the clean energy transition. Distinguished Members, let me once again thank you for your support in realising our joint ambition.

If we think for a moment, our energy policy has had one main goal for the last 10-15 years. And it has been fighting climate change by reducing CO2 emissions. All energy policy has, in fact, been subordinate to this goal. And I'm not saying that that goal was wrong. But now what the European Commission has proposed - this package of eight bills - introduces what I think is a long-needed addition to this goal. In other words, we need to start thinking not only about climate change, but also about the competitiveness of our citizens and businesses and the price of energy. And the way we can simultaneously stick to our climate change goals and reduce prices for consumers, especially for our industry, is by introducing a very basic principle that works completely everywhere in the economy: competition. By releasing market barriers, we will send the right signals to create more competition for or between energy producers in the Member States. We need to remove restrictions, both physical and regulatory, for this competition to exist. Competition is not possible in a situation where there are still large subsidies for both fossil fuels and renewable energy. So, at the same time, we will have to look at how we can sensibly reduce market-distorting subsidies for all players, for all sectors, by promoting competition, while, of course, adhering to our climate goals, but thinking about lowering prices for citizens and businesses to become more competitive.", "language": "en", "original_language": "lv", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 65, "date": "2017-02-01.json", "name": "Dan NICA", "mepid": "124784", "text": "on behalf of the S & D group. - Mr President, Mr Vice-President Šefčovič, thank you for your work in making the energy union a priority European project and for delivering the winter energy package together with your colleagues in the Commission. The European Union still imports more than half of its energy needs, but progress is being made to diversify resources, routes and energy suppliers. The better our energy efficiency, the less dependent we will be on external energy suppliers. Energy efficiency will allow us to invest more in job creation and innovation. The money should be better spent on sustainable energy production, increasing energy efficiency and upgrading energy networks, and ensuring clean and affordable energy for industry and European citizens. I emphasize the importance of electricity interconnections and the strengthening of internal lines in order to further integrate the internal market in electricity. We need to facilitate cross-border flows of electricity across the Union, while ensuring the security of the system. With regard to renewables, according to Commission estimates, 25 Member States have already exceeded their 2015/2016 indicative targets in 2015. So we need to see how we can stimulate investment in renewable energy. Also, a wider introduction of renewable sources in the energy system will need important changes in the design of the electricity market. In debating the state of the energy union, we must also focus on future measures. Therefore, the current energy package must be an opportunity to launch the transition of our industrial base. We will be able to use up to € 177 billion in public and private investment in 2021.

Commissioner! I would just like to remind you that clean energy is, of course, a very important one of the most important goals of the Energy Union, while there is another goal that we should not lose sight of, namely energy security. This is a goal much more elementary for some, so it is often the case that we want energy first, then we wonder if it is pure energy and energy that we are willing to pay for. The basis of energy security (already mentioned by a colleague) is the diversification of supplies. On the other hand, if we look at statistical data, we can see that the situation is not improving, because according to statistics, the dependence of the Union on the import of energy resources increased from 52% in 2010 to almost 56% in 2015 and it seems, as indicated by the forecasts that it will increase to 60%, so with such a high dependence on external energy supplies, diversification is of paramount importance for Europe's energy security and should be the backbone of the Energy Union. And above all, there is the issue of new gas sources and independence from the dominant supplier from the East, but in this matter we receive both positive and very worrying signals from the Commission. For example, the strategy of greater use of liquefied natural gas and the prospects for The Northern Gate, which will allow the transmission of gas from Norway via Denmark to Poland and other countries of the continent. On the other hand, projects to launch capacity from the East, such as NordStream2 or the decision on the OPAL gas pipeline, are in clear contradiction to the principles of energy security and are completely incomprehensible to many Europeans, and undermine confidence in the European Commission. This also applies to the issue of capacity markets - this proposal is also controversial, because in principle it will make the EU dependent on gas imports. I would ask you to reflect on these two points, because it is extremely important for many countries and citizens of the European Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 67, "date": "2017-02-01.json", "name": "Fredrick FEDERLEY", "mepid": "124989", "text": "for the ALDE Group. - Mr President!

Sixty years ago, cooperation in the field of energy in Europe led to the European Union. Today, the energy union is a unique opportunity for us Europeans to strengthen and reinforce this cooperation in troubled times. For a well—functioning energy union, we clearly need a high level of investment and cooperation among the Member States – and not primarily, in terms of gas and electricity, for infrastructure, but also for upscaling renewables and increasing energy efficiency efforts and exploiting the clear synergies between these aspects. The Commission again confirms in its report the determination of the Commission to make the European Union the world number one in renewables, but the legislative proposals of the winter package do not live up to the promises; rather they put brakes on the energy transition and simply do not address key problems and market distortions. There is no real incentive to cut fossil fuel consumption. It allows subsidies to fossil fuel and also keeps the privileges of nuclear energy. Loopholes in the Energy Efficiency Directive are left unaddressed as well. According to the report, there was a very modest 0.4% growth in the share of renewables in the EU’s total energy use last year.  Clearly we must accelerate our efforts. The proposal still does not contain proper incentives for further deployment of renewables. Instead it undermines market access for renewable energy sources. While regulated household energy prices in about half of the EU are – rightly – identified as a problem, there are no effective proposals for dealing with energy poverty, instead of those distorting measures. I also see a lack of proper support for prosumers, such as energy cooperatives, to compete fairly in the market. The problem of energy dependency is also well addressed in the report, but the importance of energy efficiency in fighting against it is underestimated. Finally, one issue remains almost untouched – the poor enforcement of the existing legislation affecting the energy market.

It is certainly a step forward, and I welcome and congratulate the Commissioner, but at the same time there are steps backwards, in our view, which could instead undo any progress towards the climate and energy objectives that Union aims. We realize that it is not easy to manage a situation where such conflicting interests are sometimes focused on a single person, such as the Commissioner, and therefore I am in solidarity with you. However, I believe that it is simply scandalous to have eliminated the dispatching priority for renewable. It is true that green technologies are more mature and cheaper than a few years ago, but until the externalities of fossils are computed and with the capacity mechanisms still contemplated at least until 2026, as it would seem, talk about the same competitiveness with other technologies, of technological neutrality, in my opinion - to use a term that is fashionable - is fake news. I therefore return to underline the distortion of the market induced by the 300 billion in direct and indirect subsidies - the source is the International Monetary Fund - which in Europe end up feeding the fossil energy economy. When it comes to technology neutrality, the free market forgets this huge elephant in the room that is periodically ignored. This is without considering the climatic and geopolitical benefits of the renewable transition. We know that there are reliable studies - I can give them to you, but you will know them - which estimate the potential of decentralized energy production by citizens at European level with impressive data: in 2030, 112 million prosumers, including schools, local communities and hospitals, would have the potential, alone, to respond to 19% energy demand in the European Union;in 2050 this response would reach 45% with half of the citizens involved.In the newly adopted state of the Union, mention is made of financing mechanisms, and here I come with a proposal: there is no regulatory framework for crowdfunding, cross-border crowdfunding and crowdfunding for numerative investments.So I urge the Commissioner to consider such a proposal, to provide a legal framework because in this case we could stimulate the private investment of individuals and communities that we so much need.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 75, "date": "2017-02-01.json", "name": "Barbara KAPPEL", "mepid": "125024", "text": "on behalf of the ENF Group. - Mister President!

It is indeed an energy union, a union of citizens who can feel safe and at the same time have cheaper energy.

They are important to us, because first of all, in my opinion, they threaten the implementation of the Paris Agreement - and yet we agreed that all the largest issuers (we are not as big an issuer as the United States) will apply these rules - which results in specific conclusions and specific questions for us. For example, we have agreed that Member States will not have binding targets for energy savings or renewable energy - does anything change in this regard? We also have proposals from the Energy Union to reduce emissions from electricity production, and that applies to fossil fuels. The United States is going in a completely different direction, and such restrictions could eliminate some fuels and make energy more expensive. This directly reduces the competitiveness of our industry in many countries.

Within the scope of the Energy Union Framework Strategy, I particularly welcome the increased focus on clean energy, rather than solely green energy. This is key. While the need for radical reductions in carbon are clear and well known, there are other notable pollutants such as NOx and PM which also have hugely detrimental effects on both human health and the environment, and these need to be addressed.  The Commission communication does mention health. I welcome the reference to the new NEC Directive and the reiteration – albeit only in a footnote – that in 2013 more than 450 000 people are estimated to have died prematurely from air pollution in the EU, and lost days at work caused by respiratory disease amount to a EUR 15 billion loss to the EU economy.  It is becoming ever more evident that the transition to clean – and not just green – transport must be given priority. I would like to see a clear preference given to investment in projects that combine the two objectives of lowering greenhouse gas emissions, and lowering other pollutants. This should include incentives at the level of the citizen. It is no coincidence that people experiencing fuel poverty are often also those who experience the worst possible health outcomes.

You recognised the problem that you call carbon leakage. I call it driving energy-intensive businesses offshore, and you have decided to give these industries free allowances to redress the balance, but you have created your own catch—22: if you give them enough allowances to stay competitive you have no hope of achieving emissions targets, but to achieve your emissions targets you cannot give them enough allowances. You face a stark choice between competitiveness and emissions targets. You cannot have both. You are not cutting emissions; you are merely driving them offshore. You have also created a structure which involves perpetual market intervention and distortion and creates a field day for lobbyists and lawyers, as industries fight each other for an ever-decreasing pot of free allowances.  The proposal to offer a tiered structure for different industry sectors only exacerbates the problem, and the use of the top 10% as a standard implies that 90% of European industries will be at a competitive disadvantage anyway.

It is clear that there are a number of challenges. We must reduce dependence on our imports from Putin's Russia and from the Middle East. We must create a single market for energy in Europe, and we must make better use of the energy we now have in Europe. There are plenty of opportunities in the directives that now exist regarding energy efficiency, renewable energy, electricity market design, governance, etc. As rapporteur for energy efficiency in buildings, I can already see that there are plenty of opportunities. One of the nuts we need to have cracked in that directive is to have private funds released for energy renovations.

In the meantime, some countries are already talking about advanced smart meters that provide real-time data instead of near real-time data, enabling real-time data flows and data-sharing within the energy markets, with this being absolutely essential to build competitive and innovative energy markets for tomorrow.

If we want green energies in cars and buildings, we cannot at the same time prevent this structural change through the need to save renewable energies. But that's not all, unfortunately. We as parliament - i.e. the left, the liberals - want 40% less energy consumption. 40%, although the Commission's Impact Assessment says it would thwart the ETS system.

We talk about it all the time: Europe. We have to make sure that the Europeans have approval for the European project. We are constantly making sure that Europe is strong. Then we would actually have to make sure that Europe is economically strong, because that is the important prerequisite. It is therefore dangerous if the entire energy policy is based solely on climate policy considerations. You also have to have the factor under control: What burdens and costs does this entail, what effects does it have on citizens, consumers and the economy? I miss that. Then it is not the time to make a new plan every day or to announce higher percentages. We already had that at Lisbon: higher, further, better, being the very best. It's much smarter to take small steps and demonstrate success. Action is not needed, not plans. I am firmly convinced of that. There are some interesting things in this mountain of paper that we have before us. The first is: I think it is wise that we are moving away from this subsidy patchwork of renewables, but rather have the requirement to organize this through tenders and to approach it in a market-based manner. I think this is a smart contribution that can save a lot of costs. On the other hand, however, it is not at all intelligent to inflate this ACER - i.e. the attempt to improve the pipeline networks and the monitoring of the pipeline networks by making a European authority even bigger, more effective, even more effective, even more heavily.

I would like to assure you that, whenever it is possible to improve our proposals, we are ready to work very closely with the Members of the European Parliament and with the Council to make sure that the proposal we put on the table last November really leads to the most profound transformation of the energy systems in Europe since they were built in today’s centralised and fossil-fuel-centred way. Our two afternoon plenary debates confirmed that we in Europe are following developments in the USA with growing anxiety. My colleague, High Representative/Vice-President Mogherini, was discussing with you one hour ago the problems with visas and the proper treatment of visitors to the United States. And I will, of course, say a few words about climate action and the Paris Agreement. I want to make it very clear that, for us, the Paris Agreement is a historic achievement. It is a binding international treaty which was jointly negotiated, approved and ratified and has entered into force, and we are ready to continue our communication and exchange of views with the United States because we believe we have very strong arguments. The implementation of the Paris Agreement is important not only for preserving life on our planet, for preserving mankind, but also because it has huge potential for modernising our economy: from bringing electricity to the 1.3 billion people on this planet who do not currently have access to it to really accelerating the implementation and use of all the innovations we have in our labs and our companies. I also want to make it very clear that Europe is ready to continue to lead in these efforts. I know that this readiness to provide leadership is very much welcomed by our partners across the world, be it on energy transition or climate action, be it in the area of development aid, where we want to use our clean technology to provide access to electricity to the peoples in Africa and in Asia, or be it on free and fair trade. I hope that this realistic and pragmatic discussion will take place again in the United States because I can hardly think of any other nation which is so affected by weather-related disasters, be it hurricanes or whirlwinds, or any of the other tragedies we have seen on our screens. You have been highlighting the importance of putting citizens as consumers at the centre of our efforts and using this energy transition to fight energy poverty and air pollution, and I absolutely agree with you. This is a must for the European Union. We cannot lose 450 000 people every year because of high pollution. We cannot have, on our TV screens, pictures of our cities which remind us of Beijing or Delhi, and we cannot accept the fact that 50 million Europeans have to choose between paying their energy bills or buying food for their families. Therefore, we are introducing what I believe will lead to a more common approach in fighting energy poverty. The European Observatory on Energy Poverty will be up and running by the end of this year. We will be talking about how, jointly with the EU Member States, we can tackle this challenge together. We believe that energy efficiency is a very important part of the answer, and that new electricity market design, with strong rules on the procedure leading to disconnection, should be another very important lever for improving the situation of our citizens. I know that Europe’s mayors – who very often are the first addressees of citizens’ complaints about air pollution or energy poverty or vulnerable sections of society – are ready to work with us very actively in the Global Covenant of Mayors for Climate &amp; Energy. I understand all those honourable Members who have reminded us of the importance of energy security. You know that we are dealing with that very seriously, and I think this is strongly reflected in our report: 22 out of 28 countries are actually better off; having better infrastructure and interconnectors with reverse flows is giving us much more confidence; the European market is much more liquid than it ever was before; we are open to LNG and to Caspian gas; and we are ready to develop the East Med gas reserve with its huge potential, probably as big as that of the Norwegian reserve. We are also putting into practice rules which will no longer allow any abuse of a dominant position in the European market. In this context I would also like to thank and congratulate the Maltese Presidency because today they managed to secure the mandate for trilogue on the security of gas supply and I believe that, working together with the representatives of the European Parliament, this very important legislation on providing greater security of supply for European consumers will be agreed very soon. The last two points I want to mention concern investment and infrastructure. I totally agree with Mr Kelly, who underscored the importance of regulatory stability, vision and the alignment of goals at global, European, national and local levels. We have to work on that, and if we achieve it I am sure that we will also be able to secure investment because this represents a huge investment opportunity for private investors and for cities, and I am sure there will be huge demand in terms of putting all the new and innovative technologies at the service of our citizens. Mr Tamburrano suggested that we could use crowd funding, and this is actually one of the options we are studying under the Capital Markets Union. We are going to explore the possibilities here and look at how we can merge these two unions and use the potential of capital markets to invest in European energy infrastructure. I totally agree with you when we talk about investment that it should be smart investment. We should be very careful about stranded assets. We should think twice about where we put both private and public money. And this leads me to my last point, on excessive infrastructure. I was listening to you very carefully and I know very well your concerns on Nord Stream 2. I want to reassure you that European law would be fully respected, and that we are highlighting the fact that, even in such a harsh winter as this one, the transport capacity used for getting Russian gas to Europe is somewhere between 50% to 60%. I would emphasise too that we have consensus in the European Union – and the High Representative could be the best witness to that because we discussed it in the Foreign Affairs Council too – about the preservation and continuation of the Ukrainian gas transit route. There is consensus among all the EU Member States that we want to have it operational after 2019. I would like to thank the honourable Members for a great debate.

The basic tool for achieving these goals is energy efficiency. At this point, I would like to return to the topic of doubling the capacity of the Nord Stream gas pipeline. Nord Stream-2 may have a significant impact on these objectives and on the security of supply. Looking rationally, ignoring political understatements, long-standing disputes and fears resulting from historical experience, it must be admitted that the construction of the second line of the Nord Stream gas pipeline is rational. Converting the energy from gas to electricity is at least 20% more efficient than from coal, while CO2 emissions are only 40% of that resulting from its combustion. An additional physicochemical aspect is the high flexibility of electricity production, which perfectly harmonizes with wind energy. Gas turbines are the perfect way to be efficient during the so-called peak wages. This will allow the increase of energy efficiency in the EU to 30% and more. The designers of Nord Stream-1 (it's a pity not Jamal-2) perfectly understood the geopolitical superiority of this project. For a new project, a community method will be needed. Investments with links to EU countries in the Baltic region should be considered, which will enable Community exploitation and price fixing.

Energy security should be the overarching principle guiding the Commission when drafting new legislation. Meanwhile, the recently published \"Clean Energy Package for Every European\" shows that it is going in an entirely opposite direction. In the draft presented by the European Commission, concerns are primarily about the criteria that Member States will have to meet in order to launch the so-called capacity markets. Capacity mechanisms are of key importance for the energy security of the Member States struggling with energy shortages. Each country should therefore be able to shape this market on the most favorable terms for itself. Meanwhile, the European Commission proposes to introduce an extremely restrictive emission limit (550 g CO2 per kilowatt hour) for technologies that can be used in the construction of capacity markets. This means discrimination against carbon technologies. This is a provision that is potentially contrary to the EU Treaties, which state that a Member State has the right to \"determine the conditions for the use of its energy resources, the choice between different energy sources and the overall structure of its energy supply\" (Article 194 TFEU). Meanwhile, the European Commission's proposal on emissions is an attempt to circumvent this principle and exert pressure on individual countries when it comes to the selection of energy carriers.

The Commission's recent winter energy package is the basis for the creation of the European Energy Union and the first building block of Hungary's energy independence. By improving energy efficiency, modernizing buildings and spreading renewable energy, we can finally disconnect Hungary from Russian gas taps. If energy efficiency increases, not only will the overhead bill be cheaper, but tens of thousands of quality jobs can be created in Hungary. In the construction of the Energy Union, it is important to spread wind farms and solar panels, which are the cheapest forms of energy today. It is incomprehensible why these had to be banned in Hungary. Part of the Energy Union is also the termination of long-term, unfavorable gas contracts with third countries. For example, if we had not re-concluded the Russian gas contract last year, Hungarians would have received 40% cheaper today. All this because we could buy gas from the world market much cheaper. An energy union would also be good at preventing irresponsible governments from harming their own citizens. The energy union is good for the Hungarian people, provides Hungary with cheaper and more predictable energy, and leaves more in our wallets at the end of the month.

This report shows three key things. Firstly, it is good news that the modernization of the EU economy and the transition to a low-carbon economy are becoming a reality. The second is the role of renewable energy. For the first time in history, it is cost-competitive and sometimes even cheaper compared to fossil fuels. It employs more than one million people across Europe, attracts more investment than many other sectors, and has reduced our imports of fossil fuels by € 16 billion. But it is essential to maintain this trend. The third point is the approval of the Paris Agreement and its subsequent rapid ratification, thanks in part to the role of the Slovak Presidency. In the current context, this agreement will need to be defended and enforced even more vigorously. Personally, I consider the progress made since the publication of the first report on the state of the Energy Union in November 2015 to be very good, although the most difficult part - implementation - awaits us this year.

We must repeat once again, as we did here just an hour ago, that refugees must be welcome. This is a strong position that the European Union has and will continue to have. At the same time, without any contradiction – and, on the contrary, with some complementarity – we must say that the pain and the deaths caused by smugglers have to be stopped. I have seen with my own eyes people who have managed to survive – their stories are ones that nobody should have to live through, nobody should have to listen to. It is, first and foremost, a humanitarian duty not only to save lives but also to protect the lives of the people who are migrating. As you know very well, in the last two years we have been working literally day and night to reduce human suffering, first and foremost, and to reduce the loss of life on the various routes leading to Europe: in the Mediterranean Sea, of course, but also in places where the loss of life and the violation of human rights are less evident to the TV cameras, in particular in the desert. In the central Mediterranean, our Operation Sophia alone saved more than 32 000 people last year. Each and every one of them represents a precious result for me in a war that we are at last waging as the European Union. We also apprehended more than 100 smugglers, who are now in the hands of the law. Our migration compacts with five African countries have started to reduce substantially the irregular flows. For instance, the number of people crossing irregularly from Niger into Libya has decreased to its lowest level in years. We thus see that our action is starting to deliver in real terms, the first concern always being to save and protect human lives. The report adopted yesterday by the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Development on the role of our external action on addressing the movements of refugees and migrants encourages me to keep on this path of closer cooperation with third countries, including in relation to regular channels for entry to the European Union. I would ask for your support on this specific point because, among the commitments made by the European Union with our partners at the Valletta Summit last year was that of working more on the regular channels for migration. The more we work to prevent irregular flows, the more we need to offer regular channels. We know very well that this is a difficult debate in each and every one of the Member States and also in this Parliament. It was not by chance that, back in December, the Commission increased the resources for various mobility opportunities, and this is just the beginning. Last year we had more than 4 500 deaths at sea in the central Mediterranean. Believe me, I wish we could name each and every one of them because, as long as we refer just to numbers, it is much easier to forget them or to see this as a phenomenon. Each and every one of these people has a history, a story, a name and a future – or they should have had. Yet at times we do not even know their names. That is why all of us in the European Union need to do more, in a spirit of solidarity among Europeans and with our partners, who also have to take some ownership of the management of this problem. When we see people dying in the desert, or close to the Libyan coast, we need to have discussions with, and to help, our partners do their part to save lives and to make sure that the protection of human beings and their human rights is fully taken on board – and I will come back to that in a minute. We all need to do more, first of all to end the suffering, and to manage human mobility better. Last week I presented a package of additional measures, worth EUR 200 million, that will feed into the discussion at the Malta Summit the day after tomorrow. Migration has, of course, always existed. I have been accused many times of constantly pointing out, firstly, that, until a couple of decades ago, migration used to be from Europe to the rest of the world and, secondly, that if we had to live without migrants in all our societies and all our economies we would suffer a lot of negative consequences. Imagine the cost of non—migration to our European economies and you will realise that, indeed, we are talking not about a bad phenomenon but about a phenomenon that needs to be managed, first of all, as I have said, in order to protect human beings. We all know that there is no easy way to stop the suffering and manage the phenomenon better. We know very well that the real solution implies, first of all, the economic development of Africa and also the democratic development of Africa. Here our daily work is ongoing, with the compacts with the five priority countries, the external investment plan, the trust fund, and the overall work we are doing in partnership, in particular, with Africa and also working – and I know Commissioner Mimica will be joining us for the following debates – in the framework of our cooperation and partnership with the African Union and the different countries in Africa, as well as with civil society and citizens in Africa, because we know very well that the key to development lies not only in the economy but also in society and a civil space in which Africans can find their place and their way. Apart from that, we also have to focus now on what kind of quantitative and qualitative leap we can make in our joint work and the immediate steps we can take together and with our partners. So we name three proposals that will be on the table at the Malta Summit on Friday that I believe can be fully in line with the partnership approach we have taken on the central Mediterranean routes and with the African partnership from the beginning of last year and can also constitute a clear change and a clear step forward in having a more effective result. First, we want to increase training for the Libyan coastguard. I am sure many of you remember a meeting we had here in this building several months ago with the cast and the director of Fuocoammare, the documentary film that is now nominated for an Academy Award. They told us one simple thing, among many others, namely that we should do something about the Libyan territorial waters because, while before we were seeing people dying close to Lampedusa in international waters, we are now seeing people dying in Libyan territorial waters. We cannot act inside Libyan territorial waters: that is a Libyan responsibility. But we can help and we can train and support the Libyan authorities in this work. This will be one of the things I will discuss tomorrow with Prime Minister al-Sarraj. It will not be the only one, but I will come to that in a minute. Just a few days ago Operation Sophia launched the second package of training for a carefully vetted group of officials from the Libyan coastguard and navy and we now propose to increase the training even more substantially, including – and this is a very important point for me – human rights, women’s rights and respect for international standards and obligations. Secondly, we propose to step up our efforts on the southern borders of Libya at the point before the migratory flows enter a country that is, by definition, a difficult country in which to operate. We have already started to facilitate a common approach between Libya, Chad and Niger, in particular. Managing their common border is an interest they share, inter alia for security reasons. They see us as Europeans with our main focus always on the migration flows through Libya towards Europe – and I see a lot of attention paid to this, not in this Chamber but certainly in terms of public opinion – but there is also a flow of a different kind going from Libya to the south, to the Sahel and possibly connecting with the Lake Chad region and with Boko Haram. There is a security challenge there too: to control the border south of Libya in a more effective way. So managing this common border is in their common interest as neighbours, and it is also in our interest as Europeans. We are active in the region with three missions and operations and are already training local security forces, including in respect for human rights. I stress this because, for me, this is a key component of all the training we do with local forces. These are powerful tools. We can make them even more powerful, improving cooperation among all actors in the region and taking a regional approach, including working with the African Union and its newly elected leadership, as we have the new African Union Commission President who was the Foreign Minister of Chad until a few days ago. Thirdly, we will increase our support – at least this is my proposal – for the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) and the UNHCR. For me this is key, because you can act to the north, at sea, and to the south, in the Sahel, but the presence you already have now in Libya is there and will not disappear by itself. We all know very well that the human-rights angle of this is extremely serious, so we have to find a way of addressing the dramatic situation of stranded migrants inside Libya in a very challenging security situation. In recent weeks I have met both Filippo Grandi, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, and William Swing, the General Director of the IOM. Together we discussed ways in which the European Union can increase its support to the IOM and the UNHCR in order for them to work more, and better, inside Libya and chiefly in the places where the migrants are. For me, cooperation with these two organisations is the best possible way to guarantee the protection of human rights for migrants inside the country. A first project, worth EUR 20 million, was adopted in December under the Trust Fund for Africa. It will allow IOM to offer alternatives to the first group of 5 000 stranded migrants and take action to improve the dreadful conditions in detention centres. I believe that this will be a key element of our policy, where we will need to work as a team – the UNHCR, IOM and the European Union, together with the Libyan authorities, in trying to create the conditions for this to work. All these actions are designed with the bigger picture in mind. It is not an issue for today’s debate, but I think it is essential to keep clearly in mind that the key element of our work is supporting peace and reconciliation in Libya. Again, as I said, this is not an issue for this debate, but this is my main work. Our work with Libya goes far beyond the issue of managing migration. I know this is the top priority for political parties, governments and public opinion in Europe, but believe me when I tell you that the main point for us is working on finding a political solution to the crisis in Libya. I discussed this with Martin Kobler, the UN Special Envoy, just a few days ago here in Brussels, and again this will be the main point we will discuss tomorrow with Prime Minister al-Sarraj here in Brussels. We will also be discussing it with the Foreign Affairs Council on Monday. However, while we keep working to reach a political solution for Libya, there is much we can do in the meantime – working with the Libyan coastguard and navy, working with mayors and local authorities, working with Libya’s neighbours – not only to the east and west but also to the south – as a Libyan neighbour ourselves, because the European Union is a neighbour to Libya, and, with respect, trying to help and trying to focus – as I said – on a political solution that can bring stable democracy to the country, uniting it more than it is now. We will continue to work in partnership along the lines we defined together in Valletta last year in partnership with our friends, not only the authorities but also civil society organisations, and in partnership with the international organisations and the UN system with which we are involved.  In a week’s time in Malta we will have the first stocktaking exercise of the Valletta Summit action plan. Next week I will have the pleasure of initiating it, with the Maltese Foreign Minister, in order to see, with our African partners and the partners from the northern part of Africa, where we are on the implementation of the action plan and what is the way forward in terms of partnership. I believe that, as Europeans, we have finally started to play our part. We are starting to see some results. I mentioned the tens of thousands of lives which have at last been saved, but even if there was only one person dying at sea or in the desert, and whether we saw it or not, this is a responsibility and a problem that we are ready to try to solve. Again, it is not just a European responsibility. It is also a responsibility we have to share with our African partners and, specifically here, our Libyan partners. I hope – and I believe – that the Heads of State and Government in Malta on Friday will commit even more strongly to saving lives, both at sea and in the desert, to fighting the smugglers and to protecting the dignity of all human beings. This also means being true to our values, and that links us to the previous debate here in this Chamber.

I would like to draw attention to several points. The first priority, you said, is to continue to save lives. Yes, faced with the impossibility of entering Libyan waters, we have bet on support for the country's coast guard. This is the right approach. This is why it is necessary to release new funds for this project. But this is not the only solution. We should really think about how to counter the actions of traffickers who exploit the distinction between \"territorial waters\" and \"international waters\". What could the role of Frontex be? I would also like to ask a question about the Seahorse network, which should be operational in the spring. Do we have a more precise timetable for the results to be achieved? Second emergency: stabilize Libya and ensure that migrants there are treated with dignity. Yes, we must continue to support the country's efforts, keep in mind that the situation is fragile and we must pay particular attention to the country's southern borders. I wonder to what extent certain minorities, such as the Toubous, could be included in border management. Third point: the coasts of Libya are, in fact, the starting point of 90% of migrants wishing to reach Europe, but Libya is not the country of origin of migrants. That is why we must continue to work with the countries of origin. Niger is a very good example: 70 people in May, 1,500 in November. What about others?For that, indeed, as the European Union, we must also continue the efforts to open legal channels for migration.Last question: we must not lose sight of countries such as Tunisia and Egypt.How do you see Egypt's role in managing migration?The country is making efforts.It is important that we continue to support them.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 136, "date": "2017-02-01.json", "name": "Elena VALENCIANO", "mepid": "4334", "text": "on behalf of the S & amp; D Group. - Mr President, the truth is that when you hear Mrs Mogherini speak, she tends to start by congratulating her and thanking her for the work that she is doing on her, of which we are all aware of her. It is true that the foreign policy of the European Union had not played much role in the management of migratory flows, which were always dominated by the interior ministers, by internal policy. In the past year, both the Commission and the Council have worked very hard. There you have the Valletta summit, the new partnership framework, the pacts on migration, the high-level dialogues and the agreements and not agreements signed, for example, with Turkey or Afghanistan. In fact, something quite unusual has happened and that is that the weight of foreign policy has been put into motion with great energy, precisely to achieve the objectives that Mrs. Mogherini described today with respect to the central Mediterranean route. Now the question we must ask ourselves is whether all that effort is going in the right direction. There are some results, it is true, insufficient, but what matters most to me is whether the horizon is the one we must agree on. Are we really managing to respect what Mrs. Mogherini always defends: human rights, the dignity of people who emigrate? Can the efforts of the Commission and this Parliament really do more than the efforts or the urgency of the Council in obtaining concrete results on how many people we have managed to avoid entering the European Union? Which of the two powers will finally have more force? The future depends to a large extent on that answer, and I believe that the prestige of the European Union. Today, the central Mediterranean route is the deadliest in the world: in just one month, more than two hundred people have died. Achieving the stabilization of Libya should probably be the central element, but not only. I think we have to continue to appeal to the efforts of the member states to defend dignity ...

Basically, the only humane, the only realistic and the only concrete solution to the challenge of migration is to implement a variant of the Australian model, where we take the bread out of the mouths of human traffickers knowing that there is no longer an economic incentive to come to Europe. A model where we help the refugees where they are most numerous and where the weakest refugees are, namely in the immediate areas. That we invest massively in emergency aid and safe zones instead of believing that the world's poor can be prevented from coming to Europe, as long as it is financially possible to pay human traffickers, with the clear knowledge in mind that one has a an incredible opportunity to stay, either temporarily or permanently, once the European authorities find their way.

You also said that the travel ban is only a temporary and illusionary solution. I fully agree with you, but I cannot reconcile that with your proposal to make agreements with Libya to stop refugees on the coast and to pay a lot for it. Refugees do not travel to Europe because there is a gap in the border, refugees come to Europe because they flee from war or poverty or hunger. Throwing away development money to close a gap in the border while we can also spend it on opportunities for young people in Africa, isn't that exactly what you warned us about earlier, a temporary and illusionary solution? If we give Libya a license to stop and detain refugees, then we do exactly what we accuse Trump of, we turn away from the people who need protection.

Six years later, those hopes lie in tatters. Although 18 months of brutal civil war were formally brought to an end by a peace agreement in August 2015, fighting continues throughout much of the country. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, continue to die each month.  On 1 December last year, the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan noted that a steady process of ethnic cleansing was underway in the country, using starvation, gang rape and the burning of villages. The United Nations Secretary-General warned in November that South Sudan stood on the edge of the abyss, with a catastrophe imminent. Around one-and-a-half million refugees have fled to neighbouring countries, while almost two million persons are internally displaced. Some four million persons are short of food, with more than one million children under the age of five acutely malnourished. There is a danger of widespread famine later this year.  Faced with this bleak situation, the European Union is very much engaged in addressing these immense challenges. The European Union, as a witness to the 2015 peace agreement, is working vigorously to support its implementation. The European Union is an active member of the peace monitoring institutions established by the agreement and is providing financial assistance for implementation of parts of the agreement. The European Union works as closely as possible with the countries of the region and with the Intergovernmental Authority on Development and the African Union collectively to encourage implementation of the peace agreement. Although South Sudan, much to our regret, has not yet acceded to the Cotonou Agreement and is therefore not eligible for the full range of development support, the European Union remains committed to help. In 2016, the European Union provided EUR 143 million for humanitarian assistance to South Sudan, as well as for supporting the provision of basic services. We fear that this year’s needs maybe even greater.  The European Union is also providing financial assistance to neighbouring countries to assist them to deal with the enormous influx of refugees. Let me take this opportunity to commend Uganda, in particular, for its compassion and efficiency in sheltering over 650 000 refugees.  The European Union has imposed an arms embargo against South Sudan and is lobbying – so far without success – for the United Nations Security Council to follow suit.  The European Union is particularly shocked at the gross violation of international human rights and international humanitarian law that have been perpetrated by all parties with complete impunity. An individual who orders or commits criminal acts of violence must be brought to justice. To this end, the European Union stands ready to support the African Union in establishing as rapidly as possible the hybrid court for South Sudan envisaged in the peace agreement.  Let us seize the opportunity today to send a number of clear messages to all parties in South Sudan. There can be no military solution to the divisions of South Sudan. All parties must observe the ceasefire in full and repudiate any speech inciting ethnic hatred. The United Nations mission in South Sudan must be allowed to exercise its mandate in full, and without hindrance. The regional protection force that was mandated by the UN Security Council last year to reinforce the United Nations mission in South Sudan must be deployed swiftly. The South Sudanese authorities must allow unrestricted humanitarian access to those in need. All parties must be brought into an inclusive political process based on the 2015 peace agreement, which remains a blueprint, if properly implemented, for establishing a functional institutional framework for the state of South Sudan.  We welcome the national dialogue announced by President Salva Kiir in December last year. Any step to foster dialogue and reconciliation between many groups in South Sudan is welcome. A political dialogue and consultation should be representative of, and trusted by, the entire population of South Sudan. Such a process should be initiated without delay and without obstacles. There is no shortcut to full and fair representation. I urge President Salva Kiir and the transitional government to look again at the structure of the national dialogue, with a view to ensuring that it is a generally inclusive process. In particular, we hope that a way can be found, and should be found, to allow the South Sudanese Council of Churches, which is widely seen as an impartial interlocutor, to play a central role in the national dialogue.  Let me also mention the Cotonou Agreement again. As mentioned, the development needs of South Sudan are evidently vast, yet we cannot release all the funds potentially available as long as South Sudan has not acceded to the Agreement. We urge the transitional government to move forward rapidly with accession. South Sudan is, sadly, a country which has known more war than peace.  The European Union will continue, in close coordination with the United Nations, the African Union, the United States and the countries of the region, to do everything it can to support the South Sudanese leadership to take decisive steps to embrace peace and to build a state that serves the interests of its citizens. Thank you very much for your attention. I look forward to our discussion.

Dare I say, at a time when the European Union is shrinking thanks to Brexit, it is encouraging to see that the African Union is actually expanding.

It is an optimistic picture, but reality has denied these fragile arrangements because, despite the fact that over the years there has been a massive injection of resources for development aid and the creation of an administrative system, the representatives of the two main factions, President Kiir and the Vice President Machar, they broke government cohabitation driven by ancient ethnic rifts accentuated by the oil interests at stake. The UN mission has proved powerless in restoring the rule of law and has only succeeded in creating sites for the protection of civilians fleeing violence, while the Regional Protection Force authorized by the Security Council is still far from materializing.

As you know, our relationship is based on the principles and essential elements of the Cotonou Agreement and especially respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law. And, of course, we support the implementation of the African Charter on elections, democracy and governance.  The stability of Gabon and the Democratic Republic of Congo is of primary interest to the European Union, but genuine peace, stability and development do not come through enforced preservation of the status quo and repression of opposition voices.  On the Democratic Republic of Congo, the European Union considers that the political agreement signed on 31 December last year represents important progress, with remarkable mediation done by DRC Catholic bishops. The challenge now is to implement and to do it quickly. It is imperative that the transition period towards elections be as short as possible. In order to achieve this, the bishops should not be left alone and the European Union will actively seek the engagement of the region, as well as the United Nations, in pushing Congolese political actors to implement the agreement. A new government reflecting the inclusive support for the agreement must be in place as soon as possible. The DRC parliament will have a loaded agenda in its March session with the legislative acts necessary to move ahead with elections and the institutionalisation of the Comité National de Suivi, the oversight body that will also watch over the independence of the Electoral Commission. The Electoral Commission will then produce an electoral calendar that will reflect the urgency for holding elections and utmost care for the costs of the operation in a country that is experiencing a severe fiscal crisis and is failing to provide essential services to its population.  The European Union is ready to support this process politically and operationally, providing expertise when required to both national and international actors involved. The resolution of the Security Council that will be renewing the mandate of MONUSCO in March 2017, will be an important step in establishing a global consensus around the political agreement. This is important, as the legitimacy of President Kabila no longer rests on the constitution alone, but on inclusive political support for the agreement. The European Union imposed restrictive measures in December. The warning given in the EU Council conclusions of 23 May 2016 still stands. Individuals responsible for violence and those trying to obstruct a solution to the crisis in the DRC will be targeted. We shall exert vigilance on the human rights situation, on fundamental freedoms, including freedom of expression, and we are dedicating increased resources to that effect.  Let me now address Gabon. The electoral violence following the presidential elections of 27 August last year and climate of fear, repression and intimidation that followed and continues today, is an issue of great concern. Arbitrary arrests, long-term detentions, inhuman conditions and excessive restrictions of freedom of expression, assembly and manifestation are alarming. Grave human rights violations, including alleged torture, extra—judicial killings and disappearances, call for an independent investigation without any delay. We strongly encourage an independent inquiry in Gabon to conduct a quick fact-finding mission.  We also welcome the initiatives by the Gabonese Government, the opposition and civil society to request a preliminary inquiry into the post—electoral violence from the International Criminal Court. The European Union has also activated the human rights defenders mechanism to protect civil society activists in Gabon whose personal security was at risk.  We cannot disregard the conduct of the elections. The conclusions of the EU Election Observation Mission were clear. They do not allow us to turn the page and to carry on with ‘business as usual’. EU relations with Gabon have been reassessed and the Gabonese Government was invited to an intensified political dialogue with the European Union. The dialogue aims to accompany the government in their announced electoral and institutional reforms, based on the Election Observation Mission’s recommendations and to shed light on the human rights violations. We expect the government to recognise its best interest to engage in this constructive diplomatic exercise in order to avoid further consequences. Some of them are mentioned in the draft resolution before this House, such as individual measures, a review of our development cooperation or consultation under Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement. In concluding, let me express my gratitude both for the debates and for the resolutions of the European Parliament, which reassure us in our firm diplomatic and development actions, and for your participation in the EU Electoral Mission.

I think we have to send a clear message. In Africa, in some African countries many things are happening that we should not consent to, but it is true that our possibilities of action are limited. But, regarding those possibilities of action that we have, we must be firm and forceful. How many times have we brought the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the debate in this house? Many times. We almost designed what was going to happen, month after month. And yet, we have not been able to intervene to stop what is being, on the one hand, a mockery of President Kabila towards his own people, but also a mockery of his commitments to the European institutions. We have to repeat to the African countries that democracy is a game of rules that no one can break. And that, in the dialogue that they maintain with us, third countries must be clear that we are not going to compromise with some of the drifts that are taking place, for example, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or in Gabon.

Even if it is fragile, it does exist, and we must be vigilant. On the other hand, in Gabon, I find that Europe has been quite absent, perhaps also because the French presidency is not dynamic enough to show the aberrations that have taken place in these elections. Ms. Gabrielle's report is very clear. It shows that there was ballot stuffing and that the results are completely aberrant. This is where Europe must intervene, to take sanctions. What I have heard about the Gabonese is that they no longer want travel visas for Ali Bongo's family; for the members of the government, those responsible for the coup and the repression, they want a ban on residence and movement in the European Union, a ban on aerial flights and a freeze of assets in Europe. If we do that, it will weaken the regime, and we expect the population to explode.

As regards the Democratic Republic of Congo, the European Union will remain vigilant and ready to use all instruments available to ensure that a transition period will end with democratic and transparent elections.

I am strongly committed to eliminating this practice. I stand for zero tolerance for it and I call on all of you to join me in this. I welcome the opportunity to discuss it with you today, ahead of the International Day of Zero Tolerance for FGM on 6 February. The estimated figures are really shocking, with half a million women and girls being victims of FGM in Europe, and 125 million worldwide. Thousands of girls are at risk of FGM. I would like to update you today on what the Commission has done in this area since we last discussed this serious issue in 2015. We have been following the 2013 action plan, the Communication ‘Towards the elimination of FGM’, and its five defined priorities: improving data collection and knowledge, prevention, prosecution, protection and eliminating FGM worldwide. In the strategic engagement for gender equality we commit ourselves to continue with the implementation of the measures set out in the communication.  I am proud to announce that this week a complex web-based knowledge platform, which serves as an online EU-wide multilingual resource and education centre for professionals, has been launched. It provides easily—accessible and culturally—appropriate information and support to professionals from diverse backgrounds across the EU. The aim is to raise awareness of FGM, to effectively deliver victim support and to protect women and girls living with, or at risk of, FGM. We reach out to all relevant professionals, including nurses, doctors, midwives, lawyers, judges, prosecutors, police officers, asylum officers, teachers, social workers, child protection professionals and also reporters and journalists. This project has gone live, also due the commitment of Parliament to this cause. I count on your further support to ensure a wide dissemination of the information on this new tool.  In addition, together with the European Institute for Gender Equality, we have developed a methodology to estimate the risk of FGM in different Member States, and we have funded a prevalence study to get more understanding of the phenomenon. We are working on the revision of the EU guidelines on the promotion and protection of the rights of the child. Preventive and protective measures against FGM are foreseen to be part of the recommendations towards Member States, notably with regard to children in migration. We are enforcing a correct and timely implementation of the Victims’ Rights Directive, which is of particular importance for victims of gender-based violence, including FGM, as it ensures access to free-of-charge and confidential specialist support services, including trauma support and counselling. In the proposed amendments to the Common European Asylum System we strengthen the safeguards for protection of persons with specific needs, including women applicants who have experienced gender-based harm. Access to medical care, legal support and appropriate trauma counselling and psychosocial care is to be ensured. The European Asylum Support Office has developed a practical support tool for the identification of persons with special needs and applies a training module on gender, gender identity and sexual orientation to officers.  Last, but not least, we are funding transnational projects that combat harmful practices such as FGM, both in the EU and beyond. In concrete terms, this means EUR 4.5 million in the Rights Equality and Citizenship Programme and EUR 11 million in the UNICEF Joint Programme on the abandonment of FGM.  Last year, I visited NGOs that help victims and support women who have undergone FGM and that focus on the prevention of girls from being cut. I have spoken to the women and men dedicated to ending this practice and listened to their concerns. One of the recurring issues was the prevailing lack of knowledge and understanding of professionals. This impedes girls and women in Europe from getting the best possible care and from having all their rights respected. If a doctor is surprised or horrified when an infibulated woman visits him or her, this can cause shame and certainly it would be a hurdle for visiting again and receiving appropriate care. If a police officer believes this is just a part of the culture, rather than a serious infringement of rights, coming forward can become so much harder. If a teacher has never heard of FGM, it will be impossible to pick up any signals and prevent a young girl from being cut. Hence, it is important to encourage all relevant professionals to act accordingly and provide care, protection and prevention. I believe the FGM platform we are launching these days, calling to unite to end FGM will be an important contribution to end this practice in Europe.  Finally, as you know, I have dedicated this year as a year of focused actions to combat violence against women. I will continue to fight harmful practices such as FGM as part of it, and count on your support.

There is no place for such a practice in any civilised society. This so—called tradition, like many others, is nothing but a violation of women’s rights which goes back many centuries, and we can no longer tolerate it happening in the 21st century. We should be committed every day, not just on the International Day of Zero Tolerance for Female Genital Mutilation as such.  The EU has been advancing on this file. However, we should strengthen the instruments at our disposal. As regards supporting victims of FGM, the provisions of the EU Directive on Victims’ Rights apply to all victims of crime, including FGM. The signing of the Directive on Victims’ Rights meant that tremendous progress was made in strengthening victims’ rights. The European Parliament, as co—legislator, had as a clear objective to seriously recognise the needs of victims in criminal proceedings. We now need to focus on the implementation of this important piece of EU legislation, which should have been transposed into national law by all EU Member States by November 2015. However, progress made on the transposition front is very disappointing. I would like to ask the Commissioner about the state of play of implementation. Another complementary tool in the fight against FGM was the Istanbul Convention as it was the first treaty to recognise that FGM exists in Europe and needs to be systematically addressed. I would therefore repeat my call on the Commission and on the Council to undertake whatever is needed to make the EU accession to the Istanbul Convention happen as soon as possible.

It has nothing to do with religion, but it has all to do with patriarchy. It is also symptomatic for me that the clitoris almost everywhere has been systematically neglected and erased. Many people don’t even know what it looks like, and the dictionaries in 2017 still get it wrong. This is what it looks like, a real-sized clitoris. This is a simple 3D print that I think every woman should be proud to be in possession of, because knowing your body is also a way to take back control, to take back power. This is being used by many FGM activists that fight against FGM, and it gives us the power to protect it.  Saying a firm ‘no’ to FGM for me also means that we have to have protective laws and we have to provide strong support to the grassroots organisations that work on this. But saying no to FGM also demands that we say no to all forms of patriarchal control of our bodies.

I recognize that it is not easy to face this complex web of discrimination, customs, ignorance and religion that enslaves so many innocent girls who suffer mutilation in silence that will mark them for the rest of their lives. It is necessary to change the mentality to achieve the abandonment of the knife, which endangers not only physical but also psychological integrity. Our action must not be aggressive, but must aim at raising awareness of the communities that practice it and at education, since it is the best way to combat this scourge, which has a very strong cultural resistance. The women assume it, but the drivers are the men, obviously because they do not mutilate them. Unfortunately, a woman who is not mutilated is considered impure, as a result of which she suffers from social exclusion.

Thank you for this, because it is very encouraging.  I would like to comment on some of your proposals or comments. I spoke to many professionals, including the people working in the FGM Network, which was mentioned here by Ms Ward, and they always speak about very complex phenomena. Of course, I always say that we should do more law enforcement, and fight against this crime by means of criminal justice. But I always hear horrible stories about the custom of taking a girl to Africa for a summer holiday and then doing it to her there in Africa. When she comes back and the parents or the granny are on European soil could and should be prosecuted, the professionals tell me it would be further trauma for the girl. There are many stories of this kind, so we need to understand very well the complexity of this phenomenon and to use really efficient measures which will bring about a difference. We speak about ‘zero tolerance’: there are several factors which are necessary. The first thing is political will. We must be absolutely clear that there is no excuse for it, based on some something like tradition or culture. This must be absolutely clear to everyone – all politicians, all influential people must know that this is a crime which must be punished. To my taste, we suffer from too much relativism in many other important things. Here, we should not do this.  The second thing – and I spoke about it before – is that professionals, from teachers to nurses, doctors, police and prosecutors, must understand what this is about and how to fight against it and engage with it. Thirdly, the law enforcement side, which I have also mentioned: there must be no excuse, but there must also be proper provision of care to the victims, because this must be balanced. And the fourth thing, which I find the most difficult but also the most important factor, is that we here with a kind of taboo. In violence against women, we fight against the fact that quite a large part of our societies think that it is normal. With FGM, we see that we have to fight against a taboo. I myself go to many conferences, I speak to many people, and I always mention FGM because it must be heard by hundreds of thousands of people in Europe, and I always receive the same reaction: ‘What? FGM in Europe in the 21st century?’ There is such a low awareness about this phenomenon that we have to do more, and I agree with some of the comments I heard here that it must not be at our seminars and conferences where the people who know about it are participating. We must not invade the open door – we have to address the communities where this barbaric habit is being carried out.  As you know we are now running a campaign against violence against women. To my disappointment, the Member States where we have identified high numbers – France, Portugal, UK, Sweden, Belgium, Cyprus, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain, and I am naming without shaming but we must be aware of where this happening – have not asked for money to fight against this. But I don’t want to say that they are not doing anything, because they have their own policy, and it was said here clearly that first of all it is the task of the Member States to take the necessary action against this. But, coming back to the need to address the communities, we have opened the call for proposals for the NGOs, and I will encourage the NGOs from these countries which I mentioned to ask for the funding and to go more closely into the communities and to work on the ground. This is to be closed on 8 March. There is EUR 6 million. If you know about those NGOs who could help, please let them know. This is now a practical thing.  I know I have been speaking for too long, but I will finalise quickly. I have mentioned the Member States where we see high figures, but the statistics are still very inaccurate. We still do not have proper data collection, and this is also connected with the taboo factor. We have to be much better, and as I said we are working with the Agency on Gender Equality. We are also pushing for the adoption of the Istanbul Convention. I will talk about it tomorrow with Maltese Minister Ms Helena Dalli, who is very much engaged with it. I hope we can achieve it at the March Council or in June. We have the signatures of 28 Member States, but the ratification of only 14, unfortunately.  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for your support. FGM is one of those matters where I will always feel we do not do enough, that we need to do more, and that if we do it together it will be more successful.

The leading banana producer in the world and the leading exporter to the Union, Ecuador will now benefit from a significant reduction in customs duties for its exports to the Union. This obviously changes the situation and risks destabilizing the European banana industry in the long term. However, this plays an essential economic role in the outermost regions of Europe. It is the source of some 37,000 jobs. It should also be remembered that the banana is part of the European list of so-called \"sensitive\" agricultural products and that it meets high sustainability standards in social, environmental or health matters, standards that are not applied in the production chain. Latin American. In this context, it is therefore very important that European banana producers are better protected. That is why I am very happy that our Parliament's position has been heard and taken into account by the Commission and the Council. I especially thank our curator, Cécilia Malmström. I also want to thank the chairman of our INTA committee, the shadow rapporteurs and the colleagues who have been deeply involved in this dossier. Thanks to all of you, we have a text which constitutes substantial progress and which provides concrete answers to preserve our industry. From now on, producers will not only be better informed, but they will also be more involved in monitoring market developments. The Commission will have to carry out an annual and in-depth study of the situation on the European banana market and that of European producers, including after the mechanism expires. It will also have to involve the Member States and the parties stakeholders, by allowing them to exchange views in the context of ad hoc meetings on developments in the European banana market. This is important and it responds directly to a major demand from producers. This will make it possible to establish a regular dialogue between the stakeholders and the Commission and to address all the concerns of producers, such as the evolution of volumes and the impact of imports on prices and on European production. The Commission will also have to improve its statistical databases in order to allow much more detailed and regular monitoring of the situation on the European banana market, and to make this data more accessible. Finally, and this is very important, an early warning mechanism is created when 80% of the trigger volume of the stabilization mechanism is reached by one of the countries covered by the mechanism. The Commission will now have a legal obligation to inform Parliament and the Council in writing. It should also provide all the statistical data and import volumes for the other eight countries covered, so that stakeholders can have a general overview of the situation and better predict future overruns. If the thresholds are found to be exceeded by one of the countries covered by the mechanism, the Commission will have a legal obligation to act, either by temporarily suspending the preferential rights, or by demonstrating that such an imposition is not required. The Commission will have to carry out a full assessment of the functioning of the mechanism by 1 January 2019, i.e. one year before its expiry. If, at the end of this assessment, it considers that the situation of producers has deteriorated, it will have to extend the period of validity of the mechanism after agreement of the stakeholders. The Commission will also have to continue to conduct annual analyzes of the market situation, of those of producers after 2020, and take action in the event of production degradation.All of these changes will apply to Peru, Colombia, Ecuador, but also to the Central American countries which are parties to the association agreement with the European Union.Our Parliament will be vigilant with regard to the application of the joint declaration which now binds our three institutions and with respect to the commitment made by the Commission during our trilogues to precede any new free trade agreement by a studyimpact on our outermost regions.I hope that this report will be widely adopted tomorrow by our Parliament.We will thus have done useful work for these regions so important to our Europe.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Liberals and centrists"}, {"id": 240, "date": "2017-02-01.json", "name": "Cecilia MALMSTRÖM", "mepid": "4273", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, following Parliament’s consent on 14 December on the Protocol of Accession of Ecuador, I am very pleased to confirm that this agreement has been provisionally applied since 1 January this year. This is good news because a new trade agreement that creates new export opportunities for Ecuador – and of course opportunities for our goods and services – is also very good news for Ecuador. It is the first trade agreement with a developed country, an agreement that respects the level of development in Ecuador, and provides the opportunity for them to diversify the economy, reduce dependency on oil exports and raw materials and create new jobs for Ecuadorians.  I would like to thank the Committee on International Trade, and its rapporteur, Mr Scholz, for the work that it did to make this agreement possible. Since the agreement has been applied, the next step is, of course, to amend the banana stabilisation mechanism as well, and that is what we are debating today. This mechanism needed to be amended to incorporate Ecuador.  I very much welcome the constructive discussions and the agreement that we reached just before Christmas under the leadership of the rapporteur, Mrs de Sarnez, and also the co-rapporteurs, shadow rapporteurs and the Chairman, Mr Lange. The banana stabilisation mechanism, to which imports of bananas from Ecuador will be subject, is a good and efficient mechanism to ensure stability in the EU market in case of a surge in imports of bananas from Ecuador. Mrs de Sarnez gave a very long explanation of its content, but let me just reiterate the main points.  With the amendments proposed by this Parliament, the amending regulation further improves the mechanism. There will be an early warning mechanism when imports reach 80% of their relevant yearly threshold. Transparency will be improved, and data on imports will be made regularly available and in a user—friendly manner. Finally, the institutions also agreed that before the stabilisation mechanism expires at the end of 2019, the Commission will assess the situation of EU banana producers. Even after the expiry, we will continue to regularly analyse the state of the market and the EU producers and, where necessary, take appropriate action. In the light of this provisional application of the trade agreement since January, I hope that this amended regulation on the banana stabilisation mechanism can be adopted, hopefully voted on with a big majority tomorrow, and then applied as soon as possible.

For many, it was much more important to approve the agreement with Ecuador than to guarantee the future of the banana sector. It was not for me, but it was for many and for that reason I really thank the commissioner for getting involved, almost at the last moment, but it was enough that she got involved and that this went ahead. Because we have to remember the reality: producers in the outermost regions are always the losers of free trade agreements and that is why these safeguard clauses and the stabilization mechanism are important, because perhaps it is the last resort that our producers have to do. versus imports, very often led by powerful multinationals that control markets worldwide. When we faced this debate, we did it knowing that the mechanism had not worked until now. It was not working well and we have seen it with a very clear example, that of Peru, which for four years has widely exceeded the threshold set by the agreement and nothing had been done about it. For this reason, we understood that this system had to be modified and I think it has been modified on the right track. I am not going to explain the characteristics much, because both the rapporteur and the commissioner have already said them, but I do believe that it is good that there is this early warning mechanism that obliges the Commission to alert Parliament and the Council when the volume of imports reach 80% of the thresholds.

It simultaneously increases the risk that Andean countries will lose the preferential tariffs which underpin the livelihoods of poor farmers in countries like Ecuador, where 200 000 families depend on banana production, and 56% of the banana plantations are smaller than 10 hectares. The Greens’ priority for trade is to ensure a comfortable life for all, without wasting energy and resources. Our priority for agriculture is to protect the livelihoods of small producers against the power of global corporations. This regulation does nothing to constrain the power of such powerful retailers, who undermine the minimum wage in the Ecuadorian banana sector. This so-called safeguard regulation dismisses social and ecological aspects of production, and should leave a bitter taste in the mouths of the millions of European consumers who choose a banana before other locally grown fruit.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 246, "date": "2017-02-01.json", "name": "Gilles LEBRETON", "mepid": "124738", "text": "on behalf of the ENF group. - Mr President, the opening up of the European banana market to Ecuador is a major risk for West Indian producers.

We are about to raise standards in the management of the EU external fishing fleet. For many years the EU had a very bad reputation when fishing outside EU waters, but for the last ten years things have considerably improved with the control regulation, the IUU regulation and the reformed CFP in place. The report that we are going to vote on tomorrow is a regulation that is part of the EU control system on fisheries. It is actually the most fundamental one because it decides who shall have the right to fish outside EU waters. We can be proud of ourselves for we have voted for a very ambitious Parliament position in the committee vote. On several points we have strengthened the Commission proposal, which I have to say was a very good proposal to start with. For instance, we have added that EU vessels can only get direct authorisations if there is a surplus of fish available that the coastal state cannot catch. We have added that fishing on the high seas must be based on a scientific evaluation, showing the sustainability of that fishing activity. We introduced the requirement that vessels returning to the EU fleet register must provide their complete flag history during their period off the register. But, above all, we agreed that the new public register on authorisations must also include the name of the owner of the company, as well as the beneficial owner. This would then mean that, for the first time, we will see who benefits from global fishing through a public register. Tomorrow we will vote in plenary, and some things are still to be settled. It is an important principle that only EU vessels with a clean record of compliance should be able to fish outside EU waters. This is already a provision in the current regulation that we need to keep. Otherwise we undermine our own credibility in our work to curb the IUU fishing of other fishing nations. So it is crucial to reinstate Article 5.1(d) that fell in a tight vote in the Committee. I therefore urge you, colleagues, to vote against Amendment 30 and to support Amendment 78. Another fundamental principle is the exclusivity clause in the sustainable fisheries partnership agreements. This is stipulated in Article 31 of the basic regulation. I agree that there could be situations when the Commission should try to reactivate so—called dormant agreements. This idea was adopted in Amendment 18 in the Committee vote. But under no circumstances should fishing vessels be allowed to engage in direct authorisations, just like that, if there has not been any protocol in force for three years. This is exactly what Amendment 48 suggests. It suggests that fishing could start again without any prior assessment of the situation, yet there can be many reasons why there is no protocol in force – for example that the fish stocks situation does not allow for more fishing or the coastal state wants to keep the resource to itself for political reasons. That is why the Commission first needs to assess the situation and check coherence with other EU policies, such as developing and foreign policies. The Commission needs to ensure a level playing field. So please join me and delete Amendment 48, which is in fact not in line with the basic regulation.

The proposal on the sustainable management of the external fleets is of prime importance to reinforce the role of the European Union as a key global actor in fisheries and in ocean governance. With the new rules, the Commission aims to create a benchmark at international level regarding the management and the control of external fleets. I am pleased to see that the overwhelming majority of the amendments tabled follow this objective overall, and even reinforce the key elements of our proposal. The Commission would therefore be favourable to these amendments as long as they do not lead to disproportionate administrative burdens for our Member States and for our operators. The efforts deployed so far to simplify the text, reduce administrative burdens and improve the consistency and structure of the proposal could be of inspiration during the upcoming trilogues.  In relation to the database I am confident we will be able to increase openness and transparency, while striking a good balance with respect for sensitive, personal and commercial data. In order to maintain the reputation of the EU’s external fleet, we need to ensure that only good conduct vessels and operators complying with the rules are allowed to fish outside EU waters. Therefore, a clean record from sanctions for serious infringements in the last 12 months should be one of the conditions for a fishing authorisation.  Finally, as you know, the European Union is responsible for the activities of its vessels operating outside EU waters, and that is why it is particularly important to allow the Commission to withdraw the fishing authorisation of a vessel when the flag Member State does not take action to stop that vessel from causing damage. The Union has now become a strong global actor in shaping international oceans governance, and this has to be reflected also in our legislation and in our actions. I therefore trust that together we will manage to improve fisheries governance through better control and monitoring of our extended fleet. Let me thank you once again for this report and for the fruitful upcoming discussion.

I think we have achieved a somewhat improved text by reducing the bureaucratic burden, especially in the so-called private agreements, by introducing a fast track; The procedure for granting licenses has also been changed, allowing Member States to better control the process. Logically, there are also points with which I do not fully agree, including the one referring to the Union's fishing authorization register (Article 39). The text approved by the Fisheries Commission seems excessive to me: it requires the publication of data that could threaten the privacy of companies and make them reveal their business strategies. Your original proposal, Commissioner, seems to me much more balanced. My political group supports transparency, but this regulation does not seem to me the ideal one to regulate a matter that is horizontal in nature. I want to dwell on the so-called double sanction, that of article 5, paragraph 1, which I understand penalizes without a license boats that had been sanctioned a year before the authorization request. We managed to remove this provision in the Committee on Fisheries, but now - as you see - it is brought back to plenary with an amendment. This rule, which may be counterproductive, would seriously harm the Union's external fleet. Due to their special characteristics, in many cases these vessels cannot be converted and fish in Union waters. The one-year stoppage would imply unaffordable economic losses. It is not consistent either with the basic Regulation, which says that the European Union must contribute to sustainable, economically viable and job-creating fishing activities. And furthermore, this requirement does not apply to the fleet operating in Union waters, thus creating a situation of discrimination. For all this, I ask for the support of the amendment 30, which is the position that was approved in the Fisheries Commission.Commissioner, legislation on fisheries must also take into account its economic and social dimension.We cannot make it impossible for the European fishing fleet to fish in third country waters.We will harm employment, we will harm our companies and we will favor fleets from third countries, which are much less controlled and fish in an unsustainable way", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 263, "date": "2017-02-01.json", "name": "Ricardo SERRÃO SANTOS", "mepid": "124741", "text": "on behalf of the S & amp; D Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, first of all, I must congratulate the rapporteur on the inclusive work she has done with the shadow rapporteurs and their teams. We may not agree with some details, but everything was done with openness, clarity and commitment on the part of all the political groups that were involved in the discussion of a regulation that has enormous relevance for the management of external fisheries. As time is short, I want to focus on three essential points. First, I think it is essential not to expunge this regulation from a provision that already existed beforehand and which makes it possible to penalize access to international fishing agreements to vessels and master fishermen who have committed serious infringements. It would be a historic setback in the context of European legislation. Secondly, it seems to me essential to ensure that there is transparency regarding information on vessels fishing in international waters, what are the associated fishing opportunities, who are their owners and, very importantly, who are the final beneficiaries, that is , who are the beneficial owners. We must ensure that European fisheries are not used as a tool for tax evasion or money laundering. Finally, I would like to explain why it seems to me important to prevent dormant international agreements from perpetuating. When certifying the legality and transparency of the sector, which is guaranteed precisely by this regulation, then we also have to ensure that dormant agreements are not perpetuated to the detriment of the fleets of the Member States of the European Union, with harmful effect downstream and , while we are asleep, we promote the establishment of doubtful and malevolent fleets.

A European flag on the back of a fishing boat should symbolize responsible management. Unfortunately, the fishing vessels from, for example, China and Russia apply different principles. Europe must not participate in this, but the European Union must set a good example.

I want to thank the rapporteur and the rest for the work done and say that the external dimension of the CFP obliges the entire European fleet to comply with the same rules and to operate with the same principles inside and outside our waters. This Regulation will improve the transparency, control and sustainability of the activities of the more than seven hundred European vessels that fish under agreements with third countries, under United Nations legislation, through private agreements or carrying out activities on the high seas. The first success is thus to control the fleet regardless of its type of activity, establish procedures against abusive flag changes and authorize fishing rights only when there are surpluses not used by local communities. The second, to establish more and better control measures, such as the electronic register of ships of the European Union or the European supervision of authorizations. The third, the legal certainty that it adds for all operators. However, we want the common eligibility criteria that should be required for licensing to only apply to vessels and not to operators or captains. Thus, we want to avoid double sanctions for the fleet and operators of the States that have best applied the 2009 Control Regulation.

Last year, however, the Spanish Supreme Court overcame the application of this principle in a case that will have strong far-reaching repercussions and may seriously undermine Spain's possibilities to strengthen the provisions of the CFP and thus fisheries control. A well-known fishing company was accused, among other things, of falsifying documents and committing crimes against the environment while fishing in the Antarctic, for a turnover of 100 million euros. Unfortunately, Spanish law alone does not have the legal tools to condemn shipowners, who could be a school for other illegal fishing companies. This case demonstrates the absolute need for a strengthening of common rules in the control of fishing in external waters, as well as in continental waters. Member States alone are clearly unable to do this themselves. As the rapporteur has already said, this regulation is essential and it is necessary, in particular, to vote against amendments 30 and 48.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 268, "date": "2017-02-01.json", "name": "Mike HOOKEM", "mepid": "124957", "text": "  on behalf of the EFDD Group. – Mr President, tonight we debate sustainability, and I see by the numbers tonight the importance this European Parliament puts on the jobs of UK fishermen.

The point on which I would like to draw the attention of this House is that relating to dormant agreements, which at present create a regulatory vacuum that could undermine the sustainability of resource management in waters outside the European Union. In fact, these are partnership agreements whose operational protocol has expired and not renewed and which, as a result of the exclusivity clause contained therein, do not allow direct authorizations in favor of boats flying the EU flag. The concrete risk of these agreements is that non-EU countries that do not recognize the high standards of sustainability like us - for example social and economic sustainability - may take over the capture of surpluses in a predatory way and that do not take into account the aspects of cooperation to basis of our agreements. Indeed, it must be emphasized that the EU's external fishing fleets represent the CFP at the international level and the European Union has achieved remarkable results in terms of sustainability standards, which must be consistently achieved also in the external dimension.

This week, I had the pleasure of discussing with many of you the importance of ocean governance at the Seas, Rivers, Islands and Coastal Areas Intergroup. Your vote on this proposal will be a very important step towards improving ocean governance overall. It will contribute to the sustainable exploitation of global fisheries resources. The European Union must be seen to act responsibly outside its own waters if we expect others also to fish sustainably. We are accountable for the actions of our own fleets. We need to provide these vessels with clear, simple and coherent rules in order to ensure that fishing authorisations are granted on objective and proportionate eligibility criteria, and that vessel activities are constantly monitored and transparent. The Commission proposal, which you will soon discuss in trialogues, presents an approach that will achieve these objectives. I welcome Ms Engström’s report, which reinforces our policy objectives and brings in some constructive suggestions as well. Turning to some of the specific points raised by Members this evening, some of you do not agree that past serious infringements should be taken into account in granting authorisations – I am referring to Amendment 30. I think that this measure is proportionate and justified. We should ensure that only good conduct vessels are allowed to fish outside EU waters, and the absence of serious – let stress and underline the word ‘serious’ – infringements in the last 12 months is a good indication of good conduct. It is also a cost—effective way to control who can fish outside our waters and who cannot.  There were also some comments on the clawback clause. The European Union is responsible before third countries and international organisations for the activities of its vessels operating outside EU waters. Not having a legal basis to stop fishing vessels from causing harm without the impunity of the flagged Member State would put the European Union in a situation of not being able to comply with its international obligation of due diligence, as pointed out by the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS). The clawback clause allows the Commission to withdraw a fishing authorisation in cases where Member States do not stop fishing vessels flying their flag in the cases provided by the law and where those vessels continue fishing, causing harm.  There was also some mention of the dormant agreements and, although we sympathise, we cannot accept them for legal reasons. We understand that this is an important issue for a number of Members, and our proposal addresses direct authorisations with the objective of ensuring sustainability. This may eventually lead to our reviewing dormant agreements in the context of the negotiation of sustainable fishing partnership agreements.  Some comments were also made about the minimum length of vessel fleets. I have to say that it is very difficult to quantify the effect of the amendment, because we do not have information on high seas fisheries conducted by the EU vessels. However, to give you an idea, in 2015 there were around 70 000 EU vessels licensed to fish in our FMOs, with the bulk coming from the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean (GFCM) and the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT). In the Mediterranean, most of the vessels are small—scale and normally fish on the high seas, although not adding a minimum length may bring problems of monitoring and control as well, because not all vessels are obliged to carry VMS, AIS and IMO numbers.  Some of you also expressed concern about data protection. As I have already said, we believe that the balance between information requirements and privacy in the proposal is the right one, but I am happy to look at proposals that would improve transparency within the limit of our data protection rules. I am sure that this will be an issue for intense discussion in the trialogues. I look forward to further working with Parliament in a good spirit of cooperation as we take this file forward.

I have some last points, and the first is that I really want to support the idea that we keep in the report the second part of Amendment 32, which gives the Commission the possibility to act if a Member State fails to. I think this is crucial as a provision to guarantee the level playing field among fleets. I hope that this will be confirmed in tomorrow’s vote. I urge you to vote in favour of Amendment 32 – all parts.  The second point is that some colleagues claim that prohibiting vessels that have committed a serious infringement from fishing abroad would be a double penalty, and this is definitely not the case, as Commissioner Vella also stressed. It is an eligibility criterion designed to ensure that only vessels with a clean record are allowed to fish outside EU waters. My last point: let me come back to Amendment 48. If vessels are allowed after three years of a dormant agreement to set up their own terms with a third country, they will be able to ignore those very provisions in the CFP that have served to improve EU standards.

Let me take this opportunity to express my heartfelt thanks to all the co-rapporteurs of the political groups who took an active part in drafting the report and enriching it in terms of content. But this report has ramified roots. In terms of content, it also involved individuals, non-governmental organizations and educational institutions that deal with this issue throughout Europe, including in practice. This breadth also seemed useful to me in preparing the draft, because due to the relatively early preparation of the report and the short deadline for the implementation of the program, I could not use the results of official research and analysis because they simply did not yet exist. The European Parliament has carried out two surveys, and the Commission has also made available everything it has had so far about the operation of this new umbrella program, which has a great deal of support from the European public. Thanks again for helping the professional services of Parliament and the Commission. It is well known that Erasmus + was created by merging various previous programs and is therefore extremely complex. Therefore, simplifications, mainly related to the digitization of application procedures and projects, are very welcome. At the same time, we emphasize the integrated approach, as Erasmus + also brings together previously established programs such as Youth in Action, Erasmus Mundus, Erasmus, Grundtvig, Comenius and Leonardo da Vinci). Despite the established horizontal integration, the Commission has managed to functionally decentralize the program and transfer responsibilities - or greater responsibilities - to national agencies. The general visibility of the Erasmus + program has increased, and the most important decision in the report is that the program is working well, that it has brought a number of innovations. But there are also disadvantages that will have to be phased out. As an example, stakeholders sometimes complain that there are still too many bureaucratic obstacles, that new information and communication technology is not the most user-friendly, that inter-ministerial cooperation is not intensive enough, that the success rate in some parts of Erasmus + is significantly too low. forward. But the biggest problem is the gap between the potential of Erasmus +, which is reflected in the large number of applications, and the real financial possibilities. In some parts of the program, as many as three quarters of projects (or applications) are rejected, even if they are of good quality because there is not enough money. A 40% increase in the budget in this financial perspective will only be felt in reality this year. This will increase the absorption capacity of Erasmus + over the next four years, with 4 million people, mostly young people, expected to benefit from the Erasmus + program by the end of 2020. In the next financial perspective, we will have to increase the budget for this program, as it has invaluable positive effects.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sl", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 285, "date": "2017-02-01.json", "name": "Milan ZVER", "mepid": "96933", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, this year we are celebrating the thirtieth anniversary of Erasmus, one of the EU’s biggest success stories. This is the perfect opportunity for us to take stock of how we have moved from Erasmus to Erasmus+ and to celebrate what we have achieved so far. It is also a greater opportunity to debate where we want to take the programme in the future.  I therefore welcome the fact that the European Parliament has appointed a standing rapporteur for the Erasmus+ Programme who keeps a critical eye on its implementation. I want to thank Mr Sver and his shadow rapporteurs for their positive and constructive report, and their suggestions, especially with a view to the upcoming mid-term evaluation of Erasmus+. I welcome this report, and I am very happy to comment on some of the points it raises. I am fully aware that Erasmus+ had some teething problems in its first year. Merging various former programmes into one and trying to apply uniform rules to the whole programme was not an easy task, but we have overcome these initial difficulties I am therefore pleased that your report recognises the efforts the Commission has put and continues to put into improving the implementation of the programme. This would not have been possible without your regular feedback and without us closely cooperating with our stakeholders and national agencies who implement the programme at national level. Your report rightly identifies the cross-sectorial approach as a main feature of Erasmus+. As you point out, we have seen many positive developments over the course of only a couple of years. What we do in education, training, youth and sport is much more visible. We have built bridges between these fears which has led to an exchange of ideas, and has also translated into a significant increase in the funding available to the benefit of all beneficiaries. Moreover, funding rules have been streamlined and simplified funding mechanisms such as lump sums have been widely introduced. Communication to beneficiaries has been streamlined and, finally, this leaner management has made the programme more flexible, so that it can respond to changing political priorities. I am very proud that Erasmus+ is a much more open and inclusive programme than its predecessors. First of all, Erasmus+ is much more than student mobility. It is about learners in vocational education and training, and youth workers. It is about providing practical support to teachers and helping organisations and educational institutions to forge international partnerships. It is about kick—starting innovation across the fields of education, training and youth. It is about supporting our sports organisations, and much more. Erasmus+ also covers important horizontal dimensions. To name just one: language learning. Language learning is definitely a must in today’s world. This is why Erasmus+ provides flexible online linguistic support in many languages. The programme also offers additional funding to disadvantaged learners, including people who come from difficult socio-economic backgrounds, or who have special needs, because these people are the ones who need the extra boost to participate in the programme. I am happy to see that as a result of our efforts, one out of ten mobility participants come from disadvantaged backgrounds or have fewer opportunities. I believe that inclusion and accessibility go hand in hand. I am therefore glad to read in your report that you appreciate our attempts to simplify the application procedures through a range of digital solutions. We have established a strong relationship with our national agencies and beneficiaries. My services have put in place a long-term IT action plan to adapt our IT tools to the needs of participants and to make the tools as user—friendly as possible. We have already achieved high satisfaction rates here, but we will keep up the work. Thanks to the use of online application forms and the online programme guide, we are now moving to the next level of digitalisation. This is in line with the call included in your report. Let me stress one more thing: if we are to ensure the future success of the programme and the positive impact it has on the lives of so many young people across Europe, we need adequate funding. Already now, the programme is heavily over-subscribed, and as you rightly say in your report, it creates frustration when high—quality projects have to be turned down for the simple reason of lack of funds. Given the back—loading of the programme, which means that most of the funds earmarked for Erasmus+ will be spent between now and 2020 when the current programme ends, we need an increase of funds for the next programming period, just to maintain current funding levels. The thirtieth anniversary of Erasmus+ this year provides us with an excellent opportunity to make the case for such an increase. As you know, just last week we organised a launch event at the Parliamentarium for a year full of anniversary events all across Europe. I would like to invite you all to get involved in these events, as we have so much to learn from listening to the Erasmus generation and their ideas. We need to involve them in building a stronger, better Europe.  Honourable Members, your report is a manifestation of our shared dedication to the programme and of our constructive relationship. I want to thank you for the time and effort you have devoted to drafting it. Let me assure you that your conclusions and recommendations will be carefully taken into account in the ongoing mid-term evaluation of the programme. Together we can make sure that Erasmus+ will continue to be one of Europe’s greatest success stories.

We present all this in our report, and I would like to thank my colleague Zver, who deals with it in great detail, for this report. After less than three years, I must state that the Erasmus + brand meant visibility and simplification of communication. Everyone knows that there is mobility and partnership for all groups, from teachers to pupils to volunteers and athletes. Nevertheless, we have demands for improvement. An increase in the budget of 40% for this period is excellent, but we will need more to make the success even higher and also to make it more efficient, so it is necessary to simplify the administration, such as simplifying the program guide. Erasmus + should also contribute more to improving language skills, to which preparation before going abroad should contribute. We would also like to strengthen the volunteer program, the forthcoming solidarity corps should not be a competition, but rather a complement to this successful volunteer program.

Erasmus is one of the most important programs contributing to a new generation of Europeans. A generation that sees international mobility and multiculturalism as an opportunity, not a threat. Therefore, we all care about the high quality of the program, its efficiency and transparency. Mr Zver's report under discussion correctly identifies the problems. I would like to highlight three aspects of this program. First of all - availability. Despite some improvement, the socially selective nature of participation in mobility persists. Many low-income people cannot afford to participate in the program without the help of third parties. In order to increase the participation opportunities for these people, Commissioner, it is necessary to align the amount of the subsidy with the cost of living in the host country. Second case - the budget. The Commissioner spoke about this. Indeed, the funds are insufficient due to the enormous popularity of the program, but therefore it is unacceptable to create new, even good, programs that are financed by Erasmus, such as the European Solidarity Corps, among others. I also propose that for those good projects that are rejected due to lack of funds, a patent should be introduced to distinguish them so that they have priority in reaching for funds from other sources. Third - student loans. The student loan guarantee instrument needs to be assessed critically. Only one hundred and thirty people have used this instrument so far. I urge the Commission, in consultation with Parliament, to present a strategy for reallocating a portion of the budget that is unlikely to be used by 2020. The last question I ask - what is the lesson from this successful program for Member States' education systems? Most importantly, learning mobility should be a permanent part of the core curriculum, both in academic education and in professional development. I sincerely hope that This is how the Member States will celebrate the 30th anniversary of Erasmus.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 288, "date": "2017-02-01.json", "name": "Angel DZHAMBAZKI", "mepid": "124873", "text": "on behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Erasmus + is an example of success in the European Union, and I hope that with common efforts this will continue.

However, we want the program to be even better, and that has been the idea of ​​this mid-term review. It is still appropriate to underline a few things that may still improve this program. One of them is that the application processes should be further simplified so that voluntary organizations in particular can be better involved in the various programs. We also need cross-sectoral cooperation in the field of education. The student loan guarantee scheme has also not really taken the wind off and has not succeeded because the banking sector rejected the initiative. New initiatives must also be taken on this side in such a way that all Europeans have the opportunity to take part in the Erasmus program. It must also be further developed. It is very important that European citizens can benefit as much as possible from this program. I can say that we need simplification, especially with regard to search processes.

And instead of drawing inspiration from the founding values ​​of our Union, for example that of the right to education, we want to transform it into a system of imitation of a system that has failed in America, namely the student loan. This is what is really happening. Since the new version of Erasmus, Erasmus +, was approved in 2014, alongside important things that we have supported, such as transparency, bureaucratic simplification and integration of disciplines, this virus has been introduced, which is that of student loan . It is a system that in the United States has caused and is causing an economic collapse, a bubble of 1 300 billion of debt - largely bad debt - that threatens to overwhelm an entire credit system. Fortunately, I must say, in Europe it has been used very little, by 130 students in these three years in just three countries. So we should change course and go back to Erasmus, which was successful.

The budget has increased by 40% in this planning period, but it is clear: that is not enough either. But above all I want to take a quick look at what still needs to be changed in order to make the Erasmus program better: Small school projects should be given more support, the importance of formal and informal learning should be recognized and, in particular, the importance of informal learning should be strengthened . We must give more consideration to disadvantaged young people and allocate more money to young people in the field of sport in the internal distribution of funds. All application procedures and electronic guides should also be simplified. I would like to mention three extra points: The European Solidarity Corps is in principle a good thing - I also support that - but it must not be paid for from Erasmus + funds, but rather the funds that are now available for it should be used for the main areas of Erasmus +. The same applies to the idea of ​​the Interrail ticket: that too is good if young people have the opportunity to travel with it, but it must not be financed from the funds of the Erasmus program. And then there is the idea - and I am very prepared, especially with Trump's policy, to think about the need for a new security policy in Europe - but the Erasmus funds should not be used first for possible military cooperation.

The report we are about to vote on constitutes a good balance between the groups. If the Erasmus + program is indeed one of the most successful programs among the European ones, nevertheless some aspects of it can be improved and the report has the merit of recognizing it. Thus, for example, it is emphasized that the loan guarantee instrument has not achieved the intended results and its critical evaluation is requested. In my opinion, it is absolutely impossible for students to have to go into debt in order to participate in the program. It is unacceptable that those who have few, sometimes very few resources must also be burdened with an additional burden. It is the community that must take charge of it. Another aspect on which the accent is correctly placed is that relating to the fact that, if on the one hand it is correct to recognize the role of volunteering within this program, on the other, however, volunteering cannot in any way replace the workforce and public investment. Finally, I consider positive the references to the need for a simplification of administrative procedures, which have often proved too cumbersome. I would like to close my speech with a general reflection: the Erasmus program is always cited - as my colleagues have done - as a positive example to demonstrate that the European Union basically works and can generate positive results. However, if the success of Erasmus is undoubted, we must not fall into the error of using this program as a propaganda tool for the European Union, because the latter is affected by too many evils that cannot and must not be overlooked, to start with austerity policies.

The program is an example of how the European Union is constantly building on successful projects and policies and delivering concrete results to its citizens. That is why, when we push for increased funding for Erasmus +, we do not just want more student exchanges, we want better trained workers with more quality skills for success in the 21st century, students who know more languages, students with professional experience from a foreign country. One example is enough to understand the importance of Erasmus + in shaping European self-awareness among young people. In 2015, the country that sent the most Erasmus students was the United Kingdom.

These grants helped – and continue to help – young people enhance their skills and employability and intercultural awareness. They also encourage young people to participate in democratic life. Compared to previous generations of programmes, the new Erasmus+ provides stronger support for learners from disadvantaged backgrounds, which I welcome. By funding cooperation projects, Erasmus+ also fosters modernisation and EU-wide collaboration, which in turn stimulate innovation, creativity and improved job prospects.  Leaving the EU will have a major impact on higher education in the UK, with an important loss of income due to a fall in the numbers of EU nationals studying in the UK. Losing access to EU funding, such as Horizon 2020 grants, which accounts for a quarter of all public investment in UK research could further tarnish the attractiveness of the UK as a place to study for international students, including those from non-EU countries.

But for the programme's success over the long term, it is essential that the Commission continues its efforts to further increase the programme's budget, also in the next period of implementation, and continues its efforts to simplify program procedures.

Both the critical and the supportive remarks are very useful to us in building up the project for the years to come and the upcoming multiannual financial framework.  Indeed, the Erasmus programme, which started its career 30 years ago as a student mobility programme, transformed into a very complex programme with higher education aspects. It is no longer only about student mobility, but strategic alliances among higher education institutions, the exchange of ideas and best practices, and a strong and institutionalised cooperation among higher education institutions. It has a chapter on volunteering which can be very useful for young Europeans to gain experience and skills in volunteering which can be used on the labour market. We have some funding programmes for sports, especially for grassroots sports, and we have projects in youth policy as well. This means that Erasmus+ is today much more than a student mobility programme. It is a complex programme for the future because it not only helps young people to find their own place in today’s and tomorrow’s societies, but it also helps them to develop a complementary European identity which is not antagonistic to local, regional or national identities, but complements them. It adds to their personality and thereby hopefully helps European integration in this very critical period.  There is, of course, a lot of room for improvement. That is why I thanked you for all the remarks which raised the issue of funding. The structure of the Erasmus+ budget is an incremental one, which means that from 2017 until 2020, there is a 10% increase in the budget, which means wider opportunities in the future. I thank you for all the critical remarks on the administrative burden. We are working on simplifying procedures and IT solutions. I understood Mr Jakovčić’s remarks on possible synergies. Together with local authorities or regional authorities, I think that could be a good opportunity for broadening the social and geographical appeal of Erasmus+ in the next period of the lifespan of that programme. All in all, Erasmus+ is a success story. We have to protect all the achievements and to improve the structure and the outcomes of Erasmus+. That is why we offer some additional policy instruments aimed at helping young people to use the best opportunities in Erasmus+, for instance the student loan or the apprenticeship and traineeship programmes in Erasmus+. In the future we would like to broaden its social appeal and we would like to make it more available for those people who come from social circumstances and a social environment which are not so fortunate.

The new European Erasmus + program therefore enjoys the kind support of all the European institutions, and Parliament in particular, and I have no doubt that tomorrow's vote will be positive.

Cross-sectoral cooperation has improved, greater decentralization in the operation of the program has been introduced, and the positive responses of participants in the program and the increase in interest in participating in it are particularly important. Therefore, it will be necessary to continue to close the gap between the limited budgetary capacity and the broad potential of the program in the future.

On the one hand, merging the different programs into a single program has increased the visibility of EU support, which has led to greater public and political attention.

The European Parliament will continue to support this great mobility program so that as many young people as possible can take part in it and, in addition to knowledge, gain cultural experiences, experiences and new skills. Multilingualism is important for improving the labor market opportunities of young people, so more Erasmus + projects are needed within the Erasmus + program, which provide opportunities for language learning and multilingual communication. The main attraction of Erasmus + is that young people who have experience in foreign universities and institutions are enriched with skills and knowledge that are a plus for them in the labor market or when starting a business. I believe that the program should also give priority to and support language learning in minority languages. It is difficult for almost all regional and minority language communities to ensure the survival and development of their languages. The Erasmus + program should support all students, regardless of whether they belong to the majority or national minority community.

Launched in 2014, Erasmus + brought together several smaller programs in the field of education, training and youth and, for the first time, included the sport sector as a new field of support. It is currently the main vehicle for supporting activities in the fields of education, training, youth and sport and should be positively assessed and implemented as such. Unfortunately, the shape of the report on the implementation of the Erasmus + program, containing recommendations for its further development, forced me to refrain from voting. The rapporteur omits the problematic aspects of the program, as well as the proposals for their correction, even though they are constantly indicated by the stakeholders themselves, i.e. the academic community.

We also need to move more in Europe. Sports policy deserves cross-sectoral reflection and more resources. The European Union has had competence in the field of sport for seven years now. My report assesses these developments and is the only one in the current parliamentary term that deals exclusively with sport. It contains the European Parliament's policy recommendations to the Member States, sports organizations and the Commission, which will carry out a mid-term review of the European Union's sports policy this spring. Concrete proposals include measures to increase physical activity, such as a proposal for a VAT reduction and other financial incentives for grassroots sport. In particular, we want to emphasize that at the grassroots level, people across Europe can move. That's where the foundation is. The report also highlights the broad economic importance of sport for society. The sports sector is growing faster than the rest of the economy, already employing around 3% and a half of European Union citizens. Other sectors in Europe could also learn from this boost in the sports sector. Exercise improves public health and thus also has a positive effect on the age structure. This has a direct link with the economies of the Member States affected by the age structure. Sport is also a fundamental right of every human being. It also helps to better integrate into society. Therefore, sports and sports services must be equally accessible to all, including people with disabilities, immigrants, young people and the elderly. Accessibility of sport is an issue that needs to be more clearly reflected in the European Union's sports policy. The Erasmus + program we just discussed is a great program and a success story, but it also needs further investment. specifically for sport. We certainly all also know that there have been nasty cases of corruption and doping in organized sport, which have tarnished the reputation of the sport. This report calls for zero tolerance for corruption in sport and makes proposals for the development of good governance in sports organizations, which often receive public support. The governance and cash flows of sports organizations must be transparent. We also emphasize ensuring the integrity of sport and measures to that end, such as the fight against match-fixing and doping. These are problems that tarnish the international reputation of sport, in which the European Union and its Member States also have an important role to play. Finally, I would like to express the hope that the European Commission will take the proposals in this report into account in the mid-term review of sport policy. As there are many proposals, monitoring should continue beyond this spring. It is also important to monitor the implementation of the proposals in the Member States and in sports organizations. That is why we are making these programs, not just on a shelf in a folder, but that they would come into practice and that they would also be implemented in the various Member States and sports organizations. I therefore propose that we hold an annual follow-up meeting to the proposals in this sports report here in the European Parliament, in cooperation with the European Commission, the Council and stakeholders. In this way, we can ensure that this broadly consolidated position of the European Parliament on sport can become a living and working reality in practice in all the Member States of the European Union.

Sport must remain a vehicle for promoting human rights, not a justification for breaching them.  Finally, I’d like to address the issue of gender equality in sport and the fair representation of women in governing bodies: having more women in sport decision—making would have a positive outcome, not only on the transparency and accountability of sports organisations and access to sports activities for women, but might also counter the poor media coverage given to women’s sport and the socially discriminating and sexually stereotyped reporting found in the media.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 328, "date": "2017-02-01.json", "name": "Notis MARIAS", "mepid": "125069", "text": "ECR). - Mr President, sport is a large and rapidly growing sector of the economy of the Member States of the Union and contributes significantly to growth and employment, while also playing an important role in the lives of European citizens.

Europe is forced to face serious social challenges and needs to protect and strengthen every tool capable of generating inclusion, tolerance and positive confrontation. The priority, therefore, must be to direct resources towards sporting activities that produce cohesion, that are sustainable and that effectively bring value to the places that host them.

Honourable Members of the European Parliament, we normally see sport as a vehicle for our health and well—being, but sport is more: it mirrors the values that our societies are built on, and in today’s polarised world, sport is also a tool for building bridges. Since the European Parliament’s report by Santiago Fisas Ayxela back in 2011, the way in which sport is organised, watched, televised or gambled on has changed. This has important implications for the amount of money flowing into sport and sporting events, more specifically, and how this money is distributed. What is more, sport has never been as closely scrutinised as it is today, either through technology, social media or investigative journalism, and this has uncovered some home truths about sport. This is why this report is welcome. We have to readjust our focus to take recent developments into account. Mr Takkula, you and your shadow rapporteurs have gone to great lengths to recognise all these aspects precisely at a time when the topic of integrity is a top priority for the global sports movement and the public alike. Let me assure you that the Commission will continue its work to protect the integrity of sport. We strongly support the call to find a solution to unblock the signing and ratification of the Council of Europe Convention on the Manipulation of Sports Competitions. It is important that the EU and the Member States who wish to participate can play a strong part in implementing the Convention from the very beginning. Good governance should be embedded within the culture of sport, become part of its DNA, so that sport can continue to inspire us all. This is paramount not only to safeguard the integrity of sport and its credibility, but also to help sports organisations to do their work more effectively. That is why I launched an initiative in September last year inviting sports federations to sign up to, and put in practice, good governance principles. Some have done so, but this can only be a first step. I will continue to urge all sports federations in the EU to stand up and be counted.  Your report also rightly highlights the importance that needs to be attached to accessibility. I fully support this focus and the call to ensure the sport is accessible to everyone. The Commission is committed to helping to ensure that persons with a disability can participate in sport activities. The Commission proposal for a directive harmonising accessibility in the EU – the so-called European accessibility Act – will also contribute to this goal. Sport can play a vital role in fostering social inclusion and help us build inclusive societies. It can provide positive role models to young people. It can make an important contribution to help integrate migrants in the EU. In fact, sport has the potential, matched by few other areas, to promote values such as tolerance, solidarity, respect and understanding between nations and cultures both within Europe and beyond.  The report also highlights the economic impact of sport, as well as its potential for providing young people with opportunities to develop skills – skills that enable them to find fulfilling work and become independent active citizens. This is of great importance to the Commission. Sport faces many challenges. To tackle them, we must all work together: sports organisations, the Commission, Member States and civil society. And we have to work across policy areas. We will continue to use all our instruments to support and encourage Member States and sport bodies. The sport chapter of Erasmus+ can play a key role here. Indeed, the report suggests actions in many areas that we are already supporting through Erasmus+. These include promoting grassroots sport, fighting match-fixing, fostering social inclusion, protecting young athletes and helping to preserve traditional sports.  The report also comes at a time when Member States and the Council are discussing new priorities for their cooperation in this field and the structure of the next EU work plan for sport. Your report will provide valuable input to these discussions. To conclude, this report identifies the same challenges and priorities that the Commission is working on. I am very pleased to see that the European Parliament is a strong ally supporting our work. I therefore very much welcome this initiative, and wish to thank Mr Takkula, in particular, for his commitment.
