The last is from 2009 and since then there have been extraordinary technological changes, changes that have affected business models, the interests of users, the experiences of consumers themselves and which have absolutely transformed the electronic communications landscape.  We must begin by saying that connectivity has always been the precondition, the necessary condition for the extraordinary advances that have been known in humanity, especially in the twentieth century of technology.  Consider, for example, what situation we would be in if there had not been an infrastructure of roads, railways, radio, telephony or air transport: surely the situation of our economy and the development of our society would be very, very different.  Today we are in a similar situation, where connectivity is a necessary and urgent condition for the European Union to harness the potential of the most advanced digital technologies, such as the Internet of Things, big data, artificial intelligence, robotics, quantum computing and much more.  They are technologies that are making their way, that are making their way in an extraordinary way, at a very, very high speed and are waiting to have the capacity to connect in order to be able to develop fully and thus deploy their full potential for new opportunities for the economy and society. Consider the possibilities for 5G development that it can offer us for the future — for the very near future — such as: performing long-distance surgical interventions; high-risk work that can be done from a safe place; or for farmers themselves, for the agriculture sector, which, by obtaining real-time data, can greatly improve farms.  For all these reasons, the new regulatory framework, in addition to the digital market, strengthens and places connectivity as the backbone of this regulation of the electronic communications market. It includes a number of measures to do so, measures that will attract investment, to make investment more attractive, such as co-investment models, better and more harmonised radio spectrum management, improving the duration of licences with a minimum duration, for example, of twenty years.  The Code further obliges all Member States to release and allow the use of the well-known 5G bands before the end of 2020 and, in consumer protection, establishes and improves emergency services, giving more opportunities for location in the event of a disaster, as well as introducing a very significant reduction in pan-European calls, intra-European calls , which, after the disappearance of roaming costs, is also very good news for citizens.  In sum, the European Electronic Communications Code is intended to play a key role in the digitisation of Europe and does so by putting connectivity at its heart.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 2, "date": "2018-11-14.json", "name": "Evžen TOŠENOVSKÝ", "mepid": "96713", "text": "   Rapporteur. – Madam President, Commissioner, let me start by thanking my colleague Pilar Del Castillo, who has done an excellent job under the Code. The Code and BEREC are closely intertwined, from the outset, Mrs Pilar Del Castillo and I have acted in a coordinated manner and have finally successfully concluded both proposals on a joint trilogue.  The Code presents berec with a number of new tasks that needed to be reflected in this report. The issue of special voting rules in the Board of Regulators has proved to be the most problematic point of the final trilogue and we have been greatly helped by the Commission as a mediator. Under the agreement, BEREC also hosts a chapter originally agreed in the Code for the Regulation of Calls within the European Union. It would therefore not be fair for this to be attributed to the outcome of the BEREC report. In general, I appreciate the compromise on the Code, I believe that it will facilitate the development of high-speed networks as a 5G precondition, as Pilar Del Castillo mentioned here just now. As our political group, I am glad that the resulting text leaves more flexibility for Member States in the spectrum and does not ultimately include a single authorization or a so-called double lock. Back to the heart of the berec report – the structure of BEREC and the BEREC support office was the result of a political agreement in 2009. Now the Commission has proposed to link them up by creating one large agency. As rapporteur, I tried at the beginning to gather information from various sources on whether this double structure was working, and my colleagues and I also carried out a mission by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy to Riga. I am not in support of fundamental dramatic changes where something works well, and positive reviews have strongly prevailed here within BEREC. We also reflected concerns about the independence of regulators' decisions. We need real independence from regulators, both at member state level and in the European Union. Their distance from national governments and the European Commission was therefore important. I therefore proposed to reject the merger of BEREC and the BEREC support office and to focus on minor improvements as the discussion took place. Nevertheless, the European Parliament was divided on this fundamental issue, with some political groups preferring the link proposed by the Commission. Finally, the new tasks for BEREC set out in the Code, namely the newly introduced arbitration decision-making of BEREC, which would be legally binding, helped us to compromise in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. As a result, BEREC would also receive legal personality. In the context of trilogues with the Council and the Commission, we then proceeded the other way around – in the end there will be no legally binding decisions in the Code, and therefore we maintain the current structure and the status of BEREC as an independent association of regulators. It is clear to me that all colleagues cannot, in fact, be entirely satisfied on this most basic issue. In any case, my big thanks go to all the shadow rapporteurs. I think that we have managed to agree a sensible modernisation of the rules so that BEREC is effective, can carry out new tasks from the Code, contribute to the single application of the regulatory framework for telecommunications and to the opening up of the Single Market of the European Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "cs", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ECR", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 3, "date": "2018-11-14.json", "name": "Dita CHARANZOVÁ", "mepid": "124708", "text": "  rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection. – Madam President, today we are giving our citizens concrete achievements.

For that, two pieces of legislation will be vital: the European Electronic Communications Code and the Regulation on BEREC (the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications). Together, they create the legal conditions that will allow us to meet Europe’s growing connectivity needs and to boost its competitiveness. We have succeeded in providing a legal environment for European telecoms that is both investment-friendly and pro-competitive. This is something very much to be welcomed. We should not underestimate the significance of this achievement. I would like to thank the rapporteurs, Pilar del Castillo Vera, Dita Charanzová and Evžen Tošenovský, for their impressive work. The code will lay the groundwork for developing 5G across Europe. It will make sure that 5G radio spectrum is available in the EU by the end of 2020 and will give operators predictability for spectrum licensing for at least 20 years. That includes better coordination of planned radio spectrum assignments and specific rules regarding radio spectrum fees. Rolling out new, very high-capacity networks is crucial for putting Europe at the forefront of digital innovation. The code’s new provisions, including those on core investments, offer strong incentives for deploying these new networks. The new rules ensure close cooperation between the Commission and BEREC on supervising measures related to the new access provisions. Europeans expect an internet connection that is fast, reliable, affordable and safe. The code will allow that expectation to become a reality. Consumers will benefit from advanced services and from better online protection. It harmonises end-user protection of electronic communications in the EU, whether in relation to bundled services, switching providers or stronger security against hacking. We have extended the end-user protection obligations to web-based services where that makes sense. Two more important things are to be welcomed: firstly, that the universal service will guarantee that everyone can afford access to an adequate broadband internet service; and secondly, that end-users with disabilities are guaranteed equivalent access to communications. We have also strengthened people’s protection in emergency situations, including through the retrieval of more accurate caller location.

I believe that the current institutional set-up, based on the independence of national regulatory authorities from the Commission and other Union institutions, allows BEREC to provide independent and expert advice and to continue cooperation with other Union institutions. Through its opinions and recommendations, BEREC may advise Union and national regulatory authorities on how to make more efficient use of electronic communications, highlight shortcomings in their use, supervise consumer protection and also ensure cooperation between other regulatory authorities.

Doing everything possible to treat every form of data traffic as equally as possible also has a strong effect on diversity. Despite initial scepticism, it can be said that BEREC has done a good job of maintaining net neutrality, thereby serving all Europeans. Ensuring neutrality, fairness and non-discrimination remains a major challenge, and today we are equipping BEREC with the necessary means to address this. The European Code of Electronic Communications is also drafted in the sense of non-discrimination. It is essential that all citizens have access to an affordable, universal, available Internet connection.

As always, the world is changing. It's always been the case. During the first industrial revolution came new technologies that radically changed people's lives. If in the past people mostly worked in rural jobs, perhaps in forestry, in fisheries, new industries, factories, completely new working environments, our great-grandfathers, say, adapted to such conditions. We are living today in the next era of revolution, the so-called digital revolution, when the whole labour market changes again, all opportunities are changing. And if perhaps even 50 years ago many people literally worked in factories, robots are working in factories now, but people are the ones who make up the robots of the future, creating future opportunities. The challenge for us in the age of this digital revolution is that these are already technologies that have evolved. In Europe, we have a very sly market: in each Member State, things were a little different. It has also affected telecommunications and so on. But we know that Europe is competing in the global global market: the United States, with a single market of 330 million people, is China with 1.3 billion inhabitants. In Europe, we have enormous potential with 500 million, but a great deal of squabble. What this telecom pack, which we are talking about today, is a common approach, a common infrastructure for the whole area. So for consumers, this means telephone calls that do not have to be paid more expensively when travelling elsewhere in Europe, i.e. a single market for telecommunications. This means simplified, secure internet access. And for the industry, this means clear conditions for further developing technologies, such as the so-called 5G technologies, which will be the key to the future for autonomous car driving, healthcare and so on.

It has made our lives easier, brought with it new services and technologies, but we haven’t seen it all yet. The change has only just begun. This morning I came from Paris where I had the privilege to head the Parliament’s delegation to the Internet Governance Forum. Europe is at the forefront of the digital revolution but we need to cooperate with the rest of the world and we have to make sure that we have common goals for the right use of the digital tools. To deliver that digital revolution, we need this European Electronic Communications Code. If we want better digital services, we need better digital infrastructure. If we want connected cars or if we want e—health solutions, we need fast 5G. If we want our schools and universities and businesses to thrive, we need gigabit connectivity to use artificial intelligence and cloud computing. If we want to see the next ground—breaking services to make our lives better, we need fast internet connections for all homes and mobile devices. Internet connectivity is a modern right for every European and we have defined what a very high capacity network is. It’s not just in these connections that you see that you are connected but your program doesn’t work anyway. We need fibre to boost things and we need more very good connections. The key problem we’re trying to solve here is how we can get faster, better and cheaper connections. We need this for all Europeans while maintaining the right conditions for investment so that it can happen. The outcome here today, agreed after eight months of trialogues and negotiations, reflects the Parliament position well. We have achieved the goal of promoting investments while making sure that consumers in Europe retain the right to choose their operators. The new rules for co—investments are complex and some details will be up to national implementation, but the message is clear: there can be no turning back to the monopolies. One key technology for revolution is 5G and very fast connections. It’s high time for Member States to see that we need common rules for spectrum as well, and we need the spectrum bands to be out there at the latest by 2020.

First, it was based on the strange notion that the best way to get companies to invest in broadband internet was to reduce competition and to offer deregulation in return for investment. Even the most conservative economists would predict the exact opposite, namely that competition drives innovation and doesn’t stifle it. The Verts/ALE Group has been at the forefront of resisting any deregulation agenda and ensuring that telecom regulators have the necessary powers to regulate. The final deal, thanks to Parliament, is much more balanced than the first draft and is much more ambitious in the field of consumer rights. With the Electronic Communications Code, we’re making real improvements to the transparency of contracts, to the ability to take your phone number with you when you switch providers, and to ensuring that everyone has affordable internet access, also recognising community networks. We are making real improvements to people’s security, too, by introducing systems that allow people to receive automatic notifications on their phones in the case of disasters. There’s a reason why telecom companies have quite a terrible reputation among consumers. Many people in Europe have the choice between just a small number of providers, and often all the available options are bad. Bad surprises, in the form of ridiculously high phone bills, slow speeds and difficulties in switching providers, are still common. When we told Europeans years ago that we would abolish roaming, they thought that would mean that wherever you called in Europe, and wherever you used the internet, you would pay the same price. What they soon had to learn was that calling somebody in another EU country is not roaming. That’s an intra—EU call – something completely different – where higher prices are considered okay. So it is a great success for Parliament that the proposals from the Greens and the left to abolish charges for intra—EU calls have made it into the final deal, at least in the form of a price cap. That will bring European consumers one step closer to a real single market. A missed opportunity in the Telecom Package is that of turning the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications (BEREC) into a fully—fledged EU regulator. The BEREC Regulation makes some modest improvements, but this Parliament and national governments failed to take the important step of creating an EU regulator with all the powers needed. It’s a missed opportunity because global threats to our open internet are becoming bigger. It’s not just that the US has abolished Federal net neutrality rules. It’s not just that, in Paris this week, Mr Macron said that net neutrality must not stand in the way of internet regulation. No, Mr Macron, net neutrality is internet regulation, and it’s precisely the kind of regulation we need to strengthen. Although the European Union has enshrined net neutrality in law, it has failed to provide a clear and unequivocal ban on zero-rating. The consequence is that today, according to BEREC’s own figures, zero—rating still exists in most EU countries and we need to take further steps to ensure that an open internet is available to everybody. I hope that this Telecom Package will be a step in the right direction.

The need for regulation has already been mentioned here and I would like to draw attention to another issue that seems to me fundamental: communications are a very sensitive area and therefore it is not only code infrastructure that we are talking about, but also what threats to the maintenance and management of communications can be.

We have stronger connections, competition is increasingly complex, there is convergence of fixed and mobile networks and demand for wireless data has exploded. Today, in response to these significant structural changes, we are preparing to launch a European telecommunications code. However, while we must encourage investment in high-capacity networks, we must ensure greater competitiveness of the markets, lowering prices and raising the quality of services for consumers and businesses.  I am glad that a number of our demands have been accepted, which are in the direction of better protection for users. First of all, the reduction of the cost of international calls between countries of the European Union. These tariffs are in no way linked to the real costs incurred by suppliers. That is why we have called for any price difference between domestic and intra-European calls to be eliminated. Unfortunately, this request has only been immediately granted, but it is important that a ceiling of 19 cents per minute has been set for intra-European calls. This, for example, in Italy will mean a drop of almost half the price of these calls. I hope that consumers will be aware of this change and that this will be the first step towards a complete reduction in the cost of intra-European calls.  Other important successes for consumer protection are the more transparent bills, so that the bill makes an explicit statement of who the suppliers are and the length of the services that are then charged, so that it is clear what we are paying for. The change of operator will be easier, because maintaining the same number and therefore portability is a key element of consumer freedom of choice and effective competition. Therefore, a new number must be made available within one working day and there must be refunds proportionate to the delays suffered. Certain times for the transfer of the line, so that it is agreed with the user and is done at the time it has been decided.

Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to thank the commissioner for her work and for the work she has I would like to thank Pilar del Castillo very much for your reports. With both the electronic communications code and the BEREC Regulation, they have helped to ensure that Europe will in future have more legal and planning certainty in the field of telecommunications, that the Digital Single Market will be further developed, particularly as far as BEREC is concerned. They have ensured that more flexibility in regulation is maintained by Member States without restricting regulatory competence.  As Commissioner Ansip has already mentioned, the development of digital infrastructure and digital skills are now essential drivers for competitiveness and therefore also for growth and jobs in Europe. In Austria alone, in my own country, investments of EUR 10 billion in digital infrastructure would trigger GDP growth of 15% or EUR 58 billion, according to a study by Future Business Austria presented on Monday this week. Digital infrastructure includes the construction of 5G – we have already heard it today – high-speed Internet, the possibility of autonomous driving, the Internet on the Internet of things, artificial intelligence and much more. An essential prerequisite for this is the European Electronic Communications Code, which will help to promote broadband expansion, particularly in rural areas. I think there was a question about that today. But not only that. The new Communication Code will also create essential conditions for investments in superfast Internet to take place in the first place. And how does he do that? This is by ensuring that sufficient 5G frequencies are available for network expansion over the next two years and that network operators have at least 20 years of planning certainty for spectrum licences.  But there are advantages not only for the producer, but also for consumers – it has already been mentioned today: the code will ensure that international calls within the EU – we still call it international calls – can cost a maximum of 19 cents per minute, that easier service switching and call-by is possible, that cheap communication services are available, that there is transparency, that security is increased in relation to malicious programmes and that citizens are better protected in emergencies. , by making emergency calls more traceable by means of caller location and also by issuing a public warning with a profile of \"telephony\".

That was the first step. We have set new standards here, because for the first time we have succeeded in introducing a sunset clause.

My group has always supported this objective because we are convinced that the future European internal market for telecommunications needs a clear and strong administrative structure in which BEREC should play a central role as an agency. However, following the conclusion of the negotiations in Parliament and with the Council, we note that the time for this change is probably not yet the time. In particular, we regret that BEREC does not have legal personality with the text now put to the vote and therefore cannot continue to take legally binding decisions. We consider this to be a short-sighted decision, because many rules will still have to be harmonised and technical solutions will have to be found on the road to the internal market. We therefore consider the text as a whole to be too unambitious and too focused on maintaining the status quo. However, what makes the revised BEREC Regulation acceptable to me in sum is something quite different, namely the inclusion of the issue of foreign calls in the text.

I think that it is very important to stress that quite a few regions in the world are already putting CO2 standards in place, like the United States, Canada, China and Japan. They have all put CO2 regulation in place on the heavy—duty vehicle sector. Europe hasn’t done so yet. But we now have a proposal on the table from the Commission for CO2 standards for heavy—duty vehicles, and I think that is of course a very welcome development. Why? Because, if you look at heavy—duty vehicles, this is one of the sectors in Europe that is fast increasing and where CO2 emissions are also fast increasing. For now, total EU CO2 emissions are at a level of 6%, of which 25% is from road transport and it is increasing. We know that to meet our climate targets agreed in the Paris Agreement we need to go to zero emissions. This absolutely means that special attention needs to be paid to the heavy—duty vehicle sector, which this proposal is doing. For context, what we know is that, if you want to be Paris compatible, the heavy—duty vehicle sector needs to go in the direction of minus 40% by 2030. That analysis is from the Dutch institute, TNO, who say that for compatibility with the Paris Agreement, you need to go to those kind of reduction levels, and we’re not there yet. That’s also why we as a Parliament, in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI), agreed on raising the ambition level compared to what the Commission was proposing to a level that we say should be minus 20% by 2025 and minus 35% by 2030. I want to stress that this level of minus 20% by 2025 is, according to the impact assessment from the Commission, also possible with existing technologies. We know of course that, if you look to the longer term and we need to go to lower level ambitions, then we need to have an improvement in technologies because existing technologies can get to a level of minus 30%, but not much more than that. This means that we also need to prepare for new technologies in the heavy—duty vehicle sector and that’s why, also in ENVI, we have been proposing a zero and low—emission vehicle mandate to push the market into new technologies. The definition of zero and low—emission vehicles is broad, so it’s not necessarily electricity – it can also be other technologies. We are not subscribing to any technology, but are pushing just for a mandate on zero and low—emission vehicles of 5% by 2025, rising to 20% by 2030, in order to prepare the market for these new technologies to arrive in order to get to the deeper carbon cuts that are necessary for implementation of the Paris Agreement.  We are also putting forward a specific mandate for buses. I want to stress that this is important because in some of these markets the truck producers also produce buses and, if you have just one mandate and mix them all, you can create an unfair market. Therefore it is important to have separate mandates for buses and trucks because we know that on buses we can move much faster we can than on trucks. The mandate is also for all the trucks, not only the bigger ones, so that you can also achieve those zero and low—emission vehicles mandate for smaller trucks. My last point is that there was a big discussion on the fine. Let me say very clearly that we would like to stay very close to the Commission proposal because, if you lower the fine to such a level that it’s easy for the producer to pay it, what you are putting in place is just an additional price factor – a cost factor of production – and I don’t think that is what we want to do.  To conclude, I would like to thank all the shadows for all the good cooperation. On many compromises we had broad support, though not on others. We do of course see some amendments on the targets. That’s to be expected. But I would like to thank all the shadows for their great cooperation. I think the vote in ENVI, where 47 people were in favour and only six against, shows that we had broad support in that committee, which we hope also to maintain in the plenary.

Following the debate last month on the proposal on CO2 emission standards for cars and vans, this is another key proposal to implement the 2030 climate and energy framework and continue to follow up on our commitments under the Paris Agreement.  Shortly before the upcoming COP24 in Katowice, the recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) special report on 1.5 degrees Celsius has once again demonstrated the urgency of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in all sectors. This is the first time ever that we are making a proposal to set CO2 standards for heavy—duty vehicles.  We do this for a number of reasons. First, we need to act to tackle the growing CO2 emissions from heavy—duty vehicles. Without action, these emissions – which represent almost 25% of road transport emissions – are set to increase by almost 10% by 2030. This new legislation will therefore help to reduce emissions from heavy—duty vehicles, while also supporting the Member States in meeting their binding national targets under the Effort Sharing Regulation. We also need to act to keep Europe’s industrial leadership. As has been said by the rapporteur, other countries, such as the United States, China and Japan, have already set emissions standards and competition in the global market is fierce. This legislation will contribute to Europe’s economic prosperity and global competitiveness, keeping us at the forefront of developing low—carbon solutions.  Finally, we need to act to support our transport companies’ savings on fuel. Fuel today accounts for about one quarter of transport companies’ operating costs. This legislation will bring fuel savings to the 600 000 small and medium—sized enterprises that operate in the European Union freight transport sector and employ almost three million people.  Your vote today is therefore instrumental to allow the adoption of this proposal during the current legislative term. We need to give a clear and stable regulatory signal to our industry as soon as possible because this will stimulate the right investments in the transition towards low and eventually zero—emission mobility. I therefore want to thank the rapporteur Mr Eickhout for his very hard work on this proposal, bringing together very rapidly the position of the European Parliament. I would also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs for their efforts in the same direction.  The Commission proposal, underpinned by a thorough impact assessment, is both ambitious and realistic because it strikes the right balance between the three main policy objectives, which cannot be considered in isolation: first, achieving environmental benefits; second, bringing savings for transport operators; and third, supporting employment, growth and competitiveness.  As this is the first time this sector is being regulated and in view of the uncertainties on some key data, a stepwise approach is followed. The proposed 15% and 30% targets by 2025 and 2030 will bring significant environmental benefits, estimated at around 54 million tonnes of CO2 in the period 2020 to 2030. This is equivalent to the total annual emissions of Sweden. An early review is foreseen in 2022 to expand the scope and set the 2030 binding targets based on additional information on new technologies. Besides the targets, the proposal includes an incentive system to speed up the transition to zero— and low—emission vehicles.  The situation in this sector is different than for cars. There are virtually no large zero—emission trucks on European roads, and today 98% of the trucks rely on diesel, while almost all manufacturers have announced plans for zero—emission vehicles.

By 2025, 15% less emissions and by 2030 30% less emissions. The Committee on Transport believes that these are extremely strict objectives. We supported these absolute figures from the Commission because, despite the fact that lorries have not had co2 emission limits, they are already very effective because fuel is such an expensive item of expenditure for hauliers that we have already strived for very good energy efficiency. In its own opinion, the Committee on Transport continues to criticise the fact that we are too focused on measuring emissions from the end of the exhaust pipe.

That is why it is good that we are now getting this draft legislation, so that for the first time in Europe we are taking seriously the issue of reducing emissions from heavy-duty vehicles. However, this is the first time we have done this, and that is why we should do so with a certain humility. After all, it is not we in this room, in this house, who are the ones who seriously reduce CO2 emissions from lorries and buses, but they are skilled technicians in vehicle manufacturers with the right conditions that are the ones who can make a difference. This is often and rapidly developed into a bidding process, where it is given the impression that those with the highest demands for emission reductions are the ones who are most beneficial to the climate. However, I would say that is wrong. It is they who find the right level and create the strongest incentives for technological development that make a real difference. We need to find a level that the technicians can deliver. Above all, we must ensure that the vehicles produced are vehicles that someone can afford to buy. It is only by replacing the old trucks and buses with high emission levels that we really reduce emissions. Unfortunately, I do not think that the Committee on the Environment succeeds in doing so, for three reasons in particular. The first is that we are saying that we will raise our ambition for 2025 to a 20% reduction. So these are trucks and buses that have already been developed, they are under development, and this will not change them. The only question is whether it is the case that there will be heavy fines. That is the second problem for those who fail. The last requirement, which we find difficult to understand how it will actually help to reduce emissions, is to ask for a special proportion of low-emission vehicles, in practice, electricity as early as 2025. We need a switch to electricity, but we in this house do not know and cannot decide exactly when that change in technology will take place.

In addition to ambitious but achievable emission reduction targets of 20 % by 2025 and 35 % by 2030, we have introduced a road compliance test to have data on emissions and fuel consumption under real driving conditions, data that can be used by third parties for independent verification tests.

Some of those paths are moderately good, the last path will be very expensive for the next generations.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we are finally preparing to set CO2 emission standards for heavy goods vehicles. This is already a victory, because such standards did not exist until now. So we can be proud of that, except that it is not enough. We have to go faster, stronger. The IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change), a collective of scientists who regularly alert us to climate change, has warned us. We have little time to maintain a global warming of only 1.5oC instead of 2oC.  Why is it so important? Because the risks associated with climate, this warming of 1.5ooC, are certainly much lower than with a scenario at 2oC.  It is also a matter of heatwaves, precipitation, species extinction, agricultural productivity or ocean acidification.  What does a warming of 1.5oC mean? This means zero net CO2 emissions in 2050 globally, well before 2050. Did you hear me right? Long before 2050! That is why we need ambitious short-, medium- and long-term goals to chart a path that is reliable, concrete and effective. In this report we have succeeded in raising the reduction target to 20% by 2025 and 35% by 2030, because this is not only technologically possible, but above all desirable. We have also set a low, somewhat restrictive share of 10% of zero- or low-emission HGVs for 2025 and 35% for 2030. Again, it is possible, manufacturers can and should do so.  You see, ladies and gentlemen, it is a climate issue, it is an issue for jobs, but it is also innovative for clean vehicles.

Everyone is called upon to play their part and above all the transport sector, which is the one that has increased its emissions most of all over the years. It is therefore essential to achieve the best possible result on new heavy goods vehicles. As the 5 Star Movement we want to define a future-proof regulation, which really allows the spread of zero and low emission vehicles even in this market segment. Vehicles such as trucks, trucks, buses and coaches generate more than 6 % of total greenhouse gas emissions in the Union and 25 % of road transport. We must therefore do our best as co-legislators to protect the climate by setting significant reduction targets. Furthermore, pushing on the accelerator to stimulate the electrification of new heavy goods vehicles will also serve to protect the health of Europeans and to strengthen the energy security of the whole continent.

As I said with regard to emissions from motor vehicles and light commercial vehicles, there is no system in the proposal that recognises the role of renewable fuels.  On the other hand, it is essential that the contribution and benefits of these funds are recognised for the decarbonisation objectives through the introduction of a calculation methodology that recognises the renewable component networked at European level. It is therefore essential to consider the entire fuel chain, including the extraction and production, transport and use of fuel or electricity, in order to provide a more realistic comparison of the different options and in this sense it is very important to recognise the role of methane and biomethane.

First, there is no such thing as zero-emission vehicles. This is the use of false terminology, which then tends to make false conclusions. Unless you have invented perpetuum mobile in the meantime, and I missed something, or have already declared that perpetuum mobile is to be invented by 2030, I would not be surprised. Perhaps this is in some new amendment. There is no such thing as zero-emission vehicles, they simply do not emit in the place where they drive, they only emit where electricity is generated to power them. So let's not tell fairy tales.  Secondly, if we want to work fairly to improve the environment, then instead of using such a casuistry that for such vehicles it will be 15%, but if they are buses then no, unless articulated, then again some other percentage. Such casuiticism cannot be introduced into law.

I also believe that environmental objectives can be reconciled with caring for jobs and economic growth. I therefore believe that a 35% emission reduction allows such synergies to be maintained. The most effective solutions are those that are widely accepted by both consumers and manufacturers.  In the case of heavy goods vehicles, fuel efficiency is of paramount importance, as fuel is the highest fixed cost for transport companies. It is therefore in their interest to buy vehicles that use as little fuel as possible. Fuel efficiency is also linked to reducing emissions, so we should aim to implement as low-emission vehicles as possible for the production and use of vehicles. Ideally, they would be zero-emission vehicles. However, we must not require manufacturers and consumers to implement things that are impossible. Although it is technically possible to design, for example, a power-powered tractor unit, the barrier is of course its range, loading speed, vehicle weight. This barrier is easier to overcome on short journeys, for example in the case of cars and buses, but it is difficult to overcome when it comes to heavy vehicles.  I have encountered this problem in the work on the Directive on the promotion of clean vehicles, for which we adopted a negotiating mandate at the last session and of which I was rapporteur. There, too, we adopted other targets for buses and others, lower for trucks.

After all, it cannot be explained to any citizen that emissions from heavy goods vehicles have not yet been regulated.

I believe that regulation is necessary and that regulation also helps the entire economy. In my constituency, for example.B, there is the second largest manufacturer in Europe for truck trailers, which has developed wind spoilers that reduce consumption.

Road transport is a major factor in this, as we know, and it will continue to increase. Because if we continue to have more people in the world, there will be more trade, more internal market with Europe, and there will be more on the road, because that is the main medium on which transport is carried. For the first time, we now have binding targets. That is also a good thing that we are taking care of it. The point is that we have to think: how far can we really go on the objectives? Perhaps the best way would be to introduce emissions trading for lorries and buses. We don't have that now, and that's something we'd like to do from my party. It is also important to consider the entire life cycle of a vehicle, not just what comes out of the exhaust at the back. Absolutely right! Long trucks could also be a good solution.

I would like to stress once more that the Commission proposal is balanced, ambitious and fully in line with our climate objectives. Some interventions are calling for higher ambition levels in 2025. With 15% in 2025, the Commission proposal strikes the right balance between being realistic and ambitious. We have based it on a solid impact assessment because a 15% target can be achieved using technologies that are already available on the market but not yet widely deployed. Today we have also heard calls for setting a binding and higher target for 2030. Let me please remind you that while the 2025 target can be met by deploying readily available cost—effective technologies, achieving a more ambitious 2030 target would require the implementation of new technologies that are not yet on the market. There is currently a lack of robust information on how the performance and costs of those more innovative and prospective technologies might evolve in the medium term, and this creates a risk that a binding 2030 target would not be set at the most cost—effective level right now. The Commission has therefore proposed to review the 2030 aspirational CO2 emission targets in 2022 once sufficient certified CO2 emission data has been collected and more information is available. Some interventions also called for incentives for the deployment of zero— and low—emission vehicles, an objective that the Commission supports. A crediting system based on a benchmark was considered in the impact assessment. However, it was not retained, in particular in view of the very low penetration of zero— and low—emission vehicles in the fleet and of the scarcity of robust data on such markets. Adding a malus would mean that manufacturers meeting the CO2 targets would actually be penalised if they did not meet the benchmark. Instead, the Commission proposal contains a super—credit system which also preserves the environmental integrity of the CO2 target. CO2 emissions standards cannot be set yet for buses, as the CO2 emissions are not yet certified. However, as set out in the 2022 review clause, buses will be included in future standards. But, at the same time, this proposal can help to speed up the market uptake of zero—emission bus technologies by including then in the super—credit scheme. There is a competition distortion between manufacturers which is addressed through a cap. The proposed revision of the Clean Vehicle Directive will be a key tool to steer public authorities’ decisions in purchasing zero—emission buses by creating a larger market for those vehicles. A platform has already been created to help cities make joint public procurement, and the European Union budget will also continue to support the financing of a new fleet of clean buses. However, certain zero—emission buses mandates for manufacturers will not be proposed. We heard today some interventions calling for credits for alternative fuels. The Commission proposal does not include such credits. Our approach is based on the principle of clear responsibilities for clear actors. Manufacturers are responsible for designing vehicles so that they achieve the CO2 reductions required under the legislation. However, they cannot be held responsible for the type of fuel that is actually used in its vehicle or take advantage of it. More precisely, one vehicle is not necessarily linked to one fuel type as in many cases the same vehicle can use several fuels, either conventional, biofuels or other low carbon fuels. This being said, it does not mean that we are not taking action to decarbonise emissions from fuels. The eight—year reform will ensure decarbonisation of electricity production and the Renewable Energies Directive will ensure that more low—carbon fuels will enter the market. In this context we need to apply the principle of better regulation and avoid double regulation and double accounting for incentivising renewable fuels. Some interventions today raised concerns about the proposed level of the penalties, considering them too high and possibly putting at risk the economic situation of a manufacturer exceeding its targets. Firstly, ensuring compliance is absolutely necessary for the effectiveness of any regulatory requirements. Secondly, to be in line with the objectives of the regulation, financial penalties have to be set at a level that exceeds the marginal cost of meeting the targets. The penalties need to be a real deterrent. It should not be less expensive to pay penalties than to invest in technologies to meet targets. Thirdly, the approach taken by the Commission is to set an equivalent level of stringency from an environmental point of view, as compared with cars and buses. Finally, this issue will be part of the review of the effectiveness of the legislation in 2022. To conclude, I would like to thank all of you for the interesting debate. I am looking forward to the upcoming vote. The Commission is also confident that the Council, under the leadership of the Austrian Presidency, will be able to reach swiftly a position so that the discussion between the two co—legislators can start this year. It is absolutely essential that the final political agreement between the co—legislators can be found before the end of the term of office of this Parliament. I trust that this will be possible thanks to the dedication and hard work of the two co—legislators.

I feel that there is quite some support for what we did in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI), which is very good.  To touch on a couple of issues that have been raised, first, on the level of ambition, we have to be very clear here that we have already adopted national binding targets for 2030 under effort sharing. This means that we know that if in the transport sector we are not reducing our emissions enough, reductions will need to come from the other sectors that fall under the Effort Sharing Regulation, being housing or agriculture. If we don’t go for the cost—effective reductions that are possible in transport, it will mean that agriculture needs to deliver more in those countries where they will have difficulties in meeting their reduction targets. All the analysis shows that a CO2 standard on cars and heavy—duty vehicles is the cost—effective way to reduce emissions in those sectors that fall under the Effort Sharing Regulation, and that’s what we’re doing here. On the level where we, as ENVI, say that we should raise the bar to 20%, I once again want to stress that, in the Commission’s impact assessment, it’s very clearly stated that an analysis of the cost—effective technologies already at hand shows that full deployment would make it possible to achieve emission reductions between 15% to 20% by 2025. This shows that the existing technologies can be achieved with the 20% target. On top of that, we need to develop new technologies and that’s why we are making this Regulation consistent with the cars. In the cars we had super credits and now, later on, the Commission is stepping away from that in cars and comes up with super credits again in this Regulation. We think it’s better to skip that mistake that you made on cars and immediately go into a mandate for zero and low-emission vehicles at a very low level of 5%. My last point, on buses, is that it’s very important to realise that there are producers producing both trucks and buses. So if we have one mandate, you are giving very clear priority and a benefit for those who are producing both because, in buses, we can move faster, and the market is moving faster. That’s why we have decided on separate mandates for buses and heavy—duty vehicles – in order to make sure that the level playing field remains equal for all the players in the market for new technologies.  Once again, I thank everyone for the discussion. I’m looking forward to the vote and then indeed, what is the intention? A fast resolution in negotiations, hopefully to start under the Austrian Presidency.

Its provisions will undoubtedly be a major problem in the long term, both for vehicle manufacturers and for fuel retailers. According to the current methodology, the vehicle's CO2 emissions are attributed to it on the basis of the measured amount of CO2 emissions from the vehicle's exhaust pipe. However, the total CO2 emissions from the previous processing of crude oil into fuels, as primary energy (refineries) or in the production of renewable fuels, including biogas, shall not be taken into account. It's a mistake.  I believe that the focus should be on taking into account the emission reductions that result from the use of biofuels and alternative fuels. To this end, the European Commission should develop a new methodology for objectively counting total emissions.

As you can see, strengthening ties with the African continent is a priority for us, but also for me it is one of the most important points for my presidency. Let me begin by saying that the European Parliament proudly joined the worldwide celebrations to commemorate Nelson Mandela’s legacy on the centenary of his birth. He was, as you know, the first person to receive the Sakharov Prize in 1988, in recognition of his struggle to end apartheid and his fight to pursue equal rights for all. We will always remember this great man with admiration and immense respect. Mr President, in February of this year, you became South Africa’s new president. Your reforms are contributing to revitalise South Africa’s economy by attracting foreign investments, enhancing private-sector competitiveness, creating jobs, especially for the young, fighting corruption and inequality, and improving citizens’ rights. We welcome your agenda and are confident that in tomorrow’s summit we will open a new chapter in our partnership. However, structural challenges in South Africa remain: poverty, income inequality and unemployment are at the top of the list. The EU stands ready to support you in tackling these challenges. Through stronger economic diplomacy and an ambitious ‘Marshall plan’ for Africa, we can help you attract investment. South Africa is a champion of multilateralism, an active member of the African Union and of the Southern African Development Community. It is the only African member of the G20. This means we have to work together on our most pressing common challenges – trade, climate change, terrorism, migration and unemployment. I also wish to congratulate you on the election of your country as a non-permanent member of the United Nations Security Council starting next year.

(Applause) He is one person who, through his life and deeds, proved to all the people across the world that championing human rights and doing what is right in terms of embracing universal values was the right thing to do, and that is precisely what he dedicated his life to. He belongs not only to those who lived through the tumultuous events of the last century, but he also belongs to the generations that are going to follow all of us. We live in the world that Nelson Mandela and many other great leaders of his age made. We are grateful to the European Union and to the people, as well as the leaders, of Europe for the tributes they have paid in many different ways to Nelson Mandela on the occasion of his birth, and for this we thank you from the bottom of our hearts. We say thank you for honouring Nelson Mandela in the way that you have.  (Applause) It is indeed a testament to the universal appeal of his vision that he is as revered on this continent as he is across the African continent. We remember with the nations of the world the centenary of the armistice that marked the end of the First World War.

Now, more than a quarter of a century later, that affirmation of democracy, of liberty, of respect for human rights, of fundamental freedoms and the rule of law continues to endure. These timeless values are indeed beacons of hope in our troubled times, for – despite our greatest efforts – the world today is blighted by conflict, poverty and underdevelopment in a number of poor countries. There is still a lack of meaningful social progress, unrest and displacement. The spectre of the resurgence of racism and xenophobia, cloaked in the mantle of nationalism, is rising and is causing a great deal of concern in a number of places. Unilateralism is on the rise and threatens, in many ways, to undermine our collective commitment to democratic values and respect for human rights. Now, more than ever, we turn to our great leaders for strength and inspiration as we seek to resolve the most pressing challenges of our times. We recall their words and their actions as we reaffirm our commitment to democratic values and upholding the rights of every human being. It was the great statesman and friend of the anti-apartheid cause, Olof Palme, the former Prime Minister of Sweden, who said, ‘for us, democracy is a question of human dignity. This includes political liberties, the right to freely express our views, the right to criticise and to influence opinion. It embraces the right to health, work, to education and social security’. This view of democracy resonates with Nelson Mandela’s vision of a global community of nations that affirms the centrality of human dignity and strives through all means available to improve the human condition.  Just four months after his release from prison in 1990, Nelson Mandela paid his first visit to the European Parliament to receive the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought. He used this occasion to thank the leaders and the people of Europe for their contribution to the liberation of South Africa. I also stand here, like Nelson Mandela, and thank the people of Europe for the contribution that they made to end apartheid, and we say thank you for all the support you gave us during the dark days of apartheid. Thank you very much. (Applause) Nelson Mandela also used the opportunity, as he addressed this European Parliament, to call on the nations of Europe to continue to stand by South Africa as we sought to rebuild our country. We are here today to confirm that, indeed, the nations of Europe answered the call that Nelson Mandela made with conviction and generosity. We are here today, following in the footsteps of Nelson Mandela, to say that we would urge you and we would call on you to continue supporting South Africa as it has embarked on a journey, not only to reform itself, but to build a new South African nation from the ashes of apartheid. We thank you for continuing to support us.  (Applause) The European Union was born out of the need to end the historic divisions on the continent, to create a firm base for the construction of a new Europe rooted in solidarity and cooperation, and to contribute to global peace, security and development. The countries of Africa have similarly embarked upon a new path of peace, development and transformation. The African Union’s Agenda 2063 provides a programme for integration and prosperity on a continent that has been wracked by division, exploitation and strife. Nelson Mandela was an ardent advocate for pan—Africanism, and he believed that the continent could only reach her full potential if her peoples were united. In pursuing this goal, there are many lessons we can draw from the European Union’s path to integration, to economic and political union, and to achieving social progress.  South Africa notes the tireless work of the European Parliament to ensure that the provisions of the Lisbon Treaty on the eradication of poverty continue to underpin the EU’s approach to external development cooperation. Since 2007, South Africa and the EU have enjoyed the mutual benefits of a strategic partnership that continues to play a meaningful role in our country’s economic growth. It covers over 20 sectoral policy dialogues on diverse issues from development cooperation, science and technology, health, climate change, trade, education, skills development to peace migration, security and human rights as well.  An integral part of this partnership are the interparliamentary meetings between the South African Parliament and the European Parliament. These meetings have indeed played a crucial role in strengthening South Africa’s, as well as European, relations, contributing to a strategic partnership – a partnership that is based on equality, shared values and issues of mutual interest. Allow me to express our sincere appreciation for the contribution that the European Union – and in this case the European Parliament – have made not only to the development of South Africa, but also towards the achievement of progress across the African continent. Nelson Mandela led South Africa in its peaceful transition to democracy, but he had a bigger dream: an Africa at peace with itself and the world. In his lifetime, he supported the African Union’s effort towards conflict prevention and resolution, peaceful building, as well as post-conflict reconstruction. He would have joined us in applauding the EU’s support for the AU peace and security architecture and its steadfast support for efforts to silence the guns on the African continent for good. He always argued that lasting peace and security on the continent will not be possible without economic development. Without opportunity, without investment, without thriving economies that enable us all to enjoy our place in the sun, we cannot hope to have political and social stability on the African continent. We therefore welcome the support of the European Union for Africa’s development needs through initiatives such as the European External Investment Plan, the Economic Partnership Agreement and the new Africa—European Alliance for Sustainable Investment and Jobs. We should strive to ensure that these approaches are developed and implemented in line with Agenda 2063 of the African Union. We should seek to ensure that these developmental initiatives support the establishment of the African Continental Free Trade Area and Africa’s overall industrialisation infrastructure development, as well as economic transformation.  We need to work together, as the countries of Europe and Africa, to develop sustainable and humane responses to the challenge of irregular migration. This is a challenge that Europe has had to deal with in recent years. So, too, has South Africa, and several African countries have had to deal with this challenge as well in a number of ways. We need to work together to address the root causes of irregular migration, which include poverty, inequality, unemployment, economic exclusion and competition for scarce resources. This should be informed by the principles of solidarity, compassion and an unwavering commitment to the human rights of all the people of the world. Africa is the cradle of humankind. It is rich in land and water, abundant in minerals, and blessed with a young and vibrant population. It is the next frontier of growth, of innovation and of social progress. To realise this potential, the people of Africa are in the process of uniting themselves. Africa will continue to strengthen the bonds of partnership and friendship with the citizens of her sister continents and, in this case, her sister continent Europe. It is therefore a matter of great satisfaction and promise that our partnership with the European Union is as strong as it has been enduring. It is grounded in responsibility, respect and mutual accountability. The nations of the EU are a source of investment, trade, skills and knowledge, which has worked with us as South Africa in our quest to grow our economy and improve the lives of our people.  As we look to the future, we continue to count on the strength of this partnership between our countries and our peoples. As we advance forward to address the many challenges that our country faces – the challenges of unemployment, of poverty, and of inequality – we rely on Europe to be our partner. Right now, our country is in the process of transforming and reforming itself. We are seeking to create a South Africa that is conducive for investment flows. A few weeks ago, we held an investment conference that attracted a number of European—based companies to come to South Africa, and we were particularly overjoyed when many of them declared that they will continue to invest in South Africa. We were able, at that conference – and another conference that followed – to raise USD 26 billion that will flow into South Africa, and we are grateful for the support that we have enjoyed also from Europe, for that vote of confidence in our economy.  (Applause) It is this collaboration and partnership that we seek – a collaboration that has bound South Africa and the countries of Europe together in a pact to never again return to the excesses and divisions of the past. As South Africa, we are dealing with a number of issues that have to do with policies, policies that will consolidate South Africa and make our country more stable. We are in the process of dealing with the question of land reform. Land reform is one of those challenges that our country has had to face over hundreds of years, where the indigenous people of South Africa were denied access to land, and have over the years been yearning to have access to land. We are now at a stage where we are engaging in a dialogue – an overarching dialogue among the people of South Africa, those who own land and those who don’t own land – to see how best this important resource can be utilised to develop our country. Through this, the dialogue is leading us to a point where we are seeking to find solutions that will be inclusive and that will enable all South Africans, as we continue to consolidate our nation and to work together to resolve this problem. We have said very clearly that this problem of land will be resolved through adherence to the rule of law, through adherence to our constitution, and we will utilise the lessons that Nelson Mandela taught us with regard to resolving problems. We will resolve this problem in an inclusive basis, respecting each other’s human rights, respecting each other’s hopes and aspirations, and making sure – like we did when we resolved the apartheid problem – that we resolve it with a view to building a nation from the ashes of apartheid. This we shall do, because that is what Nelson Mandela taught us. I can assure you that we will resolve the land issue in line with the values that are enshrined in our Constitution and, when we do so, we will have an all—inclusive solution that will make all the people of South Africa work together and move together into the promised future that we see ahead of us.  (Applause) Unity and partnership, as well as solidarity, are the principles that have underpinned our cooperation across two vast and different continents out of dark histories and into a promising new dawn. South Africa, Africa and the European Union are bound by shared values of democracy and respect for human rights. We share a commitment to the ideals of free and prosperous societies, societies in which all persons live together in harmony with equal opportunities. We owe it to our great forebears, leaders of the calibre of Nelson Mandela, to focus on what unites us and not that which divides us, and to focus also on what benefits all of us and not what enriches and benefits just a few. We owe it to the leaders who are our forebears to build a strategic partnership that endures, that flourishes, and that – above all else – advances the cause of humanity. We thank you for your friendship, we thank you for your solidarity, we thank you for your partnership, and we thank you all for your support and for your continued help in everything that we are doing to rebuild the South African nation so that we, too, can enjoy the type of progress that you, as Europeans, have achieved. Thank you very much.

And so it is essential that, in view of the experience of recent years and in particular what is suspected to have happened in the case of Brexit and the Brexit referendum, which may have happened in the 2016 US elections, which may be happening in some movements, such as movements on the issue of Catalonia and whether there should be more autonomy , less autonomy, independence or non-independence.  What we verify is that, digitally, there is constant interference in these processes and interference whose author we are not able to identify and often whose design we are not able to identify. And, therefore, it is with this new challenge to the issues of exemption, impartiality and transparency in the electoral process, but also in the debate that precedes the electoral process, that we have to review those that are the procedures of public authorities and, in particular, of the entities responsible for the electoral process, whether at national level or at European level. Data protection is fundamental here in the first place. We have already taken an important step when we have made the framework through this data protection regulation in which the European Union is highly innovative. It is true that the Commission itself has already come up with a set of ideas and proposals to combat cyber-attacks, but we may go further. We must go further and view these threats as global threats.  And here I wanted to introduce another factor yet, before saying what are the two fields in which I think we should act. We're dealing with external threats here. It is the theme of this current debate: external threats. But let's not have any illusions, there are also internal threats. That is, in this digital world, whether of cyberattack or of the abuse of the data that is collected, there can be both internal agents and external agents, because the opponents of democracy, the opponents of transparency, the opponents of exemption are not only foreign powers. We have evidence that they are acting in accordance with their geostrategic interest, but there is no doubt that there are also groups and entities within our borders, european borders, which have the same designs or have designs of the same kind. And here I would say that we must act in two key areas: one is the area of regulating data processing and protecting citizens in general and their data, and this goes to operators in general and also goes to businesses, foundations, political parties, public authorities.  And then we have to have another concern, which is an already criminal concern. It is already a second concern, because no more rules and guarantees that we have there will always be cyberattacks, there will always be criminals who have some success. And we must have technological conditions and police investigative conditions that will also allow us to prevent and repel and punish these kinds of attacks, whether they are foreign attacks, whether they are national attacks.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 140, "date": "2018-11-14.json", "name": "Karoline EDTSTADLER", "mepid": "197643", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Mr President, I would like to thank the House for the opportunity to exchange views on the very topical issue of increasing EU resilience against the influence of foreign actors on the upcoming European election campaign. As you will be aware, the European Council attaches great importance to the matter. This year it addressed, both in June and October, questions of internal security, including cybersecurity and disinformation, also in the context of the upcoming European elections. Work is also under way in the Council in response to the Commission communication on ‘Tackling online disinformation: a European approach’, and the package on securing free and fair European elections. On the latter, the Council is engaged in strengthening the EU Regulation on the Statute and Funding of European Political Parties and Foundations and is examining the non—legislative part of the package in order to adopt conclusions from the Council and Member States as soon as possible. In addition, we are looking forward to the action plan for a coordinated EU response to disinformation, which is being jointly developed by the Commission and the EEAS. It should be relevant both for EU institutions and for Member States, as well as for international partners, and should propose concrete measures and resources to respond to hostile information operations in a coordinated and comprehensive way. In 2018, the number of social media users world-wide reached almost 3.2 billion, marking an increase of 13% in just one year. With the number of users expanding at such a rate, it comes as no surprise why social media have become a highly attractive target to cyberattacks, capable of impacting electoral campaigns and thus destabilising the democratic basis of our societies. Criminal misuse of the internet is a serious concern for the Council. It bears the risk of violating the privacy and fundamental rights of our citizens, attacking the integrity of information and seeking to disrupt the credibility of the internet. Therefore, it should be our common goal to ensure that technology used in electoral campaigns safeguards these basic principles and guarantees the legitimacy of electoral outcomes. The improvement of our resilience and preparedness to counter cyberattacks, including targeting electoral campaigns, requires our full, immediate and constant effort. In the last two years, we have seen numerous initiatives, measures and instruments in the area of cybersecurity, seeking to enhance the resilience of our systems and networks. The ambitious Cybersecurity Package, presented by the Commission in September 2017, was followed by a set of Council conclusions and an action plan for the continuous monitoring of their respective implementation. They emphasise the need to enhance the EU’s capacity to prevent, deter and respond to cyberattacks. In June 2017, the Council agreed on a framework for a joint EU diplomatic response to malicious cyber-activities. In October 2017, the Political and Security Committee (PSC) agreed on implementing guidelines outlining the measures as part of the framework and decision—making procedures. Member States have seen repeated their wish to continuously improve the EU’s ability to respond to diplomatically to malicious cyber activities in order to influence the behaviour of potential aggressors in the short and the long term. Finally, the European Council, in its conclusion last month, calls for measures to ‘protect the Union’s democratic system and combat disinformation, including in the context of the upcoming European elections in full respect of fundamental rights’. It is our firm commitment, in line with the call to ensure rapid examination and follow-up of the recent set of measures proposed by the Commission on election cooperation networks, online transparency, protection against cybersecurity incidents, unlawful data manipulation, fighting disinformation campaigns and tightening the rules on European political party funding. The protection of the European Parliament elections and of the democratic basis of our society, including cyberspace, is our paramount task and joint responsibility.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 141, "date": "2018-11-14.json", "name": "Karoline EDTSTADLER", "mepid": "197643", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, I would like to thank Parliament for this most urgent plenary debate. We will have elections to the European Parliament in May 2019 and 50 various elections will have taken place by 2020. We have to adjust the protection of the integrity of our elections to the digital age. And we have to protect our democratic processes from new ways of manipulation by third countries or private interests. The Facebook Cambridge Analytica scandal showed how personal data can be misused for the profiling and targeting of voters, and how valuable our new data protection rules are. We have seen the spread of fake news or disinformation coordinated on an unprecedented scale, including from outside the EU. We have learnt of hacking of candidates and cyber attacks on elections around the world, including in Europe. Crucial electoral rules have been breached or circumvented, in particular existing rules on the transparency of campaign financing. Investigations are ongoing into allegations of dark financing from undisclosed third country sources. The most cited source of activities interfering with elections in Europe is Russia. But others are learning from Russia. We have observed other countries and private interests increase their capabilities for election interference. Given the very nature of our Union, electoral interference in one Member State affects the EU as a whole. National authorities cannot address these threats by working in isolation, nor can private sector self—regulation solve it all. Soon we will publish the results of a special Eurobarometer on elections and democracy. Already now I can share with you that it shows that Europeans are worried: 73% are concerned about disinformation or misinformation online in the pre-election period; 81% are in favour of online social networks being fully transparent about political content online and about who is paying for them; 80% are in favour of online social networks making clear the amount of money they receive from political parties. The Commission and the European External Action Service are working hand in hand to define and implement an appropriate EU—wide response. In the long term, our objective should be that our respective societies all become more resilient and capable of defending themselves against disinformation. This means, for example, improving media literacy, access to quality journalism, supporting independent fact checkers and working with online platforms on how to prevent disinformation campaigns online without – and this is important to mention – restricting freedom of expression and freedom of speech. In the short term, our priority should be a coordinated response to the threats against the upcoming European and national elections. The recent election package adopted by the Commission includes several concrete measures. They are: the establishment of elections cooperation networks at national and at EU level; guidance on the application of data protection rules in the electoral context; recommendations on greater transparency in paid online political advertisements and communication; strengthened cybersecurity; diligent enforcement of existing electoral rules; awareness—raising and a legislative proposal allowing to sanction the misuse of personal data for electoral purposes.  I encourage the co—legislators to complete their work on it as soon as possible so that it is in force before the elections. We need to improve our analytical capabilities to detect, analyse and expose disinformation campaigns in cooperation with EU Member States and with the intelligence community working on hybrid threats.  Allow me to give you a quick overview of our follow—up actions. The Commission has written to the Member States urging them to set up their national election networks, and to identify appropriate single points of contact by the end of this month. We will convene the first meeting of the European election network in January. This network will facilitate the fast exchange of information and best practices, but also provide support to Member States in addressing the main areas of concern, which are: coordination of all relevant national authorities involved in the protection of elections; cybersecurity; strategy communication; data protection and hybrid threats. In the area of cybersecurity, the Commission organised in October a high—level conference bringing together, for the first time, 70 representatives of Member States, national electoral and cybersecurity authorities. The results of this important conference, which was organised mainly by Julian King, who is here today with me, will feed into the 2018 colloquium on fundamental rights, which Commission First Vice—President Timmermans and I will organise together in November, and which will be dedicated this year to democracy in the European Union. The Commission welcomes that the leading online platforms and representatives of the online advertising sector have agreed on a self—regulatory code of practice to address online disinformation. The Commission is monitoring closely its implementation.  However, this is not enough. In June this year, the European Council tasked the Commission and the External Action Service to develop an action plan on tackling disinformation. This action plan, which we are currently working on, will outline specific proposals for a coordinated EU response to the challenge of disinformation. We will build on existing initiatives, such as the work of the East StratCom Task Force, which was created in 2015 to address Russia’s ongoing disinformation campaigns. It will also build on the work of the Hybrid Fusion Cell, as well as the European Centre of Excellence for countering hybrid threats. An important part of their work is showing who is behind the disinformation attacks that are aimed against EU interests.  Addressing disinformation also means that we need to improve our ability to make our voice heard, to pass our messages and to tell our story. We therefore need to strengthen our strategic communications capacities, both within the EU and abroad. Finally, close cooperation and coordination of our efforts with the European Parliament in the run—up to the 2019 elections is absolutely crucial, and I fully trust we can rely on your support.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 142, "date": "2018-11-14.json", "name": "David McALLISTER", "mepid": "124806", "text": "   – Mr President, the EU Member States, as we have just heard, are facing an unprecedented threat to their democratic societies. Disinformation campaigns and the continuous support for anti-European political forces are undermining the European project and Western democracies in general. The efforts of non-state actors and third countries – and let’s name it, especially Russia – to distort facts, to manipulate reality, to foster distrust in the democratic process and even to interfere in our democratic elections, are completely unacceptable.  We must act immediately and boldly to enhance the EU’s resilience against such threats, including the risks for our next European elections in May 2019. In the run—up to the European elections, the European Union should focus on cooperation and information. Member States and EU institutions need to cooperate more intensively and share information more effectively. In this context, Commissioner Jourová, I support the Commission’s proposal for a cybersecurity competence centre. The European Union needs an effective, well-targeted and tailor-made strategy to communicate and promote EU policies in the run-up to our next elections.  We have to stand united.

It could not be more important and better timed. For my group, the S&amp;D, this is a big priority and I think the previous speaker spoke very eloquently on why that is the case, and I should say that very directly to him. But let’s be very clear, colleagues. For years we have been warning about the threat posed by the collection of citizens’ data online by a handful of social media companies and the power of those who hold this information. The revelations involving Cambridge Analytica and Facebook highlight the extent of this problem and show that the issue has now reached the point of threatening our core values. The author said that these were real threats to our democracy, and not virtual threats. The issue today, as the Commissioners have begun to set out, is one of action, and my Group is interested now in action and not just talking about the issue. Seven months out from the European elections, after the presidential elections in the US and after the UK referendum and leaving the European Union, I think it is about time that we talked about what we do, and the Commission has begun this process. But so has Parliament. So let’s be clear in what we have to do and let’s not leave this debate without saying it. Recent requirements in the last weeks introduced in the United States, but not here in the European Union – and also by the way, in the United Kingdom – to verify the identity, location and sponsor of political advertisements, have happened, but not here. This is important, and the same standards should be applied throughout the EU. But this does not just reveal the data involved in targeting users, which could help Facebook users contextualise political ads, understand how their data has been used, or potentially misused, and be able to respond to attempts to manipulate their opinion. We should have full algorithmic accountability and transparency for citizens to be able to protect themselves against any manipulation and to protect our electoral processes from possible foreign interference. We have now proven that this is happening, and we should have GDPR, as the Commissioner said, but also the cybersecurity resilience which Commissioner King should redouble his efforts to provide. And we should if possible – and I say this to the Council – be imaginative about e-privacy regulation if that is also possible, because the Facebook model was not just dealt with by the question of GDPR. But we need further tools and further regulation, and not just GDPR to deal with those further issues. We have to look at how political parties and campaigns are using social platforms for campaign purposes. We have called for a code of conduct to be developed with the participation of all actors concerned. And if not, then legislative action is needed. Regulation is needed. This is not about robust debate or just aggressive democracy. This is about manipulation and, as the Council said, sometimes about criminal activity and breaking the law. That is where the line has been crossed and that is where we need legislative action when necessary. But we also believe that applying conventional offline electoral safeguards, such as rules on transparency and limits to spending, respect for silence periods and equal treatment of candidates is essential, making it easy to recognise online political paid advertisements and the organisations behind them. Banning profiling for electoral purposes, including the use of online behaviour that may reveal political preference. Now is the time for action. We have spoken about the threats to our democracy, to our very core values. We at the European Parliament have had the hearings from journalists from The Guardian, we’ve examined Cambridge Analytica, we have interviewed Facebook. Now is the time for action. We have the commitment from the Commission. Let’s ask them to redouble their efforts, but here in Parliament our democracy is under threat. Let’s do something about it, and let’s have that action now.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 144, "date": "2018-11-14.json", "name": "Anna FOTYGA", "mepid": "28353", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Group. – Mr President, I would like to thank Commissioner Jourová for naming a series of elections we face in the years to come, because not only European elections, but every election which happens in each and every EU Member State requires a very resilient environment – resilient to external hostile malicious interference as well as, of course, to private interests. There is a role naturally of governments, legislators, national legislators as well as social media companies and civil society to build this resilience, to raise this awareness. Of course, there is a huge role for the EU and, in particular in the case of cybersecurity, for cooperation between the EU and NATO to tackle these challenges and these threats.  I would like to mention also the importance of transatlantic cooperation. Lessons learned from interference elsewhere in both the United States and other parts of the world enable cooperation over political divisions in tackling these problems because, rightly, we say that hostile violation of universal suffrage is a violation of fundamental human rights, and the role of politicians, of public actors, is to raise awareness. Therefore, we stress the importance of quality journalism. I would like to tackle one thing: the electoral process is still a dominant role and competence of EU Member States. Also, I would like to say that external actors like Russia have tailor—made these attacks, and therefore we have to be rather cautious in imposing common measures to tackle this, although I stress that we have to cooperate and cooperate closely.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 145, "date": "2018-11-14.json", "name": "Pavel TELIČKA", "mepid": "124706", "text": "  on behalf of the ALDE Group. – Mr President, this is a very serious issue, and I am very happy to see that, judging so far by the speakers that have spoken, we have a very broad consensus here in Parliament. The fight against disinformation, from my point of view, involves two main aspects. One is enhancing our resilience against those that are spreading disinformation and the other is appropriate education awareness, in order to be able to differentiate between what is really disinformation and what is not.  If I look at these two main aspects, I need to say that on the first one, one should also emphasise the regulatory framework, and I did listen very carefully to you, Madam State Secretary and the Council’s attitude. To be honest, I use that as an opportunity to say I don’t see it, for example, in the trilogue on the Cyber Security Act. I am not talking about the presidency. I know it is a very tough task to achieve, but the mindset in some Member States that co-decide on the common position has not changed. That brings me to the second aspect, and that is that education awareness is not just about citizens; it is about politicians. I very much appreciate what Commissioner Jourová has said and that is that the main threat is Russia. If we don’t use the proper words then we will be failing, and I must say that, once again, I don’t hear that clear language from the Council. There is clear evidence of that in terms of scale, coordination and also the stated willingness of the Russians to do so, and it is increasingly dominant. The European elections are behind doors. They are absolutely key. They are also a test on what we have just spoken about and what we are tackling. A final remark, on the East StratCom. Once again, I do appreciate what the Commissioner said. It is understaffed, but it is doing excellent work. It needs a permanent budget and I would appreciate it if we could see more emphasis from the Commission – I must say I was never impressed by the attitude of High Representative Mogherini in this respect: she can provide better assistance – but also emphasis from the Council.

For a while, it looked to me that colleagues would weigh themselves in the fallacy that only Ukraine would be at the centre of the cyber and fake news attacks of the information war. It has taken several years – from 2013 to 2014, when it became apparent in Ukraine – for Europeans to understand that they themselves are the target of this information war. I believe that this recognition is the first step in defence, and I think that many of the measures that are now being taken or have been adopted are also right – in keeping with what has been said.  However, I am still not sure whether the scale of this attack, which Russia has decided on the stability of the European Union, is understood, and I just think that the endowment of the programmes that we have decided so far is so weak that I cannot believe that the dimension has been understood. I would also like to point out once again, in this context, that it is a major problem for prominent politicians from European Member States to become part of Russia's information and uncertainty campaigns. As a German, I can only keep pointing out the former chancellor and current Rosneft boss Gerhard Schroeder. I also know, however, that we need to talk about Mr Gusenbauer in Austria or Mr Prodi in Italy. The Manafort papers have given us some insight. Parties have to deal with this if they really want to take on the challenge. Otherwise, I would like to thank Anna Fotyga.

There has been some evidence in recent years of outside actors – and in particular, the Russian state – seeking to interfere. There has also been, going back many years, slack control of the use of data harvested by social media giants and the use it’s put to, so vigilance is certainly in order. But I’m afraid to say that something else is going on here today: it’s the spectacle of the European political class clutching at straws.  So many votes have gone against its wishes – from Brexit to the defeat of Hillary Clinton, to the Italian election result, and more besides – that an elite which is unwilling to question its own complacent assumptions is looking for a scapegoat. And that scapegoat is the idea that so-called ‘fake news’ has led people into a false state of consciousness, causing them to turn unfairly against benevolent rulers and break out of parameters for political debate and action set in their own best interests from above.  Part of the thesis is the contention that almost any form of nation-state affiliation represents a giant step back towards the terrifying ethnic nationalism that left Europe drenched in blood in the 20th century. Mr Macron was at it again at the weekend when he claimed that nationalism was the opposite of patriotism. In fact, moderate, sensible nation—state preference is at the heart of sustaining the social solidarity we need to allow collective decision-making to run smoothly, and the revolt against the overreach of the globalist establishment is deep-rooted and based on considered thought. At its heart lies opposition to the ‘no borders’ ideology being pushed by the left and much of the centrist establishment too, which threatens to shatter social cohesion across Europe. Working—class voters in more prosperous European countries – people who depend on selling their labour for their income – are also in revolt against the creation of a single European labour market, which they quite correctly judge to be against their own best interests.  At a time like this, a wise European Union would be loosening the corset, allowing more room for national decision-making and respecting the mandates handed down to national governments by national electorates, but the EU we have is doing the opposite, picking fights with member nations on an almost weekly basis. My advice, therefore, is to prepare for an election result next year that most of you are not going to like, and don’t blame it on Russian bots or fake news because it will be a real message considered and profoundly meant from the people to the political class.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 149, "date": "2018-11-14.json", "name": "Jacques COLOMBIER", "mepid": "191510", "text": "  on behalf of the ENF group.

I have just listened to the last three speakers who actually say in the context of freedom of the media: let the Russians pull the strings here. The EU is very quickly criticised for propaganda. However, doing nothing is not an option! I will give you the concrete examples, especially for the profession behind me. Let me start in my own member state, the Netherlands. The day after the plane MH17 was brought down, Putin's troll factories went three times as fast to shift the blame to Ukraine via social media. Then brexit. There are also findings that Kremlin trolls wanted to influence the referendum. Worse still, we already have a governing party in our own European Union using manipulated video footage on social media.  I welcome the Proposals from the European Commission. After all, the fight against this is desperately needed and must be waged on several fronts. Of course, first of all, raising awareness of fake news through education and political awareness campaigns, in close consultation with the Member States. After all, that's where it starts.  We need more transparency. This can be done in consultation with tech companies, but also through legislation if these companies do not get over the bridge. It's about transparency about funding, about where it comes from, about who's behind political ads and about algorithms on social media platforms. Actually, we need to think one step further. For example, what about developments like Deepface, where video footage is manipulated in such a way that politicians put words in their mouths that they did not say themselves. In fact, the truth or development has already caught up with us, and we may have to do more, dear Commissioners, than is already on the table.

Freedom of expression is the greatest asset of a democracy. In my country, I have to see that the corridor of opinion of accepted opinions has become very narrow. Although there is no criminal prosecution, there is a social ostracism of disliked opinions everywhere. This reminds me of my childhood in the GDR, only that for many Germans today, the coverage from Switzerland or other foreign media has replaced Western television. Do you want to limit this spectrum of opinion? Just yesterday, during Mrs Merkel's speech here in plenary, Parliament's camera did not make a single swivel to our side of the Plenary. The opposition should not be visible at all, not only in terms of content, but also figuratively. If you are so convinced of the correctness of your arguments, then a different opinion is always worth a debate, is nit? Where I am with Mrs Merkel in particular, the practice of influencing foreign elections is not unknown to us either. Before the lockout period expired, the federal government transferred taxpayer money to the Clinton Foundation through its ministries. This money is also believed to have been used in the US election campaign. Has this ever been the subject of discussion in this House? Or is this becoming acceptable because you see yourself morally on the right side? The restriction of other opinions is now to be extended to foreign actors. This is unworthy of a democracy. Twenty-five years ago, when US economists in particular warned of the catastrophic effects of the introduction of the euro, this was described as anti-European. If these opinions had been seriously discussed at the time and not included in one's own bubble of moralising wishful thinking, things would be markedly different in Europe today. We must allow foreign opinions to be unrestricted, even if there are real or alleged falsehoods. We have had our own experiences with fake news in Germany since the events in Chemnitz.

The possible influence of foreign actors is very serious but we must not be carried away by the emotion of events such as the Facebook/Cambridge Analytica scandal. Instead, we must be objective and act not only in the interests of the 500 million citizens we represent here and, in my opinion, we must think about these three points: ensuring security, not falling into censorship and focusing on education. It's right to ensure online safety, but considering traditional elections in fully safe voting booths is just a fairy tale. There are distortions such as the exchange vote, hidden funding and not given to politicians. Pointing the finger and demanding an absolute degree of security for online activities is far-fetched, as this degree does not even exist in the analogue world. This obsessive quest for security at all costs brings us to the second point, which is the risk of censorship and the restriction of freedom of expression. The European Union has the rule of law, democracy and fundamental rights among its founding values, and any restriction of freedom of expression is intolerable. We therefore need a great deal of caution in the responses to be given and it is not by imposing new forms of network control, which would, moreover, be implemented by private individuals, that the regularity of the elections is guaranteed. Turning to the third and final point, I believe that the only response to be given is to promote educational policies that can provide citizens with the necessary tools to develop awareness, critical spirit and civic sense. Without education there can be no awareness and without it there can be no real democratic participation.

We also have examples in this House of people who have used the European Union and fake news about the European Union for electoral purposes already in recent election campaigns in different countries. So let us certainly think about the American elections and also the Brexit campaign, but let us also think about many campaigns that have taken place within the European Union. We know that politics is used today using social media, that technology and computer systems are an integral part of our lives and that is why we need to make sure that those who use them do so legally and on the basis of common rules and that it is possible to provide for financial penalties in the event of violations. Above all, we must be on our guard and firmly defend the protection of our data.  As you know, the European Parliament has already legislated in this area. Proposals are on the ground today. Mr Wieland and I are rapporteurs for the proposal on sanctioning European political parties for abuses of the use of electoral data. However, it is not only the guidelines that are needed, which are the preliminary stage – we legislate on sanctions, but the preliminary stage must prevent the violation from happening – but I believe that we also need a task force set up by the European Union to combat the use of fake news that will certainly take place using manipulated data from our constituents.

We are facing a global phenomenon with a high political impact, but it is also important to say that we are dealing with the tools of warfare. So we can only expect this to happen during the next European elections as well. I don’t see any reason why it should not.

Mr Commissioner, the 2019 vote is consequential for our fate and future. These elections are so important that is not only a matter of actually preserving the vote from disruption, but also preserving it from any rumours, fraud and interference. All available digital radars should be focused on the European election infrastructure and systems that are part of the voting process, but also on foreign intelligence activities, notably the Russian state-sponsored media outlet which operates in various Member States. And, yes, do not forget the financing of the electoral campaign and the political parties and political leaders in some countries which are too close to Moscow. Ahead of the European elections in 2019, the EU response should face these extremely topical challenges. This has to change and rapidly, before it is too late. As a result of the requested strategic communication plan to address Russia’s ongoing disinformation campaign, in 2015, East Stratcom started working. It has only 18 people and does not even have its own budget to face all those challenges. Let’s invest in Stratcom and let’s invite the Member States to work closely with Stratcom to prevent this.

As an old proverb says, if you want peace, prepare for war. This should not be taken literally, but the propaganda war must prepare to defend our values.  Russia has realised that direct intervention, such as in Crimea and south-eastern Ukraine, is facing serious Western resistance, so there is now an emphasis on fake news, propaganda on the Internet, on television, on fake profiles on social networks. Russia makes up not only fake news, as I say, but also fake views. This is an indisputable fact, interpreting in exactly the opposite sense. It is both about the occupation of the Baltic states, it was also the case with the downing of a Malaysian plane. What do we have to do? The party financing law must be sorted out first. When I heard some colleagues today who do not notice the fake news made by Russia, I think that perhaps the disorganization of the party financing law is the basis for this. Secondly, we need to work hard with journalists, to veer, to build media literacy, to inform the public. It is necessary not to mention only the bad news in the media, but it is also balanced with our achievements. We need to work with our NATO partners so that our technology specialists, cyber specialists, are stronger than those who are trying to disturb us, who are trying to hack our websites and so on.

One of the divisions of this Gerasimov hybrid army is influencing electoral processes.

This means in countries that unfortunately fell under the influence of the Soviet Union during communism. These are countries where Russia simply wants to exert its political and economic influence and does not want to strengthen that part of society that is pro-European.

We must count on the issue of migration to be greatly misused by the enemies of the European Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "cs", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 195, "date": "2018-11-14.json", "name": "Jiří POSPÍŠIL", "mepid": "125706", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, this is a vitally important subject that we’re debating this afternoon. Foreign, domestic, sometimes criminal, actors have, without doubt, sought to break the rules, sought to interfere in our democratic processes and raised questions about our democratic institutions. Make no mistake: that does represent a security challenge. We, from the Commission side, agree with those of you who say that we need to take action on a number of fronts: we need to build our cybersecurity and our resilience against cyberattacks, we need to tackle cyber manipulation through dis— and misinformation, and we need to tackle the misuse of mined personal data. We also agree that we need to call out examples of interference. I want to join those of you who have praised the excellent work carried out by the EU’s East Stratcom Task Force, which, over the last couple of years, has now gathered more than 4 000 cases of pro-Kremlin disinformation, contradicting publicly available facts, repeated in a number of languages and on a number of occasions. These activities basically reflect a public Russian military doctrine which openly advertises the use of false data and destabilising propaganda as legitimate tools. As a number of you have also observed, unfortunately it is not only Russia. Others are going down this route as well, which is why we also need to tackle the underlying vulnerabilities. We need to build our resilience through longer term actions – as many of you have said – on education, independent media and building critical awareness, but also through some shorter-term, more immediate actions, not least with the upcoming European parliamentary elections in mind. So we are pushing for early agreement on the Cybersecurity Act, the package of measures that we have proposed to try and build our cybersecurity and resilience. I note that in the US Congress they’ve just acted to create a US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. I think it is high time we followed that example. We’re also acting to tackle cyber criminality. We will continue to support Europol, who have in EC3 an internationally recognised centre of excellence in tackling cyber criminality. But, more generally, we need to work for transparency, traceability and the accountability of cyber criminals, which is why it is so important that we make progress on e—evidence. Without fast and effective access to electronic evidence, it is very hard to hold cyber criminals to account. As well as those steps, we need to tackle cyber manipulation and on that, building on the measures we presented last April in our communication on tackling online disinformation, we have – as has been mentioned – now agreed, in what is actually internationally a first, a Code of Practice on Disinformation with the big social media platforms, the big news platforms. We’ve asked those platforms to restrict targeting options for political advertising, to ensure transparency around sponsored content, to step up their efforts to identify and delete fake accounts, and to establish clear rules around bots. There should also be greater clarity around algorithms – as has been mentioned in this debate – and information on how they prioritise the content that that we see. This needs to be combined with tools enabling users more easily to discover content and access new sources representing alternative points of view, as well as to report disinformation. I think this code is a good starting point, but we need to go further. We need to press the platforms now to deliver granular, measurable objectives that we can hold them to account against. We will do that work, as a number of you have asked, as we prepare the action plan for early December. We still hope that we can see sufficient progress by working quickly together on a voluntary basis, but we’ve been clear that we reserve the right to consider our options again if we don’t see the progress that we need. As my colleague, Commissioner Jourová, mentioned earlier, in September President Juncker presented a set of measures specifically on election security, asking Member States to set up a national election cooperation network of all the relevant authorities. We have brought them together – representatives from each of the Member States, those responsible for running elections, those responsible for cybersecurity, and those responsible for data protection – and we will build an effective European—level network so that those experts can share best practice and support each other, and we can build our collective resilience. From the Commission side, we very much welcome your strong engagement on these issues. As we’ve said before in these debates, raising awareness is the first line of defence, but, in itself, it is not enough. We need to go further. We need to maximise our preparedness ahead of the series of elections that are coming up. We are committed to working with you, with Member States and with the private sector better to secure the foundations of our democracy: free speech, freedom of expression, and indeed the right of all of those who have spoken today, including those who attacked the Commission.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "PPE-DE", "partyIdeology": "PPE-DE"}, {"id": 196, "date": "2018-11-14.json", "name": "Karoline EDTSTADLER", "mepid": "197643", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Mr President, it’s quite difficult at the end of the debate to say something new in this debate, because I would like to say that this very useful debate showed and demonstrated a high degree of convergence between the European Parliament’s and the Council’s and also the Commissioner’s view on the importance of EU resilience against any influence of foreign actors in the upcoming EP election campaign – and I would like to emphasise this – no matter from which country it is evolving. I fully second what Commissioner King said: we have a lot to do in a lot of different areas and regarding different topics. It is clear that it is still work in progress, and I’m looking forward to further results in the short— and the medium—term. Let me assure you of our firm commitment to continuing the work that I outlined already at the beginning of our debate and of our readiness to adopt and effectively implement concrete measures to protect the internet and the cyberspace from criminal misuse. It is clear that these objectives cannot be met without common efforts to ensure a free, open, safe and secure cyberspace and in close cooperation with other public and private stakeholders. This work is actively supported by the contractual public—private partnership on cybersecurity between the European Commission and the European Cyber Security Organisation. But I doubt that we will be able to complete this work at any time. Our work in the cyber domain is now far away from being completed, and against a background of the developing technology, we have to work a lot also in the future – I’m convinced of that. We need to join forces – and also that was mentioned by the Commissioner – to raise the awareness of all stakeholders, to encourage action, and to improve the capacities and capabilities of the EU and its Member States to tackle the ever—growing sophistication of cyber—attacks and evolving cyber—threats around the world. We need to make good use of all the EU initiatives directed at increasing cyber resilience and invest in the implementation of all recently announced measures.

They will be called to lead Europe into a new era full of challenges, opportunities and threats. The stakes are critical and some will attempt to weaken the electoral process by spreading fake news, amplifying populist and anti-European voices and insousing nationalisms. Their success will be not only the emergence of populist and anti-European forces, but also the low participation rate of European citizens. The answer to those who want to see a weakened Europe is greater participation of citizens. Strengthening democracy.

It is particularly shameful that fake propaganda in Hungary is carried out exclusively by the government - and clearly in support of Vladimir Putin's anti-EU policies. The government's disinformation is part of everything the EP condemned in relation to the Sargentini report. Orban's troll army is working to monopolize the written and electronic press and silence the critical voices of the political opposition and the civil sphere. At the same time, the European Union is constantly being attacked on the Internet with a mass of aggressive, eye-picked lies. They create fear and division among voters - which is then used for their nationalist, racist policies. The cleanliness of the EP elections is therefore also under threat from Hungary of the Union and the Government of The European Union. I would like to draw attention to the fact that, in addition to the campaigns of lies, it is preparing for another manipulation of the Hungarian electoral law.

This is reflected in the fact that in many countries voter turnout remains at a low level. This is particularly true of the European elections, where voter turnout is often below 40%. We need to come up with solutions to this problem.  In the elections, capital circles and various advocacy organisations sought to get their own candidates elected to key positions of trust in Parliament, the Government and the European Parliament. The aim is, of course, that representatives sponsored with election money should, in their duties, particularly contribute to the interests of their donors. Election campaigns in general are often too simplistic and over-the-top, even smearing of misleading and political opponents, further confounding undecided voters.  Disinformation, which is becoming increasingly common online and in traditional media, is one of the biggest challenges to the realisation of European democracy. The more disinformation is disseminated on social media, fake news, fake factbooks and fake videos, the less people believe in the reliability of any information they receive. Each editor-in-chief and publishing director should understand and take responsibility for publishing only facts. The reader, listener and viewer must be able to easily distinguish between facts and fictions. Simply staring at turnover should not be the main issue in any publishing business.

In the age of social media and targeted advertising, it becomes more difficult to enforce existing rules, for example the ones forbidding the use of foreign money. The internet does not know national borders; therefore, the sponsor of a politically targeted advertisement (which could even contain blatant lies masquerading as facts or news) could be located anywhere. This is why, as a bare minimum, we need more transparency regarding political targeted advertising: who purchased it and where the target audience is located. It might be healthier to ban political targeted advertising on social media altogether; one thing is to use it to sell commercial goods, but using it to influence or even manipulate the democratic choice of citizens is something entirely different.

Commissioner Bulc, i would like to thank you for your comments. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur Let me start by saying: this is a very important day of our debate on the development of consumer rights, a specific consumer, which is rail passengers in Europe. It is about more than four billion people who travel by rail every year. It is also about the millions of workers employed in rail transport, and therefore a comprehensive and crucially important project on a very large scale. At the outset, I would like to thank my shadow rapporteurs, in particular Mr Denis de Jong, who, on behalf of the IMCO Committee, was comingly activism in the preparation of the report. I would like to stress the high willingness of the Commission to cooperate and to thank Commissioner Bulc.  Let me start with what Parliament can achieve with tomorrow's vote. The first and fundamental issue with regard to passenger rights is compensation for train delays. We propose to increase compensation amounts to 100% in the event of a delay of more than 121 minutes. I realize that it will not be easy. A possible alternative would be compensation of 100 % with a delay of more than 180 minutes.  The second issue, which is particularly important and noteworthy, is to increase the availability of connecting tickets, so-called through-tickets, for passengers who lose their connections because the tickets were intended for connecting flights. They will have the right to take a seat on the next train at no additional cost.  Another issue is accessibility for travellers with reduced mobility: the group of people we want to allow access to mobile means is very large and growing. We propose, of course, that at top-class stations that serve at least 10,000 passengers per day, there should be no prenotification, followed by a three-hour notification at smaller stations and a 12-hour notification at the smallest.  We also open the railway for bicycle transport. We suggest that up to eight bicycles can be transported on the train. Over time, this provision will apply to every train. We also want to extend the scope of the Regulation on the protection of passenger rights not only to international and national trains, but also to regional trains, so that the same rights apply to these trains throughout the European Union. This is one side of the coin.  At the same time, we want to make it very clear that this solution is intended to mobilise states and governments to be more concerned about the quality of railway infrastructure, about rolling stock, as well as about the economic and physical accessibility of transport for passengers. We want rail transport to become an alternative so that all its advantages, such as ecology, cheap access, reliability and safety, can find their place here. We would also like to – and in this direction this solution is going – to level the playing field and the rules for rail transport to compete with other modes of transport. Thank you again for your cooperation and I look forward to your debate.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 214, "date": "2018-11-14.json", "name": "Bogusław LIBERADZKI", "mepid": "23768", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, I would also like to thank very much the rapporteur from the Committee on Transport and Tourism (TRAN), Mr Liberadzki, and the shadow rapporteurs, as well as the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection (IMCO) for their intensive and very dedicated work on the Commission’s proposal to recast the Rail Passengers’ Rights Regulation.  It is indeed, as Mr Liberadzki already said, a unique opportunity to improve rail passengers’ protection and, at the same time, to ensure further development of the rail sector, which also has an essential role to play in the development of multi-modal, integrated mobility as a service solution and in decarbonisation of transport.  First of all, let me stress that the Commission very much welcomes Parliament’s objective to promote more attractive rail services and better passenger protection, but allow me to comment on some of your specific amendments.  First, on amendments beyond the recast legislative technique: we do have some institutional concerns over specific amendments which are not in line with the rules agreed between our institutions for the recast legislative technique. Some changes, such as the compensation levels in cases of service delay or cancellations, are not part of the Commission’s legislative proposal. This said, we fully understand and share your good intentions to increase passengers’ protection in the sector and we will examine the respective provisions put forward in detail taking account of the Commission’s prerogative of legislative initiative. Of course, for those provisions which have been included in the Commission’s recast proposal and which have undergone significant amendment following the EP debate, for example, regulation on through tickets, we stand ready to actively participate in the upcoming interinstitutional discussions.  On persons with reduced mobility, it really goes without saying that we are very much in favour of increasing, to the most feasible and realistic extent, the mobility of all European citizens. We, therefore, very much value Parliament’s effort to improve the situation of persons with disabilities and reduced mobility. We are open to those amendments that can lay solid ground for generally improving the mobility of these citizens in need. Allow me just to share one very concrete example that I was able to directly witness and experience – when we made the special effort to make it happen for a person with disabilities to also use the European programme Discover EU and travel with different modes, primarily railway, throughout the EU and be part of this exciting programme for the youth. It’s a really good example of how we can improve conditions and how we can really enable all European citizens to be able to take advantage of European programmes. So, that’s very much appreciated, Mr Liberadzki. On bicycles, it will be of no surprise to you that I also welcome those amendments which may further contribute to increasing the use of ecologically friendly transport modes such as bicycles. The Commission shares your enthusiasm about new mobility opportunities. Further efforts will be needed in order to ensure that there are no loopholes on this path. For example, passengers shall be properly informed about those new opportunities. We shall also ensure that when train capacity for taking bicycles on board is reached, any possible refusal takes place on transparent and justifiable grounds.  On passenger information, I would also like to stress that the Commission welcomes amendments that increase the level of rail passenger information about their rights, the journey opportunities offered to them, as well as events and outcomes surrounding the trip.  On derogations, we will not be able to truly promote the interests of EU rail passengers and the single market if our legal provisions are accompanied by a widespread practice of granting derogations. The Commission therefore supports increased limitations on such derogation possibilities, which should be based on a purely balanced approach taking into account both passengers’ and industrial interests.  To conclude, I am convinced that all efforts invested in this legislative file will pay off. Improving the current rules would not only increase the mobility of EU citizens and open new opportunities, but also open new opportunities to them. It would also contribute to enhancing competition in the rail sector and also improve rail services. In turn, all this will increase the overall attractiveness of rail transport, to the benefit of passengers, industry, and our environment.  Once again, I would really like to express my appreciation of Parliament’s work on improving rail passengers’ protection and I look forward to today’s debate.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is a great day for us and for the millions of train users. For the first time, thanks to this regulation, Europe will finally take users into account. Until now, the European Union had always dealt with railway companies and infrastructure managers. It was completely abnormal for the main stakeholders, the users, to be left out. The last report was in 2007, we waited ten years! Ten years later, this injustice will finally be repaired, and this on the whole of the European rail network. You talk about derogations, we do not want them, we have already wasted enough time. Regional and cross-border lines will also be governed by these new rules, which is great news. Never forget that 90% of European rail passengers use these regional routes on a daily basis. What are the main commitments of this landmark reform? They are based on four pillars. First: compensation. If your train is one hour late, then a 50% refund is provided, which is normal. If it is two hours late, which is not acceptable on the European continent, the reimbursement is 100% in this case. That is the norm. Second, in the event of a missed connection, for whatever reason, operators are required to reroute you to your next destination. They can't leave you on the edge of the dock. With this unique ticket, regardless of the operator, the operator will have to meet its obligations at no additional cost. The far west rail is over! Third: assistance. Commissioner, you are talking about an attempt. That is not the case. With this file, we must guarantee to the 80 million people with disabilities or reduced mobility that they will be cared for in all the major stations in Europe, but also in small stations with a three-hour pre-notification. Mobility for all will be the reality of tomorrow. You can't leave people with reduced mobility on the side of the road. Finally, fourth: sustainable mobility. Each train, from 2024, will have to provide eight seats for the bikes. This is a great step towards softer and more respectful mobility and is an essential step in fulfilling our COP commitments. It should be noted that rail is the most publicly funded mode of transport in Europe. It is still a bit unusual for this service to be less well perceived by users than other modes of transport, such as the aircraft. Finally, thanks to this file, rail users will benefit from a better service than in air transport. And for the first time, Europe is taking care of rail users. So I clearly ask the European Commission and the Council not to go back in the forthness of the upcoming negotiations.

The European Parliament must not fail them by caving in to rail industry lobbying. The top complaint of train travellers is delays and cancellations. That fact is not just anecdotal, but is acknowledged independently by the International Rail Regulators’ Group and the European Court of Auditors.  So, particularly problematic is the Commission’s proposal for the introduction of a so—called ‘force majeure’ clause, seeking to allow rail companies to refuse to pay compensation to passengers for delays and cancellations in certain circumstances, including severe weather conditions. This aims to reverse a key passenger—friendly decision of the EU Court of Justice in 2013.  Worse still, is the version of ‘force majeure’ proposed by our own European Parliament Committee on Transport and Tourism (TRAN), which could even be interpreted to include lawful strikes and other industrial action. Whilst the TRAN Committee’s amendments do have some good points, as our rapporteur has explained, they allow exemptions for suburban rail services, despite evidence showing that these are the most widely used services by passengers across Europe, especially younger people. Under the TRAN Committee’s amendments, passengers will only have the right to onward travel on the next train in the course of delays and cancellations where a connection is missed in the course of a single transport contract. In real life, this is often not the case when tickets are bought separately.  So, in the vote tomorrow, I urge all MEPs to support the alternative approach tabled by myself and many others: in particular, do not make rail passengers suffer still further for the consequences of external factors causing problems with their journeys.

Only a minority of Member States have fully implemented the passenger rights adopted almost ten years ago. That is why I think it is good that we are taking action here today.  I am pleased that we have found a strong compromise on bicycle transport. Anyone who knows me can feel that. The European Parliament wants us to have mandatory parking spaces on all trains in the near future – without loopholes as before. This will no longer force customers to transport their bicycles by other modes of transport.  A large majority is also in favour of the transit ticket. No wonder! Transit sit-throughs were already the authoritative standard by international conventions as early as 1923. We are a long way from that today. 67% of passengers are in favour of uniform rights for the entire rail journey from start to finish, even if you have to change trains, even if you have to change trains several times. However, this is hardly available, especially for cross-border connections. The prerequisite for transit tickets is accessible travel information and booking systems. We have found strong formulations for the necessary open interfaces, open data, so that this will also improve in the future. For full-fledged passengers, however, we must, in principle, remove the state of emergency 'higher violence'. I have always been committed to this, including in the negotiations. Until now, there has been no such thing as a fact in the case of the railways. The introduction of force majeure would lead to a barely unacceptable legal uncertainty at the expense of passengers. Only a tiny part of the delays are caused by force majeure at all. The arbitrary interpretations of the airlines should be a warning to us. The Court of Auditors has also confirmed this in its current report. A tyre defect was for an airline force majeure, which is crazy, but sad reality.  Another problem is assistance at stations, with no pre-registration time. Only at stations with more than ten thousand passengers a day can persons with reduced mobility take advantage of spontaneous assistance. 97% of stations would therefore be exempt from this scheme.

By restricting exceptions and excluding language barriers to the complaint, we succeed in doing so. Second, information for passengers must be provided in real time, both before and during the journey. Thirdly, the so-called transit ticket should not be the exception, but the rule. A single ticket must be enough to be able to travel nationally and cross-border. Fourthly, the rights of rail passengers who are restricted or disabled in their mobility must be significantly strengthened. I am very pleased that my proposal has been adopted, which makes the lead time for assistance dependent on the size of the station.

Now only 50% of the ticket price can be recovered. A second point that has already been mentioned is that passengers can more easily take their bicycles on board the train. In a cycling country like the Netherlands, this is of great importance. We will also ensure that transport to the stations and the connecting journey on the way to the destination are more sustainable. Moreover, my third point is that it will be much easier for passengers with reduced mobility, for people with disabilities, to take the train in Europe. From now on, they can count on assistance on the platform without having to arrange it days in advance. This allows them to arrange their trip much more smoothly.  Ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow we will accept the proposal to make trains more attractive in Europe.

The recasting of the regulation on passenger rights in rail transport starts at many good points. In the end, the EU will strengthen the rights of rail passengers to provide information and compensation; that is our goal. In the end, however, passengers' rights must also be enforceable. From a consumer protection perspective, for example, it is incomprehensible why guests should lose all right to reimbursement or compensation in the event of weather events.

I am glad that Parliament has clearly confirmed its support for improving the protection of rail passengers. Today’s discussion has confirmed that we agree on many of the aspects which will allow us to deliver on this important proposal. Before I conclude, please allow me to address some of your comments. On integrated and multimodal travel, let me confirm that, today, we have a set of EU regulations applicable only to each individual transport mode separately. Let me also confirm that we are progressively moving, already, towards multimodal integrated solutions. This year is a year of multimodality and it is a perfect time to address passenger rights, as well, within the multimodal environment. For passengers combining the use of different modes in one journey, the Commission is now launching preparatory work to develop multimodal and integrated-ticket passenger rights. This is our next challenge. So yes, it is important that we set very clear rules, as is reflected in your report. This is especially important for passengers with reduced mobility, who need adequate assistance at transfer points when using a single ticket and otherwise. Our cooperation on this topic is not done yet. On force majeure: let me say that, regarding the inclusion and the scope of the force majeure clause, we fully understand your efforts to ensure the best possible passenger protection and smooth operation of railway services. The introduction of the force majeure clause exempts railway undertakings from having to pay compensation where long delays are caused by events beyond their control and which they were not able to prevent. While a force majeure clause has been included in the proposal, events that trigger it have been restricted to natural disasters – so-called acts of God. Let me repeat that: a very narrow, restrictive definition of situations caused through purely natural disasters – in order to avoid legal uncertainty and to limit the reduction of passenger rights. The introduction of the force majeure clause aligns rail with other modes of transport in terms of passenger rights legislation, and also of consumer legislation such as the Package Travel Directive. It ensures that the general principle of legal fairness is applied. But, as I said earlier, we will have an opportunity to clarify this issue further when we address integrated ticketing and multimodal passenger rights. I will not go over again the issues that I have already addressed in my opening remarks. As a closing comment, I would like to express once more my deep appreciation of the work you have done. It was crucial to conclude the discussion in Parliament before the elections and I am confident that the position adopted by the European Parliament will serve as a solid basis for the negotiation with the Council.

We want rights that are attractive to passengers and that will make passengers want to use the railways.  Secondly, the solutions and rights of passengers with regard to rail liability must be feasible for carriers and must not entail an increase in ticket prices. If someone asked about the cost: yes, we estimated the cost. We are talking about several hundred million euros. Let us remember, however, that at this time we will spend tens of billions of euros under cohesion policy, the Structural Funds and the Connecting Europe Facility on modernising rail transport in Europe. We have the right to expect quality improvements. And I believe that no one will deny us this right. We want services to be available to passengers both on price and physically. We are talking about coherent regulations throughout the European Union, perhaps with the exception of Cyprus and Malta, because not a single railway line has been built there yet, but, who knows, anything can happen. We want the responsibility of railways and ticket vendors to be unavoidable, as formulated and enforceable.

The new legislation modernises the rights of train passengers and protects consumers more effectively by providing them with a framework of rights equivalent to that applicable to air transport. Better service is provided to people with reduced mobility and clear complaint handling procedures are provided, with greater compensation in cases of delays.

There is no disagreement in this House that this is necessary. The latest research on persistent organic pollutants (POPs) shows a worrying persistence of previously banned substances, particularly in the polar regions, and it’s important that we keep up the momentum on this. The report includes a new role for the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), giving them much more involvement in certain tasks. This is a move that I strongly welcome. I am aware that not all Members of this House are supportive of ECHA – they don’t particularly support it as an organisation – but in my former role as Parliament’s ECHA liaison person for many years, I witnessed at first hand the excellent work that they do. I very much welcome the use of their in-house expertise on POPs, as opposed to using outside consultants. That is a good move forward. We’re limited in what we can change here, as the Stockholm Convention supersedes the EU legislation, so this report has been relatively straightforward compared with previous legislation, and indeed with other things that I’ve worked on. But there are issues, and there is one particular issue – the problem of plastics recycling – which remains to be resolved in the vote tomorrow. This concerns the substance decaBDE. For political reasons which are not clear to me – but which, I would say, just amount to negligence – we find ourselves in a position where this substance was not granted a recycling exemption at UN level, despite the fact that less stable substances from the same chemical group have recycling derogations in place, and these were not removed by the Stockholm Convention. I sought to address this issue at committee level, but the oral amendment that I proposed was rejected by MEPs from some of the political groups. This was regrettable because it would have been best to have the issue dealt with at committee level. So I have re-tabled the same amendment – that’s Amendment 30 – for plenary. I cannot emphasise strongly enough the importance of this amendment when it comes to the EU’s circular economy objectives. Amendment 30 concerns five substances, four of which currently have individual recycling derogations of 1 000 ppm, and it imposes a limit of 1 000 ppm for all five combined. That’s a major net benefit environmentally and it is in line with limits set out in the current Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive. The fifth substance, decaBDE, has the same recycling derogation under the REACH (Registration, Evaluation and Authorisation of Chemicals) Directive, a limit agreed only last year. I also include in my amendment a review of this limit in five years’ time. Without this amendment, the vast majority of plastics recyclers dealing with WEEE (waste electrical and electronic equipment) and end—of—life vehicles would have to dramatically reduce their activities or stop altogether. This would particularly and disproportionately affect SMEs. We are talking about 900 000 tons of end—of—life vehicle plastic waste each year, which will probably end up being exported outside Europe for recycling, where standards are far less rigorous and there is a real risk of it finding its way illegally into products such as toys, which are then imported into Europe. If we deal with it and recycle it within Europe to high standards, that should not, and cannot, happen. Amendment 37 seeks to impose a more ambitious target and, while I fully support ambition, its adoption would actually be negative rather than positive. What’s more, my Amendment 30 includes a review of the limit in five years’ time and this is crucially important. We have a strong commitment to the circular economy, and I hope that Members will bear that in mind when considering how to vote on these amendments.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "ECR", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 260, "date": "2018-11-14.json", "name": "Julie GIRLING", "mepid": "96956", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, I would like to thank the European Parliament, notably the rapporteur, Ms Girling, and the shadow rapporteurs for the work done on the Commission’s proposal to recast the POPs Regulation. POP stands for persistent, organic and pollutant. The term refers to chemical substances that persist in the environment, that bio-accumulate through the food chain and that are highly toxic to human health and the environment. Let me underline that these substances can be transported over thousands of miles in the environment from where they were released. This is why persistent organic pollutants are a global concern. As is often the case, global challenges require global solutions. The international community took action on these chemicals through the establishment of the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, which entered into force in 2004. The current EU Regulation on Persistent Organic Pollutants dates from 2004 and implements the international commitments expressed in the Stockholm Convention. The Regulation aims at eliminating the production, placing on the market and use of internationally produced persistent organic pollutants (POPs). In addition, it aims at reducing and eliminating the releases of POPs that are unintentional by—products of industrial processes such as dioxins. Last March, the Commission proposed the recast of the EU Regulation on Persistent Organic Pollutants in order to bring its procedures into line with the procedures set out in the Lisbon Treaty. The recasting process gave us an opportunity to update certain aspects of the regulation, to provide further clarity and to make its processes more efficient. For example, we proposed a role for the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) to assist the Commission and provide scientific support. In addition, we adopted and streamlined reporting and monitoring obligations and proposed to align the annexes to the Regulation on Persistent Organic Pollutants with the outcome of the 2015 Conference of the Parties to the Stockholm Convention. Finally, we brought certain terms and definitions into line with those used in the EU REACH Regulation.

We are talking about dioxins, furans and pesticides, but also flame retardants that are still present in many everyday products such as TV screens, computers or car components. That is why the International Convention obliges us to be very strict in the treatment of these substances, which are very strict even when it comes to managing the presence in waste and materials that are treated for recycling.  That is why I would like to make it clear that we must prevent these products from being exported and treated outside Europe according to environmental standards that are not ours and then returning to Europe through the window. That is why we Socialists want to support and promote recycling activities, but at the same time to set ever more stringent and more ambitious limits.

It has been a really useful discussion and has touched upon the main elements of the Commission’s proposal.  Let me underline, however, one specific issue concerning your proposal of listing decaBDE (decabromodiphenyl ether) in the recast, since this featured prominently during the discussion. While I fully understand the objective of Parliament to take into account the experience and concerns of the recycling sector, I would like to remind you that it is crucial that our circular economies are as free as possible of toxic chemicals. This is in line with the objective of both the United Nations Stockholm Convention and the EU Regulation on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPS) to eliminate production and use of these substances. To achieve that objective, it is of utmost importance that materials that contain persistent organic pollutants can be used or placed on the market only if those pollutants are present as unintentional trace contaminants. We must also be aware that products made from recycled materials will be accepted by consumers only if they have confidence in the quality and safety of the recycled material. Before I conclude, let me refer to some of your additional comments. First, regarding Mr Andrieu’s point about breaches of chemical legislation, I’d like you to know that this study was conducted regarding the REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals) Regulation, whereas, in the debate, we were discussing the recast of the POPs Regulation and I would therefore really like to focus only on that. Secondly, we think that it is important to note that, contrary to the Stockholm Convention, discussions regarding other similar substances, the Stockholm Convention decision that listed decaBDE in Annex A to the Convention does not include a derogation for recycling of products containing decaBDE. This is significantly different from the listing of the other PBDEs (polybrominated diphenyl ethers) under the Convention in 2009, where such a recycling derogation was included. In this case, the listing of the PBDEs in the POPs Regulation in 2010 specifies that the unintentional trace contamination (UTC) levels for the PBDEs is ten ppm (parts per million), but in line with the listings in the Convention, a derogation of 1000 ppms for recycled materials is allowed.

I am particularly concerned at the attempts by one or two Members to roll into POPs (persistent organic pollutants) discussions around agri-chemicals such as glyphosate. It is utterly irresponsible to stand up in this Parliament and imply that glyphosate is a POP. It is not. This legislation is far too serious to play those sorts of politics with.  So, let’s restrict ourselves to dealing with the persistent organic pollutants. As I said in my opening address, there is no disagreement here that we all would like to eliminate them. The point is about how we do it, the rate at which we do it and the methodology. For me, I would just make my point again, yes, it’s true, as Ms Rivasi said, that there are studies that show that decaBDE (decabromodiphenyl ether), for example, has turned up in hair brushes. This is appalling, but I will bet my life that those hairbrushes were produced in the Far East. They were not produced in Europe, and they come from bad recycling.  If we want to prevent that from happening, if we want the recycling to take place in Europe, by European companies bound by European rules, which will not then put the recyclates on the market for products like food contact materials and toys, according to our rules, then we have to take control of that process. Pretending that we’re not going to recycle at all when we have legislation like the ELV (End-of-Life Vehicles) Directive and the WEEE (Waste Electrical &amp; Electronic Equipment) Directive in place is frankly ostrich-like. So, I ask Members yet again to re-examine their support of Amendment 30 or Amendment 37, and to look carefully at Amendment 30, which not only sets out recycling reductions – because it takes four products, rolls them into five and gives the absolute maximum for all five, which is actually a reduction to 20% – but it also has a review mechanism which would allow us in five years, if we can get best available technology in place in the European recycling industry, to recycle these products. It would allow us to be in a position where we could actually eliminate these.

The approach currently taken by the EU to recycling and the limits of persistent organic pollutants is literally toxic. Especially if there are safer alternatives.

Issues related to statistics are therefore a regular item on the Council’s agenda. The Council regularly – once every year – reviews the EU’s statistical information needs, examines reports provided by EU statistical bodies and adopts conclusions, which evaluate progress and set priorities for the upcoming year. Undoubtedly, high—quality, accurate and reliable statistical data can only be produced by independent statistical authorities.  The professional independence of the EU’s national and Union—level statistical bodies is enshrined in EU law. The EU’s statistical authorities also operate according to the European Statistics Code of Practice. The implementation of the Code’s 16 principles is monitored by the Independent European Statistical Governance Advisory Board, which informs both Parliament and the Council. Indeed, the situation as regards the professional independence of statistical authorities in general has been satisfactory.  The important exceptions, however, are the concerns expressed over the judicial proceedings against the former President of Greece’s statistical authority, ELSTAT, Andreas Georgiou, and two senior ELSTAT officials. The Commission has repeatedly reiterated since 2016 its full confidence in the reliability and accuracy of ELSTAT data from 2010 to 2015 and since then. The issue has also been addressed by the Eurogroup in the context of Greece’s Third Economic Adjustment Programme, whose conditionality included requirements to review the provisions related to the autonomy of independent parties, including ELSTAT. Against this background, in June this year, on the occasion of concluding Greece’s Third Programme, the Eurogroup mandated the institutions to continue monitoring developments in the legal proceedings against the former President and senior staff of ELSTAT and against the members of the Committee of Experts of the Hellenic Republic Asset Development Fund. It also mandated them to monitor the supporting actions taken by the Greek authorities, including legislative actions, if needed, in full respect of the independence of the judiciary. The institutions are expected to report back to the Eurogroup in the context of the post—programme surveillance. These reports, in addition to the regular reporting by the European statistical agencies, will keep us informed on the situation related to ELSTAT.  With this, I will finish my brief statement and I will listen attentively to the Commissioner’s intervention and to your debate.

The independence of statistics and of the statistical authorities that produce them is a fundamental principle explicitly set out in EU law. The current governance of the European statistical system relies primarily on a clear, legal framework, the so—called statistical system. With your support, that law has been improved and strengthened, on the initiative of the Commission and in full observance of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality. Like any principle or rule set out in law, statistical independence needs to be monitored and its implementation needs to be ensured in practice. Regulatory monitoring is carried out both by the Commission and by independent peers in the context of the European Statistics Code of Practice, already mentioned by the Presidency. This code aims to enhance the professional independence, integrity and accountability of European statistics and of the European statistical system. You in this House, as the European legislator, have contributed to ensuring the transparency and accountability of the European statistical system by establishing the European Statistical Governance Advisory Board (ESGAB). ESGAB is an independent body of experts that oversees the implementation of the Code of Practice, and every year it makes a report, which it presents to you, honourable Members, as well as to the Council. The annual ESGAB reports have always covered the principle of professional independence and illustrated the progress achieved at national and EU levels. On the basis of the Commission’s and ESGAB’s monitoring, the Member States have identified and implemented improvement measures that contribute to maintaining the confidence of users, and particularly their trust in the independence of statistics. As regards the specific situation in Greece and the situation of Mr Georgiou, let me firstly emphasise that the Commission has full confidence in the reliability and the accuracy of data produced by the statistical authority in Greece under Mr Georgiou’s leadership in the years from 2010. The Commission has consistently confirmed this in previous public statements. Secondly, let me repeat that the Commission neither comments on developments in ongoing national judicial proceedings nor assesses the impact of court decisions that are not final and irrevocable. That said, I can understand that the staff of the Hellenic Statistical Authority (ELSTAT) may feel they are not sufficiently well protected to do their jobs effectively and independently. The Commission has followed the developments in Greece consistently and has repeatedly expressed its concern in that regard, both in public statements and directly to the Greek authorities. The Eurogroup has also consistently expressed its support for Mr Georgiou and, most recently in its statement on Greece of 22 June this year, it has been inviting the European institutions to monitor the developments and to report back to the Eurogroup. It’s important to highlight that the Commission has actively supported Greek statistics on several fronts. The support has led, inter alia, to amendments of Greek law to further enhance the statistical authority’s institutional, operational and financial independence. Other legal amendments have provided for the indemnification of current or former statistics officials for legal expenses incurred in the context of trials following lawsuits or criminal charges against them related to the performance of their duties. Commission officials have also contributed extensively, with their expertise, to strengthening the statistical processes in Greece, and we continue to do that, as we do in other Member States too. In conclusion, I would like to reassure the honourable Members that not only has the independence of the national statistical authorities been strengthened in law, but Eurostat is also actively working to ensure that independence exists in practice too. Your continued vigilance will help us in this task.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 281, "date": "2018-11-14.json", "name": "Georgios KYRTSOS", "mepid": "125063", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. Madam President, the picture I have of Mr Georgiou is that he is an excellent scientist and technocrat who has fallen victim to the circumstances and political legal games. Part of society has charged him, in the heat of the crisis, with Greece's forced inclusion in a loan programme for allegedly changing the elements. Greece had necessarily entered a loan program before Mr. Georgiou finalized the statistics. Unfortunately, by staying in the euro we did not - for reasons of political cost - make the necessary reforms, as other countries have done, leading to over-indebtedness and deadlock. Countries with smaller problems than ours, such as Ireland, Portugal and Cyprus, were also forced to enter into a loan programme and implement the relevant memorandum. So it is not Mr Georgiou's fault for our problems, which continue because of the 2015 crisis. There are, of course, judicial officers who assess the situation differently. Suffice it to say that the former President of the Supreme Court, who is now an adviser to Prime Minister Tsipras, had sent a letter to Mr Juncker denouncing the loan programme. What we can and must do for Mr Georgiou is to insist that his judicial adventure be over and to make sure that the legal costs are passed on to the Greek State, as has already been decided. I therefore believe that the judicial adventures of Mr Georgiou must be put to an end. In my opinion, the routes that afflict him are underground.

Madam President, the issue of artificially inflating the public deficit in 2009 proved decisive in order to enable george papandreou's government to legitimise and initiate Greece's accession to the International Monetary Fund and the Memorandums. Thus, while the Karamanlis government, in September 2009, had identified the public deficit at 6%, the Papandreou government, after PASOK's election victory in October 2009, identified it at 12.7%. What was the result? Undermine the country's borrowing position. Launch a borrowing crisis and lead Greece into the \"hug\" of the troika, which for eight years impoverished the Greek people, slashed wages and pensions and soared debt from 115% of GDP to 180%. The proof of the artificial widening of the deficit also exposes the European Union itself, as it proves that the memorandum was imposed when it was not necessary for Greece. After all, Mr Dijsselbloem confessed that the memorandum saved the lenders, saved the euro and not Greece. The Georgiou case has concerned the Greek criminal courts, before which he was found guilty. Greek justice is independent and the European Parliament has no power to med.

His crime was not that he published statistical data without consulting his colleagues on the Elstat Board – his real crime was that Andreas Georgiou did his job, and that includes the fact that uncomfortable truths must be told.

No, instead it is the person who has worked to ensure that the rules are respected and that there is no trickery.

It is not possible for such things to be done in Greece. Incidentally, I am astonished at this form of waste of resources. And I am also surprised that the Greek judiciary, which has such a pact on cases, suddenly takes this case so seriously that it takes it three times and rejects it again.

It is an attempt to set an example in order to send clear signals to other officials: do not report anything to Brussels until we have ticked it. The chance of manipulation must be preserved.

For the Commission, it is essential that the independence of the statistical authorities, and of the people who perform their duties in line with their responsibilities, is protected. The Commission will therefore continue to monitor the application of fundamental statistical principles in all Member States, and I thank the House for its support on this. The situation of Mr Georgiou is of concern to you as well as to the Commission. Let me repeat, once again, that we have full confidence in the reliability and the accuracy of data produced by the Hellenic Statistical Authority (ELSTAT) under his leadership. Concerning the comments made by Mr Chountis, I refer to the reply to question No 4404 from this year. In short, we stand by the correction made by Mr Georgiou in 2010. As I said before, we have also repeatedly voiced that concern via public statements or directly in contacts with the Greek authorities. Furthermore, a Commission official appeared as a witness before a Greek court and offered testimony in support of the implementation of EU law by the Greek statistical authority under Mr Georgiou’s leadership. I am glad that some of you recognised that the independence of ELSTAT has been strengthened. Greek statistics law has been brought into line with EU law, notably Regulation 223 on European statistics, as well as the European Statistics Code of Practice, to ensure professional independence. These make it clear that the content and timing of statistical release is the sole responsibility of the heads of the statistical offices. I also have to tell you that all governments have expressed their support for the European Statistics Code of Practice. On the basis of the code, Member States subject themselves to regular peer views and the results of the peer reviews are published and combined with action plans for improvements where necessary. The Commission fully recognises and respects the independence of the judicial authorities in Greece. They should be allowed to perform their tasks without political considerations or pressure. In that respect, representatives of governments and public authorities at both national and EU levels have a duty to refrain from anticipating the outcome of judicial investigations or proceedings.

The treaty on intermediate-range nuclear forces in Europe, in force since 1988, is among the key international agreements which marked the end of the Cold War. While neither the European Union nor any of the EU Member States are parties to the treaty, we do have a very high stake in its preservation and continued implementation. Thanks to the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, some 3000 missiles with nuclear and conventional warheads have been removed and verifiably destroyed. For those who have the experience and memory of the Cold War, this was a truly historical moment. The tools for waging nuclear war were not only removed from our continent but irreversibly dismantled and destroyed. This happened under the mutual supervision, in the form of one-side inspections. So we are justified in declaring that the INF Treaty has not only contributed to the end of the Cold War, but it also constitutes one of the major pillars of European current security architecture. Calling it a Cold War-era agreement or a relic of the Cold War is a misinterpretation and a misunderstanding. The INF Treaty is always an important contribution to disarmament obligations under Article 6 of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. All EU Member States, whether or not they have nuclear weapons, both NATO members and non-NATO countries, all are state parties to the non-proliferation treaty. We are united in our support for the non-proliferation treaty as the cornerstone of the global nuclear non-proliferation regime. The treaty has made a crucial contribution to international peace, security and stability over the past 50 years. Let me recall that all states party to the non-proliferation treaty are committed to pursuing the objective of achieving a world without nuclear weapons. We, as the European Union, stressed the need for concrete progress towards the full implementation of Article 6 of the non-proliferation treaty especially through an overall reduction in the global stockpile of nuclear weapons. The states that possess the largest nuclear arsenals – which are the Russian Federation and the United States –have a special responsibility on this. The INF Treaty does not only cover nuclear-armed missiles. It is about an entire category of ballistic and cruise missiles, regardless of their warheads. In recent years, the development, test or use of ballistic missiles has been a destabilising factor in regional and international security. It creates an atmosphere of mistrust and suspicion and adds uncertainty in international relations – I am thinking, in particular, of the launches by North Korea, Iran and Syria. The INF Treaty is also a model to be followed and, as such, it is today more relevant than ever before. The current disarmament and non-proliferation architecture needs to become more universal as a guarantee for all. We Europeans are working at all levels to promote the universalisation of existing agreements, such as The Hague Code of Conduct against ballistic missile proliferation. The Hague Code does not prohibit the possession of missiles but aims to prevent proliferation and increases transparency for the benefit of subscribers. Subscribing states exchange information including pre-launch notifications. As of now, 139 countries have subscribed to The Hague Code. This is no small achievement as subscribers include the US and Russia, as well as all EU Member States. The EU has a long history of supporting the universalisation and effective implementation of The Hague Code, both diplomatically and financially, both the immediate contact point in the Austrian MFA and the rotating chairmanships benefit from EU-funded support programme. It is not by chance that very often it is EU Member States which hold the annual rotating chairmanships of The Hague Code, promoting its universalisation and chairing relevant meetings. Last year it was Poland, this year: Sweden. But let me stress that politically binding confidence-building measures like The Hague Code are not a substitute for legally binding arms control and disarmament agreements like the INF Treaty. It is for this reason that, in our view, the United States and the Russian Federation needs to remain engaged in constructive dialogue to preserve to INF Treaty and ensure its full and verifiable implementation, which is crucial for European and global security. We have asked the United States to consider the consequences of its possible withdrawal from the INF on its own security, and on our collective security and we expect the Russian Federation to address the serious concerns regarding its compliance with the INF Treaty. The world doesn’t need a new arms race. That would benefit no one. On the contrary, it would only bring even more instability.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 313, "date": "2018-11-14.json", "name": "Jeppe KOFOD", "mepid": "124870", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group. – Mr President, I would like to thank the Minister for her clear statement. There is no doubt that what we have seen now is a real blow to the disarmament of nuclear weapons in the world. We all understand that Russia is not complying with the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty and there is real concern, but it’s the wrong reaction from the US President to withdraw from such an important treaty. With the new START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) expiring in 2021, we could, in the worst case, be left out of control of nuclear states with their nuclear arsenal and we could go back to a situation which I think we have to go back to 1972 to see. This is really detrimental.  We should – as the European Union, as Europeans – ask Trump to reconsider. We need to fight hard for disarmament and the control of nuclear weapons.

Anything can happen. For the most part, what he does is very worrying. Not least, it is worrying that on 20 October this year he terminated the agreement between the UNITED States and the Soviet Union to abolish medium- and short-range missiles. The question then is how we in the EU and the Member States should approach what comes as a letter in the mail. Firstly, we Greens want Mrs Mogherini, the Presidency and the Member States to do all they can to keep the agreement in force. Secondly, we believe that it is clear that a new initiative is needed with a view to achieving total nuclear disarmament in Europe, and that a regional nuclear-free zone is needed, as the UN calls for in its Resolution 3472 B of 1975. However, as long as there is no new agreement in place, it is crucial that we stick to the various disarmament agreements that already exist. With American nuclear weapons in Europe and Russian nuclear weapons next to our borders, and as both the British and the French continue to invest in their nuclear arsenals, there is little prospect of an EU decision to join the new UN Convention on The Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. Thirdly, we should therefore accede to the Convention. Nuclear weapons in Europe do not give us security. On the contrary, it is not difficult to imagine that Europe could once again risk becoming the great battlefield and that nuclear-armed medium-range missiles can detonate on European soil if something goes wrong. That is why we can and should lead the way in disarmament, but it is also crucial that other countries, including Russia, the UNITED States and China, support all disarmament agreements, including bilateral ones.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sv", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 316, "date": "2018-11-14.json", "name": "Helmut SCHOLZ", "mepid": "96646", "text": "  Mr President, I would like to like to sanendour sto -- on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

I was already politically active in 1980. At that time, there were only Soviet missiles aimed at Europe – exclusively. These were the SS-20. On the other hand, there was the NATO double decision, which led to the Soviet Union being forced to make the deal with Gorbachev in 1987, that both sides would abolish their weapons, that we would not continue to set up and that the SS-20 would disappear. That is the INF Treaty. However, we have known for some years now that Russia is once again erasing these modern-day missiles – missiles, medium-range weapons that do not reach the United States or anyone else, but which are almost exclusively aimed at Europe. In other words, we have a situation like 1980, where we have directed Russian medium-range missiles with nuclear weapons at Europe, but that there are no counter-weapons on the part of Europe and in Europe. In other words, we arrived at 1980 and the Russians destroyed the INF Treaty. I don't think it's so wrong that this is now becoming apparent – and I'm not often a Trump fan . I believe that Russia is called upon to put an end to this, to remove these missiles, so that the content of the INF Treaty is fulfilled. The American missiles in Romania are not surface-to-surface missiles that threaten Russia. These are surface-to-air missiles to shoot down missiles aimed at Europe, and the deployment of missiles in Romania was intended to deter Iranian missiles. I believe that we should invite the Russians to carry out an inspection of the installations in Romania in order to remove any uncertainties that this would be aimed at firing Russian missiles aimed at Europe – not even that is what we want! – and that is why the deal must be done to ensure that the Russians finally remove their missiles aimed at Europe.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 320, "date": "2018-11-14.json", "name": "Ana GOMES", "mepid": "28306", "text": "   – Mr President, by disconnecting Russia from this treaty, Mr Trump may indeed be playing putin's dangerous game, because the treaty has effectively reduced the risks of military escalation, operational miscalculations and helped to change the MAD logic of the Cold War to that of dialogue between Russia and the United States.

Trump essentially accuses the Russians of not complying with the agreement because of two battalions of New Tor cruise missiles, with a range of 1,500 kilometers, based on Russia's western borders. Moscow denies this, but Obama had already threatened to pull out of the treaty as early as 2014 because of tests on R500 missiles, also complaining about the deployment of Iskander ballistic missiles in the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad. However, the two Moscow installations are the answer to the start of the construction of the anti-missile shield that the US has deployed in Poland and the Czech Republic, equipped with radar and state-of-the-art missiles, officially to intercept any ballistic missiles launched by Iran. The decision to abandon the INF treaty announced by Trump seems to conceal even different motives. For Washington, denouncing the treaty means, above all, pressing for new negotiations with Moscow, but it must also be extended to Beijing, a true emerging strategic power. Denunciation of the treaty would trigger a new nuclear and ballistic rearmament race similar to that desired by Reagan, forcing Russia and China to do the same to undermine their economies, forcing them to invest more in defense than they could and would like.  Then there are not strictly military aspects that Trump seems to want to pursue. The White House appears to be pushing for an escalation of tension with Russia to unite an ever-further distant Europe, relaunching the protection offered by the American missile atomic umbrella.

The United States of America has expressed its reservations about Russia's violations of the INF Treaty 30 times since the Obama era. Russia's reaction: the construction of Russian cruise missiles, which are strictly prohibited in this INF Treaty. The planned meeting between Trump and Putin has not taken place since then.

We are now recognising that more and more political decisions are being taken against international law, political decisions against European law, political decisions against building trust.

They clearly show us that we must take it seriously, with European action, with international dialogue, with multilateralism, so that we can overcome national selfishness and expansionist policies.

I think it has highlighted the importance of the preservation of the Intermediate—Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty for European and global security, as well as our common preoccupation with the increased threats to our security. Disarmament, arms control and non—proliferation treaties and agreements like the Treaty on the Non—Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and INF constitute our first line of defence. Dismantling such multilateral security arrangements and institutions is in nobody’s interest.  Because I was asked very explicitly, I would also like to answer the question as to whether I believe we can rescue the INF. Yes, of course, I do believe that. We mustn’t give up on that, and must put all our efforts into the rescue of the INF. I also believe that debates like the one today in the European Parliament remind people, including decision makers in Moscow and Washington, of the value of the INF Treaty for European and global security and the stake that we in Europe have in this treaty’s future.  By the way, the INF is only one contribution to Article 6 of the NPT, so a lot more has to be done in the future.  Allegations that the Russian Federation has begun producing and developing new missiles which could be aimed at EU countries, and which are not in compliance with Russia’s treaty obligations, deserve to be treated seriously and need to be resolved. This should happen through a responsible dialogue, including at the highest level. The stakes are simply too high.

However, after years of mutual accusations between Washington and Moscow, the scrapping by the former of the INF Treaty seems to be an increasingly real risk with unpredictable and dangerous consequences. Firstly, the possible abandonment of the Treaty by the US administration would further undermine relations between the US and Russia, increasing the cold war climate not only between these two powers but also with China. The latter, not being bound by the INF Treaty, was able to develop an arsenal of missiles otherwise not allowed and continued to do good and bad weather in the Chinese Seas. Finally, the unilateral American withdrawal from the INF would jeopardise the entire non-proliferation regime.

Every country in the world has every right to protect its borders and every country in the world has the obligation to do so in full respect of human rights and the principle of non—refoulement, as well as the norms on international protection. This applies to Europe and its Member States as it applies to everyone else, including the United States. But beyond looking at the consequences, let me take this opportunity also to also look at the symptoms. Every day, hundreds of people from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador begin the journey to the United States. Today migrants are more visible as part of caravans walking in broad daylight, accompanied by NGOs and TV crews. They are all fleeing poverty and hunger, but fear seems to be the main driver of these migrations.  The Northern Triangle countries are among the poorest in Latin America with one third, or even half, of the population living on less than EUR 5 a day. Half of the unemployed are young people so it is hardly surprising that many of them decide to leave their country and look for a better future. Natural disasters have also been a strong driver for migration from the region. Today they are aggravated by the dire effects of climate change, in particular droughts and floods. All these factors combine and today the migrants are also fleeing death, violence and extortion. Between 2010 and 2017, over 100 000 homicides were recorded in the Northern Triangle. It is probably no coincidence that the first of these recent caravans started in San Pedro Sula, which is one of the most violent cities in the world. The European Union has been supporting countries in the region in a twofold approach, providing immediate relief and tackling the root causes. In terms of humanitarian assistance, the Commission is implementing a program of EUR 2.5 million to address the needs of people affected by violence in the Northern Triangle. Concerning the caravan, the Commission is currently looking into possibilities to respond to humanitarian needs, in particular regarding the protection of vulnerable children and women against trafficking.  In Honduras we are investing about EUR 200 million in decent employment and food security, as well as strengthening the rule of law and access to justice. In Guatemala support amounting to over EUR 150 million is focused on food security, competitiveness security, security and human rights. In El Salvador we are investing about EUR 150 million. We support the national strategy to fight violence with a focus on prevention, including support to community organisations on the return of young people to the education system and on the construction of safe public spaces. The EU also funds social programmes such as ‘Ciudad Mujer’ an innovative approach to provide women with psychological and legal support and training for entrepreneurship. Efforts to address security challenges at national level go hand in hand with reinforced regional cooperation against transnational crime and drug trafficking. Regional cooperation is equally important for the development of the region, including the creation of economic opportunities. The Association Agreement between the EU and Central America opens our markets to Central American businesses. Once fully ratified, the political and cooperation dimensions of the Agreement will further reinforce our partnership. The EU is – and will remain – a reliable partner to the countries in the region in addressing the migration challenges, combining response to immediate needs with action on the root causes. Migration is a global challenge that requires global solutions and global responsibility sharing. Through international cooperation with our partners, we can turn migration from a common challenge into a shared opportunity for human development. I know that the Parliament has always supported this approach so I thank you for this debate and look forward to hearing your views.

Entire families walk in caravans, with their eyes set on the United States. According to Save the Children, one in four members of this caravan are children and adolescents. The lack of opportunities, extreme violence and endemic poverty in the northern triangle of Central America have led these families to leave their homeland and embark on this journey that, although arduous, offers more security than solitary migration and avoids paying thousands of dollars to smugglers. Many of these victims of economic misery and social exclusion also face persecution, hard-working recruitment and kidnapping by groups linked to organized crime, from the local Maras to transnational drug traffickers, a pattern that unfortunately now reproduces in Nicaragua too. These people are not criminals, as you can't get enough of repeating President Trump. They are, yes, victims of criminal organizations, who with violence and impunity pretend to govern them, and seek only to live in safety and find a job that will allow them to support their families, as they did in the 19th and 20th centuries, thousands of Europeans who went to the United States to flee violence, discrimination and hunger. President Trump, who in the 22 months of his presidency has demonized immigration, has promised to stop those now trying to reach his country on the pretext of protecting American citizens from criminals and an imminent invasion and announcing the deployment of troops to the southern United States and militarizing the border. The chances of them being granted asylum are therefore slim and many run the risk of being detained and separated from their families pending court hearings that could end with a deportation order. This migrant march and the one that formed from the city of Tapachula in southern Mexico last April show evidence that the hardening of asylum policies and mass deportations undertaken by the United States and Mexico in recent years have failed and their goal of deterring these flows and the announced cuts in economic aid to these countries will do nothing more than exacerbate the social chaos from which they are fleeing these people. The European Union must therefore continue to support regional integration efforts in Central America and to make the opportunity, within the framework of the Association Agreement with Central America, to strengthen political dialogue with the countries of the northern triangle with regard to respect for human rights, strengthening the rule of law and the fight against drug trafficking and impunity. The Union cannot fail to support the regional expansion of the UN anti-impunity commission and to urge transit and destination countries to respect their international human rights obligations on all cross-border crossings.

And it forces us to replace for facts the many words we usually hear about solidarity, fraternity, humanity, refuge or asylum. The first, in our case, is that those who consider that this Parliament's voting system has not adequately collected their votes correct the data in the relevant register. It will not serve to change the meaning of the vote, but it will at least bear witness to the true will of the house and legitimize that we can bring that matter here in the future. Self-criticism, assuming the mistake and correcting it without compromising the legal certainty of all our votes. And it's essential to do. People who leave their places of origin usually flee poverty, insecurity and violence. In the case of Central American caravans, the problems that lead to the exodus are clear. They are the fruit of inequality and an interventionist policy that has sometimes driven the country to which these people are addressed. A dynamic that has marked the sign of governments and economic and political systems. The problems of governance and democracy and their impact in terms of inequality and social justice are the breeding ground that makes some of the cities from which these caravans came today, as you said, Commissioner, the most violent in America. In the face of these problems there are those who buy the fake news and those who sell simple and Manichean schemes, which offer too many people the peace of mind of knowing among the good ones and that allow to justify any atrocity against others, who easily end up being the bad guys. For the president of the United States to play this game so crudely, to the point that the most conservative television networks reject their ads about these caravans as racist, is an indicator of how far populism has come. I hope you'll teach us. Moreover, this fallacy, this rude simplification can ward off some uncertainty to which it buys such a broken commodity, but offers no solution.

It’s not just in the European Union, but it’s also in the United States. We share a common challenge when it comes to dealing with the millions of people who are trying to illegally cross borders. In recent weeks, the United States has seen a migrant caravan consisting of thousands of people travelling from Central America to the US border. We’re witnessing an organised mass migration of economic migrants on a scale that has never been seen before and this, quite simply, is economic migration. Both here and in the EU and over there in the US there are legitimate and legal routes for seeking genuine asylum, but these migrant caravans should not lead to permanent residence in the US. It has been said in this debate that they are not criminals. But if you enter a country illegally, you are breaking laws and you are therefore a criminal. I think President Trump is right to send thousands of US troops to the border to stop the illegal entry of the migrants and to protect their national security.  Let’s just point out that the migrants are now in Mexico. Why are they not staying in Mexico? There are 129 million people who live in Mexico quite happily. Are we saying that everybody in Mexico should be leaving Mexico to go to America as well because it’s unsafe there, or are we saying that the migrants should stay in Mexico now that they are there?  While some argue that the numbers of migrants in the caravan are small, they set a precedent and encourage others to make this dangerous journey to the US. Since 2017, multiple caravans have headed to the border, and each time they are getting bigger and bigger. On our own soil we have seen the effects of mass migration, especially the terrible death toll of migrants crossing turbulent seas in boats completely unfit for that purpose. International law is being broken and EU treaties are just being ignored. A government’s main duty is the protection and the security of its citizens. This includes securing your nation’s border – it’s just common sense.

On 2 November, the High Representative issued a statement together with the Foreign and Finance Ministers of Germany, France and the United Kingdom, expressing deep regret at this development. The sanctions re-imposed on 5 November cover a wide array of sectors and, together with the designation of some 700 individuals and entities, impact large parts of the Iranian economy. As such, they are a serious challenge to the continued implementation of the plan of action.  The re-imposition of US sanctions may also bring substantial collateral effects, in particular it could weigh on the region’s trade flows and energy supplies, connectivity and ultimately the security and stability of states such as Iraq and Afghanistan.  Let me begin this debate with a few general comments. First, we continue to support the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action as its provisions continue to ensure that Iran does not acquire material or equipment to develop a nuclear weapon. The deal with Iran is working and delivering on its goal, namely ensuring that Iran’s nuclear programme remains exclusively peaceful. This is an assessment based on scientific facts provided through a uniquely high number of inspections and 13 reports by the International Atomic Energy Agency. Moreover, there is no credible peaceful alternative to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. The deal with Iran is a key element of the global nuclear non-proliferation architecture. It is crucial for the security of Europe, the region and the entire world. Dismantling the agreement would not only destroy years of diplomatic efforts but also undermine other key multilateral negotiations in the nuclear field and beyond.  It is a matter of security and it is a matter of credibility for the international community. For these reasons, the EU and its Member States are determined to preserve it. We remain committed to the continued implementation of the nuclear deal in all its aspects and in particular we are at work to preserve the economic dividends arising from sanctions lifting. Let me remind everyone that we are talking about economic benefits for the people of Iran which constitute an essential part of the deal. As we remain committed to our side of the deal we also expect Iran to continue implementing in full all its nuclear commitments under the plan of action. The European Union has already taken a number of measures. First, we have updated our blocking statute to ensure that business decisions are not determined by the listed US extra-territorial legislation, which the Union does not recognise as applicable to EU operators. The Commission has significantly engaged with economic operators and Member States on the implementation of the statute.  Second, we have extended the European Investment Bank’s lending mandate. This allows the bank to lend in Iran in the future in line with relevant rules and procedures.  Thirdly, the European Commission is elaborating a range of tools to strengthen the activities of small and medium sized enterprises between the EU and Iran. We are working on technical exchanges to enhance trade, harmonisation of standards and due diligence and compliance efforts.  I am aware of the high level of interest regarding the design and state of play of the special-purpose vehicle. We Europeans cannot accept that a foreign power, not even our closest friend and ally, takes decisions over our legitimate trade with another country. The ongoing work, led by France, Germany and the United Kingdom, aims at preserving the full and effective implementation of the plan of action in all its aspects and in line with UN Security Council Resolution 2231. Protecting legitimate trade is also a basic element of our own sovereignty and it is only natural that we are working in this direction. This is a hugely complex and unique undertaking requiring the best expertise available. Technical work has been advancing over the last days and weeks under the political leadership of Member States and supported by the EEAS and the Commission. Our goal is to build something that is workable, effective and viable. The special-purpose vehicle is not directed against the United States. On the contrary, preserving the nuclear deal is essential to our common security both for Europe, for the United States and for our friends in the Middle East. The special-purpose vehicle is not circumventing sanctions. It is about working in full transparency, ensuring due diligence for the most rigorous standards on anti-money laundering and on countering the financing of terrorism in full respect of UN Security Council resolutions and the primacy of the EU law. I am aware that many of you have concerns regarding Iran’s foreign policy and respect for human rights. So does the European Commission, but the Plan of Action was never meant to solve all of our disagreements with Iran. We continue to voice our disagreements on Iran’s security role in the region and its ballistic missile programme and we have engaged in a frank and active dialogue with Iran on these issues. We maintain a range of EU autonomous restrictive measures. These include an arms embargo and measures against arms trade, against human rights violations, on Iran’s support for the Assad regime in Syria and for terrorism.  Some of these issues are addressed through our EU-Iran high-level dialogue. The EU has also led a dialogue together with France, Germany, Italy and the UK to engage Iran constructively on regional issues. The last meeting of this group was convened in Brussels on 12 September and discussed the situation in Syria and Yemen, and we hope to meet again before the end of the year.  This is also very much about our own security and regional security, but none of these issues is linked to the Plan of Action and they would not be easier to deal with without it. Preserving the nuclear deal with Iran is an essential security interest for Europe, for our region and for the whole world. So we will keep working to preserve a nuclear non-proliferation agreement that is working well, and to prevent a major security crisis in the Middle East.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, my conviction is that the European Union cannot properly answer the question of the extraterritorial effects that US sanctions against Iran can have on European companies, if we do not put this issue in the broader political context of our political relations with Iran. The situation we find ourselves in today, which obliges us to defend the economic interests of European companies, is, in my view, also the consequence of an insufficient political response. We supported the need to continue the implementation of the nuclear agreement with Iran as long as iran complied with its obligations, long before the U.S. withdrawal. The delegation of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, of which I was a member, who visited Tehran in February, carried this message. The reality is that before the decision of the United States on May 8 to withdraw from the agreement, we had some leeway to seriously discuss with the U.S. government its concerns about the nuclear agreement and to find a solution that would have saved us from today's discussion. My first conclusion is that it is not too late. We should have a serious discussion with the United States. Cooperation with them remains vital to respond to Iran. The challenges we face together are many: curbing Iran's nuclear ambitions, improving the dire human rights situation in that country, and addressing issues of Iran's harmful role in the conflict in Syria, threats to the State of Israel, the Iranian regime's support for terrorism and plans to attack European soil. All these subjects have become almost taboo, including in our Parliament, where any attempt to discuss human rights in Iran is systematically blocked by our socialist friends. To defend the interests of European companies, the answer cannot be found in purely economic action, whether it is the establishment of a special entity or the assistance given to Iran to respond to the consequences of US sanctions. Above all, it must be in a coherent political action which, I stress on this point, does not isolate the various aspects of our relations with Iran and does not exclude the building of bridges with the Trump administration on this subject, but again our friends on the left do not displease them.

The Iran nuclear deal was one of the most intensively prepared multilateral treaties of recent times. For years, various parties have been intensively discussing Iran's withdrawal from its nuclear program. This not only eliminated a constantly smouldering threat of war, but also laid the ground for peaceful development. The resulting removal of economic sanctions should end the isolation of Iran's economy, generate economic win-win, and lay the foundation for domestic prosperity. The hope was that this could also create a new stability zone in a region that has been uneasy for decades. This would be particularly essential for Europe. The European Union also plays an essential role in the conclusion of the Treaty, and it is in the interests of the Union and its Member States that the process does not stall. The Iranian side has so far taken all its commitments seriously. All international controls have so far confirmed this – twelve times in a row. Why the process is not really progressing, and more and more companies are reluctant to engage economically, is mainly due to the fact that the US, under Trump's influence, has abandoned multilateralism. US unilateralism is a major challenge, not just on the Iran issue. That is why we must stand by our agreements, without ifs and buts.

Of course, High Representatives Ashton and Mogherini stuck out their necks for diplomacy, and that was the right thing to do, but preserving that legacy cannot be a goal in and of itself because it also had a shadow side. I think human rights and the violations that we see every day in Iran, as well as Iran’s troubling role in the Middle East, were overlooked, and rebalancing our European approach towards Iran is very important and should not be hindered by needing to defend the JCPOA. Attempts to maintain policy independence and to give European companies maximum choice to do business are the right steps to take; they are positive. The EU lifted sanctions as it’s part of the deal, while Iran commits to verification of nuclear enrichment. But to push or even punish European companies for choosing to drop business with Iran under threat of US repercussions is taking it too far. Additionally, the whole impression that the EU and Iran are in one sort of camp and that the United States is in another camp is deplorable.

The US believes that the deal is a bad one, one which is not built upon long—term stability. Whether or not this is the case, we are now in the de facto situation where the Iran deal no longer exists. Iran is considering abandoning the terms set out in the deal, as it sees no economic benefit from adhering to them – a very worrying development.  Clearly, a solution needs to be found to the problem, either by saving the existing agreement or producing something new. The EU must forget about posturing power politics and allow the USA to get on with its own foreign policy. After all, you do not have your own EU army yet to enforce your ideas. The Iranian President has even suggested that the country now faces a war situation, and air defence drills have been taking place. This is obviously extremely concerning. It not only impacts trade and business, but of course on the humanitarian level as well.  In 1998, the US and the EU had similar issues with sanctions, this time involving Cuba. An agreement was struck and the sanctions were lifted. Again the EU must work alongside the US to solve this Iran problem. The United States are not the enemy, and they must not be treated as such. It would be wise to remember the many great sacrifices the American people made during the 20th century in order to promote freedom and peace in Europe.

The Blocking Statute is a first step, but there must be countermeasures by the European Union vis-à-vis the United States in order to stop this extraterritorial intervention by the United States.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ECR", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 382, "date": "2018-11-14.json", "name": "Georgios EPITIDEIOS", "mepid": "125071", "text": "   Madam President, the reintroduction of The United States of America's sanctions against Iran affects important and crucial sectors of Iran's economy, such as oil exports, the automotive industry, air transport and, above all, also affects the trade of European companies with those of Iran. In this sense, the European Union welcomes European companies trading with Iranian companies to ignore these United States sanctions. However, I cannot imagine a way in which the European Union can guarantee the protection of the interests of these companies. There must be cooperation with the United States and an agreement with Iran to convince the United States that the European Union's contacts and support for Iran are not directed against the interests of the United States.
