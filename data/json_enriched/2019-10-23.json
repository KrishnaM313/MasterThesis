We acknowledge the contribution made by several international actors to ensure that this is the case. We have seen high—level diplomatic efforts aimed at de—escalating tensions, firstly a few days ago by the United States’ Vice President Pence and Secretary of State Pompeo, who negotiated a temporary truce with Turkey. We also know note the memorandum signed only yesterday between President Putin and President Erdoğan in Sochi.  The High Representative was in the Parliament with you on the first day of the offensive and she immediately made clear our request that Turkey immediately stop the attack. Turkey’s concerns must be addressed diplomatically, not through military action that can only further destabilise the region and bring more suffering to the Syrian population. We are also relieved that humanitarian agencies have not had to suspend their response – at least not entirely – and that those displaced from their homes for fear of the fighting have begun to return. Yet there can be no excuse for the nearly 200 civilian deaths that have occurred, nor for the bombing of hospitals, ambulances and water stations. We care about the fate of Syrian Kurds and indeed for all the civilians in the zone of hostilities. The only way to address their aspirations and recognise the sacrifice made by the Syrian Democratic Forces in the fight against Daesh is to help build a democratic and inclusive Syria – a country that all its citizens can home. There can be no military solution to the Syrian conflict. It is crucial that instead we support the political process and that a lasting solution is found for all parties involved. Thus, we have a duty to support the work of the Constitutional Committee due to meet for the first time at the end of the month in Geneva. Despite recent events – or rather, all the more so because of them – the time is right for that Committee to meet. We have full confidence in the United Nations Special Envoy, Geir Pedersen, and we believe that a step—by—step political solution can be found. Launching the Constitutional Committee can set a positive cycle of trust and confidence and eventually bring about the changes necessary for a peaceful and stable future for Syria.  We all know that the path towards a negotiated political transition will not be easy. Yet we must agree with our international partners – and yes, Russia and Turkey too – that changes must be made to the way Syria is governed. We must agree that justice and accountability must be brought for the crimes committed by all sides during the course of that conflict right up to Idlib and the most recent offensive. This is for the sake of the peace, stability and reconciliation that we all crave for Syria. Let me turn now to Turkey and its responsibility for the current situation. Turkey’s security concerns at its border with Syria will not be answered by military intervention. This offensive instead undermines the fight against Daesh and threatens our common security. Turkey has made tremendous efforts in hosting several million refugees for many years – there’s no doubt about that – yet Turkey’s military action is only making an already highly complex situation in the region even more difficult to resolve. It only adds to an already complex and dramatic situation. This is why the EU leaders and EU Foreign Ministers have condemned Turkey’s incursion and this is also why Member States have decided to halt arms exports licensing to Turkey. They insist that the incursion must not just be stopped temporarily, but it must cease altogether. The Foreign Affairs Council has also made clear that we will not provide stabilisation or development assistance in areas where the rights of local populations are ignored or violated.  The European Union has been clear and united on all this from the very first day of the incursion. We are glad that the Council, the Commission and Parliament have passed the very same messages and we thank the European Parliament for its continued support to ending the war and supporting a political solution under the auspices of the United Nations.

The crisis that unfolded on 9 October has led to civilian casualties, displacement of people, destruction of civilian infrastructure. Heavy fighting took place, including in highly populated areas. There are reports of nearly 200 civilian deaths. At the height of the hostilities, nearly 200 000 people have been displaced. Some have now started going home, but the remaining over 150 000 displaced people come in addition to over 200 000 people that were already in camps and informal sites or hosting arrangements before the crisis. Humanitarian staff were denied safe and unimpeded access to people in need due to shelling and airstrikes, or uncertainty regarding territorial control. International NGOs and UN agencies had to evacuate staff to Iraq. Let me underline what the EU Presidency just said: there can be no excuse for these civilian deaths, damage to civilian infrastructure, absence of protection of people and those who are there to help them. I am particularly concerned about the horrific situations faced by healthcare providers. Hospitals in Tell Abiad and Ras Al Ein are out of service due to heavy bombing and shelling, Kobane hospital was temporarily out of service because the electricity line and the generators were cut by mortars and because of shelling; ambulances have been reportedly targeted, preventing the evacuation of patients from the front lines; medical staff have been killed and even kidnapped. To make matters worse, the emergency is affecting the provision of basic services to a population that was already suffering before the crisis.  While the international staff were evacuated, this does not mean that the humanitarian community is no longer assisting the people in need. Life-saving assistance continues to be delivered. We are supporting our humanitarian partners in north-east Syria with EUR 38 million and we will continue to support them for as long as it is needed. But the fighting must stop. And it remains paramount that International Humanitarian Law is fully respected and that civilians are protected. Humanitarian workers must be allowed access to those in need. All precautions must be taken to mitigate the risk of harming aid workers, their facilities and assets, including convoys, and the people they serve. Humanitarian workers should not be any sort of target. Let me also take this opportunity to recall the EU’s line with regard to the return of refugees to Syria. All returns should be safe, voluntary and dignified, and only once the conditions are in place – otherwise the EU will not be in a position to provide support. The same applies to the so-called buffer zone that Turkey is seeking to establish in the north of Syria with a view to eventually sending refugees back. And let me also recall the recent EU28 Statement that any attempt at demographic change would be unacceptable. At the same time, the European Union will not provide stabilisation or development assistance in areas where the rights of local populations are ignored. The European Commission has recognised and supported the efforts of Turkey to host millions of refugees in its territory. But Turkey’s military action in north-east Syria has aggravated an already dramatic situation on the ground. I am glad that the European Institutions have been united in their reaction against Turkey’s military action. But there should be no time for complacency. The brokered ceasefire was only partially respected. We must use all our power; all our leverage to stop hostilities, to put an end to this humanitarian tragedy and to allow our assistance to fully resume, and of course reach in parallel a political solution under the UN.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 1, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 3, "date": "2019-10-23.json", "name": "Michael GAHLER", "mepid": "2341", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Mr President, I would like to thank the There is a broad consensus in this House: we condemn Turkey's incursion into northern Syria, which is contrary to international law, and we are consequently calling for these troops to be withdrew from Syrian territory. We are not naive, we know what was agreed yesterday in Sochi. It is all the more regrettable that this behaviour was made possible only by a unilateral withdrawal of troops by the United States. Turkish behaviour, moreover, further distances the country from the European Union politically. That is why we also recalled in our resolution that this Parliament called for the formal suspension of the accession negotiations as early as March.  We call on the Council to consider appropriate, targeted economic measures that do not affect civil society, which does not reduce the possibility, for example, of Turkish people continuing to participate in the Erasmus+ programme and study with us. For example, we have an agreement on agricultural products. One could think about whether something should be done there. Or we have also mentioned that the final step could be to suspend the customs union. The people of this northern Syrian region do not want to see Turks, Russians or the Assad regime there.

The establishment of a so-called safe zone has de facto become the establishment of a war zone and the Turkish invasion of north-east Syria. The winners are Putin, Assad, Turkey, Iran and Isis, and the losers are the citizens of north-east Syria and the credibility of the West. A total of 218 civilians and 600 SDF fighters have been killed. More than 300 000 civilians had to leave their homes and are now displaced, struggling to find safety. They are caught between advancing Turkish troops and Syrian forces moving in from the south, and hundreds of IS fighters, including EU citizens, have escaped guarded camps. The summary execution of Kurdish politician Hevrin Khalaf, one of the many courageous women in north-east Syria, is an absolute outrage. The latest reports refer also to the alleged use of white phosphorus against civilians by Turkish-backed forces in Ras al-Ayn. The perpetrators of these heinous acts must be prosecuted, and while the US President hails the cease-fire as great news that will save millions of lives, I can only reject, on behalf of this House, its very basic premise. Yesterday’s Russia-Turkey deal legitimises the Turkish presence of a 10-kilometre zone along the Syrian border, the refoulement of two million refugees and the displacement of the local population. All of these are grave violations of the most basic principles of international law, refugee law and humanitarian law.

But so far, the EU’s response has not been strong enough. We cannot just stand by and see how others interfere, for example, Russia, Assad, Iran. It’s also our safety that is at stake. For Renew Europe, the road does not end here. Tomorrow, the European Parliament has the unique opportunity to speak with one clear voice, one voice to make perfectly clear to Turkey that we do not accept this, and to call upon the EU to take a strong stance now.  I ask my colleagues in this House to support me in urging the High Representative to set up an immediate dialogue with the Turkish authorities, to reach a sustainable solution, and to hold Erdoğan to his promise of keeping ISIS prisoners in detention. However, we must be prepared for firmer action. Arms, economic and targeted sanctions are also on the table. Let us combine our strength and show unity and bring an end to the violence now.

The situation in Syria is again a humanitarian tragedy which should not continue another day. The withdrawal of the US troops has left the Syrian and Kurdish people with no other option than to wait for the solution Erdoğan and Putin will come up with. Although the EU should use its power to de-escalate the conflict and stop the violence, it seems to be invisible on the world stage and therefore today the Greens call upon the EU to take up its role as a proactive actor to force Erdoğan to withdraw his troops and refrain from deporting Syrian refugees back to Syria, by placing targeted sanctions and visa bans on Turkish government officials, imposing a full arms embargo and by working on suspension of the trade agreements. At the same time we should proactively protect the Syrian refugees by stepping up their resettlement and take our fair share in their protection. We cannot wait any longer with action and we therefore urge the support for the proposed resolution. Mr President, ISIS terrorists escape displacement camps posing a risk to the Syrian people and leaving us with no control over the persecution. The Greens therefore urge the EU Member States to repatriate their nationals and their family members to prosecute them at home and take care of their children. It’s our duty to reduce the security risk and also to prevent children from being the victims. And as we all know one of the goals of Erdoğan’s invasion is to deport Syrian refugees to their country. However, even a so—called safe zone cannot protect them against violence and persecution, as deportation would violate the Refugee Convention the EU must refrain from returning Syrian refugees to Turkey as long as this risk of deportation exists. But deportation would also mean a demographic change of the population in north-east Syria, which is also a crime against humanity. As the Kurds, who fought on our side, will probably lose their autonomy the EU should at least make all efforts to ensure that their rights are upheld. So high time to be pro-active.

This phrase from the White House is simply disgusting and shows the spirit of child speaking here. People died, some are on the run again. The invasion of the Turkish army is to be condemned without any ifs and buts, no country can invade another country. The Erdogan government is concerned with domestic and geopolitical motives, and the so-called security zone is not about security, but about reshaping Syria. The fact is, however, that all the world powers, all of them, including the EU, have watched for their own economic and geostrategic interests, how international law has been broken and war crimes have been committed. Not even a real arms embargo has been adopted here. All the world knows that Mr Erdogan cannot continue his war if the international community speaks a clear language and exerts consistent economic and political pressure on Erdogan. And that is what we are calling for: a genuine arms embargo, no more economic business with the ACP, recognition of the self-governing structures in Rojava.  What is needed is a political, peaceful solution for the region, for Syria, and not for a military one – I stress: no military solution! Rojava is an example of this.

We are mutually needed and therefore dialogue and cooperation on migration and security must be maintained. It is in our interest that Turkey remain on the European track, democratise itself, honour its commitments, including respecting the terms of the Customs Union, and countries that are at the European-Turkish border must receive European solidarity to preserve and ensure the security of the Union's external borders – Cyprus, Greece and Bulgaria.

The conclusion that we should draw from this – and here I come back to key EPP demands – is that we in the EU must finally create the decision-making structures – for example, a European Security Council and an EU Defence Council – and provide the appropriate military capabilities, so that the initiatives of individual Member States, such as that of the German Defence Minister, to establish an international protection zone can be immediately treated and evaluated at European level and also lead to joint European action.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank the honourable Members for their interventions, comments and suggestions. Turkey’s unilateral military action in north-east Syria has, and is, causing unacceptable human suffering. It undermines the fight against Daesh, it threatens European security. For all these reasons, the European Council on Friday again urged Turkey to end its military action to withdraw its forces and respect international humanitarian law. As you know, the matter has been referred to the European Council, which will continue to follow it. Meanwhile, the European Union remains engaged in efforts to address the serious humanitarian and refugee crisis in light of evolving needs. We insist that any and all parties on the ground grant full, unimpeded and safe access to humanitarian workers responding to people in need of urgent life-saving assistance. The protection of civilians must remain an absolute priority. Now regarding the so-called Sochi agreement last night, the de-escalation of hostilities in north-east Syria will hopefully save lives, and prevent further civilian suffering. As such, we welcome it as an attempt to achieve an end to the current cycle of violence. We can expect it to take some time before the consequences of the agreement reached in Sochi play out. However, one thing has not changed: what is needed to end the Syrian conflict on a permanent basis is an overarching political settlement for the whole of Syria negotiated by the Syrians for the Syrians, in line with UN Security Council Resolution 2254. All parties must come to the table in Geneva at the end of this month and from there build a lasting solution. Allow me to express my appreciation for your continuing commitment to seeing a peaceful resolution to the long-running Syria conflict.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 112, "date": "2019-10-23.json", "name": "Mairead McGUINNESS", "mepid": "28115", "text": "  Thank you, Minister Tuppurainen, and also my thanks to Commissioner Stylianides, who has been with us for the debate and listening closely to it.

I hope that the climate emergency is also felt by the Commission representatives, who I hope will join us as soon as possible. The sea level continues to rise at an increasing rate. Extreme sea level events that usually happen once per century are projected to occur at least once per year until 2050 and in many different locations. Wildfire is projected to increase significantly for the rest of the century. These are not my statements. These are just a few of the stark conclusions that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change of the United Nations presented in its latest report this September. The phrases ‘climate change’, ‘climate crisis’ and ‘climate emergency’ have been echoing through our streets and cities, and in this Parliament too. We’ve had enough of empty rhetoric from those who say that they believe that climate change has to be addressed as a matter of urgency, but then duck out when push comes to shove, when the real binding measures that can make a difference are negotiated. Citizens who are paying the high price of wildfires, droughts, floods and storms want leaders that are capable of addressing the real cause leading to this extreme weather. That is why the Socialists and Democrats have called for this debate. We are calling for a new approach on how to address the climate emergency we are facing, because a climate emergency it is. However, stating that this is an emergency is not enough because, if your house is on fire, you do not just press the alarm button and sit around waiting. You make sure that the fire brigade is coming and that the fire is extinguished. That’s why we want to start working now on a long-term economic, social and environmental plan with ambitious legislative proposals backed by sufficient financial investments and proper enforcement. To act on climate we need the money to finance the required transition as early as next year. It has to be both private and public money at the Member State level and at the EU level too. Achieving carbon neutrality requires a revolutionary transformation that has the potential to create new jobs, ensure our industrial competitiveness, enhance resilience, and improve air quality and human health. The Socialists and Democrats are calling for an ambitious plan for deep de-carbonisation, shifting subsidies from fossil fuels to support clean technologies, ensuring clean energy production, safeguarding our biodiversity, developing a new sustainable agricultural model that can also avoid food shortages, having in place afforestation and reforestation plans, preserving water resources and investing in new technologies that address water scarcity, renovating our building stock and ensuring the new energy-efficient building stock, and, importantly, having in place a strong just transition fund that ensures economic, environmental and social progress, leaving no one behind. We are calling for ocean-based climate action, which could deliver up to 21% of the emission reductions needed by 2015, further investments into developing ocean based renewable energy, de-carbonising marine transport through energy efficiency and alternative fuels, and restoring and protecting marine ecosystems and ocean-based food sources. Awareness is increasing, our young people are speaking, and we have a choice to make. Either we say that we have a crisis and do nothing concrete about it or we use this challenge to come out stronger, better and empowered. We, as Socialists and Democrats, choose the latter.

Climate change is a direct and existential threat that spares no country. The world is already witnessing multiple devastating impacts of climate change. Stepping up global action is therefore more urgent than ever in light of the latest scientific data, especially the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. Scientific evidence shows that human-induced global warming has already reached 1°C above pre—industrial levels and is rising at 0.2°C per decade. Without stepping up international climate action, the global average temperature increase could reach 2°C soon after 2060 and continue to rise afterwards. In addition, climate change is increasingly contributing to the deterioration of global biodiversity, water resources and ecosystems. The Arctic is warming at more than twice the global average rate, which is already having serious global, regional and local consequences. However, according to United Nations reports, the nationally determined contribution submitted by parties to the Paris Agreement collectively falls far short of what is required to achieve the long-term goals of the Agreement. Although insufficient progress has been made until now, I see growing momentum for more ambitious action. It is a positive sign that there is increasing knowledge, awareness and concern about climate change and its effects on the world at large. It is particularly encouraging to see that civil society and citizens, especially the youth, are calling for more ambitious action. While human-induced climate change is caused by the way in which our societies have produced and consumed goods during the industrial age up to the present day, the engagement of the young people of today is vital if we want to implement those changes that will ensure that the planet will be fit to live in for future generations. The Climate Action Summit last month was another welcome initiative to mobilise and boost the political will to step up collective efforts in line with the Paris Agreement. It is that shared awareness and collective will to effect change among governments, businesses and society as a whole that is needed in order to bring about the kind of paradigm shift and transformations of economies and societies that are needed to avert catastrophic climate change. The European Union is determined to help raise global ambition and lead the way. It continues to successfully decouple its economic growth from its emissions. From 1990 to 2017 the EU’s economy grew by 58%, while total greenhouse gas emissions decreased by 22%. The EU is set to overachieve its target for greenhouse gas reductions by 2020. It also has a complete package of legislation in place to ensure that it will reach its target for 2030 and thus also deliver its contribution to the Paris Agreement. However, we know that the policies that the EU has in place today will not be enough when we consider the scale of reductions needed in order to reach the long-term temperature goals of the Agreement. Therefore, rapid and far—reaching economic and societal transformation will be required in the coming decades. To this end, as is required of all parties, the EU will submit a long-term strategy for greenhouse gas emissions reductions with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change by 2020. With a view to preparing the European Union’s long-term strategy, the Council has been discussing since November last year how to achieve climate neutrality in line with the Paris Agreement, based on the Commission’s strategic long—term vision – a Clean Planet for all.  The scale of the economic and societal transformations needed in order to achieve climate neutrality in the EU will require efforts from all sectors of the economy. This is why it is so important that this debate is as broad, inclusive and extensive as possible across the EU and its Member States. The transition will affect everyone and it must be carefully managed to ensure that it’s just and socially balanced for all citizens. We need to take into account the specificities of Member States and different regions, ensuring that no one is left behind. On the other hand, the transition also offers great opportunities and potential for economic growth, new jobs and technological development to realise that potential investment into research and innovation needs to be scaled up, while ensuring that our industry is protected from competitive pressures in the global context.  Most Member States agree with the objective of climate neutrality in the EU by 2050 and several Member States have already set national targets contributing to that goal. We are continuing to work towards an agreement that all Member States can sign up to and look forward to the European Council finalising its guidance on the EU’s climate neutral vision before the end of 2019.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Minister, who represents you in the Presidency of the Council, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteurfor her part in the work of the Council. I would like to represent my colleague, Mr Caete, who is absolutely prevented from having a debate with you. The new Parliament, as well as the new Commission, which is about to be launched, have made sustainability, climate protection and environmental protection a priority, and rightly so. This extends to large parts of the House. This can be based on the work of the parliamentarians of the last Parliament and also of the Juncker Commission. We are not at the beginning of the Europeanisation of sustainability and climate protection policy and the development of common rules, standards and funding instruments for this. On the global stage, we can say that Europe has demonstrated ambitions – even before Paris, but also after Paris – and that we are serious about meeting the targets of staying well below 2°C of global warming and achieving 1.5°C global warming if possible, as well as many others on the world stage, but not everyone in the global debate. It also makes sense to approach the whole thing at European level. That is why we consider national special routes to be only the second best solution. In a European internal market, a Union, the Europeanisation of sustainability and climate protection makes perfect sense. For this, we have a proven instrument, the ETS – the Emissions Trading System – in which we can regularly reflect on and re-decide on volume reduction, but which, without red tape and in terms of market economy, can be used to develop around 50% of our emissions in a targeted manner towards 2020, 2030 and climate neutrality in 2050. The ETS works for the energy industry and for industry. It does not include mobility – transport, transport – but does not include buildings – housing, heat and electricity in buildings – and agriculture. I think it could be exciting for a new Commission and for the new Parliament to discuss whether the ETS can not be extended to transport and transport emissions, transport and even buildings and heat, heating, cooling and electricity consumption in a market economy. There are initial approaches to this in some Member States, but again: in the internal market, European solutions make sense. What are the possible instruments that a Commission will propose to you, in which my colleague Frans Timmermans is in charge within the Commission of the Leyen? That is why I am a little reticent today. He is responsible for the Green Deal, which will be presented to you, the Council and the public within 100 days of the new Commission taking office, on which consultations and assessments are still to be carried out. But what is clear is that, firstly, we are relying on technology. We rely on modern technologies that accelerate energy efficiency, bind emissions and thus make an important contribution. Horizon Europe is a crucial programme for this. Secondly, we are counting on the fact that there can continue to be an update of the ETS and, if necessary, a withdrawal of quantities and thus an increase in the price per tonne. Parliament is at the heart of all discussions here. My recommendation is to tackle this again. Thirdly, we have a 40% reduction target, and with the measures that have been decided in the old Parliament – in the Clean Energy package, in the mobility package – we can, according to our calculations, achieve a reduction target of 40% or even 45% in 2030. Now the debate is about 50 percent or even more. I believe that impact assessments are a priority here and that we must then decide whether to supplement, update or even revise the packages of the last two years. It is then a question of trade agreements. Since Europe is responsible for only about 9% of all global greenhouse gases and their emissions, a trade agreement with other partners and a common emission reduction make a lot of sense. Europe has never been more in demand than it is today, where we can secure investment protection with Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Vietnam, Mexico, Mercosur via export and import, and then sustainability and climate protection can also be important objects for us and for our contractors in a trade agreement. It will have to be examined whether, if necessary, co2 prices are imposed by means of levies or taxes on imports into the European Union, also in order to avoid carbon leakage and fair competition. Mrs von der Leyen mentioned this in this House as worthy of scrutiny. It is necessary to examine whether it is compatible with the WTO, how it is possible under competition law, and we must be prepared, if necessary, to settle trade disputes and trade wars. if this is seen as an unfriendly act by Washington, D.C. or others. We need to weigh up whether costs and benefits are also politically balanced. The new budgetary framework currently being moderated by the presiding authorities, where we are slowly on the right to finish, provides that 25% of all investment, all expenditure, must be devoted to climate protection. That amounts to EUR 40 billion allocated to programmes, out of EUR 160 billion a year – 40% for one programme, 60% for the second programme, and 0% for some programmes, because they are not linked to environmental and climate protection. Within the budgetary framework, there may be a fund for a fair transition. The idea is relatively new. There are 41 coal regions in the European Union in 12 Member States, and accelerating structural change in these regions – Poland alone has 19 – is an honourable goal. The earlier decommissioning of coal to heat, from coal to electricity, but always linked to the aim that this would not create an absolute disadvantage for jobs, workers, social justice in structural change. The Commission is currently preparing to consider how to configure a fund for a fair transition, how it needs to be endowed and what conditions are necessary for the call for funds. Every input from this House over the next few weeks is highly appreciated. InvestEU: Europe's structural banks will certainly be part of the instruments in the Green Deal. How can public funds – European, national, regional – and how can private funds be activated in the best possible and efficient way? In short, your debate is a prelude. The Green Deal, the Commission's proposal from the Leyen and Timmermans, will provide a concrete basis for your deliberations. I am sure that this will allow the course of the old Commission, the last Parliament, to continue and perhaps to maintain direction, but to speed up.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 2, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 157, "date": "2019-10-23.json", "name": "Esther de LANGE", "mepid": "38398", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Madam President, it’s clear that tackling climate change is one of the biggest challenges of our time, and quite rightly so; as has already been mentioned, it’s one of the key priorities of the new Commission. As a Christian Democrat, I believe that we don’t own this planet. We’re guarding it and we’re keeping it for the next generations to come, and therefore we have a moral duty to look after it. In this debate I’m quite sure we will see those who, in a matter of speaking, will show their middle finger to the next generation, telling them that climate change doesn’t exist and refusing to take measures. We will also see those who will be telling you precisely what you can do, must do, or shouldn’t do: that you should insulate your house, that you should buy a Tesla, even though you’re just struggling to make ends meet by the end of the month. Therefore, the EPP Group believes that there should be a third way: a way that tackles climate change but that takes people along; that doesn’t put the burden on the shoulders of those who can least afford it; and that leaves no region behind. And then it’s too simple to only talk about a just transition fund. In the view of the EPP, we shouldn’t only have a Green Deal or only have a European climate law, but also a strong industrial strategy to make sure that we have the cleanest, the most innovative industry that actually keeps jobs for those generations in the future who will need it. If we’re talking about sustainability in three regards – sustainability that, yes, indeed is environmental and tackles climate change, but that is also social and economical – we need to have a strong industry to make sure that we can also deliver on climate change.

Madam President, I would like to begin by thanking Theresa May for The situation is serious, but the UN International Panel on Climate Change is also clear that it is still possible to reverse the trend and to complete the Paris Agreement. But that requires us to act now. The EU plays a key role here. As a Social Democrat, it is obvious to me that Europe should show the way to the climate-smart society.  We have consistently pushed for sharper changes and emission reductions in the EU's climate and energy policy framework. These are renewable energy, energy efficiency, emissions trading and emissions from transport. These are welcome steps along the way, but at the same time it is clear to everyone that emissions must be reduced even more and even faster than they are currently doing, and of course in line with the Paris Agreement. Political leadership is needed. We Social Democrats take that leadership, for us it goes without saying that we have to switch to a socially, ecologically and economically sustainable society and we are convinced that we can do this together and that we can do both: both reduce emissions and increase growth in the economy. That's how we also create new jobs. That will change in the labour market. Here we also have a responsibility to ensure that the support is developed, further training is available and skills development takes place.  A \"branch deal\" is of great importance. We see that, and we see that it is possible to achieve our goals.

We know that we have very little time to control warming and if we want to stop it we have to act with very strong and unprecedented measures as we have done so far. European citizens , 93% – think it is a serious problem. But it is young people, our children, who consider it an urgent problem, which is a real crisis—a climate crisis—and that is why they go out into the streets every Friday to demand that we act. On a limited planet we consume too many resources and have too much waste. In some productive sectors we waste 98% of what we produce. How we will not be able to rationalize and make a production and consumption system much more reasonable, with a circular economy system that shifts the paradigm from recycling to prevention, with bioeconomy, that knows that everything we use, all our natural resources must be preserved and protected in any production system, designing different cities , greens, where 70% of citizens live and working on decarbonization, in a zero carbon in our economy...

That’s very crucial because, to be very honest, Mr Oettinger, if I hear you talk, I don’t really get an urgent feeling about the crisis that we are in the middle of, and that’s exactly the problem. The Commission is talking about putting in place targets that we already decided five years ago. But science has advanced. If you read all the scientific reports that are coming out on a daily basis, it shows the urgency that we are facing. This is about our future, but this is also about opportunities as a European continent to really change our economy in a way that delivers on climate neutrality but also creates new jobs. All the reports are out there and still the Council is struggling to agree on climate neutrality. Maybe now in December – it took more than a year – and then we have next year, the last year before Paris starts. Are we going in with the same targets that we agreed five years ago? That’s not the urgency that our citizens are asking for. There is more that needs to be done and that urgency needs to become clearer, not only from a debate here, it needs to come from action from the Council, from the Commission, but also from this House because it is lovely to hear all the debates that we are having in this plenary but when we are talking policies, this House is also not delivering. At this moment we are discussing agricultural reform. The agriculture sector is an important sector that can deliver on climate action, but I’m challenging my colleagues then to deliver, not only in speeches here but also in making sure that the agriculture reform is going to be a truly green reform and not again just subsidising the bigger farms. And the last point on trades: let’s also make sure our trade agreements are in line with climate, so stop with these voluntary sustainability chapters but make them binding so that we are also really pushing this agenda internationally with the urgency that this matter deserves.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "Verts/ALE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Greens and regionalists"}, {"id": 161, "date": "2019-10-23.json", "name": "Silvia SARDONE", "mepid": "197578", "text": "  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Socialists have proposed and ensured that the main theme of this plenary session is the climate and ecological emergency.

In order to deal with this urgency, I would like to put a further issue on the plate, that of soil, because climate change and the fight against climate change cannot be separated from soil protection. It takes 2000 years to create 10 centimeters of fertile soil, which can be wiped out by a storm like what happened a few days ago, in my region in Lombardy or Liguria. The European Commission estimates that Europe loses 9 million tonnes of land per year, the equivalent of 275 football fields, every day. In Italy alone, one third of agricultural land suffers from severe erosion, costing the country EUR 619 million per year. And Italy therefore loses 24 % of land, but it is not only an Italian problem, France and Spain are also in the same condition.  I know that the Commission has announced a strategy on biodiversity and I hope that this strategy will focus on the issue of soil protection, which contains as much as a quarter of biodiversity. I therefore call on the Commission to set a neutrality target for land degradation by 2030, because without adequate soil protection we will not be able to combat climate change and to do so we need a holistic policy, which combats intensive farming, monoculture and unbridled and unregulated construction.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "NI", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Non-Inscrits"}, {"id": 165, "date": "2019-10-23.json", "name": "Pernille WEISS", "mepid": "197515", "text": "   Madam President!

We are debating today a climate emergency, and that is exactly what it is all about. We see how scientists in report after report, scientific study after study, show that we need far more leadership from the EU and the rest of the world if we are to manage the climate change that is required. It's easy to feel hopelessness. It's easy to feel impotence. But, as we know, 'night is the mother of the day' and from what we see today, we can create a future that gives Europe more jobs, more innovation and more prosperity. We can show the leadership that the world needs to see. However, achieving this requires concrete action and the EU has a special responsibility. The economic opportunities will only be there if we lead with economic transformation and innovation and create the green jobs needed to gain a competitive advantage to Europe and take the leadership.  For us Social Democrats, it is clear. We have the opportunity here. But then we also need to be much more ambitious. That is why we are calling for the EU to come up with a more ambitious target by 2030 and to reduce emissions by at least 55%, not today's 40. It is also a question of ending the subsidies that we are seeing today, which will continue to flourish in the fossil industries. They counteract the necessary climate change. Equally important is that everyone contributes in this transition. It is appalling that we have sectors flying under the radar or sailing under it.

The cost of tackling climate change globally can be halved if we eat less meat, if we consume less dairy and if we leave fish and eat some more vegetable. That doesn't have to take years. We can start every second! Europe can stimulate this by stopping subsidies for the promotion of meat and dairy products.

The same alarmism was present at the 1988 Toronto summit, which compared climate change to nuclear war. It predicted temperatures would rise between 1.5 and 4.5°C by 2030. We are now over two thirds of the way through that period and we’ve seen a rise of only 0.25°C. In the 1970s, scientists told us we were entering into a new mini-Ice Age and they came up with the genius idea of dumping ash from power stations on the polar ice caps. Clearly their temperature models were wrong then, and they’re wrong now. There is, frankly, more credibility with the theories such as sunspots, the Milankovitch cycle and orbital variations than there is with anthropogenic warming, but by far the biggest impact of climate policies is on energy costs, living standards and the economy. Simply put: decarbonisation is deindustrialisation. It amounts to unilateral disarmament. These policies replace the enormous tax revenues generated from fossil fuels, with taxpayer subsidies for rent-seeking renewable companies that generate no tax receipts to fund public services.

The neighbouring county, Louth, have a very strong Dunleer Sustainable Energy group and they work at ground level and help vulnerable communities refurbish their homes with support from government. So don’t be despondent. The real world is taking action.  But we need to do much more. I want to talk in particular about how we’re going about this. There’s a lot of finger pointing about what you’re not doing and what you need to do and I think we need less of that. We are dividing sectors and we are fragmenting within sectors, particularly on agriculture. I want to say very clearly that farmers know that they need to take action, but if you push them into a corner and blame as being the problem, they cannot be part of the solution. So we need to be very careful about our language.  Farmers themselves are in dire straits. They’re protesting, they’re fragmenting and they really are directionless, so we need to give them direction. We have smart farming and we have conservation agriculture. I do agree that we need a more environmental Common Agricultural Policy, but we need to give strong signals and reward people who do deliver. More importantly, the food supply chain is broken. Competition law has resulted in the following statistics, and I’ll give them to you: 70% of global agricultural industry controlled by three companies, 90% of the grain trade by four companies, and the five largest food retailers in 13 Member States have a combined turnover of 60% of the marketplace.

Temperature surveys show that an unprecedented upward trend has increased over the last fifty years. Every European citizen now has almost direct experience of extraordinary and often catastrophic weather events.  On the other hand, the demographic pressure on the planet increases, we were about 2 billion in '27, now we are 7 billion with projections in thirty years that show that in 2050 we will reach 10 billion. So if we want to preserve the planet and the quality of life of future generations, we need a paradigm shift in our development model. Today, action to combat climate change means putting policies in place in all areas, without exception. Firstly, we must protect what we still have, defending the environment and biodiversity. But I am also thinking of the challenge of cleaner energy and more sustainable agriculture, the great issue of mobility, with less polluting means of transport and more efficient and integrated infrastructures, making the most of the new models of shared mobility. No less important is vocational training in order to create the new skills that innovations in production processes and consumption patterns require. Let us think about the circular economy and the possibility of employing new workers in the processing from waste to new raw materials. Because that is how we protect a subject dear to us today, work, adapting it to the new professions.  However, if we do not want to make fun of ourselves, wash our consciences with good intentions and then continue as if nothing had happened, we need adequate resources and far-sighted decisions. The commitments made by President Ursula von der Leyen simply need to be financed from a multiannual EU budget that is more ambitious and adapted to the climate challenge.  I will end by paraphrasing the Nobel Prize in Physics Michel Mayor, who recently, in front of those who asked him about possible plans B of new habitable planets, replied: \"let us think rather about taking care of our planet which is still beautiful and above all livable\".

EUR 1 trillion pledged over ten years, which must be invested in the ecological transition, with a central role, of course, for the European Investment Bank.  So it is obvious, of course, but at a time when the ambitions for the next financial framework 2021-2027 are shrinking, we like to remind you of this obviousness. The climate emergency also means acting on the impact of pollution on our health. Air pollution is greatly exacerbated by climate change. It kills more than tobacco in Europe. It is responsible for 660,000 deaths a year.  In Europe, a healthy air is a right of European citizens.

Unfortunately, throughout the debate, it is often forgotten that agriculture and forestry are the only sector with the great potential to bind carbon.

A Green New Deal is a social project that, through a massive investment plan in the thermal renovation of buildings in low-tech, not in high-tech, in plant infrastructure, in renewables, can allow us both to save ourselves from climate change, to create 10 million jobs, to eradicate environmental poverty and to finally create a European industrial policy.

Madam President, honourable Members, representatives of the Presidency, Commissioner Oettinger, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his excellent work and for the work she has done. I am very pleased to be here with you today, together with my esteemed colleague Lazaros Lazarou, the rapporteur for the annual report of the European Court of Auditors, in order to launch this year's discharge procedure of the European Court of Auditors with the annual report for the financial year 2018.  What am I talking about this afternoon? My aim is to present to you the current state of financial management of the European Union. In our annual report, and in particular with our statement of assurance, we assess whether the money you, as a Parliament, approved for the budget last year, has been used lawfully, properly and, of course, economically. We have audited the consolidated accounts of the European Union for the financial year 2018. In our opinion, it presents the financial position of the European Union as a whole in a proper way and does not have any material misrepresentation – in other words, we have delivered an unqualified opinion.  Secondly, we have not found a significant error rate for the revenue that has flowed into the EU budget. Thirdly, we have estimated the error rate in expenditure at 2.6%. This means that, in our opinion, 2.6% of payments should not have been made at the expense of the European budget because they were not made in accordance with current EU legislation. However, this overall estimate obscures an important distinction: the disbursement mode of European funds has a major impact on the risk of errors. In the case of expenditure that is subject to complex rules and which account for around half of the EU budget, i.e. primarily the so-called 'refund-based payments', where beneficiaries have to submit applications for reimbursement of the eligible costs incurred – for example, research projects, employment-related projects, regional and rural development projects and development projects in third countries – the error rate is estimated at 4.5%.  On the other hand, the risk of error is lower in the case of so-called 'claim-based payments', which are subject to simpler rules and where beneficiaries receive a payment if they simply meet certain conditions – think, for example, direct aid to farmers, administrative expenditure, student grants or EU budgetary assistance to third countries. In other words, around 50% of the Court's population we have examined does not have a significant error rate. For this reason, for the third year in a row, we issued a limited opinion on expenditure, that is, a 'yes, but'. We see it as an encouraging sign that the European Commission and the Member States have been able to maintain the progress made in the previous two years. Our auditors were able to note positives in the areas associated with low risk. At the same time, there remain worrying problems in the high-risk areas, which need to be addressed further. As part of its own multiannual strategy, the Court of Auditors is gradually moving towards basing its Statement of Assurance on a test-based audit. This means that, in future, we want to provide audit certainty on the Commission's management statement, which in turn is based on our own reviews and, in the case of shared management, also on the reviews carried out at national level. We are therefore increasingly working with the Commission to create the necessary conditions for progress towards the test-oriented audit, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank Commissioner Oettinger and his staff for their support, and I look forward to further developing this cooperation with his successor. I am convinced that paths are created by taking them, that is, by taking concrete – perhaps initially modest – steps to achieve this reasonably aspirational objective of taking advantage of work already done by others, thereby also saving double the burden of examination. Honorable Members! A deeper insight into our conclusions and recommendations on the individual MFF headings can be found in the respective chapters of our annual report, which is available in all eu official languages. Two weeks ago, in the Committee on Budgetary Control, I had the opportunity to draw a detailed attention to the individual chapters. to enter. Since many of you were present, I will not go into detail here. Dear ladies and gentlemen, Members of Parliament! However, I would like to make one point very clear once again: we are at a crossroads – a new parliamentary term, a Member State in the process of leaving the European Union and the other 27 Member States in the final stage of the negotiations on the multiannual financial framework for the period 2021-2027. Our audit work, which I have been able to present to you today, shows that, despite many problems that still exist, the European Union is consistently upholding high standards of accountability and transparency in the use of public funds for the third year in a row. We expect the future Commission and, of course, the Member States to continue and build on these efforts. And, of course, we are counting on you all to work with us to ensure that this will be the case.

Madam President, Mr Lehne, Mr Lazarou, ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work and for the work she has done. I would like to begin by thanking you, Mr Lehne, and you, Mr Lazarou, and the whole office, the whole Court for a valuable piece of work and for a fair cooperation that I have seen together with my team over the last three years. I do believe that together we have also made progress and have the opportunity to make further progress – we, operationally the Commission, in the control of the Committee on Budgetary Control, Parliament, the Council and, with technical support, the European Court of Auditors. We strive for high standards of transparency, we have a full duty of accountability, and it is about the money of our European citizens and taxpayers. I believe that the outgoing Juncker Commission leaves European finances in a very good state. Firstly, for the twelfth year in a row, the Court has judged the accounts to be flawless. Secondly, the error rate has fallen significantly in recent years. In 2018, it was around 2.6%, and just five years ago we had to register 4.7% as a margin of error. Thirdly, for the third time in a row, the European Court of Auditors has come to the conclusion that the sustained improvement in the financial management of the European budget has made it possible not to make a negative but a qualified judgment on the regularity of expenditure possible. Last but not least, we have jointly improved the reporting on the performance of the programmes and thus the significance of the european budget. The European budget plays an important role for millions of citizens, farmers, researchers, entrepreneurs, start-ups, start-ups and students. Three quarters of our expenditure is managed jointly with the Member States, and since we do not have a substructure, we need this cooperation and the proper assessment of European law by Member State authorities. These play a crucial role in areas such as cohesion policy and agricultural policy, where around 70% of the budget is still carried out today, for which we are grateful to and dependent on the national and regional tax authorities. The Commission has strict rules for good and effective management of funds. Even if the funds are spent far from Brussels or Strasbourg, we have a clear governance structure with clear responsibilities for all those involved. We also know that the impact of errors that occur – the error rate – is ultimately less, because we can ask the Member States and/or the recipients to repay amounts that have been wrongly received – which is also largely happening. That's why we always present two figures: the risk of errors at the time of payment and the risk after corrections have been made. For the taxpayer, the latest figure is the decisive one, which, according to our estimates, is only 0.8% last year. For what counts for the citizen is what has been misused in the end after all efforts and has not been reclaimed. Together, we have identified some problems with the management of cohesion programmes in some Member States over the past year. And so it can be said that here and only here in 2018 more mistakes were made than in the previous year. We will pursue this – together with Member States through our deliberations, by improving our regulatory framework, by simplifying, simplifying the next budgetary framework and by taking further action. However, it can be seen that in the sample carried out by the Court concerning the transactions, the majority of errors have now been detected and financial corrections have been made. I agree with the Court that complex rules contribute to errors, which is why we have simplified the rules, but we have also carried out training and communication measures to facilitate access to European funds for recipients. The proposals for the post-2020 budget framework provide for further simplifications, and I would ask the legislator, the House, to stick to this simplification of our rules in the coming weeks, particularly with regard to the implementing rules for the budgetary framework, and not to go too far up the complexity again. We will continue to work with our partners to address the root causes of identified errors. I come to the subject of performance: we have achieved a great deal in this regard in recent years. The performance framework for the European budget has been set up by the OECD, which has an excellent Overview of global budget management , ranked as the best of its kind. We have improved and simplified our reporting. We publish detailed information on the results of each European budget programme. We have made considerable efforts to ensure that the budget is not only properly spent, but that it also finances projects that concern EU-wide tasks and that make a difference for a large number of people. The Commission remains committed to optimising its performance reporting in line with its respective policy priorities. European added value plays a central role in the Commission's proposal for the next budgetary framework. Goals are formulated even more clearly, and performance is brought even more into focus. Our aim remains to provide you, as decision-makers and our citizens, with the best possible information on the results achieved with the European budget. Once again, I would like to thank President Lehne, Mr Lazarou and the whole team in the Court, but also thanks to Parliament and the Committees for Budgetary Control. I would also like to mention the former chairwoman, Mrs Gräßle. Otherwise, I would like to say to you that I find the work that is being done there very significant and relevant. Thank you very much for that. We look forward to further budgetary discharge.

A thank you to Commissioner Oettinger for not only taking up many, many suggestions, but also helping to implement them in a very concrete and active way. I believe that it is noted that the overall trend, as President Lehne says, is positive. We have several questions which will give us suggestions for the new MFF, which we have to take into account.  Firstly, if we find that refund-based payments have a much higher error rate, then this is simply due to the so-called gold plating, which makes things even more complicated in the Member States than is absolutely necessary, sets even more criteria, makes it even more complex. I would urge the Commission to discuss simplification with the Member States in the MFF, because if the so-called ineligible costs are a significant part of the problem, it is often because the complexity is too great and the Member States are unfortunately very often pushing it to the level of Brussels, even though it was not the Commission. , which invented these regulations.  Secondly, we know that we have Member States which also have problems and difficulties with the national authorities. It's not just about naming and shaming, because that doesn't help in the end.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would really like to thank the President of the Court of Auditors, both for the presentation of his annual report, but also for the work done by all his services.  As I had the opportunity to say in committee, this presentation begins our discharge process. So we are at the beginning of our work and, in terms of budget efficiency, our mission, as we know, is not simple. We need to find a balance between a budget that is both ambitious and realistic. The European Union must not make promises that it cannot keep. While the Court's report is generally positive, I still note a number of points on which we need to pay particular attention. Moreover, these are problems that are not new: the review of the repayment rules, because they generate significant errors; The error rate in high-risk spending Low absorption rates in some countries; we just talked about it, over-regulation and the need for administrative simplification; the accuracy of the amount of own resources collected, particularly at the customs level, or the error rate in the European Development Funds. The Court also states that all European bodies must work to harmonize audit procedures and all audit practices. We therefore hope that initiatives will be taken, both by the Court and by the Commission, to align the procedures, the audit methods in order to simply guarantee the reliability of the data.  At the other end of the day, the impact and effectiveness of policies must be strengthened through effective budgetary controls and audits.

We are looking at the spending figures for the 2018 financial year. However, we need to make sure that our budget is sustainable.  The payment backlog not only shows what we did in 2018, but it is also a good indication of what to expect in the future. The outstanding commitments have constantly been growing in the past years and in 2018 we reached a record high number with EUR 281 billion. The projections show that it will grow even further in the coming years. The high number is not just a number in our accounting system. This bears a political significance. We need to make sure that the payment appropriations will be available to cover all amounts due in the first years of the new MFF. Otherwise, it will endanger the new MFF programmes. The difference between Member States is enormous. The risk, especially in the eastern and central Member States, suggests that there might be a structural problem as well.

In 2018, EU spending totalled almost EUR 157 billion. This amount represents 1% of the Union's gross national income and corresponds to approximately 2% of the total public expenditure of the Member States of the Union. It is essential that the spending of these funds is not only in line with the rules, because it is clear, but at the same time delivers the intended results. For expenditure for the financial year 2018, the Court delivers a qualified opinion, as the estimated level of errors in budget expenditure was 2.6%. This, of course, falls within this range of estimated error levels over the past two years. Only a year earlier this error rate was 2.4%. My question is: is this level just starting to rise when it's 0.2% higher, or is it a cosmetic, statistical issue, and it's not a problem? Maybe it will be a problem in the future.

The annual report is indeed a document of great importance to the European Parliament, as it facilitates our work and provides many elements for assessing aspects of EU spending and identifying the problems to be solved.  The 2018 Annual Report noted some improvements compared to previous years: firstly, the fact that, in general, the estimated level of error for payments made is constantly decreasing, 2.6 %. This is a step in the right direction.  However, the Commission must continue to make efforts to increase transparency in the use of public funds and at the same time step up cooperation for the Court of Auditors. There are a number of critical points, for heading 3, which concerns security and citizenship, and for heading 4, which concerns Europe's global role. The error rate has not yet been detected.

I didn’t expect that, but it’s nice to see. A lot has been said about the numbers, statistics and percentages in it, and rightly so. But I would like to talk about what stays behind the numbers and namely people, companies and their projects. It’s good that you’re searching for error rates. This is your job. You are the taxpayers’ best friend. But along with searching for errors in our project, we should consider what the quality of this project is. Did it reach the goal that it was designed for? Did it reach it in the correct way? So along with looking at how funds were spent, we should also look at how goals were reached.  And we have to consider that one of the reasons that in the fifth year of this programing period we absorbed only 30% is because of bureaucracy. So we need a risk-based control.

The estimated level of error in their expenditure was 2.6 percent in 2018, with a significant increase in the level of member states' payment requests for the European Structural and Investment Funds.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. Simplification – yes, that is true: we must do everything possible to ensure that, for a support programme, a budget programme, the rules on how to apply for funds, how to carry out projects and then document and settle them are as simple as possible, because the cost is a cost within the European administration, with Member States and their authorities, with citizens, with universities, with companies, with NGOs. What is clear, on the other hand, is that some requirements for application forms, bureaucracy and billing have to do with the fact that corruption, fraud, infidelity and mistakes can be partly avoided. If you make it easy, abuse is easier. A second request: we can demonstrate that in recent years and decades, complexity has arisen mostly in the Council, but also in Parliament – even more rules, even more expectations of documentation. That is why, with the post-2020 budget framework, there is now a chance that we will bring simplification to the fore, as many speakers have requested, and that everyone will withdraw to the Council and Parliament when it comes to more complex derogations, documentation rules and more.  In my political years, I have seen budget implementation and accounting control at regional, local and national level. I can really assure you that the quality of documentation and accounting, the avoidance of errors, the recovery of funds is at least as good at European level as at all levels in the Member State from which I come and where I am well versed at town hall level, district office level, state government level and national level. We have no reason here to talk our work worse than it is compared to the work of others. Making mistakes is human. It is important that you do not make a mistake twice, that you uncover and correct a mistake, and that for others – best practice – you learn from mistakes and advise others so that the mistake that has been made here does not find itself permanently or repeat itself.  We must then see and, as the Commission, try to ensure that the error rate – the issue of 2.6%, 2.4% a year ago – remains at this low level or even falls even further, but an increase of 0.2% is more about randomness than a trend that will start with it.  I see a number of speeches, but the speakers are no longer. Let me tell you frankly, perhaps this is my last opportunity: I have always experienced it painfully and I do not know from any other Parliament that the Commission or the Court of Auditors is being critically addressed, that questions are being asked, and those who ask the questions: angry, they are out! I don't know where, maybe with beer, wine or coffee? Perhaps also in the study room, but it is actually a requirement of collegiality and courtesy that in a democratic debate you should also hear what you want to hear directly in the room where the question was asked. I am not saying this so much to this cluster of polemics at the back right, but I say it to Mr Lega: very critical, comprehensible and no longer there. I would have liked to have told him, so I do not give the answer. Mr Pieper, we are happy to look at the issue of full transparency and then the presentation of where mistakes are the main focus. With our transparency, we fully comply with the rules of the Financial Regulation, which you have adopted. No more and no less.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has had on the work of the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work First of all, I would like to thank Mrs Hohlmeier as the new chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control. In any case, we look forward to working with you and your committee in the new parliamentary term. I think you raised the central point; this has also been mentioned repeatedly in the debate by other Members of the European Parliament: the more complex the rules, the higher the likelihood of errors. That is actually, in very few sentences, the basis of the whole problem. And now I say something to yours, but also to my address, because I have been sitting on the other side for 22 years: of course, this is often the fault of the legislator. Legislators tend to make more and more detailed regulations for a simple reason: because they do not trust the administration. So he's trying to sort out individual cases, to sort out more and more details. This applies to all parts of the legislator, and the consequence is that, in the end, the rules become so complicated that mistakes happen. Perhaps – that is the realisation, if you have sat on the other side of the problem for a few years and see what the administrative problems look like – it is sometimes better to have more confidence in those in the administration, whether on the European side or at Member State level, that they have simpler and clear rules that can perhaps be interpreted here or there. , will nevertheless be able to make appropriate decisions. I think that is the crucial point on which we should also try to improve the basics, and then the error rate will also be reduced. Mrs Penkova, thank you very much also for your comments. You raised the issue of pilot initiatives for the transition to the attesting test. That is a very important point. Since we have been doing this, we have also been examining the internal audit mechanisms of the Commission and the Member States. And this will give us new insights into how far they work, how far these deficits have, and then, in dialogue with the Commission and the other bodies audited, we can also make concrete proposals on how this can be improved and how it can also be used to create data that we can deal with afterwards, which we can use directly for our audit. The new approach is already showing considerable success. Mr Chastel made the point that the problems we are raising here are basically the same every year. That is absolutely right. The issue of complex bureaucratic regulation has already been raised. Perhaps I would like to comment on the problem raised by Mrs Grapini and Mr Chastel in the context of the concentration on not only compliance, i.e. the legality and computational accuracy of the implementation of the budget, but also on the question of performance, efficiency and cost-effectiveness: in recent years, the Court has examined the number of reports dealing with performance – i.e. efficiency and efficiency audits. , more than doubled. In other words, we have shifted the focus of our activities in this direction and we want to continue to do so more and more, because we do indeed believe that the citizen and you as a stakeholder are often more interested in whether the bridge or the terminal or the port that has been built with European funds is actually used. whether it is economically efficient than whether a tender ingescent might have been awarded to the wrong contractor because of some technical error. This is also important, of course, but the question of whether someone is actually using this infrastructure is at least as important and, in my opinion, even more important in my opinion. Mrs von Cramon-Taubadel and Ms Wolters raised the issues of sustainability. You will have already seen – and you will see this even more so when we adopt our new strategy, which will then apply to the Court from 2021 onwards : we will also deal intensively with the problem of sustainable development goals, i.e. the UN's SDGs. This will also play an increasingly important role in our audit work. You will hear from us even more about sustainability. Mr Kuhs, thank you very much for the kind and good words. I can assure you that the Court has no bite inhibition. As you can see, if you read the report, we will continue to give concrete examples of where things have gone wrong, because criticism is a prerequisite for it to get better. This is simply the very central experience that has been made over decades and which must be continued. That is what we are going to do. With regards what Mr Czarnecki, but also Mr Monteith and Mr Heaver and others have said, I would like to say this once again: we are using a statistical method. The Treaty obliges us to provide a statement of assurance on the implementation of the entire budget. No one is in a position to examine in detail the millions of transactions that the European Union makes in various sectors of its budget. So we do what is common according to international standards, which is what other audit institutions in the world, in Member States or in international organizations do: we take a relevant statistical set of operations that are randomly selected, and then examine these processes, and then examine these processes, and on the basis of the results we find – that is, the error we find – we calculate an estimated error rate. , and according to a very simple system: if you have a population of just under 1 000 transactions – in our case there were about 750 – that you have tested, then you can say with a 95% probability that under a certain curve in the middle is +0.8% the actual error rate. These are the international standards by which we are guided. Of course, we can be more precise, of course, in theory, instead of the whole budget, much, much more details can be provided on individual aspects of the budget. But if we do that, we need far more resources – far more resources! We currently use almost half of our resources for these transaction audits as part of the annual report. And if we want to be more precise, it means that – yes, that too is mathematics, statistical mathematics – we need four times the amount of resources for double accuracy. Let me put it very simply: at the moment, the Farm has almost 1 000 employees. If you give us 4 000 staff – you as the budgetary authority – then we will also be able to check twice as closely and provide you with twice as much data and accurate information. That is the crucial question facing the budgetary legislator. But within the resources we have today, we are simply limited, and we can only do what we have done. In order to use resources sensibly, we naturally make a risk assessment. In other words, we are looking more closely at this and making concrete statements where we know that the risks are higher. Where the risks are low over the decades of the audit period, such as in the area of administration or administration, where we always have very low error rates, we naturally do less accordingly. This means that we try to use our resources economically in order to achieve the best possible result for you. That actually answers the question asked by Mrs Garcia Muoz about the statistical method. Mr Boyer raised the issue of the use of resources and quantity. We have presented specific opinions on the various MFF proposals. You can read them all, and you can also read our views on the MFF. Mr Novakov raised the issue of performance. I do not want to say anything more about this now. As I said, we have shifted our focus. Mr Jurzyca cited the OECD's decision or publication. In fact, we believe that today, within the European Union, we have a very, very high standard of administration and implementation of the budget. We have a high standard. There are still areas where improvements need to be made. We have said that, there is no question about that, and you can find it all in the report. But if you look at this in an international comparison – we know, for example, what the figures at the Government Accountability Office in the US are – then we are in a good position, then we are really in a good position overall. But you also have to know where we actually come from. When the Commission was forced to resign from Jacques Santer in 1999, the Court of Auditors naturally also produced annual reports and issued negative opinions on the implementation of the budget in these annual reports. At that time in the 1990s, we did not publish the data on the individual household sectors, some of which were in the range of double-digit percentages. And if we compare the situation at that time, when there were no functioning internal audit systems with the efficiency that we have today, with the situation today, then we have made considerable progress. And I would like to say this: also thanks to your House, because, of course, the European Parliament after 1999 has made a number of important changes to the The Financial Regulation and, through constant pressure, which has also come from the Committee on Budgetary Control, has helped to ensure that these things have changed accordingly and have improved. So I think there is considerable progress. And then perhaps a comment on Mr Pieper. This is basically exactly the same as I said earlier, only in another form: of course, we could theoretically provide data on countries. But then I need other resources. If I do 750 or 800 transactions as part of the audit of the annual report on the entire budget, i may only have 16 transactions for some countries, which I examine. This is statistically completely irrelevant. In other words, it is like an opinion poll: if you poll 1,000 people, you get a reasonable result in terms of the likely outcome of party preferences – that is clear. But if you only ask 16, you can throw away the result. And that's exactly how it is here. What we did in response to Parliament's request was that every seven years – we did this for the first time after 2014 – we published all the data that we had collected in previous years, but with a clear disclaimer that these figures are statistically irrelevant and that they have no relevant value in terms of any statement or assessment of the situation in the Member States. That is where we are, and this state of affairs will not change. That is why I am telling you the same thing that I said in Ecofin the day before last week, because the Wishes of the Council always come from: more here, more there, more detailed information on this or that sector. With the resources we have, we cannot. We can demand this as many times as we want, we simply will not be able to do it unless our resources become different. But the question still arises: does this make economic sense to use more resources in all these different sectors of the budget in this case? This is a decision that the legislator will have to take again. In other words, the answer to this question lies with you and not with us.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 269, "date": "2019-10-23.json", "name": "Ewa KOPACZ", "mepid": "197525", "text": "  I close the debate.

I mean it. Search and rescue of human lives in the Mediterranean against the unbearable death toll in the Mediterranean that we have mourned so many times throughout the debates of this plenary session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg. I’ll make some remarks in English, according to the documents that have been widely circulated throughout the debate within the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) and then I’ll move into Spanish to make some final statements. Presenting the case is just recalling the importance of the historic record of the resolutions of this European Parliament, quite a number of them. Every time there has been a tragedy in the Mediterranean – 1000 dead human lives in the Mediterranean only this year – we have mourned them on a regular basis, almost ritually. It is not the case that we ritually deplore this tragedy. It is about time that we bring about change and call on the Commission and the Council for real action on the matter. This is the aim of this concise resolution that has tried its best to encompass all of the component elements of the rationale behind the different political groups in this House which are willing to spread the message – to reach out to the European citizens – that we actually do care about the necessity to stop this death toll and this tragedy. So many lives are lost because they don’t have a regular pathway to make it to Europe. That is why they expose themselves to trafficking in human beings and the most unbearable violations of human rights on the other side of the Mediterranean coast, namely, Libya. So we not only make the case for the necessity of enhancing legal pathways, namely humanitarian corridors, but also to call Libya by its name: no safe place, no safe port for disembarkation. We care about enhancing the capacity to respond of the actual agency, which is Frontex in cooperation with some Member States and also in cooperation with the Libyan coastguard, but we know that people trying to flee from Libya are subject to the Libyan authorities, which deem it to be a criminal offence against the Libyan legal order to try to flee from Libyan territory irregularly when they are not given the chance to make it regularly. That means, in practical terms, that those who are sent back to Libya are subject to the most inhumane violations of their most basic rights. We should not turn a blind eye to that situation. There is also a very important legal point that has been present on a regular basis in the ongoing discussions and that is the need to stop the criminalisation of NGOs trying to save lives in the Mediterranean and trying to cooperate in the operation of saving lives. Of course we pay respect to the efforts that have been deployed by public authorities, namely, Italy and Spain. They have invested massive public resources, as have the rest of the southern bordering countries of the European Union: Malta and Greece. They spend their own resources to save lives in the Mediterranean, but they have to do it under a European framework, which makes sense at a European level and which is consistent with European law. By European law I also mean international humanitarian law, which is at stake because international humanitarian principles are part of European law, according to the Lisbon Treaty, which entered into force in 2009, 10 years ago now, along with the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which enshrines in Article 18 the right to seek asylum. It is 20 years since Tampere, which launched the call for a European space of liberty, justice and security which makes sure that the response towards asylum seekers is a European response, consistent with European values and Europe’s foundations, and this means fairly shared responsibility towards the issue, as in the mandate of Article 80 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. All these component elements are in place. What we call on the Commission to do is to do its best with the Council in this new mandate for a fresh start to unblock the asylum package as a whole, to make sure that the Facilitation Directive is reviewed, to stop the criminalisation of NGOs, to open ports for safe disembarkation for those vessels which have saved lives in the sea, according to international humanitarian law, because the Convention on the Law of the Sea, which was codified in Jamaica in 1982, and the conventions on rescue and safety in the seas adopted in the 70s in the last century are still binding on all Member States, as they are binding for the European Union itself. So there has to be a European framework for response which really does make sense. Finalmente, quiero simplemente señalar la necesidad de que el Parlamento Europeo, en la votación que se celebrará mañana jueves, muestre la misma voluntad de marcar su mensaje propio ante el Consejo y la Comisión que mostró en resoluciones anteriores, notablemente en la Resolución que adoptó el concepto de «holistic approach», una visión comprensiva ante la migración y el asilo que lleva la firma de sus ponentes en aquel momento: la señora Metsola, del Partido Popular, y la señora Kyenge, del Grupo Socialista. En aquella Resolución importante se lanzó un mensaje humanitario y de compromiso de cambio. Queda todavía pendiente, como quedó pendiente el mandato que adoptó este Parlamento en la legislatura anterior de acabar con la criminalización de las ONG, modificando la «Facilitation Directive».  Este es el mensaje que quería compartir y agradeceré el voto de todos los grupos parlamentarios que estén dispuestos a renovar ese mensaje ante la Comisión y el Consejo en su nuevo mandato.

However, we should also note that it has improved significantly over the past years. According to Frontex, in 2018 around 137 000 irregular migrants crossed the Mediterranean Sea on one of the three main routes. This year so far, we have had 105 000 arrivals, which is 20% down from last year.  Equally important is that, although any death is one too many, the number of deaths at sea in 2019 has dropped by 44% since 2018, a figure which can be attributed to the decrease in departures and increased search and rescue activities and capabilities of the Libyan Coast Guard. By the beginning of October this year, 688 people were known to have lost their lives while attempting to cross the sea via this route. This is obviously a tragedy, even if there is some progress.  The United Nations Refugee Agency estimates that in 2018 the Libyan Coast Guard rescued or intercepted nearly 15 000 migrants at sea. Even though the security situation in Libya has worsened in 2019, the Coast Guard has continued operating, rescuing 7 100 people at sea. These numbers reflect the important contribution of the EU to act and reduce fatalities at sea. In Libya in particular, assistance has been of paramount importance owing to the lack of resources of the Libyan State to provide for migrants. EUR 91.3 million were granted to support the Libyan Coast Guard and to support the development of Libya’s own Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre. Operation Sophia has provided training for a total of 355 coastguard personnel so far, and the European Asylum Support Office has provided training on access to the asylum procedure.  Despite three EU joint operations in the Mediterranean Sea having saved more than 478 100 lives since the beginning of operations, and assistance to improve migrant conditions on land in North African countries, there is no denying that the overall situation regarding search and rescue operations is unsatisfactory. There is a lack of responsibility-sharing under the International Law of the Sea and we need a greater predictability of search and rescue operations. We need to strengthen cooperation and coordination on search and rescue with our North African partners.  This is not an EU responsibility alone. International Maritime Law applies to all States, and coastal States have specific responsibilities. In order to enable our partners to carry out these responsibilities, we offer additional support for the North African States – including Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt and Algeria – in migration management, including carrying out search and rescue activities and disembarkation under international law.  As you know, Italy’s migration and asylum policy has recently changed, with Italy now again permitting NGO vessels to dock in its ports. Italy also intends to revise its policies regarding the seizure of NGO boats and on fines for ships bringing migrants to Italy without permission. To address the ad hoc handling of the arrival of migrants via the Mediterranean, four Member States have been working since this summer on a common solution. On 23 September, a joint declaration setting out a mechanism which could replace the current approach with a more coordinated and efficient one was agreed by France, Germany, Italy and Malta.  Since then, a few other Member States have agreed to participate and others are invited to join. We need to see how this new approach works in practice. I am convinced that if the mechanism proves smooth and efficient this will be the best incentive for others to join. Those Member States which previously took part in voluntary relocations from Italy and Malta have started to look at the common practice which was already developed with the help of the Commission and the agencies, and are now discussing standard operating procedures. However, even if such a mechanism worked efficiently, it cannot itself be our ultimate aim. We need to find a long-term solution to these situations, but also to the whole of the common European Asylum System. In line with the invitation from the European Council in the new Strategic Agenda, we need a sustainable solution based on solidarity and fair sharing of responsibility.  Such a system has to work well, both in normal situations and in times of crisis. It needs to guarantee protection to the people in need, prevent secondary movements and be more effective in returning those who do not have the right to stay in the EU. During our Presidency term, we have tried to promote strategic and forward-looking discussions on the most pressing challenges. We are, together with the Member States, trying to look at the key issues at stake from a broader perspective and in a comprehensive way. We believe this could help us rebuild a climate of trust in the spirit of cooperation between Member States and, at the same time, feed into the new Commission’s programme. That being said, the continuation of the work on the legislative proposals will depend on the way the new Commission will reassess and reconsider the texts that are on the table.  Regarding the issue of criminalisation of organisations providing humanitarian assistance, the role of NGOs in search and rescue operations cannot be overlooked. As the Chair of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) stated in his question, and as the European Parliament reminds us in its resolution of July 2018, we need to recognise their role in saving lives at sea.  The EU Action Plan against migrant smuggling stresses the need to ensure that appropriate criminal sanctions are in place, while avoiding the risk of criminalisation of those who provide humanitarian assistance to migrants in distress. I understand the new Commission will take a close look at the facilitation framework and possibly come up with the requested guidelines for Member States to prevent humanitarian assistance from being criminalised. In addition, we need to further consolidate our efforts to tackle smuggling networks in a comprehensive way.

The migration situation across all roads has returned to pre-crisis levels, with arrivals since September 2019 around 90% lower than in September 2015. However, the situation is volatile and we must remain fully mobilised to anticipate any upcoming challenges.  While the number of lives lost in the Mediterranean has been falling, it’s still too high. Each life lost represents an individual tragedy that’s a stark reminder that we need to do more. I am therefore glad to have the opportunity to discuss today the important issue of search and rescue in the Mediterranean. Saving lives has always been a priority of the Commission. Since 2015, four EU operations have helped to rescue nearly 730 000 people at sea. Of these four operations, three – Themis, Poseidon and Indalo – coordinated by the European Border and Coast Guard, continue to be fully operational. As regards the fourth operation, Sophia, Member States agreed to its continuation only on the condition that the development of its naval assets be temporarily suspended, a solution which is far from optimal and not sustainable.  Our commitment to save lives doesn’t start when people are on the boats and at our borders. Our comprehensive strategy to prevent irregular migration flows also includes measures to assist migrants in third countries before they embark on a dangerous journey and to prevent the activities of smugglers.  When talking about search and rescue, one should not forget that this remains a merely national competence which our Member States exercise on the basis of the international law of the sea. The EU as such has no power to coordinate search and rescue activities, and for the same reason we also have no right or duty to indicate the ports of disembarkations. These talks lie within the remit of the national coordination authorities that are bound under international law by the duty to render assistance to persons or vessels in distress at sea.  This brings me to your question on the forms of facilitation which should not be criminalised. Let me reiterate one more time – no form of genuine assistance to migrants, be it those in distress at sea or those in a state of necessity on EU territory, should be criminalised under European Union law. But those involved in search and rescue operations must comply with relevant international rules. EU legislation on the facilitation of unauthorised entry, transit and residence does not require Member States to criminalise genuine assistance to migrants. On the contrary, it provides for the possibility to exempt this type of contact from criminalisation under national law.  That being said, the Commission’s evaluation of the EU’s legal framework, carried out in 2017, has acknowledged that there is a lack of clarity in the implementation of the humanitarian exemption clause in the Member States. As a result of this, the evaluation has recognised the need for Member States to have a dialogue with NGOs to facilitate cooperation, clarify context and address the concerns related to criminalisation. Also, the Commission has started to engage with civil society to gather more evidence and foster dialogue on the implementation of the existing rules. The last meeting between civil society and Commissioner services on this matter took place on 1 October this year. The results of the engagement and dialogue with civil society will feed into the reflection of the next Commission.  Despite all these limitations, the Commission is working tirelessly to find a solution to the distribution of people rescued at sea, in accordance with the principle of solidarity and the fair sharing of responsibility.  At the request of Member States, the Commission has played an active role in the relocation process following 15 disembarkation incidents. On these 15 occasions over 1 100 disembarked people were transferred to other Member States and to Norway. To date, around 750 people, of which the vast majority disembarked during the last two months, remain to be transferred, but pledges have already been given by Member States that they will do so. 15 Member States, namely Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Slovenia, Bulgaria and Spain, as well as Norway, have participated in these exercises. I would like to underline that in each case this has been preceded by an active coordination role of the Commission at the highest level, with Member States willing to demonstrate solidarity through relocation. It is thanks to these efforts that we have managed to overcome difficulties encountered in deciding where a particular vessel should be disembarked.  The Commission has strongly encouraged Member States to agree on temporary arrangements following disembarkation. Therefore, we have welcomed the progress achieved at the end of September in Malta concerning a temporary solidarity mechanism between Germany, France, Italy and Malta. The Malta Joint Declaration was submitted for the consideration of all EU ministers at the recent Justice and Home Affairs Council and further discussions will continue at both the political and technical levels. To this end, a first technical meeting between those Member States taking part in relocation to discuss operational issues took place on 11 October, with the participation of certain Member States and Norway, as well as EU agencies. This is, for the beginning, I would say, a good sign. Work will continue on this basis. At the same time all these arrangements can only be an intermediary step towards a structural reform of the asylum and migration system. That is why work on the reform of the common European asylum system and of the Return Directive, but also on the implementation of all legislation adopted to strengthen the protection of our external borders, coupled with strong partnership with key third countries on each migratory route, needs to be pushed forward.

What we do not want, however, is to create a model that plays into the hands of smugglers and traffickers, which also supports, rather than combats, this cynical business model. Because we have to be clear about one thing: causes of flight do not arise at sea, but on land. What we therefore need, therefore, is a maritime rescue procedure based on international law and EU law, to which all actors adhere. We need serious and intensified discussions with countries of origin and transit, both in terms of the prospects of staying for the people on the ground and about the common fight against organised crime. We need a clear distinction in asylum and migration policy between refugees and economic migration. We need humanitarian corridors to safe third countries for people fleeing war and violence. These countries deserve our support. None of this has been addressed in the resolution to the extent that we would have liked it to be.

I think the chair of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) has had a very difficult task in trying to bring together Members of this House on this Resolution. But essentially, what he has done is to address both the Commission and the Member States on some key points, because it is quite concrete in the end: either we do something or we don’t. And we are doing this at the beginning of the new Commission, as the Commissioner said. So let’s be very clear: we can get around some of these things that would show our humanitarian effort and understand that we have some values here in the Mediterranean. We repeatedly called on the Commission to issue guidelines specifying which forms of facilitation should not be criminalised. In our Resolution, we call on the Commission to finally adopt those guidelines by the end of this year. I know the new Commission will only take office at the beginning of December, but the Asylum Package is frozen, as has been said. But there is a lot of work to be done to take this proactive approach. Operationally, we need more information and transparency on Frontex’s activities at sea, as well as on the funds and material support that are provided by the EU and its Member States to the border and coast guards in third countries, including Libya, Turkey, Egypt and Morocco. Fundamental rights, the principle of non-refoulement and the principle of disembarkation in a place of safety have to be respected. Finally, Member States should step up their moral and legal obligations to save lives at sea and adopt a proactive approach to search and rescue, making use of all available vessels, and to cooperate and support NGOs in their efforts. Essentially, the Resolution addresses, on the one hand, what the Commission can do and what the new Commission can do, and then the Member States, because for the Member States, this blame game, which is simply not demonstrating our values but passing around the blame, will continue to drain our resources, but ultimately it will require us to make difficult decisions: difficult decisions which ultimately will be the right moral decisions in the Mediterranean, but also sustainable decisions and proactive ones.

Every life matters. And when we’re talking about numbers of people drowning in the Mediterranean, we’re talking about individuals – people who came into the world one day, and their parents had hope for them. And those people are now dead at the bottom of the Mediterranean. They are people like you and I, so that is something we shouldn’t forget. The second thing I would like to remind us of is that this resolution is on search and rescue. This is not on adopting a comprehensive asylum package because that’s been blocked in the Council, as we all know. This House has done its homework. We are ready. But we cannot wait until the asylum package has been adopted. As there are people drowning, we simply have to make sure that there is sufficient capacity in the Mediterranean. And the point is that if the EU, if the Member States, are leaving a gap, then what we see is indeed that NGOs, or sometimes commercial vessels, fill in that gap. We shouldn’t be criminalising those people for saving lives. And then to say that ‘oh but these people are irregular, they’re labour migrants or asylum seekers’ – that’s irrelevant! First, you rescue them and then we argue over their status, Okay? There has to be a permanent sustainable solution. I’m personally no big fan of the solutions that don’t have their basis in the treaties, but I have to say, if the Malta agreement can be a first step in the direction of a permanent solution, then all the Member States should sign up. it is very disappointing that out of 28 there are only four who have done so, so far. That is shameful. The asylum package is blocked and they use that as a pretext for not saving people. But then when it is about saving people they’re also not there. That is shameful. And finally, I would really like to call on our friends of the EPP because I would like to recommend the good efforts that have been made by the shadow, Ms Düpont, but I also recognise that there are parts of the EPP who, despite very often referring to Christian values, actually don’t express their Christian values in some of the amendments. Sorry! When we’re talking about the camps in Libya – there’s a German ambassador who wrote to Ms Merkel referring to those camps as ‘concentration camps’. These camps have to be closed. People have to be evacuated. it is not negotiable.

It is up to us, with the resolution, but also with the new European Commission, to show that we can do more than keep saying that no one should die on the run. Yes, of course no one should die and, of course, no one should have to flee on unseaworthy boats. Unfortunately, however, we live in a reality in which thousands of people die every year on these boats at our external borders, people who were once the most important person in another person's life.

We Europeans have a responsibility not to watch the deaths in the Mediterranean, but to act.

The best thing, of course, is if people don't get on the boats in the first place. That is why we must support the UNHCR in improving the situation in the camps.

It is not enough just to strengthen rescue operations, but we must find a more sophisticated overall solution that is acceptable to all EU states.

This may seem like a bad signal to some to refugees fighting for their lives, but let us use the situation to put the text in a more balanced form. I am not against the principle of solidarity when it comes to saving people's lives, and I am also in favour of strengthening the rescue mechanism.

I know you are equally aware that the Council has not yet been able to reach an agreement on the Commission’s recommendations to open accession negotiations with the Republic of North Macedonia and with Albania. In the meantime, both countries have worked hard to advance in their reforms. The Council’s conclusions, adopted last June, tasked us to make clear and substantive decisions on both countries, at the latest in October. As the President of the General Affairs Council, I must say that I am deeply disappointed that we failed to do so in our meeting last week. Despite all efforts, the European Council was not able to do this either. I must admit that this lack of unanimity on reaching these concrete decisions can be seen as a setback for the EU’s role in the Western Balkans and for our enlargement policy, which remains a strategic investment in peace, stability and development in Europe. But it definitely does not mean that we will stop here. This just means that even more efforts are needed. I think it’s important to stress that there are no differing views in the Council regarding our commitment to the European perspective of the Western Balkans. The importance of maintaining and even strengthening the EU’s engagement in the Western Balkans is shared by all Member States. It is also clear for everyone in the EU that the region is in our courtyard and, we need to continue to do our best to help take further the necessary reform processes. The European Council had a long debate on the issue last week, and in the end, the leaders agreed to revert to the issue of enlargement before the Western Balkans Summit in Zagreb in May 2020. At the Council, we are ready to do our part. The Presidency remains committed to doing what it can in order to explore a path towards a clear and substantive outcome. I would also like to reiterate how important it is that both North Macedonia and Albania continue to make concrete progress on reforms. Reforms are needed to progress in the EU approximation, but most importantly, these are reforms that the people of both of these countries call for. It is also worth repeating that committing to European values remains essential for all partners aspiring to gain EU membership. Let me conclude by reiterating our deep appreciation for North Macedonia, for the courageous step it took with the signing of the historic Prespa Agreement and the change of the country’s name. The Presidency also welcomes the political will to move forward, which has been demonstrated constantly by the Government in Albania, despite a polarised political atmosphere. I am convinced that soon enough the time will come for these efforts to be rewarded.

The overwhelming majority of Members States were ready to give the green light for opening negotiations. Regrettably, not all Member States were in a position to take a decision on the day. May I use the opportunity here in the European Parliament to thank in particular Minister Tuppurainen for her personal determination and efforts to find a solution a few days before at the General Affairs Council, but as we know, it was not possible. But I would like, in the presence of the Members of the European Parliament, to thank you for all your efforts, together with your team. The fact that it was not possible to get an agreement is indeed a matter of deep disappointment. Let me repeat what I said last week in Luxembourg after the first, so to say, failure: this is not a moment of glory for the European Union. We are now at an impasse. Let us not forget that there is unanimity about one thing: the Western Balkans need many more courageous decisions such as Prespa. Following our failure to deliver last week, we really have to think hard about how to answer the following questions: where are our incentives to catalyse more such breakthroughs? Where is our commitment and support to those who take the gravest political risks? The least we owe to the countries of the Western Balkans is honesty. The enlargement policy is enshrined in the Treaty, and it’s not about being nice with our neighbours; it’s about our rendezvous with history, completing the unification process that began long ago. And it’s, above all, in our geostrategic interests. European Union Member States now need to clarify how serious their commitment is to the Western Balkans’ European Union integration. North Macedonia and Albania are not to blame for this situation. Both countries did what they were asked to do – and even more, and our reports on the countries acknowledge this. Impressive reforms have been achieved in Albania and North Macedonia in the rule of law area: judicial reform, fight against corruption and organised crime. The vetting process in Albania is a particular achievement. Moreover, the Prespa Agreement was a truly extraordinary achievement based on leadership, courage and determination to overcome obstacles of the past for the sake of a bright future. And the same applies for the good neighbourly agreement between North Macedonia and Bulgaria. Our responsibility now is to stand with these countries, whose citizens are deeply disappointed. They have the right to feel short-changed but should not give up hope. Our commitment to the European Union perspective of the Western Balkans remains unchanged. Their European Union integration is, and remains, a strategic important policy goal, in our mutual interest. That’s why the European Union will revert to this issue before the European Union-Western Balkans Leaders’ Summit in Zagreb in May 2020. I continue to hope for a positive outcome then. The Commission will continue to support Albania and North Macedonia in every way it can, to ensure that the EU reforms continue to be implemented, in the interest of their citizens, and to continue to help prepare them for their future in the European Union. I think now it’s time really to stand with the citizens of these countries and of the whole region and to support them. I can fully understand their disappointment and partly their discouragement, but again, we have to assist them to overcome the situation, and from the side of the Commission we will do everything to do this.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "PPE", "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 325, "date": "2019-10-23.json", "name": "Andrey KOVATCHEV", "mepid": "97968", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Madam President, the European People’s Party (PPE) is deeply disappointed with the inability of the Council to start negotiations with North Macedonia and Albania. We have a common understanding that the Council’s decision sends a terrible geopolitical signal that is contrary to the interests of the European Union in the region. We cannot wait until the Zagreb Summit next year and we should try to repair this mistake as soon as possible. For sure this blockage will have political consequences, not only in the two countries but also in the whole region.  The EU is not consistent in its messages. The Bulgarian Presidency put back the topic of enlargement of the EU agenda, after a gap of 15 years after the Thessaloniki Summit. Our six Western Balkan partners are European countries and it is in our own interest to integrate them today rather than tomorrow. Other geopolitical players like Russia, Turkey, China and Saudi Arabia are keen to increase their influence in the absence of a vital European perspective. The EU must regain the trust of the citizens of this region as soon as possible. Furthermore, we must invest enough funds in effective communication tools to counter the propaganda against the European Union in the Western Balkans. And yes indeed, both countries need to deliver still in many political fields, for example, the implementation of the Good Neighbourly Relations Agreement between Sofia and Skopje is unsatisfactory.  Sometimes I wonder why it is only under pressure from outside that countries are willing to wake up from decades of manipulation and falsification of historical facts and events. This is similarly valid for other bilateral issues in the region, and indeed EU integration cannot depend only on the bravery of one person to solve all long-standing problems, and if the opposition come to power, to destroy it.  We would like to urge the three countries in the Council to lift their blockage and allow the start of the EU accession negotiations with North Macedonia and Albania, which we know will continue for a long time and we need very soon to regain the trust of the young generation in the EU.

North Macedonia and Albania have worked hard over the past years to meet all the conditionality criteria and to implement difficult and necessary reforms. Both countries kept their promise and fulfilled their share. It was now time for the EU to deliver and to open accession negotiations. North Macedonia has been a candidate for a total of 14 years and the Commission has given the green light for accession talks for the past 10 years.  The toughest negotiations, on its name, led to the historic Prespa Agreement and it took real political courage and real leadership, by both North Macedonia and Greece, to put an end to a 27-year dispute. As sad as it is to say, this is exactly what European leaders did not have – or perhaps, precisely, the French President did not have. Mr Macron did not show the same leadership and the same political courage. The EU had the opportunity to finally show responsibility and political maturity but we failed, miserably, and this failure damages the image of the European Union in the Western Balkans.  The EU often raises its voice on issues where, sadly, we are unable to make a difference.

We are not able to deliver on what we have promised several times already and this failure to move forward with the membership talks could undermine the EU’s credibility and destabilise the region.

Mr President, I would like to thank the I would like to thank everyone in this Chamber very warmly for the overwhelming support for a credible accession process and, in particular, for giving the two countries of Northern Macedonia and Albania the green light to start accession negotiations. We are not talking about them joining tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, but we are talking about a multi-year process. It sometimes takes years to build credibility, and it can only take a few minutes or hours to destroy that credibility. This has happened to some extent in the Western Balkans, but I will tell you, not just in the Western Balkans. With this decision, we in the European Union have lost a great deal of credibility, reliability and predictability, which we stand for, which we stand for and fight for all over the world. I say this against the background that a whole series of problems are re-emerging in our immediate neighbourhood right now. Look at Lebanon, I do not need to talk about the Middle East, in Tunisia the political situation is highly fragile, in Algeria there is an unclear political situation. I can only hope that those responsible for this current situation were unaware of this decision, which means that the European Union's standing at global level, and particularly in the neighbourhood, means that they have lost their ability to solve, to have had influence, to have lost their assertiveness. It will not be easy to recover that. I am inclined – because I am a member of the half-full glass party – to believe that things are turning for the better, and I am also prepared to take seriously the various arguments that have been put forward in recent months to justify why the negotiations are not already opening. I also confess, however, that I sometimes felt that arguments were being put forward which actually have the character of a pretext for not having to say clearly and clearly: I am against enlargement. One of these arguments that we have heard from France, but also from one country or another, was that we need a deepening, an improvement in our form of cooperation, of decision-making and cetera before the next enlargement. Personally, I say: yes, I have a great deal of sympathy for this, but I do not understand that these processes take place one after the other, but it is quite possible, sensible, realistic and pragmatic, to conduct these processes in parallel, because both will take years. But if we talk first about deepening and then about further accessions, then these countries have an accession perspective that is located in the 1930s, and I believe that we agree that there is no prospect in this context. I can also assure you, ladies and gentlemen, that my services – myself and, I assume, my successor – will be very committed to looking at the methodology of the accession process. Nobody is perfect. There are always possibilities for improvement, but much of what I have heard so far already exists, and it already exists: the emphasis on the rule of law, the possibility of suspending negotiations, and no negotiation leads to accession 'necessarily', but this process is also reversible. So that is what we are going to do, and I hope that we will be involved in this issue with the commitment that has also raised this issue. Finally, I would like to tell you a small story that is much shorter than it sounds: in 2013, as Regional Commissioner in Brussels, I organised a small seminar with civil representatives from Northern Ireland who presented their various examples, projects and case studies, such as how they organised, conducted and promoted reconciliation in Northern Ireland. I can tell you that 90% of the participants in 2013 were representatives of the countries of the former Yugoslavia. And they will know exactly why they took part. Because they are fully aware that peace, stability and prosperity in the Western Balkans region can only be achieved by embedding it in a larger whole, namely the European Union. I would like to thank you once again for this strong signal of hope, which you will also send out tomorrow with the relevant decision, and I should like to wish the President of the North Macedonian Parliament all the best and i would also like to thank him personally for the many initiatives he has taken in recent months to open up the country to Europe.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "GUE/NGL", "partyIdeology": "Left-wing"}, {"id": 376, "date": "2019-10-23.json", "name": "Dimitrios PAPADIMOULIS", "mepid": "28586", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Mr President, President of the Assembly of North Macedonia, honourable Members of Parliament, I would like to thank you for this discussion.

No matter how tempting it is, it is useless to point fingers and name and shame anyone, because now we must move forward. We must take further steps. We must now carefully consider the next steps in order to succeed in a process, which, in any case, is going to be long and require a lot of hard work from everyone.

Throughout the years, Albania and North Macedonia have achieved a significant progress with reforms which eventually led to a positive outcome by the European Commission, calling Member States to agree to start pre-accession negotiations. The Council had the key role in moving on to the next step – to greenlight the opening of the pre-accession talks with the two countries from the Western Balkan Region.  Nevertheless, the lack of unanimity in the Council led to a decision, which can be considered as a mistake for the EU.

It is feared that if the countries of the Western Balkans do not receive substantial support from the Union on enlargement, geopolitically significant countries will gain influence in the region that do not set any conditions for the countries of the region. This could pose a serious threat to the future of the Union.  The politicians of North Macedonia and Albania, regardless of their party acrelia, have done their best to start accession negotiations. Painful reforms have been carried out in both countries, with North Macedonia even going through a name change in order to start accession negotiations after 14 years of waiting. Albania and North Macedonia have met the required conditions, so it is incomprehensible why the two countries have not been given the green light to open negotiations. This underlines the credibility of the Union.  In the reform process on the future of Europe, particular emphasis should be placed on the legal framework for enlargement and neighbourhood policy.

The demonstrations escalated into violent clashes with the security forces, resulting in over 110 deaths and more than 6 000 wounded. A curfew was imposed and the internet was shut down for several days. There have been reports of attacks against press agencies and television stations, but also of unknown armed individuals attacking protesters.  The European Union made it immediately clear, already on 3 October, that we expect the security forces to exercise maximum restraint in the handling of protests, and we expect credible and swift investigations of the events.  We are encouraged by the prompt statements from Iraq’s highest authorities, who have reaffirmed their commitment to guaranteeing freedom of expression and security for all Iraqi citizens as well as the freedom of the press. The Iraqi people’s demands cannot be met with repression. Their requests must be listened to and addressed in earnest.  The protests seem to have initiated spontaneously, driven by young people asking for access to basic services, better opportunities and an end to corruption. Their aspirations and grievances are legitimate and should not be underestimated. In fact, young people across the Middle East are taking to the streets with the same demands.  At the same time, the challenges that Iraq is facing are unique. The country is finally coming out of a long conflict. It needs reconciliation and reconstruction; but it also needs to deliver on its people’s aspirations to a better life and better opportunities for all. These expectations need to be fulfilled if Iraq is to be stabilised in the long term.  Credible and effective structural economic reforms cannot be postponed. Corruption needs to be tackled effectively. This is crucial to building the country’s resilience with effective State institutions and strong democracy. The current government of Iraq has put forward an ambitious reform agenda, which must now be implemented as a matter of urgency. The High Representative was in Baghdad over the summer and already then she offered to support the government’s reform agenda and to focus on providing services to the population.  In these years, we have always been on the side of the Iraqi people, and their work to rebuild and reconcile the country. In early 2018, we co-hosted in Kuwait an international conference for the reconstruction of Iraq, and we are now delivering on the pledges made at the conference. EUR 300 million has been mobilised in the last two years to support reforms and promote sustainable job creation, particularly for the youngest generation – the one that has been at the forefront of the recent protests. In these years we have demined the country’s hospitals and universities, so that the people of Iraq could finally have a normal life. We have worked with the Iraqi Government to support national reconciliation and we have established a civilian advisory mission to assist with security sector reform. This is also to make security forces more compliant with basic human rights and fundamental freedoms.  We cannot forget that Iraq has made significant progress in the past two years. After the territorial defeat of Daesh, the 2018 elections were followed by a peaceful transfer of power. Meanwhile, relations between the central government and the Kurdistan Regional Government have also improved. We Europeans have always said that we want to help the people of Iraq win peace. This is what the people of Iraq are asking right now, so we will continue to be at their side and to accompany Iraq on its path towards a stronger more inclusive and more just democracy.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 388, "date": "2019-10-23.json", "name": "Georgios KYRTSOS", "mepid": "125063", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, we have a crisis between Iran and Saudi Arabia, unrest in Lebanon, an invasion in Syria and other developments that underline the importance of a stable Iraq in a complex and volatile region.

Having been at this very plenary since 9.00 this morning, I think we all should be resting already at this point – if we think about our health. Nevertheless, however, it is a pleasure to discuss with you the recent high-level event that took place on 23 September in the context of the United Nations General Assembly on Universal Health Coverage: Moving Together to Build a Healthier World. That event brought together heads of states, political and health leaders, policy makers and universal health coverage champions, to advocate for better health for all. Universal health coverage means that all people, including the most vulnerable – or should I say, especially the most vulnerable – have access to the health care they need, when and where they need it, without facing financial hardship. The aim was to harness financial and political commitments to sustain health investments, with the focus on accelerating progress towards universal health coverage, including access to essential health services, a skilled health workforce, financial risk protection and access to safe, quality, effective and affordable medicines and vaccines for all. This ambitious aim was achieved in the form of an action-oriented political declaration on universal health coverage endorsed by heads of states representing the entire United Nations membership. This is all the more remarkable as this was our last opportunity before 2023 – the midway point, to reach the sustainable development goals by 2030 – to mobilise the highest levels of political support, to bring the entire health agenda under the umbrella of universal health coverage. The declaration is accompanied by a concrete global action plan for healthy lives and well-being that will serve as a blueprint for global health and development agencies as well as national governments to meet health needs. We are all aware, of course, that big question marks still remain concerning the significant financing needed now until 2030 in order to live up to our ambitious commitments. This will have to be secured through a mix of domestic financing based on individual country contexts, and international aid-funding mechanisms. This is no doubt our main task ahead. It is daunting, but our credibility will be at stake if we fail. Finally, I would like to stress the leadership role that the EU and its Member States must continue to play on the issue of universal health coverage, in the multilateral context that is so dear to us but which we should not take for granted. 2020 will be a test year in that regard, with the 25th anniversary reviews of the 1994 Cairo International Conference on Population and Development and the 1995 Beijing Platform for Action. The EU and its Member States will need to position themselves at the forefront to protect the progress achieved 25 years ago and ensure that there is no stepping back. Such European leadership was demonstrated once again during the high-level event on universal health coverage, and I wish to commend Minister Kaag of the Netherlands for leading a strong coalition of 58 countries in support of sexual and reproductive health and rights. These are part and parcel of the 2030 agenda and a cornerstone of a universal health coverage. Investing in sexual and reproductive health and rights is affordable and cost-saving and can make health coverage truly universal, in line with our key promise under the 2030 agenda: that we shall leave no one behind. I want to stress that the Presidency will spare no effort to continue to promote universal access to health care, which all human beings, in particular the most vulnerable, need, when and where they need it, in line with the ‘economy of well-being’ approach introduced by our Finnish Presidency.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 22, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 409, "date": "2019-10-23.json", "name": "Fabio Massimo CASTALDO", "mepid": "124812", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, honourable Members, on 23 September heads of states, governments and health ministers convened on the margins of the United Nations General Assembly for the first time ever for a high—level meeting on universal health coverage. They endorsed a landmark political declaration – universal health coverage moving to build a healthier world.  The Commission welcomes this historical event at which the United Nations member states recognised that universal health coverage implies access for everyone to promotable, preventive, curative, rehabilitative and palliative essential health services, and access to effective medicines and vaccines.  The United Nations member states committed to invest in primary health care, to ensure financially affordable health care, to protect women and children’s health and to strengthen the health workforce and reinforce government health capacity. Regrettably, the declaration also demonstrated the visible division among UN Member States on sexual and reproductive health and rights. The Netherlands delivered a statement on behalf of 54 countries strongly supporting universal health coverage for sexual and reproductive health and rights. The United States, along with 19 other countries, dissociated from the relevant paragraph in the declaration, in a call to roll back on sexual and reproductive health and rights. Commissioner Andriukaitis, speaking on behalf of the European Union, stressed the EU’s commitment to the sustainable development goals, and to the protection and promotion of everyone’s right to enjoy the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health. Health is essential for achieving stable and prosperous societies, economic and social well—being and security. To address health comprehensively, along with the rights—based approach already used through the implementation of the European pillar of social rights, we need a ‘health in all policies’ approach going beyond the boundaries of the health sector alone. Working in parallel on gender equality, water and sanitation, education, food and nutritional security, decent work and social protection, environment and security, could bring us the tangible results we aim at. In that vein, the European Union should remain committed to the promotion, protection and fulfilment of all human rights, including sexual and reproductive health rights, and continue the full and effective implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action, as agreed in the new consensus on development.  The upcoming Nairobi Summit in November will also celebrate and reinforce the commitments made with the programme of action from the International Conference on Population and Development adopted 25 years ago. I am pleased that a delegation of the European Parliament will attend this high—level meeting. The Union’s actions have produced impressive results. Between 2013 and 2017, the European Union contributed to over 19 million births attended by skilled health personnel. More than 13 million children were fully immunised. 57 million women were supported to use contraception. Eleven million people were put on life—saving treatment for HIV and 600 million bed nets were distributed for malaria protection and prevention.  We also support the World Health Organisation (WHO). Just recently, the Union signed an agreement with the WHO for an EUR 102 million partnership programme prioritising strengthening health systems and universal health coverage. As a global leader, the European Union will continue supporting partner countries in their efforts to build strong, good quality and resilient healthcare systems by providing equitable access to medical services and universal health coverage. As such, we will strive to reach our ambitious goal of universal health coverage for all by 2030.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 1, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 1, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 22, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 410, "date": "2019-10-23.json", "name": "Dolors MONTSERRAT", "mepid": "197711", "text": "  PPE Group. – Mr President, we have made great progress in combating the world's leading causes of death and disease: life expectancy has increased exponentially, child and maternal mortality rates have declined, we have positively changed the course of HIV, and malaria mortality has halved.  However, progress in the world has been uneven. There is still a thirty-one-year gap between countries with the shortest and longest life expectancy. Four hundred million people do not have access to basic health services. Every two seconds someone between the ages of thirty-seven dies prematurely from noncommunicable diseases. And one in three women has experienced physical or sexual violence at some point in their lives.  The facts therefore show us that universal health coverage gives us better life expectancy, but it is also an engine of economic and social growth for all societies of the world. One of the great examples of success, of course, is Europe, where we have the best public national system in the world; where we invest in health prevention and promotion from primary care; where we research the most advanced treatments; where we train to have the best healthcare professionals; and where above all we have quality and universality in care and access to treatments. Therefore, this political statement in the end what it is looking for is to comply globally with the third Sustainable Development Goal. In Europe we have two great instruments, which are our strength, to be able to meet the objectives. The first instrument we have is our European model of health care and the second is our model of international cooperation.  I therefore call on the Finnish Presidency and the Commission to further promote the cross-sectoral partnerships of our public health systems with those of other countries around the world to share knowledge, research and access to treatment.  And since we are world leaders in international cooperation in Europe and devote more than 72 billion euros a year — and many of the programmes funded are health — let us prioritize international cooperation programmes for health programmes, such as those that force health prevention and promotion, which starts with nutrition and primary care; and let us prioritise that our cooperation programmes should be aimed primarily at reducing the global maternal and child mortality rate, also reducing premature mortality from noncommunicable diseases, and ending epidemics of communicable diseases. Only in this way, with these great instruments that Europe has, and with our leadership, we will be able to ensure that in 2030 all corners of the world have universal coverage.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 1, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 1, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 8, "mortality": 4, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 1, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 411, "date": "2019-10-23.json", "name": "Fabio Massimo CASTALDO", "mepid": "124812", "text": "   Thank you, Mr President, there was a technical problem with the timing, so let us say that you have overrun a little, but of course there was a problem of ours, I understand that it was difficult for you to actually observe where you were in your speech.

Unfortunately, we see today that people in different parts of the world do not have access to good care. This also applies to the right to good and safe sexual and reproductive health care. In many parts of the world, women are today deprived of this right. That is totally unacceptable.

Mr President, the UN General Assembly's statement on universal health coverage recognises the major impact of environmental conditions on human health.

Global warming is promoting the proliferation of mosquito-borne infections. These epidemics are currently spreading in Europe: two cases of indigenous Zika virus have been detected in my country, France, today.  The fight against climate change is therefore one of the axes in its own right of universal health coverage.

The Paris Agreement also reminds us that the right to health is one of the fundamental rights of human beings. The main objective of the Green New Deal must ultimately remain human health, and more generally global health, which refers to the virtuous circle linking human health, animal health and environmental health.  In our fight against global warming, we will have to focus on educating citizens in order to avoid generating new health inequalities that lie ahead for the most vulnerable.

Fortunately, a strong alliance of progressive countries was able to ensure that standards on sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) and women’s rights were included in the final political declaration. In line with its rights—based approach, the EU should continue to stand united to defend the rights of women and girls within the EU and at the global level.

Indeed, there are still a lot of people around the world who do not have access to health care.

The UN political statement is rightly based on the approach to 'health in all policy areas' and sustainability objectives. I would like to address a number of things. First, the environmental factors. We cannot talk about health without talking about a healthy living environment and protection against harmful substances. This also applies to health in the workplace, because too many workers worldwide are still not protected from toxic substances. The health gap is also one of my pet peeves. Arm makes sick and sick makes poor. Still too many people don't get the necessary worries for financial reasons. That is unacceptable. We have an immense responsibility in vaccination policy, not only in Europe but also internationally. Not vaccinating is a danger to the entire population. We must also focus on mental health care, including on our own continent. The total cost of this is estimated at EUR 600 billion in the Union. We need to move not one but two gears higher. There has rightly been a great deal of support here on the issue of sexual and reproductive health care. I agree with that, too.

And indeed we can see differences between individual parts of the urban centres of western parts in relation to rural areas, in relation to areas of Central Eastern Europe and islands and other distant areas that are much less accessible.

We are a party that wants a truly universal health service, by scrapping prescription charges, taking on Big Pharma and delivering free personal care, so that our healthcare system puts public health ahead of private wealth and people before profit.  This is a basic human right, but sadly, not everyone has such a vital safety net. However, I am proud that the EU has supported 57 million women to use contraception, immunised 13 million children, given 11 million life-saving treatments for HIV and distributed 600 million bed nets for malaria prevention.

The adoption of the UN Declaration is an important achievement, as it promotes key EU values. But we need to make sure that the important commitments made by the UN member states will now turn into concrete actions across the globe. In that vein, we welcome the fact that the declaration includes a formal review mechanism that allows us to take stock of the progress made in 2020 and 2022. The results should serve as a basis to adapt our approach and efforts before reconvening for another high-level meeting in 2023 for a comprehensive review of the implementation of the commitments made.

This is also in line with the so-called economy of well-being approach introduced by the Finnish Presidency. In our thinking, universal health coverage is a sustainable investment. Particular attention should – and will – be devoted to the needs and rights of women and girls, including sexual and reproductive health and rights. The EU and its Member States, as key supporters of multilateralism with the United Nations at its heart, together with the European Parliament, will promote and protect those rights in the context of the review of the International Conference on Population and Development and the Beijing Platform in Action in 2020.
