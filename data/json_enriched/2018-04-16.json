This intervention is the consequence of the Damascus regime's use of chemical weapons towards the civilian population. In view of the seriousness of the situation, I believe it is necessary that Parliament, already today, send a strong message before tomorrow's debate with the High Representative, Mogherini, and the confrontation we will have in morning with the President of the French Republic, Macron. Precisely because the debate within Parliament is considered of great importance, I received a phone call yesterday from the British Prime Minister, Mrs May, who had to inform, through me, the European Parliament that the attack on bases in Syria was an attack aimed at targeting only chemical weapons and not the civilian population. Objective: to prevent these weapons from continuing to use against the civilian population. The second message you have given me and that I transmit to you is that the United Kingdom intends, on the Syrian question, to continue working with the countries of the European Union. A few hours ago also ended a meeting of EU foreign ministers on the situation in Syria. I am convinced that Parliament has to reiterate strongly and clearly today that the use of chemical weapons is unacceptable and that it represents a red line beyond which no one in the world can go. Nor can we resign ourselves to the fact that Syria continues to be a ground for confrontation between global and regional powers and terrorist organisations, who pursue their own careless interests of Very serious suffering that causes to the unarmed civilian population: since 2011 more than 500 thousand people have died and 12 and a half million refugees have been forced to abandon their homes and, among them, 5 millions have left Syria. We must act with greater determination to pursue peace and stability in the Middle Eastern Mediterranean area, strengthening dialogue and diplomacy, with the full involvement of the United Nations. But Europe must play a leading role, because the area of the Mediterranean is the area where Europe can say a lot to prevent violence from ramping up, that war crimes can be carried out and that may recourse to weapons which are prohibited by international conventions. To do this, a strong unity of Europeans is essential: to go in a scattered order would be a serious mistake. The dramatic nature of the situation is to disparage all doubts about the need and urgency to build an increasingly incisive common foreign and defence policy of the Union and the ongoing debate on the next budget is an essential test on our desire to provide ourselves with the resources necessary to be true global actors but, above all, to be bearers, in the world, of the values around which the Union was born European.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "aws", "politicalGroup": "PPE-DE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2, "date": "2018-04-16.json", "name": "Manfred WEBER", "mepid": "28229", "text": " Mr President, on behalf of the PPE Group.

As you have reported, the intervention measures taken by our American, French and British friends were necessary because a signal had to be sent that we cannot tolerate this action in Syria by Assad and his partners. The use of chemical weapons must not be applied against civilians. From our point of view, the activities of the allies in Syria were proportionate. They were limited to the infrastructure necessary for the use of chemical weapons. From our point of view, however, the time window for diplomacy has also come. Russia must now abandon its blockade in the UN Security Council. And while it is often said that Europe has too little presence in the Syrian conflict, I would like to point out that Europeans have now provided more than EUR 9 billion in humanitarian aid in recent years. We Europeans are partners of those affected and threatened people in the region.

And we have to ask this question, because we agree that we need diplomacy, that we need de-escalation, that we now urgently need to strengthen the United Nations. But let us ask critically how we slid into a situation where Russia does not understand where Iran does not understand this — I could look to the north of Syria and say, where Turkey does not understand — that de-escalation is the order of the day. We need to speak clear language — sympathetic, but clear. If Russia wants to demonstrate its strength, it must not be on the back of poisoned children and on the back of attacks against hospitals. If Mr Erdoğan wants to demonstrate his strength, then he does not have to do so in a situation where ISIS has defeated in the north, he has waited so long with his tanks for the Kurds to clean up the conflict field to drive the tanks now. And if Iran wants a future in the modern world, then it must consider its role in this conflict scenario. I have one request: strengthen Mrs Mogherini's back!

I know that the British Prime Minister is extremely grateful not only for the European support, but also for the international support shown for these actions that were deemed necessary. All of us, many of us, would have wished that the solution could be achieved through diplomatic aims. We wish it could have been achieved through the United Nations, but we all know that Russia has vetoed no less than six times any attempt to address this issue in the UN. Does that mean it is time for inaction? No. What it means is actually that we have to use this in a targeted way. The American President, the French President and the British Prime Minister have been quite clear that this is not about regime change. It is not about taking sides in a civil war. It is a limited action making sure that we reinstate international norms and rules regarding the use of chemical weapons. The previous speakers have already mentioned how hideous and heinous these crimes are: the use of chemical weapons against your population. We have not been able to solve this purely diplomatically up to now, but now we have sent a message from the international community: limited action based on stopping the use of chemical weapons. Nothing more, nothing less. And let’s all be clear. Whatever our views about other issues and whatever our views about those other issues that divide us in this House, the use of chemical weapons whether on the battlefield, against civilian populations or used to poison individuals, is something that we should all take very seriously. We all know that there are norms that have to be respected, and these norms have been crossed and ignored by the Syrian regime. Let us continue to cooperate as the international community, as well as within the European Union, and let us be clear, but now making sure that we pursue the diplomatic channel with even more vigour, with even more determination, having sent a signal that the use of chemical weapons is clearly unacceptable.

I know there are some people who are making a comparison with the Iraq war. Well, I continue to believe that the Iraq war was a mistake, based on a lie. I was Prime Minister of one of the only European countries that openly opposed that war, and I am still proud of that attitude. But I think that this intervention in Syria is fully justified because it is a regime that has used chemical weapons against its own population – against women, against children – and not for the first time. Different types of chemicals have already been used 73 times, so all you can say about the Assad regime is that it is genocidal and no longer has any legitimacy. I never agree with Donald Trump, but for once, when he tweeted that Assad is a monster, I agreed with him.  At the same time, we also have to be clear – and that has to be our second message – that precision attacks against civilian military facilities are not a strategy for peace and will not end in this. I have to tell you that I am also sad when I see the outcome of the Foreign Affairs Council of today: eleven pages with a very general condemnation and very general statements of principle. I do not think that we can continue like that. We need more than general condemnation. We need a real European strategy in this Syrian tragedy, and I think there are three key elements for such a strategy. The first is to engage all constructive forces in the region in a new initiative. This new initiative must be a roadmap to a new Syria that is democratic, that is neutral, and that is respectful of the different religions that are practised in that country. Finally, I also think that we need to launch new sanctions to increase the costs of those who behave irresponsibly, who violate agreed ceasefires, undermine peace efforts and use these criminal chemical weapons, as has happened in recent weeks. I do not think we can abandon Syria and leave it in the hands of Assad. It concerns our own security and that is the reason why we need to urge the Council to come forward with a consistent strategy towards Syria.

International law needs to be upheld and indeed Russia needs to finally give up its blockade at the UN institutions. All the suffering that we’ve seen for so many years in Syria needs to end. It has lasted way too long. I believe many opportunities have also been missed in the past to find, or at least to have the opportunity to find, a solution. The international community and especially the European Union must do more to stop this war and must develop a political strategy, because air strikes will not end this war. A solution can only be political and diplomatic. It cannot be made by weapons and I think it’s really important that we indeed speak more with one European voice, because if we speak with one voice, we have much more weight behind us. We are much stronger if we speak with one voice and not if we speak with 28 different voices.

My group, and I too, will not be in line with this account of what happened last weekend — the military attack — the military attack. We too condemn the use of chemical weapons and we are in favour of its being obladed that no chemical weapons exist anywhere in the world. And it is precisely in Europe, where chemical weapons were first used in the last century, that we are very sensitive to this. We believe that the use of chemical weapons is a breach of international law, an international law crime, and that must be punished. For this, however, there are political, diplomatic, international bodies, institutions, obligations and agreements. And if — if — one really wants to achieve something, then every effort must be done to get Russia on the side of those who are clearly and clearly opposed to this use of chemical weapons here. I think it's insane to send missiles, allegedly organizing targeted blows! No one has ever explained to us to some extent what has really been destroyed, and I also assume that these blows will not facilitate the political, diplomatic solution. I have never seen in the last two or three years, or in this legislature, how much the deployment has been downplayed through the media, but above all through governments — it was only a targeted effort. It was played with fire! And I do not understand at all that heads of government of the European Union seriously believe that we should stand next to Trump to discuss with him the use of missiles, weapons at all — one who says this today and pushes the other button tomorrow. That cannot be the EU's role! We need to make sure — and I mean one voice — that we say clearly: no, we are not playing Trump's game or Assad's game, but not Putin's. We're not playing for either of the two or the three. We are an independent organization, political power in the world, focusing primarily on de-escalation, diplomacy and strengthening the UN. What happened this weekend is also that the UN Secretary-General has been embarrassed by the fact that he has been presented with facts that have rendered all his commitment null and void. I believe that we should also live up to this responsibility. Incidentally, when you say that the Heads of Government are concerned: above all, people are concerned.

These acts of war were decided unilaterally, without any UN mandate, in total violation of the rules of international law and without even the slightest discussion either within the framework of the United Nations or within the framework of national parliaments. Emmanuel Macron justified these strikes by the alleged use of chemical weapons by the Bashar al-Assad regime against civilian populations. Let us be clear: if chlorine weapons were used, this would of course constitute an ignominy to condemn without any reservation. But at this stage, no shadow of an early evidence has been brought in support of these accusations. It would have been normal to allow the investigation to take place since the OPCW experts had to go there on Saturday. Those who speak of red lines today are nevertheless very discreet when it comes to, for example, the massacres of Yemeni populations by the Saudi regime. Moreover, one can legitimately wonder: what would have been the interest of the Syrian government to use such weapons when, thanks in particular to the decisive action of Russia, 95% of the Syrian territory is now liberated from the yoke of the Islamic State and the Islamist factions that occupied Eastern Ghouta are now completely destroyed? Whatever the Syrian regime might think, this intervention has no real military effectiveness. Tens of millions of euros were spent on an hour of fireworks. There is no strategic interest in this costly operation either. Is it probably a communication action, perhaps an attempt to get back into the game and be able to sit down at the negotiating table? Let's not forget that this is our blindly dogmatic for several years that has excluded us from it. But just like the past Western military actions against Saddam Hussein's Iraq or Gaddafi's Libya have led to strengthening Islamists and sowing war first and then chaos, these strikes against Syria do not correspond to the interests of European nations or the interests of the Syrian people. Indeed, the countries of Europe must ensure that this part of the globe, which is in the immediate vicinity of our continent, is stabilized. In Syria, any weakening of the Damascus regime will allow Islamists to prosper, especially those supported by Saudi Arabia.

I hope that the attack carried out will be the last and that the intelligence and desire to dialogue prevail on the part of all, starting with the great powers that have great responsibilities, but also the powers locals — Iran, Turkey, Saudi Arabia — must do their part to help pacify a territory that has suffered for too many years.

The practical implementation of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change is at stake. By designing all three pillars, we have filled this with life. With the agreement on burden-sharing and ambitious LULUCF regulation, we have now put European climate policy into concrete terms. I thank my colleague, Mr Gerbrandy, for the good cooperation. However, while the burden sharing focuses on CO2 reduction targets, LULUCF is concerned with the positive contribution of agriculture and forestry to combating climate change. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to present to you today the trilogue result: what has we achieved in concrete terms? We have achieved that there are serious and robust accounting rules for CO2 uptake and levy. Parliament has worked to strike a balance between flexibility and comparable accounting rules for the 28 Member States. And the question arises: what does such a balance look like? I am convinced that we have managed to strengthen the bioeconomy — that is, timber for housing, furniture and bioenergy — but at the same time we have found a benchmark that can be used to measure the impact on the climate, called the reference value for forests. It is important to me personally to stress that the targets are addressed to the Member States directly and not to forest owners. This is the only way to enable active and sustainable forest management. At the same time, this is good for the forest, for the climate and, last but not least, for the forestry. Due to far-sighted and responsible management, our forests have grown over the past 25 years by an area as large as Portugal — that is nine million hectares. another Success is the integration of wetlands managed into the Member States by 2026 at the latest. This can be seen above all by taking into account the enormous amounts of CO2 that are stored there. Just as the Council has met us with regard to wetlands, we had to agree to the compromise on the so-called compensation mechanisms and the reference value for forests. I would have liked to see the reference value of 2000-2012, which would have given Member States even more flexibility in their harvest rates without weakening the climate balance. At the same time, flexible forest management means active and sustainable use, which opens up even more storage potential. In spite of everything, ladies and gentlemen, I am convinced that we reached a balanced and ambitious compromise in the trilogue. In the LULUCF area, there is no reduction potential but, on the contrary, enormous potential to combat climate change. Overall, our forests account for around 10% of total EU emissions. This performance is absolutely positive, great and needs to be strengthened accordingly. With this legislation, we are sending a signal: we want our forests in Europe to continue to be managed in a sustainable and far-sighted manner, and we want this to be valued.

I would really like to emphasise that even those who were not strong supporters of Parliament’s mandate were still very, very supportive, defending that mandate during the quite difficult, trilogue, so many thanks again for that. I would also like, despite the absence of the Council here, to thank the Estonian Presidency for the work they have done, but their absence might say enough at this moment. I am standing here with quite mixed feelings. This morning, before I came to Strasbourg, I again checked the so-called carbon clock, and the carbon clock indicates how much time we still have left with current CO2 emissions in order to stay within the Paris Agreement. We all so strongly supported the Paris Agreement and, to refresh your memories, the Paris Agreement also tries to stay within the 1.5 degrees scenario. For the 1.5 degrees scenario, the time we have left in the medium estimate – so that is not the most extreme – with current CO2 emissions is four months and 22 days. Four months and 22 days! So it is obviously clear that we need an extreme sense of urgency to stay within that scenario, and it’s clear that during the negotiations with the Council, the Member States have not shown that sense of urgency. On the contrary, it was extremely difficult, extremely difficult, to get the Council moving, and even the arguments that we used from Parliament’s side, that with the energy efficiency, a proposal from the Commission of 30% instead of the 27%, and with the upcoming facilitative dialogue in the UN process, it was absolutely necessary to increase ambition, their answer was very stubborn and that was a clear ‘no’. Some Member States even argued that given the fact that because of those developments, the ambition might increase in the coming one or two years, they wanted to stay on the lower side by concluding this act of law, which is quite scandalous. So if you ask me if I am satisfied with the final result we agreed, I’m afraid my answer is no, but it was the maximum that we could get out of the Council and I think it would have been irresponsible if we had not tried to find an agreement there. But still, I am not satisfied. Nevertheless Parliament did achieve quite some improvements in this Climate Action Regulation because now we finally got rid of that awful name of ‘Effort Sharing Regulation’, from now on we can call it clearly the Climate Action Regulation. Parliament fought hard to get an additional 125 million tonnes of ambition and I am proud of that, and we did tighten the trajectory. Member States cannot sit back during the first few years when it kicks in from 2020 onwards. And, very important, there is a strong reference to the long-term climate strategy that the EU and the individual Member States must develop, and the European Council recently confirmed that by asking the Commission to come forward with proposals. So we might now finally get rid of the October 2014 conclusions. We also came to a strict review clause, and that one is extremely important, also in light of what the Commission can do in the coming year with the Talanoa Dialogue and the long-term strategy. I am convinced that this is only the start and that with increased stringency in the coming years we might tighten it up.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 26, "date": "2018-04-16.json", "name": "Miguel ARIAS CAÑETE", "mepid": "1351", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, I am glad we are meeting today to finalise the adoption of two key files to achieve our 2030 climate target. Bold regulations are essential elements of our legal framework for implementing the European Union’s 2030 commitments under the Paris Agreement. They show our international partners that the European Union is leading by example, because we turn our pledges into agreed action and we are on track on a long-term low emissions pathway. This week a step forward has been possible due to the constructive efforts of the negotiators from both institutions. In particular, I would like to wholeheartedly thank the rapporteurs Mr Gerbrandy and Mr Lins for their leadership on these challenging files and congratulate them on the result. We have been able to come to an ambitious and realistic agreement within three months. Let me now highlight some specific elements of each of the two laws, starting with the Effort Sharing Regulation, or Climate Action Regulation. This regulation is a crucial instrument to accelerate the low—carbon transition in a number of key sectors of the economy, such as transport, buildings, agriculture and industry, not covered by the emissions trading system. It notably sets binding national targets covering well over half of the European Union’s domestic greenhouse gas emissions in order to achieve a European Union-wide reduction by 30% in 2030 compared to 2005. The trilogue agreement, which strikes a good balance between environmental integrity, fairness and efficiency, is the result of a thorough negotiation process that involved difficult compromises. The support and steering by the rapporteur Mr Gerbrandy, as well as the active engagement of the shadow rapporteurs Ms Ayuso, Ms Dalli, Mr Duncan and Ms Girling, Ms Konečná, Mr Eickhout, Ms Evi and Mr Jalkh, was crucial in this regard, and I particularly appreciate Parliament’s crucial role in ensuring an ambitious outcome. Parliament insisted on an early starting date for the emissions reduction trajectory. This saves more than 120 million tonnes of emissions over the period 2021-2030, hence it increases the additional effort by more than 10%. Other examples where Parliament left a good mark include the introduction of banking limits, the way the ETS flexibility is accounted for with reference to the ETS market stability reserve, stronger provisions on corrective action, a further substantiated review clause including reference to the manner in which all sectors of the economy contribute in the post-2030 framework and the LULUCF flexibility with the inclusion of wetlands, and making their use conditional on annual Member State reporting on their intended use. Let me move to the LULUCF Regulation. The LULUCF Regulation sets for the first time a clear quantitative objective, together with a solid accounting framework, for emissions and removals from land use and forests. Once again, this demonstrates to our international partners how the European Union tries to lead by example. The contribution from land and forest in reaching the long-term climate mitigation objectives is critical because of the potential for anthropogenic removal of carbon from the atmosphere. Forests alone currently cover more than 42% of the European Union land surface. They have huge potential for climate change mitigation through regional sequestration and storage of CO2. They also have the potential to substitute fossil—based energy materials. I am convinced that the LULUCF Agreement strikes a proper balance between conflicting interests, and as it was for effort-sharing, the trilogue agreement on this file involves some difficult compromises. The support and active engagement of the rapporteur Mr Lins, but also of the shadow rapporteurs Mr Brannen, Mr Turmes, Mr Flanagan, Mr Jávor and Ms Wiśniewska, was crucial in this regard. The European Parliament has strongly contributed to the final shape of the legal text. The agreed provisions of the regulation clearly carry the European Parliament’s signature, and I would like to offer some examples: mandatory accounting for emissions and the removal of wetlands towards the commitment of 2026, thus completing the European Union’s scope for land accounting; the introduction of a safeguard to prevent decreasing the European Union’s overall sink; obliging the Commission to assess, at the review, the need for additional Union policies and measures, and this includes exploring a post—2030 framework in view of the necessary strengthening of greenhouse gas emissions reductions and removals in the Union. Parliament’s hand can also be seen in a core article of the regulation on forest accounting. Indeed, the rules and governance process for establishing forest reference levels were clarified, taking into account the main requests of Parliament. First, the accounting rules were not locked in the harvest rates of the past and this should reassure forest-rich Member States and the related industry. Second, the forest reference level presented by Member States through national plans will be adopted by delegated act. This will ensure the highest degree of involvement of Parliament in setting these benchmarks. And thirdly, reflecting on the European Parliament’s priorities, this regulation gives more prominence to long-lived harvested products. More wood products create positive incentives not only for the climate, but also for jobs and the economy. Finally, keeping deadwood in forests will have environmental benefits such as for biodiversity. This shows the kind of balance that exemplifies the positive spirit of the negotiation. I invite you to support both motions and put Europe on track to take its place as a champion of climate policy and to lay out our vision for the way this policy will implement the Paris Agreement over the next decade.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 4, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 27, "date": "2018-04-16.json", "name": "Florent MARCELLESI", "mepid": "26146", "text": " draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Development. — Mr President, climate change is a question of global justice.

This Regulation will cover various measures to be implemented by Member States, such as improving forest and agricultural management, replacing less efficient boilers in buildings, reducing waste disposal in landfills and promoting cleaner transport technologies. But the Member States have social, environmental, energy and industrial challenges, and it is therefore a good thing that we have agreed to give countries different flexibilities in meeting the emission targets.

Greece a sharp increase in the appearance of dust clouds from the Sahara causing health problems for citizens, since concentrations of dangerous heavy metals such as lead, zinc and arsenic have been identified in them. There is also a dramatic increase in forest fires due to the rise in temperature, which in turn contribute to the destruction of large forest and arable areas. Having said all of the above, I would like to highlight one thing that I think we should pay particular attention to: we should not impose disproportionately large restrictions on European farmers because all we will achieve in this way is to reduce the European agricultural production, while at the same time importing cheaper agricultural products from countries with much worse environmental standards.

Wetlands, including peatlands, can absorb staggeringly high amounts of carbon. For instance, there is more CO2 stored in the peatlands of northern England than in all of the forests of the United Kingdom, France and Germany together. Wetlands, including peatlands, will be included mandatorily in the LULUCF accounting as of 2026, which was not in the Commission’s or the Council’s proposals and as such it is a win for the Parliament. The LULUCF proposals also recognise the role of long-life harvested wood products and deadwood, both of which have the potential for storing carbon for long enough to be relevant for our climate action. Increasing the range of products to which harvested wood goes, including long-life engineered construction timbers, such as cross-laminated timber and laminated veneer lumber, can help countries improve their climate action.

I think that together we can be proud of the result of our joint effort to agree on the legal framework for the next decade for the sectors not covered by the European Union Emissions Trading System.  We all know about the scale of efforts needed to reach our long—term climate targets and some contributors to the debate have pointed to that. Specifically Ms Dali pointed to the lack of ambition of the efforts set in the proposal for a regulation,saying that these are too low and that this does not put the European Union on track towards the necessary long—term emission reductions.  I will make two comments. First, that the ambition level increase is significant because a modified trajectory – a starting date as assured by the European Parliament of seven months earlier – saves more than 120 million tonnes of emissions over the period 2021—2030 and hence increases the additional effort needed, compared to the initial proposal, by more than ten percent.  My second remark is that, in order to address the long—term issues that have been pointed out, the Commission will address them in the context of developing the European Union Mid—Century Strategy. We intend to deliver the Commission’s input in November this year. It is very clear that, if the European Union’s Mid—Century Strategy or the global stocktake after the Paris Agreement lead to changes in European Union emission reduction targets, the review clause caters for the corresponding need to adapt the efforts set out in the regulation. So this is not a closed effort. It is an open matter that we will have to discuss in the framework of the future reflection that the Commission has to do on the long—term trajectories. But, coming back to the issue of the two regulations on effort sharing and LULUCF, today I invite you to lend your support to them in tomorrow’s vote. I think it is very important to ensure that they can enter swiftly into force and that the necessary provisions can be in place by January 2021, because there is no time to lose in our fight against climate change.

I would also like to thank my fellow Members who have made it clear that there is multifunctionality in forests and agriculture, in other words that ideology is out of place here, but that all areas of society must be taken into account: both the forest as a supplier of timber products, the country as a supplier to the Food production, but also the enormous contribution, the enormous potential of CO2 savings, and that we can achieve everything — including a higher sink effect, while at the same time providing wood and also ensuring food production in Europe.

I do not support opening and increasing the Union contribution, in the form of national contributions, up to 40% in 2030.

In 2015, when the Commission resubmitted the package after initially withdrawing it, I must admit that the premises were not the best but in recent years significant progress has been made. The circular economy has become one of the priorities of the European Union, a priority for co-legislators, a priority for our companies who immediately understood its potential but, above all, one priority for citizens. Europe has been able to show its positive side, to put together national interests, on opposing paper, to achieve a high degree of sharing on a life goal daily citizens and the environment in which they live. For this reason I do not deny you satisfaction with the result we managed to bring home. With this package, Europe is decisively aiming for sustainable economic and social development, able to finally integrate industrial policies and environmental protection. The circular economy, in fact, is not only a policy of waste management, but it is a way to recover raw materials and not to press the already scarce resources of our planet, even by innovating deeply our production system. Certainly, the package we are going to approve also contains important measures on waste management and, at the same time, goes beyond these, defining rules that take into account the whole cycle of life of a product and set themselves the goal of changing the behavior of companies and consumers. For the first time Member States will be obliged to follow a unique and shared legislative framework. An ambitious plan, with clear and unequivocal stakes. Only to summarize the main innovations introduced: the raising of municipal and packaging waste recycling targets; the inclusion, for the first time, of a maximum landfill limit of 10%; the extension of separate collection obligations to hazardous organic, textile and domestic waste; but I cannot fail remember the inclusion, here for the first time in European legislation, of compulsory measures to reduce the abhorrent phenomenon of food waste, an environmental but also ethical problem, as well as actions aimed at countering the pollution of the seas from waste. Important rules have been put in place to prevent waste generation: this is not only because prevention is the first level of the waste hierarchy but because preventing means making products which already by their design are repairable and reusable and means having production cycles that use resources efficiently, reduce waste or reuse them for new production. And finally preventing means introducing business models that go from selling a product to sharing a service. The circular economy is therefore a total paradigm shift, with which we must confront all of us and is a challenge for the States, which are asked ambitious goals to foster the transition to a new development model. When you get a job done like this, it means that there has been the contribution of so many. Let me then, in the seconds I have left, to thank mainly the shadow speakers and their assistants for the active collaboration that has always been demonstrated, which was the added value for bringing home the result relatively quickly. A special thanks to Dr. Marco Leonardi for all the precise and painstaking work on the file. Thank you to Vice-Presidents Timmermans and Katainen, Commissioner Vella and DG ENVI, in the person of Director-General Crespo, for their competence and continued support to arrive at the final result.

We rarely have any tools that can push Europe forward; a few days we have as today to talk about future projects we want for our Union. We remain an area of peace, even if we sometimes forget it, and we remain a space of prosperity, which has been diminished in recent years; and we remain the world region with the greatest social justice, although we must remain more ambitious. For too many years, some of the European values of solidarity, fraternity justice, freedom... have been diluted by other objectives; but, above all, the collective political will to build a community in which we all recognize ourselves in our diversity has been diluted by more particular, more selfish, more egoistic objectives extremists: we only seek to delve into a division of Europe never seen since the end of World War II. However, too often the debates we have in our House are far from what is perceived on the street. What do the media say about this Europe which is moving away from the integrative idea of our founding fathers? Europeanist sentiment does not go beyond the Brussels bubble. It's been too long since we stopped looking for what unites us to defend what separates us. We've lost our perspective from our ivory towers. That is why, in today's debate, I would like to stress that the circular economy can and should be a circle for relaunching the European project of our founding fathers. I would like to draw the Commission's attention so that it does not miss the opportunity to turn this project into a new 'Schuman Declaration'. The transition to the circular economy is to choose the path of leadership in the world and abandon the path of reaction. We must continue to exercise this leadership in the fight against climate change, as we committed ourselves at COP21. A struggle that has the support of European society. These targets are committed to the reindustrialisation of Europe with a low emission industry. This is an achievable project that has a direct impact on the creation of quality and decently paid jobs. Without jobs, any project will end up being an orphan of social support. Only by creating new jobs will we be able to carry out this change project; only with a cutting-edge and smart yet sustainable economy will we offer a present and a future to our society. Let us, Europeans, make the circular economy into our future in the twenty-first century what the ECSC went to the construction of the European Union in the twentieth century. Next Wednesday we will adopt this first package with the Waste, Packaging, Landfills and Batteries and Accumulators Directives for which Mrs Bonafè has been rapporteur. My report on environmental information is a small contribution to paving the way to the circular economy so that we can make this transition to a new economy more agile and easier for our citizens, our economy and our common project. And Mrs Bonafè's reports, as well as all the work of the shadow rapporteurs and all the people she has detailed in her speech, are the crucial first stone of this new path Europe must take. Our citizenship is demanding it from us.

The new EU waste legislation that we are discussing here this evening will help to prevent waste and will turn much more waste into valuable resources. I trust that this House will vote clearly in favour of the adoption of the package on Wednesday. In doing so, you would give a great push to further improving waste management in Europe, in line with our circular economy goals. This will unlock new sources of growth and innovation, create jobs and reduce our dependence on imports of critical raw materials and our reliance on waste treatment abroad, and it will of course help to protect our environment and thus the health of our citizens. I do know that this House had its doubts when this Commission in December 2014 withdrew previous proposals on waste. We did it to pursue more ambitious, better designed goals that would get the approval of Member States and would be actually enforced on the ground. I would like to express my profound gratitude to the rapporteur, Ms Simona Bonafè, all the shadow rapporteurs as well as all the other Members of the European Parliament and staff members involved for their relentless and constructive work on the Commission’s new proposals over the past two years. And I do agree with the much broader framework Mr Gambús has just given us of why we are doing this. Without your vision and support, we would not have achieved the very good result we have on the table today or indeed overcome the stalemate that the pre-2014 proposals had engendered. Thanks to your support, the ambitious recycling and landfill reduction targets proposed by the Commission were generally kept, even though Member States may take some more years to attain them. Parliament’s support was also crucial to agree on strong new rules on waste prevention, including food waste and marine litter, and you also helped to secure strong new rules on extended producer responsibility, the management of hazardous wastes and bio-waste, and the separate collection of waste. Finally, you also pushed very hard for an ambitious waste policy agenda during the coming years. This agenda encompasses and reviews the many different pieces of existing EU legislation, ranging from reusability and recyclability of packaging waste, end-of-life vehicles, waste oils, food waste and waste disposal operations, as well as recycling targets for waste other than municipal and packaging waste. Not all of Parliament’s amendments found their way into the final text. I am aware, for instance, that you would have wanted to see an even stricter harmonisation of the calculation rules for recycling. Unfortunately, the Council could not agree on a single measurement point, yet the new legislation still marks a major step forward by ensuring that only waste that enters recycling will be reported under the targets. Over the next years, the Commission will closely monitor the implementation of these new calculation rules to ensure that only input to recycling is reported. If appropriate, the Commission will consider if further harmonisation and calculating recycling targets is feasible. I should finally mention that among the Commission declarations that accompany the package are four declarations responding to points that were particularly important to this House: first, on the policy framework for the circular economy; second, on the collaborative economy; third on microplastics; and fourth, on the reporting of waste data in 2020. Our shared task now is to ensure that the promises enshrined in this Waste Package are actually delivered on the ground. This requires Member States to urgently step up action, building on the progress that many of them are already making to meet existing obligations. Local and regional administrations and businesses will also have a key role to play. Your support in keeping up the pressure for full and effective implementation will be essential. The Commission will continue to support Member States in making the best use of available instruments in terms of new legislation, economic instruments and financial support. We will also provide guidance as requested on many new key provisions, for instance on how to modulate producer fees under extended producer responsibility schemes to promote more circular products. Before concluding, I would like to very briefly touch on the other file in this joint debate – the Standard Reporting Directive. Repealing the existing directive is an important first step towards further administrative simplification and higher levels of legal certainty. The Commission has actively pursued the follow-up to the fitness check on streamlining environmental reporting which aims at increasing transparency, optimising the use of IT tools and reducing the administrative burden for all stakeholders. Before the end of May, we will present a legislative proposal to amend the reporting requirements in a number of environmental directives and regulations modelled on the proposals for the revision of the Drinking Water Directive which you are currently discussing. I believe that there is every opportunity to reach an agreement at first reading on this proposal too, so that the benefits can be delivered already in 2019, before the end of this legislature, and we have something to show for ourselves when we head for elections.

This is the cornerstone we have to deal with for our children and the next economic generations, and for this we need harmonised definitions. This was mixed up in Europe. We need clear calculation methods. We are a number further, Mr. Vice President, as you suspected. So we have more or less a calculation method now, and the targets for recycling targets are already very significant. Good countries, which are already a little further on this issue, also say: that is all we can do at the moment. And the harmonisation of standards in recycling is particularly important, as it went down and above. So there have always been great differences between Germany and Austria and there were also annoyances for the middle class. Ultimately, we also want to make industry competitive. After all, competitiveness and sustainability is a medal. And this medal is just meant to strengthen us in a resource-poor continent — that's us, raw materials are scarce.

For me, it confirms once again that creating a circular economy is one of the big challenges of our time. But it is also offers us huge opportunities, especially in the environmental, economic and social sectors. We urgently need to make more durable and recyclable products and, at the end of the cycle, use waste as a resource and channel it back into the economy. Taking a sustainable path requires multiple changes, of a technological, organisational, financial, social and also educational nature. The road ahead may seem daunting but we can make the transformation happen. Embracing the circular economy offers significant opportunities as it will unleash new sources of innovation, growth, employment and well-being. It is for all these reasons that the European Commission and the European Union at large have made the circular economy a key political priority and that we are implementing an ambitious plan with far-reaching initiatives. A central plan of action involving taking waste legislation in the European Union to the next level with ambitious, legally binding landfill reduction and recycling targets for the period up to 2035 alongside targeted waste prevention measures. It is encouraging to see that over the past two decades many Member States have gradually improved their waste management in line with the EU waste hierarchy. In 1995, on average 64% of our waste was still landfilled. In 2000, the average had been reduced to 55%, while the average recycling rate stood at 25%. Fifteen years later, in 2015, landfilling of household waste in the EU as a whole had dropped to 25% with recycling having increased to 45%. Yet, challenges and big differences between EU countries remain. We are not closing the loop yet. In 2015, twelve Member States still landfilled over 50% of their household waste and six of them incinerated 40% or more. Regarding the concern expressed by Ms Wiśniewska, I would like to clarify that Poland can get a five-year derogation for recycling and landfilling targets, so maybe she can reconsider your position and vote in favour instead of abstaining. With regards to Mr Pedicini’s comment that we missed a crucial chance to set legally binding targets for other waste streams like food waste, marine litter, the reuse of packaging and so on, the new waste legislation foresees a large number of review clauses asking the Commission to assess the feasibility to set such targets in the next years. More and bold action is still very much needed. The new waste legislation that we hope you will approve later this week, will provide fresh impetus to this area. The Commission will do all it can to make the new legislation deliver on the ground. I cannot conclude without thanking the rapporteur, Ms Simona Bonafè. I would also like to take the opportunity to thank the shadow rapporteurs as well as all the other MEPs for their commitment, contribution and support to this dossier. As Ms Engström said, we have reason to celebrate but let us not forget that this is not the end of the road. It is the beginning of our walk. Let’s continue working together as we have done so far.

If fully applied, it would make considerable improvements in the environment, health and quality of life. As we approach the end of the current programme, we need to assess how well it has been implemented and what changes would be needed for a future programme. I want to thank the hundreds of stakeholder representatives who have contributed views to this evaluation process. Many positively evaluated the program. The benefits to citizens and the environment, the shaping of a long-term vision and strategic orientation for decision-makers have been recognised. However, there is a huge gap between the expectations of this programme and the concrete results it produces. Progress has been made in some areas. In terms of resource efficiency and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, European Union legislation has a positive impact and clear progress is being made towards a more resource-efficient economy. In other areas, however, implementation is very weak. The European Union's natural capital is deteriorating, with devastating effects on the environment and services provided by ecosystems such as water, air or food. Environmental health threats are sometimes difficult to measure and we do not have sufficient data. In other cases, however, evidence is not missing. For example, it is clear that constantly high emissions from road transport force millions of people to breathe polluted air. The problem often lies in the fact that Member States do not meet the basic standards laid down by regulations such as the Birds or Habitats Directive or air quality legislation. EU policies are not always compatible with each other or complementary to national priorities. Better adaptation The implementation of agricultural policies to environmental objectives is essential, both for the protection of the environment and for the future security of food resources. Food security and environmental protection are not opposing priorities. Progress in nature conservation and biodiversity could be much greater if existing funds had been used more wisely. The European Court of Auditors identified several cases of inefficient use of European funds in projects with an impact on environmental objectives. Both the Commission and the Member States can support the better use of funds to bring results. At regional and municipal level, urban planning is vital to solving many resource efficiency and environmental health threats. That's why it's surprising that the section of the programme that deals with cities is criticized by stakeholders for not defining clear goals. At the municipal level, virtually many of the measures that ensure the achievement of the objectives is applied. That is why the municipal authorities need clarity on the results they are required and they need financial and political means to implement these solutions. Colleagues, time does not allow me to mention all the aspects that I have highlighted in my report, but I would like to thank all of you for the substantial contributions and the efforts made by all parties to adopt a compromise text. Our work shows that a broad political agreement can be reached on problems, but also on solutions.

This initiative is well timed and contains several useful recommendations, which we will look into carefully, as the Commission is also working on its own evaluation. Your report points to specific areas for improvement. Land and soil degradation and, more broadly, the sustainability of agriculture and of our mobility are among the areas in which a lot still needs to be done. It is, however, fair to say that overall there has been good progress and we are working to meet our goals to protect our climate and pave the way for a low-carbon and circular economy. The Circular Economy Package, including our new waste legislation and the Commission’s plastics strategy, will help us on our way to decoupling economic growth from environmental pressures, including carbon emissions. We will continue to deliver on this, for example by delivering a proposal on single—use plastics before the end of May, in addition to a legislative proposal for water reuse in agricultural irrigation. The European Union is also well on track to meet its climate and energy targets for 2020. We expect emissions to reduce by more than 20% by 2020, taking the first steps that put the EU towards a transformation to a low-carbon economy, as stated in the 7th EAP. As part of a global effort to limit the average temperature increase to well below two degrees centigrade compared to pre-industrial levels, we are also working towards reducing by 2050 greenhouse gas emissions by 80% to 95%, compared to 1990 levels. Under the Paris Agreement, the EU has pledged to reduce emissions by at least 40% domestically by 2030 compared to 1990. We have taken key steps on putting in place the legislative framework on how to get there. I can mention here the EU emissions trading system (ETS) revision for after 2020, the targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at Member State-level in sectors other than ETS and the regulation of absorptions and emissions in the land sectors. You discussed the last two earlier this evening with my colleague, Commissioner Arias Cañete. In terms of quality of life and a healthy environment for our citizens, we have worked hard together to protect people’s health from exposure to harmful pollutants. In 2016, the revised National Emission Ceilings Directive set ambitious 2020 and 2030 emission reduction commitments for five main air pollutants, including particulate matter. We ratified the Minamata Convention to protect our citizens from the emission and release of mercury. We have reviewed our flagship chemical legislation ‘REACH’ and are checking whether the broader chemicals acquis is still fit for purpose. These are all important steps towards a non-toxic environment. We have also made progress on the so-called enabling framework, with specific initiatives to close gaps relating to knowledge, financing and implementation. The Environment Implementation Review (EIR) and the environmental compliance action plan will help to make this happen, not against but together with the Member States in all areas, including our fight against air pollution. Our nature action plan to improve the implementation of the Birds and Habitats Directives is an important step forward in strengthening the conservation of biodiversity, complementing the Invasive Alien Species Regulation, which is tackling an important driver of biodiversity loss in the EU. But 2020 is around the corner and we need to do more to achieve our biodiversity targets. A major challenge is the alarming decline of pollinators. This requires urgent and decisive action, and we will respond soon with an initiative to address this problem in line with what this Parliament has called for. The Commission’s recently adopted action plan for sustainable finance will make Europe a frontrunner in shifting trillions of euros towards those investments needed to build a sustainable economy. I welcome your strong support for an ambitious environmental agenda. We need to successfully address environmental challenges to meet the Sustainable Development Goals.

We know it from our car windows, which suddenly no longer have to have special washing, since there are no insects! It's gone rampant beyond the birds, but it goes beyond life! And biodiversity itself is at the heart of our all of the lives of the same. It has tremendous value to the climate too.

Thus, the Commission could now demonstrate how seriously it takes the environmental objectives. We can't wait to see whether it will propose incentives for higher environmental standards in agriculture, whether it intends to massively reduce pesticide use and will finally put a stop to the excessive use of antibiotics in factory farming.

In essence, we still face a framework of inconsistency between the objectives proclaimed in the field of the environment and the content of the relevant sectoral policies, from agricultural policy to trade policy, among others.

Your report on the 7th EAP, rightly pointed out some shortcomings in these current practices. I fully agree with the need for better policy coherence and increased integration of environmental objectives into other policies. Mr Marias referred to pesticide residues in imported feed. This is, as you understand, not my area, but there are standards in place which apply to imports to ensure the health of EU citizens. The next steps in these debates are the upcoming Multiannual Financial Framework and the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). I can assure you that there is strong recognition of the importance of environmental mainstreaming, and I am working closely with my colleagues in the College to ensure that environmental and climate-related challenges are duly reflected in our proposals. This is particularly important for the Common Agricultural Policy, which needs to do more for water, nature and biodiversity. In its current form, the policy is not delivering as expected, despite the significant funding dedicated to greening. This has also been confirmed by the European Court of Auditors, so I am pressing strongly to rectify this in the context of our upcoming proposals.

I have worked on this report with my colleagues in the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, for whom I would like to thank. The European Parliament is well aware of the enormous influence of the media on society. It is for this reason that our interest arises in their operation. We are convinced that women's voices should be heard more clearly in all areas, including in the media. I am convinced that the media and society deserve greater influence on the part of women. Women are as good as men. They account for 68% of journalism graduates and 40% of employees in the media sector, but the wage gap between men and women is 17%. Women are much less cited as experts, about 18%. According to the study, only 20% of films are directed by women. The main problem is the representation of women in the media in leadership positions (33%). Such a disproportion has an impact on content, media orientation and organizational culture. Internal culture is often unfavourable to reconciliation between work and private life. It is a competitive environment characterized by stress and inflexible delays. So if we want to support and encourage women, we need to change their working conditions. Union legislation establishes a framework for the operation of audiovisual services and provisions guaranteeing equal employment opportunities and protection against discrimination, harassment and sexual violence. But there are many other aspects that are outside the legislative scope. We consider that the solution goes through a stake rigorous implementation of existing legislation. We are not proposing any new regulations. We call on Member States and stakeholders in the sector to implement positive measures to ensure that women are more equitably represented, and to introduce quotas where possible and necessary. The EU Directive on Women on Boards' shows us a way forward and criteria to be met, and explains how to monitor balance, support and promote training for professionals in the sector, share examples of good practice (e.g., the repertoires of female experts such as Expertalia in Belgium or campaigns against sexist advertising such as the price of sexist pig in the Czech Republic), and introduce measures to reconcile private and professional life. Our report deplores sexism and the abundance of cases of sexual harassment in the media. The European Parliament proposal broadens the scope of this ban to include video-on-demand and video-sharing platforms. Our job, our activity, is to ensure that women are better represented in the media and treated with respect. Once again, I would like to thank all my staff for their work, hoping that it will be followed by effects.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "aws", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 127, "date": "2018-04-16.json", "name": "Agnieszka KOZŁOWSKA", "mepid": "124889", "text": " author. — Madam President! Commissioner! Digitisation, the internet, automation and robotisation are phenomena that have diametrically changed and continue to change both the job market and the daily lives of us all. The way of communication changes, the content of the professions performed, the mobility of many professions increases, access to services, the flexibility of the organization of work. This digital revolution creates new work opportunities for women too, but also new opportunities to reconcile work with family life. It gives hope to reduce the disparity in the treatment of women and men. According to the Commission's projections, the European digital economy requires advanced and very special skills, which at this point are more readily available to men than to women. Here I am referring to the gender-related digital gap, which brings in effect lower female participation in sectors that require digital skills. These differences — sometimes several, sometimes several dozen percentages — materially affect opportunities for women to realize the potential and their participation in high-paying professions and developing sectors of the economy. Only 9% of programmers are female, only 19% of senior managers in ICT and in communications are female, compared with 45% in other service sectors. This small participation of women in the fastest-growing and best-paid professions is a manifestation of sectoral segregation that occurs as a result of persistent gender stereotypes blocking appropriate education and career paths for girls and women gifted in the majors mathematical and natural. This is a great waste of talent that reduces women's quality of life but also brings real losses to the economy. It is estimated that an equal share of men and women in the sector would bring €9bn a year in EU GDP. This and related sectors are characterized by a huge and growing deficit of workers. It could be reduced by inclusion in the market educated in this direction women who, compared with men, are very strongly underrepresented. Digitisation and the internet also facilitate the establishment and flexible operation of micro-enterprises. This is very important especially for women who are mothers — which breeds time-organizational constraints — or for women who live away from urban centers, where the number of potential clients is small. The Internet opens up the market, reduces costs, makes it possible to sell products or services, even with much smaller infrastructure or financial facilities. It also allows remote operation and, through new means of communication, makes it easier to build strengthening professional expert networks. It's all very important. We also know that increasing the number of women in these high-paying, attractive sectors could help to reduce the pay and pension gap, because simply women would earn more. However, these potential benefits that we would experience or experience through the internet will happen provided that we remove barriers that block women's access to both high-tech professions themselves and to a fair path of advancement within these sectors and competitions. Commissioner! In order for the digitalisation benefites listed here to be harnessed to equality policies, we must also be aware of the risks. The internet facilitates hate speech and other forms of cyberbullying, including sexual violence, and working over the internet and mobility provided by new technologies can be a trap of perpetual dispatchability and a multiplied burden on women. Therefore, it is necessary that legal regulations that protect women from harmful gender stereotypes and violence also relate to analogous situations in the digital world, and work over the internet is properly billed with rules guaranteeing time for rest, leave and private life . It is also necessary to act in the sphere of education, so that girls are on equals with boys encouraged to take up science and nature subjects and that their educational paths lead to studies that give qualifications in the most attractive occupations. In this context, we welcome the actions taken by the Commission to promote the inclusion and participation of women in the information society. At the same time, we urge the Commission to prioritise the employment of women in ICT, the fight against gender stereotypes and the promotion of gender equality at all stages of education, including continuing education. I would also like to ask the Commissioner what actions are being taken by the Commission to resolve the issues presented here.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "aws", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 128, "date": "2018-04-16.json", "name": "Věra Jourová", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteurs, Ms Šojdrová and Ms Kozłowska-Rajewicz, as well as all the shadow rapporteurs for the excellent work with their reports. The report and the resolution we are discussing today are very relevant and very timely. Allow me also to excuse my colleague, Commissioner Maria Gabriel, who is not able to be here today but who made sure to follow your works and whose commitment towards promoting women’s participation and representation in the digital, media and audiovisual sectors is very strong. Mobilising women and encouraging them to work in the digital field and to specialise in ICT is a needed step. Women make up less than one in five ICT graduates in the EU and only 17% of the almost eight million people working in ICT are women. We need to boost the involvement of girls and women in digital technologies. That is why the Commission started a reflection process on how to take a more strategic approach on women in the digital field as part of the Commission digital education action plan and the new skills agenda. The strategy proposes three ways to attract girls and women to take up science, technology, engineering and mathematics studies and go into ICT-related areas. First, it aims at challenging the gender stereotypes and bias towards women that persist in society and in the digital economy as well. We need to highlight role-models and positive images of women in ICT. When it comes to the participation of women in media organisations or film-making, we can only agree with your report. Significant inequalities, including under-representation and career barriers remain entrenched in the media sector. This is something that the European Commission is attentive to through media pluralism monitoring, which shows that in the EU there are only a few women on public service media boards. These findings are in line with other data which show that, despite over-representation of women among graduates in journalism and information, and despite a high number of women working in the media sector in Europe, women remain under-represented in management positions in media. Only one third of the board members of public broadcasters across the EU are women and, like in other areas, women are heavily under-represented in top-level positions, accounting only for 22% of board presidents. A similar picture arises when we look at film-making. Only one in five films is directed by a woman, and the reason is not that there are no women directors. The proportion of female directors graduating from film schools and entering the film industry is 44%. That is why the Commission wants action in the field too. Working through the media programme on gender for 2018, we shall track gender equality in the projects we are going to fund. The second area of the strategy focuses on skills and education. We need to make digital skills training accessible and attractive for women. In this area, the Commission has, for example, launched the digital skills and jobs coalition which carried out a special call for concrete commitments by private companies and public institutions. In 2017, the Commission also awarded the European digital skills award, presented to projects that encourage girls and women to take up digital skills and careers. Moreover, the Commission supports EU Code Week, which had 1.2 million participants last year, of which 46% were girls or women. The third area of the strategy focuses on promoting digital entrepreneurship for women and lowering access barriers. The Commission has funded web hubs, the first European community that connects business ecosystems and provides them with mentoring tools to support women entrepreneurs in the digital sector. Every year, the EU prize for women innovators recognises outstanding women entrepreneurs and inspires others to follow in their footsteps. The Commission is acting on several fronts in the effort to boost gender equality and empowerment. You know of the initiatives launched in the past years: the gender pay gap action plan or the EU social pillar, with its work-life balance agenda. At the same time, I will try again over this year to unblock the situation in the Council as regards the women on boards directive. Another key priority is to end violence against women and girls. This is a particular challenge related to digitalisation – online violence and harassment against girls and women. We are working on several strands to prevent violence, protect and support victims. I am pushing for the swift accession of the EU to the Istanbul Convention, which will provide a clear framework for our actions in this area. Overall, the European Commission is very pleased that the European Parliament shares our vision about the place of women in media organisations as well as having in media a more diversified and realistic picture of the skills and potential of men and women in society.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 129, "date": "2018-04-16.json", "name": "Lynn BOYLAN", "mepid": "124984", "text": "  rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. – Madam President, I welcome this report and I thank the rapporteur for her work and for incorporating the employment opinion, of which I was rapporteur.  Women make up 68% of media and journalism graduates, yet less than 16% of the high—level strategic positions are occupied by women. This inevitably leads to a power imbalance, and this imbalance is exacerbated by the precarious nature of media work, leaving women more vulnerable to sexual harassment in the workplace. A recent international report found that 64.8% of female media workers have experienced intimidation or abuse, and almost 32% of that abuse was perpetrated by a male boss or co—worker. Media organisations need robust internal procedures to assist victims to speak out. To fundamentally reform the media sector, public and private media need to mainstream gender equality in all their content and avoid gender stereotypes and the sexual objectification of women.

You are right to point out that harassment and pornography on social networks pose a danger to women and girls. You are right to say that maternity is synonymous with discrimination in hiring, and you are also right to say that the principle of equal pay for equal work is still a fantasy today. But the sequel is much more confusing. Your approach to the media world seems to be based only on numbers. These statistics on women working in the media would allow you to say that they are discriminated against. Either! As usual, your only solution then seems to be quotas. Let me tell you one thing: quotas don't work. It is not because women make up 50% of employees in an area that they will not be equal to men. Equality is neither decreed nor measured by statistics. You have another solution: to change mindsets through the media. This is where the text becomes very disturbing for us. In your opinion, the media would not convey a good view of the world but gender stereotypes that would be insulting women. One can easily guess the professions or roles that this term “stereotype” hides: nurse, secretary, housekeeper or even worse, mother of a family. To read to you, none of these roles should be associated with women in media content — as if disreputing them, as if it was the cause of their misfortune. Your blind and driven willingness by some communitarian lobbies to absolutely want to make girls boys, and vice versa, becomes ridiculous. You finally forget the paramount point that should prevail over everything else: freedom of choice. In this area of media, such as in all other areas of society, we as members of parliament must bear one thing in mind: that of giving each individual the opportunity to freely choose the professional and personal path that they wish to follow.

The creative and cultural sector, which is historically seen as female—friendly and where women outnumber men across the sector as a whole, is a sector guilty of gender-based discrimination. However, pay gap is not the only issue. In a world of images and narratives, positive representation of women is key to combating prejudice and encourage necessary mind shifts. As a cultural activist and as a feminist, I see a link between the way women are represented in our society and consequential gender-based violence.

Let me add a few comments based on the discussion, to which I have listened very carefully. On digitalisation: we have a tendency to say that digitalisation is a great opportunity for society, and it must be an opportunity for women as well. This is a positive vision. I will add a negative view: if we do not support women and girls to get into the digital sphere as professionals, as experts, we will undertake a very serious risk because digitalisation has the potential to increase the gaps in society, and we have to actively work against this. That is why the Commission, as I described at the beginning, is undertaking a lot of steps and is funding a lot of projects to boost the potential of women and to encourage young girls to study the relevant subjects. This is the problem, in practice: I have many debates with the captains of the IT industry because, thanks to other parts of my portfolio, I am in very frequent contact with the managers of big IT companies, and I urge them to give more chances – at least equal opportunities – for women to get to higher positions and to get better jobs. They keep convincing me that women are not in the pipeline, but I always say that they do not have to be technicians or programmers or specialists for IT, for the technologies – they can be marketing experts; they can be lawyers employed in the IT sector. I think this is also a way to get women into this very promising and emerging sector and also, among other things, to get to higher positions and to the better paid jobs in order to decrease the pay gap, because I think we are working on several different things here. On media: we are witnessing a very worrying trend, because online hate speech and violence online is now more and more discouraging women journalists from doing their jobs. We have statistical figures that show that women are much higher victims and targets of online violence than men. Simply, the attackers recognise women as the weaker part of society, and that is why they are attacked more frequently. I have had many debates with the IT industry: we are urging the IT companies to delete hate speech against many groups of our society, including women. I am urging law enforcement authorities in all the Member States to react and to find the perpetrators, to find the attackers and to punish them, because online violence is a huge problem for the whole of society and is already very negatively affecting the freedom of work of journalists – especially women. We have to be better in this, because this is a very serious problem. Lastly, I want to explain my approach to the quota, which has been discussed here as well. My approach is that women must be guaranteed fair competition. I said many times that positive discrimination for me is not the option, but we have to ensure that there will be fair competition; if the candidates are equally qualified, if they have similar experience, I don’t see any reason why men should always get priority. There should be fair competition: I know I am repeating it for the third time, but if we manage this it will not only be good for women; it will be good for society, because our labour market, our IT sector, our other promising sectors need more talents and we need to use the potential of women for the good of the whole society. Thank you very much for this debate. Again, I want to thank the rapporteurs for attracting our attention to these very important topics, and I am ready to cooperate with Parliament in the future because we have to join forces. We have to encourage the Member States, but also the universities, the politicians on all levels and the opinion leaders, because I think that to achieve what we want to achieve in the field of gender equality we need also the change the mindset of our society, and there is much more work to be done.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 150, "date": "2018-04-16.json", "name": "Michaela ŠOJDROVÁ", "mepid": "124710", "text": " rapporteur. — (FR) Madam President, I would like to thank all those who participated in the discussion for their opinions but also for their criticism.

Given that both public and private media must serve society as a whole, its structure and activities should reflect the fact that women account for half of society. This report focuses on the situation of women working as reporters and commentators in the media, but also draws attention to the lack of women in decision-making positions. The latter situation is of particular concern: only 30 to 40% of women hold leadership positions in the media sector, although most graduates of media studies are women. Such imbalances can not only harm media content and theme choices, but also contribute to an increase in the overall wage and pension gap between women and men. Women working as reporters and moderators also face great difficulties: they are under enormous pressure to meet high standards of attractiveness for viewers, and they are rarely instructed to work on important political or economic issues. The situation of women is often complicated by the increased need to reconcile family (maternity) and professional duties.

In the media, only 24% of the population appears to be women. And if women already appear in the media, they are usually asked for a “personal story” and rarely for their expertise (17%). These harrowing figures indicate that women, including in the media, have not yet achieved the same status as men. The under-representation of women in the media contributes to the idea that they would occupy a less prominent position in society. While it is precisely the media sector that should play a major role in changing gender stereotypes. Mr President, if we really want to achieve equality between men and women — equality in terms of wages, pensions and rights including — women must be represented everywhere.

But peace cannot thrive in the midst of poverty, injustice and insecurity. Unequal development—lack of opportunities—fuels conflict, imbalances regions and causes disorderly population movements. Climate change jeopardizes the very future of humanity and multiplies the frequency and intensity of many natural disasters. The summits in Sendai, Addis Ababa, New York, Paris and Istanbul have stressed that we all live in one world, on a common planet, and that we will only improve and preserve it if we assume a shared responsibility to improve it among all and for all. This report calls for the European Union to continue to lead this joint responsibility. The Lisbon Treaty has established that poverty reduction and eradication are the main objectives of the Union's development cooperation policy; a policy aimed at promoting fundamental values such as respect for human rights, democracy, peace, solidarity and support for public goods global. In fact, the European Union and its Member States are the main donors in the world. They are so because of the financial weight of their contribution, also because of their experience and leadership in the negotiations on the main international instruments. Of the various financial instruments of the Union's external action, three of them are the responsibility of the Committee on Development to review them. The purpose of this report is to contribute to this review, initiated by the Commission, of the European Development Fund, the Development Cooperation Instrument and the Humanitarian Aid Instrument. Part of the analysis of its implementation from January 2014 to June 2017 and — while lacking important information, something that needs to be improved in the face of future — considers the implementation of these instruments positively, but in turn evaluates for the future and sets out some recommendations until the end of their validity in 2020 and for the next multiannual financial framework. The assessment was based on several of the Commission's reports, a specific report prepared by the European Parliament's Studies Service (specifically on humanitarian aid) and some other reports made by non-governmental organisations and civil society actors. The challenges that the European Union has faced in recent years have not seriously undermined the effort of its actions, but above all they must not undermine them in the future, even with the foreseeable reducing impact of Brexit, because there are other global actors who are willing to abandon their global responsibilities, something that must at some point assume the European Union to replace them. That is going to be very necessary from the point of view of financial resources. We therefore call for a clear and committed timetable to achieve 0.7 per cent of GDP. I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs for their contribution to this report because it is certainly not a contribution of correcting certain points of the report, but of reincorporating whole paragraphs, different approaches, which have enriched that continent. The report underlines the need for at least 20 per cent of the Development Cooperation Instrument to continue to provide basic social services and public goods. It advocates future budgeting of the European Development Fund; advocates greater participation by civil society and local actors; calls for increased transparency, accountability and parliamentary scrutiny; and calls for a revision of the next multiannual financial framework.

I very much welcome this report as a valuable contribution to the Commission’s preparatory work on the future external financing instruments. I fully share your conviction that we have to remain ambitious in the financing of EU external action after 2020. Heading four has been stretched to the limits during this Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF). We have been facing unprecedented levels of crisis world-wide, from conflicts to natural and climate-related disasters, health epidemics, insecurity and massive displacement and migration. As the report rightly points out, we need to work harder to deliver on the international commitment of the European Union and its Member States to devote 0.7% of gross national income to official development assistance (ODA) by 2030. The ODA figures published a few days ago show that our collective, aggregate ODA has gone down. Even if we are still the world’s largest donor, we cannot accept such a downward trend. I agree that, overall, the current set of instruments has proven useful and strategically relevant, and enabled the European Union to adapt to evolving situations and needs in strategic sectors and regions. However, we need to have the courage to re-examine the next generation of external instruments. Our guiding policy framework with the 2030 Agenda, the Global Strategy, the European Neighbourhood Policy and the European consensus on development as well as the global challenges to which they are responding are highly complex and intertwined. The current multitude of programmes does not facilitate the necessary multi-dimensional approach to poverty eradication and sustainable development. I am therefore happy that the report calls for greater coherence and simplification. Indeed, we need to get rid of artificial boundaries within our current instruments to ensure the right synergies between different policies for different countries and regions. We must avoid working in silos, while preserving the focus on poverty eradication and on promoting European values. Keeping a comprehensive approach towards our partners is the best way to serve our mutual interests. By streamlining existing instruments, development cooperation can take a truly integrated and innovative approach, both from a geographical and thematic point of view. The policy-driven nature of financing instruments will also be reinforced. A streamlined architecture can facilitate our interinstitutional dialogue as well, by truly looking at the bigger picture, rather than specific envelopes. Having differentiated policies such as neighbourhood or development policy does not require having separate instruments. In this logical coherence, it should also make sense to integrate the European Development Fund into the EU budget. But I concur with the report that this should be done only if certain preconditions are met: the volume of funds, in particular for Africa, should not decrease and important elements of flexibility, such as significant reserves and multiannuality should be preserved. On humanitarian aid, I also agree with the report’s key findings. Humanitarian assistance should remain self-standing, taking account of the specific nature and principles of humanitarian assistance. We have been able to provide humanitarian aid rapidly and flexibly in most acute crises. This was possible, not least because of the principles of humanity, impartiality, neutrality and independence. As the recent comprehensive evaluation shows, our instrument is fit for purpose. It is also important that EU humanitarian aid continues to have adequate access to an emergency reserve to deal with unforeseen needs. We are committed to making sure that, whenever possible, humanitarian aid works hand in hand with longer-term instruments as part of the nexus approach in building resilience.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 160, "date": "2018-04-16.json", "name": "Jordi SOLÉ", "mepid": "185974", "text": "  rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Budgets. – Madam President, development policy instruments are of the utmost importance for showing the EU’s commitment to global justice and for the provision of public global goods.

The insufficient amount of EU resources devoted to external action and the need to react within the margins to unforeseen humanitarian emergencies are usually detrimental to meeting development aid goals in a more efficient way.  Furthermore, development money should only be used for development—related purposes, and not for other purposes such as covering internal refugee costs, externalising migration policies outside the EU’s border or paying the cost of returns and readmissions to countries of origin.

I’ll start with thanking the rapporteur, Mr Enrique Guerrero, for his inclusive approach and for having been willing to take on board suggestions and particular preoccupations of colleagues from other political denominations. That’s always appreciated, and I believe we have come up with a good report. On the topics: one, we need more coherence, Commissioner, you know that that is something that our external partners are demanding of us, that is something that external partners would wish for. We are confusing people with the diversity of the instruments that we have, and setting up another new instrument every year does not really help. More coherence is certainly going to be needed. We are not doing enough, I believe, on micro assistance. We have seen again and again and again on parliamentary missions lately and in the bigger picture that where true development could start, where people could take charge of their own destinies, there is no one to support them with EUR 500 or EUR 1000 in order to be able to do that. We have no instruments that foster that. It would fall well within the remit of the future development bank, as the report by Enrique states, and such a development bank would have to have recourse to innovative financial instruments. Finally, budget support will need to remain on the agenda and with greater funding than it has now. Because the patronising attitude that we’ve had in the past has made us look second or third in line in terms of preference of many recipient states, and that effects the notional validity of the partnership was well.

Commissioner, you spoke mainly about the future instruments and I want to limit my brief comments to the future because we just had a meeting of the coordinators of our committee and we talked about the ideas that are floating around at the moment on the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) and the new programmes. The key messages that were coming out are, one, that the MFF should deliver on the SDGs, that there should be no reduction in the amount of funding available – despite Brexit – and, if the European Development Fund (EDF) goes into the budget and the EDF and the Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI) are merged, that should not be an excuse to cut the overall amount.  The focus must be kept on poverty reduction, as set out in the Treaties and money not put into short-term priorities like migration because poverty eradication requires long term predictable funding.  You said humanitarian aid should remain outside of any new instrument, and I think we welcome that very much. As Enrique Guerrero said, there should be a clear strategy to reach the 0.7% aid.  There are lots of questions though that our colleagues have and I’m sure we’ll have time in the next few months to address those, particularly about how the reserve will work –you are talking about a huge reserve.

I remain convinced that development needs the States, our States and the ACP States, and that it is primarily through the association of parliaments — national parliaments, the European Parliament — upstream and downstream of the decision that we will have more transparent processes. With regard to trust funds, I share the criticism. I do believe that these trust funds should be avoided as a way of supporting NGOs, committees or development agencies, without States being re-involved. However, that is the case. This was shown for the Bêkou fund. It is not even possible to clearly involve the State and make it an instrument of support for the development of States. Moreover, I remain convinced that if we are to develop Africa, we need, in addition to the States and globalised aid, sectoral aid which accompanies developments in which we are fully associated with the funds and in which there is codecision and co-management, which also implies monitoring expenditure.

A positive assessment of the conformity of the existing implementation of these instruments with the Sustainable Development Goals and the new European Development Consensus is an important element of report. Unfortunately, the number of crises and natural disasters is globally increasing, causing these instruments to be saddled with significant financial pressures and new ad hoc mechanisms such as trusts lack transparency. External financing instruments beyond 2020 should continue to allow multiannual geographical and thematic programmes to be combined in order to enable development activities on a different scale.

It is reassuring that, according to the evaluations, the objectives of these instruments are largely relevant to policy priorities when they were created and are generally consistent with the ambition of the Sustainable Development Goals.

Whether we consume them directly, such as peas and soy products, or are intended for animal feed, protein plants are at the heart of our diet today. These cultures have immense agronomic interests and play a central role in the transition to more sustainable production systems. Every effort should therefore be made to encourage European farmers to use them and to strengthen their competitiveness. Because the future of vegetable proteins in Europe raises another question: what development of our agriculture and what feeding model do we want for future generations? In terms of supply, the signing of the GATT and Blair House agreements and the opening of markets have sealed the European Union's dependence on third countries. As a result, we now import more than 75% of our plant protein supplies from Argentina, the United States and Brazil, and this deficit is growing steadily. Today, countries like China are implementing procurement strategies based on untransparent production contracts with Latin American countries, and the European Union is likely to see its supplies and market stability seriously threatened. This dependency situation leads to irreversible damage to biodiversity, such as deforestation, but also represents a considerable carbon footprint. It runs counter to the demand of European citizens, who are increasingly expressing fears about GMOs, since the majority imported crops, particularly soybeans, are genetically modified. With the following international agreements, whose adjustment variable is inevitably agriculture, and more particularly livestock, can we really afford to put a little more at risk our chain, which is also distinguished by its quality and traceability? Today I am worried about the international situation, but I also have confidence in all the relevant European actors who can help us change the game, be it farmers and their organisations, food producers, scientists, administrations and elected officials. Together, let us set up a medium and long term strategy that Europe is sorely lacking. The European Union must be more ambitious and have a real strategic supply plan that mobilizes agricultural, research, trade and neighbourhood policies. Developing a European sector and limiting imports would reduce pressure on soil and forest in Latin America. This fight against deforestation is at the heart of the Paris climate agreement. But let us be clear: there will be no increase in production if we do not first improve the competitiveness of these crops. Today, growing protein crops remains far less profitable than traditional field crops. How to be surprised then that only 3% of arable land in the European Union is dedicated to proteins? Yet legumes do not lack advantages: they have the unique property of capturing atmospheric nitrogen that allows farmers to use less fertilizer. By generating many co-products valued in green chemistry and for the production of renewable energies, they fit perfectly into the circular economy. I hope that in the next CAP, incentives for the production of nitrogen-fixing plants are not only carried out under areas of ecological interest, but through a set of measures in the first and second pillars, such as crop rotation, crop associations and support for ecosystem services. We must value not only protein-rich crops, but also fodder and grass surfaces, as these are the largest source of protein inputs in Europe. This requires a clear increase in research, greater use of innovation and better territorial structuring of the sectors. Finally, I hope that some crops will be able to have coupled aid which is a valuable tool and will allow farmers to turn more towards pulses. Food sovereignty and security, fight against global warming, better closure of the nitrogen cycle and the rise of our chains: as you will understand, vegetable proteins are at the heart of all the issues we will address tomorrow for the future of our common agricultural policy. It is essential that the forthcoming CAP give them a special place to enhance the services rendered by agriculture and farmers.

The challenges and opportunities facing the European plant protein sector and its importance among EU institutions and stakeholders are well illustrated in this report. As we all know, plant proteins are essential for EU livestock farming as a vital component of animal feed and source of amino acids for livestock. Moreover, plant proteins are now becoming increasingly popular in human food consumption. As highlighted in Parliament’s report, the development of plant protein production in the European Union will not only benefit farmers and producers of animal feed and provide food for consumers, but will also contribute to a wide range of environmental and climatic benefits, such as the ability to fix nitrogen from the atmosphere. In this context, the European Parliament’s own-initiative report is a very welcome and constructive contribution to the Commission’s preparations of an EU protein plan, scheduled for publication by the end of this year. This publication will be accompanied by a high-level EU conference on plant proteins in Vienna this November during the Austrian Presidency of the Council, and I want to acknowledge the interest which the forthcoming Austrian Presidency has shown in this important issue. The Commission’s EU protein plan will aim to develop a viable and sustainable domestic protein supply mindful of the challenges we face. The EU is only 38% self-sufficient in its main source of feed proteins and only 5% self-sufficient for soya meal, which represent a very efficient and, therefore, important source of feed proteins. As such, we are hugely dependent on imports of soya, which have significant global consequences. An EU study in 2013 identified soya expansion as being responsible for 19% of global forest loss between 1990 and 2008, mainly in South America. There are a number of practical reasons which explain why this is such a complex issue to address. These include the agronomic conditions in Europe, the economic profitability of these crops in Europe, the competitiveness of the EU protein crops compared to imports and international WTO commitments, which limit the level of specific EU support permissible for oilseed production. The reality is that there are no silver bullets to address this issue. The scope of the EU protein plan will therefore be broad, addressing all the different domestic sources of plant proteins in Europe, as well as the different types of demand. Within this broad framework, the European protein plan will concentrate on four areas which are also highlighted in Mr Denanot’s report. Research and innovation in plant proteins with respect to yield improvements and better adaptability to EU conditions; the agronomic and environmental benefits of protein crops; the development of different supply and value chains for EU plant proteins and the market potential for EU plant proteins in different market segments. The European Parliament’s report also refers to the importance of support from the common agricultural policy to protein crop cultivation. The common agricultural policy indeed provides a series of measures which directly or indirectly encourage plant protein production in the European Union. The ongoing discussions about reforming the common agricultural policy will provide an opportunity to further confirm policy support for EU plant protein production. Parliament’s report also highlights the importance of research work which will feature prominently in the Commission’s plan. The Commission looks forward to further cooperation with the European Parliament in the development of this protein plan, which will ultimately benefit us all by making Europe more self-sufficient in the provision of essential proteins.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 189, "date": "2018-04-16.json", "name": "Lívia JÁRÓKA", "mepid": "28141", "text": "The joint debate is closed.

It is clearer than the day that Europe needs a new comprehensive protein policy in food production and agriculture. I am proud that my country has been leading the GMO-free protein self-determination initiatives in the European Union by announcing the National Protein Programme. In the summer of 2017, the European Soya Statement was born on a Hungarian-German initiative. alternative protein crops, replacing imported soybeans with GMO-free European protein crops. Protein crops also contributes to sustainable agricultural production: it improves the carbon balance, diversifies cultivation and reduces the risks of weeds and pests. Nitrogen bound by protein crops can also be used to reduce the amount of nitrogen in the form of fertilisers. The report rightly points out that, in addition to growing its own soy, the replacement of imports should also be encouraged by alternative protein crops such as fodder peas, alfalfa, lupin.

It's a topical issue. In particular, the IMF considers that eight African countries are, for the time being, over-indebted. In addition, eight other African countries are in the process of becoming so. This situation challenges us because we are talking about ways to achieve the sustainable development goals. Let us recall from the outset, the use of borrowing is not reprehensible in itself; the problem is to lend lightly. All borrowing must meet the criteria of relevance, efficiency and sustainability. The relevance criterion means that the charges involved in repayment of the debt are justified only if it contributes to financing investments that are still effective after the payment of the last instalment. If, for example, you build a school in 2020, then in 2040, when the last tranche of the loan is repaid, the school can still serve the purpose for which it was intended. Therefore, children must continue to attend this school, teachers and infrastructure must always meet the needs of the moment. The efficiency criterion is met if the added value generated by this investment is real. Finally, the sustainability criterion applies for obvious reasons: we do not borrow to finance the short term but to invest in the future, in the medium and long term. The present report intends to go even further: it aims to empower both borrowers and creditors. With regard to creditors, not only institutional creditors but also others should, in my view, be obliged to respect the democratic principle. In other words, the borrowing developing country must be duly authorized by its parliament to do so. Who other than parliament can express the will of the people? If this is not the case, the creditor should not have the right to sue the country in default. Consequently, the creditor would not have this right if the loan was not approved. It may sound hard, but what is the point of constantly reminding us of our commitment to upholding the democratic principle if we cannot introduce it into the conditionality of European development policy? The Committee on Development also recommended that the principles established by UNCTAD on debt restructuring be respected. In the event of a country's default, for example, the right to human development must prevail over the creditor's right to recover his claim. We are no longer in the 1980s or 1990s, when we decided to administer horse remedies to countries that were unable to repay their loans. We saw what this has done, especially in countries affected by Ebola: those who had not been able to invest in infrastructure due to lack of budget resources were unable to counter the disease and after three days their health care system was on the ground. Does that mean that people in developing countries that do not qualify for borrowing would no longer be eligible for financing? No, other means are possible. In particular, I am thinking of donations financed from official development assistance to support projects or programmes. I am thinking of the budgetary aid that the Commission can give to developing countries. I am also thinking of innovative means of financing, in particular the financial transaction tax. Finally, and I should have started here, let us emphasize that the levy of taxes in borrowing countries is the primary condition for ensuring sustainable financing. Let's also talk about 0.7%. If the European Union, the Commission and Member States combined, were to spend 0.7% on development, as it has repeatedly promised, we would have more than 25 billion more to finance these programmes. Let us not say, therefore, that this is a matter of lack of funds. No! It is a question of financing otherwise. In conclusion, this report is not intended to propose an approach that could cut funds to developing countries, no! We have to borrow differently and borrow better.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "aws", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 1, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 194, "date": "2018-04-16.json", "name": "Bogdan Brunon WENTA", "mepid": "124903", "text": " - Madam President!

It points out very relevant issues that need to be addressed and is an important contribution to the international debate. Ensuring debt sustainability is essential to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. For this reason, the debt management capacity of developing countries needs to be further strengthened. We need well-designed and executed debt management strategies, as well as improved data recording, reporting and analysis. Borrowing and lending should take place in a responsible manner and further work by the international community is needed to create incentives for such responsible lending and borrowing, building on existing principles issued by the G-20. Sustainable public finances are contingent on good public financial management, transparency, domestic revenue mobilisation and fighting against illicit financial flows. The European Commission is closely monitoring the debt situation in developing countries and is active in supporting partner countries in managing their debt in a sustainable manner. For instance, we actively support the World Bank’s debt management facility. We will also continue to contribute to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) debt management and financial analysis system. Through its political and policy dialogue with partner countries, the Commission is helping to tackle the most critical weaknesses. Budget support is a central element in our toolbox to help countries in managing their debt sustainability. We continue to monitor countries’ debt sustainability through our regular risk assessment and microeconomic analysis. We are also monitoring debt sustainability in relation to the external investment plan and to blending operations, and we respect internationally agreed debt limits. Our objective is to improve transparency and oversight and to progressively strengthen our partner countries’ public finance management capacity, including investment management and procurement. In parallel, the Commission is also scaling up efforts in support of domestic revenue mobilisation and the fight against illicit financial flows, in line with the Addis Ababa action agenda. On debt sustainability, the Commission works very closely with the World Bank and the IMF. On 28 and 29 May this year, the Commission and the World Bank will organise in Brussels the Debt Management Facility Stakeholders’ Forum, focusing on the rising tide of debt, risk resilience and responsibility. This forum will discuss current challenges of debt policy and management in the context of increasing financing needs for development, the growing levels of debt, complexity of the debt portfolios and uncertain market conditions. It will bring together high-level policymakers from developing and emerging countries, multilateral and bilateral donors, providers of technical assistance and civil society. We count on the Parliament’s participation in fruitful discussions. As regards the International Monetary Fund, the Commission welcomes the approach in the Parliament’s report, which underlines the role of the IMF as a principal forum for discussing issues relating to the restructuring of sovereign debt, and notes that any further work should be carried out in coordination with the IMF. The Commission, however, has reservations regarding the call for the establishment of a multilateral legal framework. The EU Member States, in line with the Commission’s position, have consistently been in favour of applying the current international practice of encouraging a market-based voluntary approach in debt restructuring. This principle is not reflected in the Parliament’s report.

It makes it possible to finance many projects ranging from financing SMEs to vocational training and cooperation between regions. Above all, this policy embodies a Europe that is both concrete and of proximity, as we know, these funds are managed as close as possible to the territories. The proposals for the next budgetary framework of the Union are imminent, and it is clear that we are hearing a lot about the new European challenges of defence, security and the refugee crisis and the reception of refugees. It is of course quite legitimate and necessary for the European Union to adapt to these new challenges, but I would like to say that the objective of cohesion and support for the territories has not become obsolete overnight, quite the contrary. The report that has been entrusted to me shows that Europe must invest more than ever in concrete achievements in order to get closer to citizens and contribute to the improvement of their daily lives. So, of course, let us not be mistaken. It would be wrong to claim that cohesion policy is now fully satisfactory, but in order to guarantee it a future, it is not a matter of defending the status quo but of reinventing it, redesigning and adapting it. The first project concerns — I believe — simplification. With nearly 800 pages, 450 articles and 89 annexes, this policy is, as we know, become illegible. Worse, it is complex, sometimes absurd and dissuades more and more beneficiaries from resorting to it. However, concrete solutions exist to make this policy simpler, more readable and more effective. That is what is clearly evident of a consultation that I wanted to launch with the beneficiaries of European funds in my region of the Pays de la Loire. This survey, which I sent to 150 structures that benefited from these funds, gave rise to a very concrete feedback to illustrate this report and demonstrated a need for simplification, but above all the real added value of European funds for project owners. This survey, which was carried out in a region ranked among the most developed, also confirms that concentrating cohesion policy exclusively on the poorest regions would in fact be a mistake. The report therefore underlines that the coverage of all European regions is not negotiable for the European Parliament. Several recently published studies show that while the least developed regions of Europe have experienced significant growth in recent years, many territories are nevertheless weakened and remain fragile. These territories are in a certain way caught up between, on the one hand, the major metropolises that concentrate development and wealth and, on the other hand, competition with regions that are less developed or less favoured. The real fight will therefore be — I believe — to ensure that cohesion policy as a whole is better adapted to the challenges of today's regions. Of course, it will be a matter of strengthening the social dimension of cohesion policy but also, of course, to take better account of subregional disparities, because our regions, including the most developed ones, face pockets of difficulty and poverty, and they need adequate support, which is not necessarily the case today. It will also be a question of protecting a number of territories that are sometimes forgotten from globalization, such as some rural territories, and of course it will be a question of providing answers differentiated according to the specificities of a number of territories, including ultramarine territories.

Touching upon all the key policy areas, cohesion policy is indeed the right tool to address these challenges. Structural funds have ensured increasing economic and social convergence of European regions, thanks to a very concrete and effective model of solidarity. Cohesion policy has helped vulnerable communities and regions, ensuring they do not fall behind. I saw this with my own eyes on a mission to Slovenia recently and I see it on a regular weekly basis in my own North West England constituency.  Understanding the real impact that Brexit and the loss of the Structural Funds will have for UK regions is crucial. That is why Labour MEPs have called for Brexit regional impact assessments, which must take account of the loss of billions of pounds of EU regional development money, funds that come directly to the poorest areas such as Liverpool, Blackpool and rural Cumbria.

You have underlined the importance of this policy for improving the lives of millions of people in the European Union. This report captures the very essence of what cohesion policy has helped to achieve so far and what is yet to be achieved. In this regard, your analysis on the 7th cohesion report is to the point. I also welcome the very concrete recommendations on the way forward after 2020. They are in line with many of our own beliefs. In particular, you state very assertively that the coverage of all EU regions is a red line for the European Parliament, and you know very well that I could not agree more with you, and I praise this ambitious approach – ambitious yet realistic. As evidenced in the 7th cohesion report, regional disparities remain important, and the needs are clearly not limited to the poorest regions, as you clearly said. Indeed, pockets of poverty are observed in all kinds of regions, notably in urban areas, where the average living standard is very high. But at the same time we have very poor pockets – very poor communities. Moreover, several middle-income regions still lack capacity to fully benefit from the EU integration process. They have failed to move to higher-value-added activities. Europe has probably never needed solidarity and equality more than today. Phenomena such as globalisation, climate change, terrorism and social exclusion are exerting polarising forces inside our European Union. The temptation of isolation is growing, and our European project is at risk. We have to be honest and recognise this. The need to continue cementing our Union is very important, and clearly the best answer post-2020 is a strong cohesion policy for our regions, and in the meantime the Commission is preparing the ground, notably by strengthening smart specialisation strategies. I believe this innovative and cooperative approach to policy-making is the best way to help regions find their competitive niche and become resilient. It is very important. I am so glad to see that you also call for an intensification of smart specialisation strategies. In this context, your report mentions the pilot actions we have launched to help regions in industrial transition build their strategies for their regional transformation. This should be ready by the end of 2018, and I remain at your disposal to update you on the progress we have made as soon as we get the first results. I would like to conclude by talking about the implementation of cohesion policy, which is very important. We share the view that radical simplification and faster delivery of results are needed. The options we are working on are largely in line with those proposed in your report, such as taking account of the different administrative capacities across Member States; a single set of rules; stronger synergies with other EU instruments; and a revised allocation system to better reflect the variety of challenges faced by EU territories. We all know that the proposal for the next Multiannual Financial Framework is just around the corner. My only concern is that cohesion policy remains the main investment policy for the European Union, that it carries on supporting growth and improving the conditions of investment.

On the other hand, however, it pointed to a number of lingering problems, the solution of which still lies ahead. I believe that a transparent, well-targeted and accessible cohesion policy should be the backbone of EU investment. It is a tool that best addresses challenges in infrastructure, environmental investment, human capital investment, entrepreneurship or public administration reform. In order for her to continue fulfilling her role beyond 2020, however, she must have a strong position in the EU budget.

However, the Cohesion Report presented by the EC shows that there are some weaknesses in this policy that we need to eliminate. In 2015, almost ¼ Europeans were declared at risk of poverty or social exclusion. Bearing in mind the figures on the unemployment rate of youth and those living in poverty, it should be noted that the prospects for rapid improvement are slim. The Union is as strong as its weakest links are. Therefore, the Union's well-being will not be average GDP growth and real results in the fight against poverty. This fight must be based on long-term investment rather than ad hoc subsidies, and this is the Union's cohesion policy. So I can't imagine the possibility of cutting resources for cohesion policy. We are also seeing a new phenomenon of deepening differences within regions, and in relatively affluent regions, poverty enclaves. Some territories were found “in the middle income trap.” It is therefore appropriate to fine-tune the indicators taken into account for the allocation of funds, alongside GDP per capita. They need to be flexible, with an emphasis on the overall unemployment rate and the unemployment rate of young people. A significant threat to the integrity of cohesion policy is the plans to integrate the ESF into the proposed social investment fund.

I would be very keen to see the cohesion policy, despite the challenges of Brexit or the new challenges of the defence community, sufficient resources precisely to help the development of the poor regions, because to focus on reducing the difference between regions, that is, I think, the main backbone force of Europeanism, the EU. The achievement of thematic objectives should certainly remain, but I think it would be good for the Commission to also hear calls from the Member States concerning their needs. And what is our greatest pain, I find it important to mention — simplification.
