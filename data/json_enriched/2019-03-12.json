I can assure you that we are committed to promoting gender balance. This is an important issue and the gender balance among the top staff of EU official financial bodies is also a key issue for the Council. At the same time, the selection procedures are based on rules that we have to respect. The Council has always acted – and will continue to act – in line with all the relevant provisions of EU law as regards its role in appointments. I would also expect all the other institutions involved to act within the legal framework and to do their utmost to promote gender balance. Against this background, I was surprised that Parliament is raising this issue specifically with the Council. President Tajani’s letter refers to legal acts that regulate appointments to three EU legal organs. These three bodies are the Single Supervisory Board, the Banking Stakeholder Group within the European Banking Authority, and the Single Resolution Board. Please allow me to clarify that the Council is not involved in drawing up shortlists, nor in selecting successful candidates, for any of these three bodies. The shortlists for appointments to the Single Resolution Board are provided by the Commission. Candidates for the Single Supervisory Board are the responsibility of the European Central Bank. Subsequently, for both of these boards, the European Parliament decides on the successful contenders. The Council’s role is limited to formally approving the selection made by Parliament. As regards appointments to the European Banking Authority, the Council has no role to play at all. Regarding the selection of members of the ECB Executive Board, the Council does indeed have a role in the selection procedure. I can assure you that we reiterate the importance of gender balance in each selection procedure and call on Member States to propose female candidates. I trust that all EU institutions involved in preparing shortlists and selecting candidates observe and respect the principle of gender balance and that they will continue to do so in the future. As the Presidency of the EU Council, Romania will continue to promote at European level the principle of gender balance, by facilitating debate on possible ways forward and advancing the legislative agenda, especially the negotiations on the directive on women on boards. Important progress in this area of action has already been achieved through the consistent efforts of both the Council and Parliament in relation to the work-life balance directive, on which we have been able to finalise negotiations. We are determined to make our contribution to mainstreaming gender balance on the EU agenda in order to ensure a fair and equitable environment in our societies and within our labour markets.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": null}, {"id": 3, "date": "2019-03-12.json", "name": "Rainer WIELAND", "mepid": "2323", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, on behalf of the Commission, including Vice-President Dombrovskis and Commissioner Moscovici, who are in Brussels this morning at the Ecofin Council, I would like to thank you for this opportunity to exchange views on gender balance in the EU financial bodies. President Juncker replied yesterday to the letter sent by President Tajani on this matter.  First of all, let me emphasise that this Commission is fully committed to the principle of gender balance and has taken decisive action in this regard. 39.6% of middle and senior management is now female, up from 30% in November 2014. The number of female Directors-General has increased from 14% to 30%, from five to 12. The number of female deputy Directors- General has increased from 8% to 42% – it means from just three to 20. We also agree that women continue to be particularly under-represented in executive positions in the field of banking and financial services. Women only account for about 15% of private executives. The under-representation of women can also be observed in the public sector entities in this field. Women rarely make up more than a third of the governing bodies of most national central banks. The under-representation of women can be observed in a similar way in the applications for positions in EU agencies active in this field. On average, there are four to five times more male candidates than female candidates.  On the specific cases you are debating today, I would like to stress that it follows from Article 283/2 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union that the Commission plays no role in the appointment of a new member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank.  As regards the European Banking Authority, the Commission’s role is limited to assisting the Board of Supervisors in relation to the appointment of the chairperson of the European Banking Authority. For the Single Resolution Board, currently chaired by a woman, the Commission is indeed entrusted with providing the European Parliament with a shortlist of candidates for the positions of chair, vice-chair and other members of the board. In line with the relevant regulation establishing the board, appointments are to be based on merit, skills, knowledge of banking and financial matters and on relevant expertise and experience. Moreover, in line with Article 56/4 of that Regulation, candidates shall be chosen on the basis of an open selection procedure which must respect the principles of gender balance, experience and qualification.  The Commission is strongly in favour of supporting women with the necessary qualifications reaching top positions. We have taken this into account and rigorously respected the legal requirements in the selection procedures, and we have kept the European Parliament informed at all stages of the process. In the cases of the chair of the European Banking Authority and the position of board member of the Single Resolution Board, several candidates, including female candidates, failed to meet the eligibility criteria, often because they did not have the required minimum professional or senior management experience in the field of finance.  We look forward to continuing the cooperation with this House on this very important matter. In the cases where the Commission has a role in the process, the Commission will continue to pay close attention to the issue of gender balance when composing shortlist of candidates for the EU financial services agencies.

Mr President, I come in here a little panting, my coat is still next to me. So I have only heard half of what the European Commission said. The reason was quite simple: I was still managing my eight-year-old son's school on my phone via FaceTime. So that's what women in their professional lives face when they're trying to combine their job with life at home.  I think that is what we need to talk about in this debate. So don't have that tip of that iceberg and those three nominations that are now on the agenda, which some groups now think need to be shut down. I would also like to remind you that the same groups that you are about to hear, especially the Italian representatives from those groups, when we had an excellently qualified Irish woman for a position at the SSM, preferred to have their preference for an Italian man.  In other words, this debate is, unfortunately, a symbolic debate, unfortunately, because gender balance seems to affect certain groups when their nationality is not with the candidates. If that is the case, then the preference in practice secretly still goes to a man. So many people who will speak later in this debate have a big pile of butter on their heads.  Where do we start? As the European Commission has already said, the problem is that in these senior positions there is often too little of a pond of well-qualified women to choose from. It is our job, here in the European Parliament, to ensure that these women are there: in banks, in government, in politics, in business.  This starts with making it possible to combine work and private life. This starts with good childcare and that starts to lead by example especially with our sons and daughters. How is it that children aged five, six, seven years old in Kent are asked at school to sign a surgeon, a fireman and an astronaut, that more than fifty out of 60 children draw a man and is astonished when a female astronaut, a female surgeon and a firefighter enter that classroom.  So things are already going wrong there.

The problem is how this trend is reversed because, if there are no applications, I also understand that we cannot do anything else. For there to be applications, it is necessary to facilitate the careers of women, particularly in these institutions, girls must be told that you can study economics and have a decent career path, because if you say to them 'look, so if you do economic studies you will not be able to go on', then nothing happens and in the end we do not have the candidacies.

Mr President, I would like to thank the The German state of Brandenburg has decided that the state parliament should be made up of equal numbers in the future. Let me give you an example. The rationale is that Parliament should be equally male and female, because that reflects the situation in society. Apart from the fact that 50% of the electorate is already female and can, of course, choose male or female Members, the challenge is that the proportion of women in politics is significantly lower than in society.  I have attended many party events, and the proportion of women has usually not been more than 15 or 20%. How, then, is such a joint list to be understood? Is that really fair? And where do we stop? Which marginal groups do we want to take into account in the future about the proportion of women? Do we want to keep all religions evenly considered? Do we want to include Christians, Buddhists, Muslims, atheists? And do we still have all minorities in mind? Do we want to be gay, queer, transgender, people with diabetes, with physical limitations, old, fat, young, thin – where are we going to draw the line?  Our democracy gives the electorate the opportunity to choose the person who best represents him. And we can also trust the citizens to do so, and the economy is no different. We should always choose the person who has the best qualifications and is best suited to a profession and to pursue a profession, regardless of gender – and I say this because I am a civil engineer by profession.

If you listen carefully to the way in which the problem was described, it was briefly described in this way: since there are no women who have the necessary knowledge at a lower level, they never reach a higher level. That's where the problem is. It is the same explanation that we hear at airports when it is said that the aircraft is delayed because it is delayed. That's not an explanation. \"Due to late incoming aircraft\" is the usual explanation we get, and equally \"late incoming\" are the decisions on the gender balance.

This was not the case in this case at the time of the designation or with respect to the Philip Lane proposal. We call on the Council, the Central Bank and the Commission to join forces to ensure that in future appointments, instead of explaining that their role is limited, they will act to change the situation.

The Group of European Conservatives and Reformists supports gender balance in the selection process, but would also like geographical balance to be maintained.

Thank you for a very interesting debate. I will add a few comments.  We have enough very well qualified women in the financial sector. When speaking about sectors and a deficit, we see a deficit in relation to qualified women in the technology and IT sector, but for the financial sector, we do have enough highly qualified women. Out of 62% of university graduates who are women, we have a lot of very well qualified economists and financial experts. Indeed, we have surveys which say that it’s in companies and in the financial sector and in banks where there is diversity on boards, where there is balanced representation, where there is more balanced decision-making. These are surveys which took lessons from the financial crisis, which say clearly that men have more of a tendency to take irresponsible and dangerous excessively risky decisions. This is not my invention; this is what we see in the facts and from the data collected from many institutions and that’s why it’s good to have diversity on boards and to have this balanced decision-making. That’s why I think that it will be good if we work together for the future on the procedures which will guarantee better representation of women by means of fair competition. This is what I introduced already in the current version of the proposed women on boards directive, where we say the first stage in decision-making and in the selection process must look at the qualification, expertise and experience – the professional ability and capability to do the job – and then the person whose gender is under—represented should be given priority. I think that this is very fair and in fact, it is gender-neutral because it could be a man who gets priority one day. I think that we should look into these processes and make them more fair.  I have been doing this job of Gender Equality Commissioner for five years now and I have heard a lot of different myths and also lies. One of them, I heard today is that we are different. Of course we are different. We have different ways of thinking and that’s why we should have this balanced representation. We are different as individuals. I come from a totalitarian country. When I hear about equality, I am nervous because I lived in the regime which imposed equality. We are individuals. Our ability to do jobs differs and don’t tell me that we have a problem from a gender point of view. The second myth – speaking about the quota, which was introduced in this women on boards directive and which some of you called to be used in the process for the financial sector. I hear sometimes that under a quota system, a woman will end up replacing a fantastic, well-educated man. That’s not true. I want to be well understood. I plea for fair competition. This is necessary to follow under excessive risk-taking and the lessons learned after the financial crisis. I think it was Neelie Kroes who said that the financial crisis would not have come about if it had been the Lehman sisters, but it was the Lehman brothers, so that’s why we had the problem. The last two comments: we had a few minutes ago a lot of very beautiful young people around here. When stagiaires and students visit me, the young women do not speak about discrimination. They are just ready to go for it. We should also fulfil the task of encouraging and helping them to have higher self-confidence and to be ready to do demanding jobs because low self-confidence, according to many other surveys, is one of the barriers for women to going for these high jobs, and to break some kind of risk-avoidance feature, which we as women also sometimes have. Last comment on what we heard from Mr Sośnierz: yes, horrible things. I don’t agree with what I heard from Mr Sośnierz but, ladies and gentlemen, I was here yesterday and we had a debate about agriculture and about the protection of fish and animals and yesterday I heard that fish do not deserve our protection because they don’t have voting rights and they are not taxpayers!

It is a real honour and privilege for me to be here today, as this Democratic House represents all European citizens. Human history is driven by a desire to achieve ideals and create a better future. This is exactly what was at the birth of the European Union 60 years ago. It's what started with democratic changes 30 years ago in Czechoslovakia. We were driven by ideals of peace, prosperity and unity. The project of the European Union brought peace to Europe and it brought us stability, freedom and prosperity. It brought us success – even to smaller countries like Slovakia. Ladies and gentlemen, the Slovak journey back to advanced Europe began in 1989 with a desire for freedom, democracy, human rights, economic and technological progress. Fifteen years ago, we went back to where we always belonged – to western European and transatlantic value space through integration into the European Union and NATO. The subsequent Slovak story was extremely successful. But it wasn't always an easy and straightforward journey. We had to overcome an era of economic slump and transformation. We had to fight high unemployment, cope with the reconstruction of the banking sector and structural changes in our economy. We have built democratic institutions in a new Slovak statehood, we have also overcome a period of democratic crisis and we have mastered the demanding criteria for joining NATO and the European Union. Eu enlargement between 2004 and 2013 was a classic demonstration of a win-win process. The new Member States have gained the prospect of modernisation and growth, the old Member States have expanded the stability zone and won a larger single market. Slovakia is now a full member of the European family. We are among the countries with the highest GDP growth in the EU, we are a stable member of the euro area with relatively low unemployment and we have changed from an emigro country in recent years to a country where more people come before they leave. And the overall atmosphere in the country has changed. Our citizens are freer and richer, but also more demanding at the level of political life. We are using this potential to modernise our country. Slovakia has a strong civil society and a high level of media freedom. However, we ourselves are aware that there are areas in which we must add, for example in the quality of education, research and innovation potential, in the quality of state administration, or in reducing the space for corruption. But the Slovak story can be an inspiration to the European Union even in the current situation. Difficult challenges can be successfully overcome and major obstacles overcome, but this must be wanted. Already Milan Rastislav Štefánik, a great Slovak and European diplomat and one of the founders of the Czechoslovak Republic in 1918, our French general said: \"For people of strong determination and endurance there is nothing that can be achive.\" And his legacy was followed after accession to the European Union, when there was a lot of work to be done. We have gone through the difficult process of joining Schengen and the euro area. We have never stopped on our way to integration, because we sincerely believe in the strength and correctness of the European idea. We consider a united Europe to be a natural space for our existence. I believe that there is no alternative for us. We confirmed this during the Slovak Presidency of the Council of the European Union, and the Bratislava Summit sent a clear signal of unity of the Union following the shock of the results of the British referendum. However, Slovakia, like the whole of Europe at present, is not entirely immun with attacks on the values of the European Union. Even in such an important area as freedom of speech. Any attacks on journalists provoke a legitimate public reaction, and we have seen this in Slovakia as well. This is a sign of the great maturity of our democracy and of our citizens. A few weeks ago, a year has passed since the murder of journalist Ján Kuciak and his partner Martina Kušnírová. The double murder of two young people has shaken the whole of Slovakia, both socially and politically. But I want to assure you that we all have only one goal: to track down and punish the perpetrators of this crime. I would also like to express my thanks to the European Parliament, including the Monitoring Group on the Rule of Law, for the cooperation that has been and often critical so far. I also thank Europol for its help in the investigation that has produced its results: the first defendants are already in custody and awaiting a fair trial. Today, for Slovakia, I can confirm that, even in these difficult times, we want to continue to belong to the group of most integrated countries in the European Union. We are ready to bear our adequate share of the burden of responsibility for the joint integration project, as well as to co-shape our European future. The election of the President of the Slovak Republic is about to take place. I believe that the citizens of Slovakia will demonstrate their maturity and choose a candidate with a clear pro-European direction.  And let me say that the party I represent, as a governing party, could not have built more of a pro-European candidate than the Vice-President of the European Commission, Maroš Šefčovič. I also consider this to be a signal of values both inside and outside the country. The success story of Slovakia is, a certain extent, defined by where we come from. Central Europe is a natural living environment for Slovakia, on the basis of our history, geography and culture. After all, regional political cooperation is the essence of EU success. Franco-German cooperation, Weimar, Benelux, the Baltics and even the Visegrád Group are bringing new initiatives and ideas and thus strengthening our Union. Slovakia currently holds the Presidency of the Visegrád Group. Our main objective is to bring a positive agenda to strengthen the EU. Of course, we are aware of differences, maybe even of criticism and comings, but in these challenging times we need to keep everyone on board, at the table, and we need to resolve our disputes through dialogue. The European Union is the product of a strong vision and the immense efforts of several generations. We are simply obliged to protect it, especially now that Europe and western democracies face dramatic new developments. We are surrounded by challenges coming from all directions, from both inside and outside Europe. We see growing Russian and Chinese aspirations, which require a strong and united EU response. We see this climate change as unpredictable economic, political and social impact on our lives. We see a new wave of technological revolution – Industry 4.0 – and Europe as we know it will survive only if it stays in the forefront of technological progress and innovation. That's what our governments need to become Governments 4.0. Moreover, we face many challenges from within Europe. Growing social differences are destroying the original social contract. We face a dramatic ageing of our societies. Regional socioeconomic disparities do not contribute to a feeling of unity: many people feel they are left behind. In this context, it is no surprise that mass immigration from countries outside the EU has been caused by new tensions and conflicts. We forget to talk to our citizens about Europe, about democracy and about our plans for the future. When they hear no answers from us, they turn around. Lack of communication can become a breeding ground for disinformation and fake news. One example was the British referendum in 2016. It is obvious that isolationism, protectionism and nationalism are not a solution. Our answer must not be fragmented into small national states with limited resources, but stronger unity of the EU as a global power. Honourable Members, as 17 of my colleagues have already, let me be brave and determined in presenting my vision of our common future: a vision of an attractive Union that citizens can trust and support. This remains a valid message from the Bratislava Summit: first, a which Union is united, prosperous and secure; and, second, and Union is globally relevant, and that Union is honest with its citizens, and a Union that cares about its own future. However, we need to find a common path to achieve our ideals. So my question is 'How are we going to get there?' First, we need to be united. 'Unity' was the word bridge often used by my colleagues who have already addressed this House, and they are completely right. Without unity among the Member States, we will become subject to the decisions of others. We can't be credible and successful in achieving our ideals if we're not going to overcome the last leftovers of the former east-west divide. We have to get rid of the stereotypes through which we perceive our differences. Here I would like to recall the words of the highly regarded Slovak politician Milan Hodža, who served as Prime Minister of Czechoslovakia from 1935 to 1938. Back in 1942, he wrote: 'European security cannot be built only in the West, it also requires central Europe, and the common democratic ideals and institutions of both provide hope for the future'. I believe that beyond the differences and geographical boundaries there are common interests. We need to communicate, try to understand one another, and perhaps go the extra mile on both sides. There are many positive examples of differences being overcome – name just two major examples, the rules on the posting of workers and on dual food quality. On the other hand, there is one major issue on which we have failed, on both sides, to communicate – namely, migration. We have to work out and work for everyone. Immigration must be manageable and migration should serve European interests. Yet, we can't preserve a political unity without achieving sufficient socioeconomic convergence and cohesion in the EU. In other words, we must use prosperity for the benefit of all. We must mitigate the negative consequences of globalisation and avoid tax avoidance by corporations. We have to make their pay taxes in the countries where they actually operate and generate their profits. We have to combat growing inequalities in society and redistribute wealth more efficiently. The introduction of a European minimum wage will be one way to create social solidarity. We government is committed to the European Pillar of Social Rights, which is to provide a strong social dimension in the European Union of the future. As well as advocates fair Labour mobility, which will allow our citizens and companies to seize the opportunities of the single market. We welcome the agreement to establish the European Labour Authority and we have already declared our intentions of hosting it in our capital.  Secondly, we need to be globally relevant. We need the EU, which plays an important global role, reflecting its economic power. We must take action to unify our forces and increase capacity building in defence. Slovakia strongly supports Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) on security and defence, while ensuring complementarities between the EU and NATO. Globally relevant means that we have uphold our long-term commitments. We are not an exclusive club. We want to be an inclusive community, open to those who meet the criteria and even those who once left. This is in our strategic interest, and otherwise somebody else will fill the vacuum around us. At the same time, \"global\" means having significant economic power, backed by a strong currency and based on free but fair international trade. The EU has been told to remain the champion in this regard. Thirdly, we need to be honest with our citizens. We can't promise our citizens and life without problems, hard work and challenges. The EU has no magic wand to solve all the problems. However, we can offer our citizens and credible vision of our future, and turn that vision into tangible deeds. We need to make our citizens – above all, young people – feel a sense of ownership. The EU is not some fictitious, distant 'Brussels'. We are the European Union. (Applause) We need to confront who tell us otherwise. Ignoring them or ridiculing them is not the solution. We need to challenge them by facts. The EU is now a large and strong community. It provides us with a collective identity because there is something about the EU that is also personal. But it doesn't take away our national or personal identity. Our unity must be a unity of values within the diversity of our national, regional and local cultures. Finally, we need to care about the future. Soon, in the run-up to the European elections, you, the European political parties, will have an opportunity to present a new, realistic vision of our Union. The European debate has become very lively and intense at many levels, political and civic, national and regional. My appreciation goes to President Macron, who has had a lot of discussions with his own vision of the future - and I agree with him. We can't be trapped in the status quo and give way to resignation. We have to renew our Union. It is up to us as leaders to find a common path and instruments that citizens can trust and support, because we need freedom, progress and protection in the European Union. We have to find a way of protecting the four freedoms that are at the core of EU integration. We need an EU-wide debate on what our strategy and aspirations should be for the middle of the century. The EU will certainly have a major transformation towards a climate neutral economy. We need a transition that is socially just towards our citizens and fair to our businesses. The important issue for the future development of the European economy is that of digitalisation and automation. On the one hand, there is a great concern that people will not have enough jobs because robots will replace them. On the other hand, there is great concern about the lack of skilled workers on the markets. Yet, in the future, we need even more highly skilled people. The best evidence of this is that countries with the highest number of robots per job, Germany, South Korea, Singapore, have the lowest unemployment rates. There are currently around 151 robots per 10,000 working places in Slovakia. This is more than half the European average and the highest level in Central and Eastern Europe. We are not afraid of technological change: we just need to adopt smart and responsible policies. If we want to be honest in our aspiration for the future, we must have the right tools, dry as the next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF). The current EU budget represents only 1% of EU gross national income. While focusing on the budget on new challenges, we don't want to give up on cohesion policy. Calls for its reduction in the next MFF reflect a wrong understanding of the role of cohesion policy. It is cohesion policy that helps rich and poor regions to converge, and contributes to growth even in economically difficult times. I mean, do we need to speak about our future, but how can we speak about the new MFF without having a clear vision of the European Union? I don't think it's the right approach to see the firstly what kind of budget we have and then decide what we can pay for out of it. I think we should do it next. First we have to see where we are like to be in the next five, seven, ten or fifteen years – what are our priorities – and then to decide how big and budget and what kind of budget we need for our priorities. That's the approach that I prefer over the current one. (Applause) On the subject of new technologies, we have to admit openly – and I'm not talking here about the European Parliament but rather generally – that, at European level, we are not able to keep pace with developments in this area. We're always behind. We are facing a digital revolution but we are not able to effect a revolution in the regulatory framework. We're always behind. We are trying to regulate something that people are already using, and sometimes we do so in drought and way that we are over-regulate everything, and then we find ourselves crying that we are not at the same level as the USA or Asia, where the innovation environment is growing up, while we are still divided with 27 or 28 different sets of regulations. So please, we need to consider some flexible regulatory framework, not to regulate every simple thing that is going on in our lives, because this is not the future in the digital revolution. We need to table only some basic rules and some kind of framework that is flexible enough, because we politicians are not able to act as fast as we need to act. That's why I mention the world. If we're talking about Industry 4.0, then we need to push our Member States to introduce 'Government 4.0', because what we have to have in some countries is more like Government 2.0 or maybe 3.0. I am not sure if we have a Government 4.0 anywhere reflecting the needs of the future. Honourable Members, the European elections are quickly approaching and we need to mobilise our forces to combat fake news, hybrid threats and cyber-propaganda. Make people feel the urgency! Talk to them about the importance of the EU for their everyday lives. Make them understand that election matter: that this is their only opportunity to steer the EU, and that they should not let others speak for them. There is a lot of work ahead of us. Let me finish my speech with the words of one of the founding fathers of European integration. Jean Monnet said: 'People only accept change when they are faced with necessity, and only recognise necessities when a crisis is upon them.' We must be brave and determined. We have to make changes and make the Union attractive to all: a Union able to learn from its past mistakes in order to prepare itself to embrace the future.

Buongiorno, Mister President, Mister Prime Minister, dear Peter, I'll tell you a secret. I didn't sleep much last night, because of Mrs May, but long enough to be able to dream of Slovakia and Bratislava. For in negotiating yesterday with Mrs May, I thought of the European summit in Bratislava in September 2016, three months after the decision of the British people to leave the European Union. Your government, of which you were a member, and you have a great deal of merit in terms of the slovak Presidency's record, had accepted the idea of convening, for the first time in history, a European summit of 27. The Slovak government, like us, believed that Brexit was the past and that we had to prepare for the future of the European Union. This is what we did in Bratislava, adopting the so-called 'Bratislava Roadmap'. I have a good memory of this European Council, which came a few days after the State of the Union speech I gave in this Chamber. For the first time, and probably also the last, the 27 Prime Ministers welcomed the content of this speech. This had never happened before, it will never happen again, but I remember the Bratislava summit as a great moment in my little political life, since it ensured that we were able, with courage, determination, although sometimes on a senator's train, to move towards a European future which some had predicted at the time that it would never see the light of day again after the British decision. We agreed last night with the British government on the terms and consequences of Brexit. I said last night, or overnight, that this is the second chance, but there will not be a third. I would therefore like the Members of the British Parliament today to support the British and European approach, which has been agreed at European Union level, in the form of a common text. I wanted, Peter, to thank you, on behalf of the Commission, for all the support that the Slovak Government continues to give us. I am thinking in particular of the effort he made when it came to innovation by amending the directive on the secondment of workers. It was an important step. The same applies to the creation of the European Labour Authority. I also note, and this is not a point I am making, that the number of governments that want to host the European Labour Authority on their territory is higher than was the number of governments that, ab initio and spontaneously, had supported the Commission in its desire to create this authority, on the model of the Banking Authority. I am pleased to hear you say that you love the social pillar of the European Union. The more Prime Ministers say that, not only here, but also in the European Council and at the level of the Council of Ministers, the less isolated I feel at the level of the European Union. The Slovak Government has helped us a great deal to set up the social foundation at the Extraordinary European Council in Gothenburg, which, by the way, I say to those who keep claiming it, has expressed the need to introduce a minimum wage everywhere in Europe. This is not an idea that has been born in recent weeks, it is an idea that has animated us since this Commission took office, and I would like us to implement it as soon as possible. The same applies with regard to the creation of a minimum income in all the countries of the European Union. You talked about the fiscal framework for the next seven years, and rightly so, you said that we have to agree first on the policies and then on the means of funding the policies that have been decided. That is exactly what the Commission has done. The approach that we took is exactly what you wanted. You say that the need to maintain cohesion policy should not be overlooked. I am a strong supporter of cohesion policy, but in order to agree on this, we had to take into account, and you called for it a few moments ago, the policies of innovation and modernisation, digital policy or even the Europe of defence. We have done all of this, and if we had not reviewed the cohesion policy, which is still necessary, and the common agricultural policy, we would have reached a budgetary level of 1.41 per cent. Even your government, despite your enthusiasm, would never have accepted a budget of 1.41 per cent. So we had to make choices, and we made them. Slovakia currently holds the presidency of the Visegred Group. I would like you to take this opportunity to help put an end to this debate between Eastern Europeans, or rather central Europeans, and Western Europeans. Europe has to breathe with two lungs and everything must be done so that these two lungs do not collide in the same body.  We all have our contribution to make. We must not believe that it would be only the Commission, the European Parliament and a few Western European governments that would be responsible for this confrontation, which is sometimes ridiculous and which, in any case, is harmful. Use your presidency of the Visegred group to remedy this situation. You know, Slovakia, for the rest of us who come from the West and are no longer young, but who try to stay so, Slovakia is not a country like any other. I was thirteen years old at the time of the so-called Prague Spring, which is also the spring of Bratislava - I even believe that the first movements could have been observed in Slovakia. We pay special attention to this country, a love of experience and hope, and I would therefore like the Slovaks not to think that the rest of Europe does not like Slovakia, on the contrary, and I would like Slovakia to love the European Union more. Some elements of history that occurred after the two world wars are little known. Thus, the exiled government of Czechoslovakia at the time and other central European governments had already outlined a project for Europe, which they called a project for the European Union. At the end of this little-known document is a sentence that has always impressed me, moved even. These Central European countries, with their governments in exile, have concluded: \"We would like the countries of Western Europe to one day join us in building the European Union.\" History has prevented you from coming out of its shadows, but as the Central Europeans were the first to dream of a peaceful Europe, it is our duty and our ardent obligation to continue the work that is ours.

Mr President-in-Office of the Government, welcome to the European Parliament and thank you for sharing your vision of Europe with us. From the Group of the European People's Party we thank you for the tone and language used. And we thank you for referring from the rostrum to the murder of journalist Ján Kuciak and his partner, although we don't think that's enough. Freedom of the press is one of the fundamental pillars of democracy and when a journalist is killed that tragedy affects all democracies. In Malta, no one has yet assumed any responsibility for Daphne Caruana's death. Something we deeply regret. In Slovakia, beyond Robert Fico's resignation, we also do not see great progress being made. You don't get to the end of the investigation. Why? What's keeping the investigation from coming to an end? More than that, we are concerned, and much, about the rhetoric of some members of your coalition or some presidential candidate. They continue to use hate speech against the opposition and hate speech against the press. What are you going to do about it? Are you truly committed to the fight against extremism and hate speech that some practice quite close to you? Mr President-in-Office of the Government, difficult times are coming for Europe. Brexit doesn't know where it's going to take us. The Transatlantic Alliance is regularly put into question. The Russian government is eager to weaken us, to see us fail, to divide us. There has been an unprecedented migration crisis since World War II.  These are problems that European states cannot take on on their own. These are problems for which we need greater unity and yet when we are in that circumstance, your Government seems to bet just the opposite. Your speech is one here, but then your government in your country does the opposite. We would like to know what your position really is: that of the speech we have heard or that of your Government in Slovakia? Are you committed to the process of further European integration? Are you committed to your country's membership in NATO? There are issues that concern us and that we think have not only not been clarified, but this morning they contradict the actions that your Government takes in your country. We, as a Group of the European People's Party, have this very clear: Europe must be built on the basis of concrete actions; Europe must be built from the base, from the simplicity of citizens and town halls, and not from elitism. The great discourses on Europe do not work if one in his own country has the worst managed agriculture in the European Union.  Europe must be built rigorously, seriously, with ambitious but also achievable proposals. National policy cannot be based on the confrontation with Brussels, the confrontation with Brussels, the political war against Brussels. Europopulism is as dangerous as nationalpopulism. And Europe must be built from within, taking into account the problems, but also from the outside, because there are ideological battles, Mr President of the Government, which, without happening on European soil, are also European battles, such as the one taking place in Venezuela, which is a battle for freedom and democracy and also today, unfortunately, for food.  His Government has not yet recognized Venezuela's interim president, Mr. Guaidó. In this sense it is placed in the same orbit as Russia, as Cuba or iran. That's to make you look at it, Mr. President of the Government. How long is it going to take, Mr Pellegrini, to stand on the side of the hungry town that the meds don't get to? Mr President-in-Office of the Government, it is true that the European dream deserves effort and unity on the part of all. Ambition must be regained, idealism regained, contact with citizens regained. Something we will be doing wrong, therefore, so that more and more citizens turn their eyes to anti-European and extremist movements every day. There is no doubt about it, Mr Pellegrini, nationalpopulism is the most serious threat looming today about the European Union's dream.  It is nationalpulism that is the greatest threat. All the others exist, but none of them are as corrosive to us as the one that comes from within. And either I am wrong, or the next parliamentary term we will have in this Parliament a large group of nationalpulists. That's why everyone, you from your responsibility—as President Juncker reminded you—and we, from ours, have to do whatever's in our power. And you as a Council are soon going to have a very important job, which is to propose to this Parliament a President of the Commission. I'd like you to leave here having reminded him that we have a commitment not to accept a candidate who has not previously been a candidate in the European elections, who is not endorsed by the vote of the citizens, who comes taxed and did not vote. In short, Mr President-in-Office of the Government, a new chapter of European history will open on 26 May, a chapter to be built with collaboration and with all the voices, the big and small, because the greatness of Europe is unity.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": null}, {"id": 46, "date": "2019-03-12.json", "name": "Josef WEIDENHOLZER", "mepid": "111014", "text": "  Mr President, I would like to make a mifful son, mr President, I would like to make a ido to the S&amp;D Group. Mr President, I would like to thank the Prime Minister, it was very inspiring to listen to you on your ideas about the future of Europe and what role Slovakia can play. Their country lies in the centre of Europe on the dividing line between East and West – for decades separated by the iron curtain and at the same time connected by the Danube, one of the most important lifelines of Europe. Since the reunification of our continent, Slovakia has undergone an astonishing development that some would not have trusted. The separation from the Czech Republic was peaceful and Slovakia, contrary to some forecasts, was able to develop very positively economically. Slovakia was the first Member State in the region to meet the convergence criteria for the introduction of the euro. This has also contributed to the remarkable economic recovery. These developments are extremely positive and your country has become an important factor in Europe on the right track. You proved this, not least with the EU Presidency two years ago.  But where there is a lot of light, there is also a lot of shadow. Unfortunately, the success has also magically attracted the moths, and for years there have been suspicions about the influence of the mafia and corrupt mechanisms, including in relation to European funds. The investigative journalist Jon Kuciak wanted to shed light on the dark and paid for it with his life. This horrific murder of him and his partner has awakened the European public, mobilised Slovak civil society and led to political consequences in your country. The European Parliament has set up a rule of law working group within the framework of the LIBE Committee, which deals in principle with these events, which do not only exist in your country. We will vote on it in the next plenary session. The balance sheet regarding your country is positive in many areas. Substantial progress has been made in investigating the murders, although the masterminds are still not really known. And it is positive to highlight cooperation with Europol, which is a real European added value.  However, there are still doubts as to whether you have really drawn lasting conclusions, both in terms of the independence of the judiciary and the freedom of the press. We urge you not to let up here and to support Parliament in its efforts to create a rule of law mechanism that allows for constant evaluation, irrespective of such tragic events. Prime Minister, this is not interference in your country's internal affairs. The rule of law serves above all the security needs of the people. No one wants to teach your country. It is about common rules and a common understanding of the law. Only in this way can East and West grow together.  In this context, President Juncker spoke today of the two lung wings of Europe. That is why it is also necessary to critically examine the role of Western countries. Here, too, there are some problems to be assessed. Too often, the East is seen as an extended workbench, where short-term profits can be made thanks to low wages and poor working conditions. This is by no means sustainable, neither for the East nor for the West. Nor is the brain drain caused by the growing labour migration. The creation of a European Labour Authority could regulate these imbalances. We support you in this endeavour, and if we do not seize this opportunity and others, such as the creation of a European unemployment insurance scheme, then we risk this Union falling apart. It is about sustainability and not just about short-term projects motivated by domestic politics.  The protection of our environment and the achievement of climate targets must not be put off. Climate change does not stop at national borders. The project concerns all of us, the East and the West. But we will only be able to win people over to sustainable change if this goes along with more fairness and social justice. This has long since been a matter of national competence. European action is necessary – determined and forward-looking. East and West will only grow together if common solutions are sought – basic social security, minimum wages and equal pay in the workplace, fair conditions in the digital sector, etc. A social Europe is the best putty for our continent, which is currently stirred up by stoked fears.

Unfortunately, recently, it has been openly questioned not only by various extremists, but also by part of the governing coalition. Undermining our strategic alliances and recklessly overtaking Russia are contrary to the interests of Slovakia and the European Union. If we want to be a credible partner for our allies, we need to be consistent. We must also be clear towards the public in Slovakia. Not to approach lies or to inducing fear just because of the higher popularity. Yes, it's easier for people to mobilize to negative emotions, but it's dangerous to mess with it. It can easily get out of lock and be destructive. Therefore, today, more than in the past, we must offer not only Slovakia, but also Europe a positive vision. A vision of a fair, safe and well-managed society. Places where people want to live, work, raise their children. I believe we can agree on such a vision.

We have met a couple of times in the past year following the very dramatic events in your country, the murder of Ján Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová, but I will come back to that in a minute. I was visiting your country as the Chair of the Rule of Law Monitoring Group, and I went to Slovakia with some critical questions, but it also made me feel that we have a special bond as Europeans. I have a special place in my heart for Slovakia and the Slovaks now. I very much agree with one thing you said, and I think that this is key: there is no Eastern Europe or Western Europe or Central Europe – there is only one Europe. It is about time for everybody to start feeling that, particularly in Western Europe, where they are still blind on one side.  I very much welcome your speech; it shows leadership in Europe. It was a very pro-European and ambitious speech, and it clarifies what ALDE also feels: the European Union needs to be much more than mere technocratic intergovernmental cooperation. In the world of today, we need a fully-fledged political union to give an answer to all the political challenges that we have, because that is the only way to remain a global leader. Your speech was excellent, but as we all know, true leadership is not in words – it is in actions. Like many countries in Europe and in the wider world, your country is witnessing deep divisions, and forces are pulling it in different directions. I just referred to my visit as the Chair of the Rule of Law Monitoring Group, and I have seen that there are many positive developments in Slovakia. I have seen that the institutions are strong and that civic engagement is extremely strong in Slovakia, and I commend the Slovak people for that. Many concerns remain, however, and new ones are also emerging.  I would urge you to show the same leadership in tackling these concerns, because in a sense you hold the key. You hold the key to the future of the European Union, and the choices that you make will determine not only the future of your country, but also that of the European Union as a whole. You can show which forces will prevail in the European Union.  You have a choice, and this will be a burden on your shoulders, I warn you. You are at the fork in the road. Do you want to join and strengthen the ranks of those who are wrecking the European Union, those who put short-term electoral gains, or even material gains, before the general interest – or worse, the ranks of those who are corrupt, even connected to organised crime? Or do you want to go down in history as a statesman, somebody courageous and wise in difficult times, who led his country forward, making it a role model for others, a leader in the Europe of the future. So do you choose the old Europe or the new Europe? I hope, and trust, that you will choose leadership for the future, and I shall be very specific. I would strongly recommend that you break ranks with Mr Fico, because he is the old Slovakia – you are the new Slovakia – and show the world that there is truly a new hand at the helm in Slovakia. You can also show them that the Visegrád Four is staunchly pro-European and not the vehicle of reactionary nationalist autocrats. It is very important that those guilty of the murder of Ján and Martina are brought to trial – not just those who actually carried out the murder and were arrested, but the brains behind it. That is crucial for trust in the Slovak authorities.  I also count on you to make sure that the nominations of nine Constitutional Court judges happen very shortly, because the Constitutional Court is effectively not operational. I would also urge you to reverse the changes to the media law, because in practice it means severe restrictions on freedom of speech. Finally, I would call on you next month to decide to extend to cooperation with Europol, and not just for the investigation into the murder of Ján and Martina, but also the other parts of the investigation that have been split off by the Ministry of Justice into corruption and fraud and all the other things. In other words, I have just put a burden on your shoulder and I am asking you to choose. I am counting on your wisdom. You can count on the European Parliament, and I can also pledge my personal commitment in the next period to working with you and with the civic forces in Slovakia to make sure that you can provide this leadership in the European Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": null}, {"id": 49, "date": "2019-03-12.json", "name": "Ska KELLER", "mepid": "96734", "text": "  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Mr President, I would like to thank the Prime Minister very much for joining this debate on the future of Europe. The future of Europe has lots of different, very important, aspects and the one I would like to focus on today is the issue of democracy. I think the way in which the European Union treats democratic deficits in the future is really decisive of how we’re moving forward. There is of course also advancing the democratic procedures inside the European Union – definitely – but the question right now is also how we deal with Member States who are turning the clock backwards on the rule of law, democracy and civil liberties.  Hungary might be the worst example in the whole picture, but we also see a lot of problems in other Member States. So we should really look around and not close our eyes to what’s happening in terms of media freedom, freedom of association and freedom of speech – all of those things which are very, very important. In Slovakia you have the situation where a journalist was murdered because of his investigation into corruption and fraud, and that is something which we need to deal with. We need to make sure it never happens again anywhere in the European Union.  So it’s really time that we address this issue, especially at the European Union level, because there are so many citizens out in the streets in Budapest, Warsaw and Bucharest who are asking the European Union to step up and to help them because their own governments won’t listen to them. So we need to get active on that. They are European citizens like all of us. But, instead of helping, at the European Union level we see too much infighting between parties – ‘is it your bad guys or my bad guy?’ – but we need to get beyond that so that we ensure the civil liberties and the rights of all European citizens.  For that, my group is suggesting that we set up an independent commission of experts to look into the situation of the rule of law and democracy in every single Member State all the time and is then able to give recommendations before it’s too late. It’s also a problem right now that we are only starting when things are too late. This commission would also be able to enact sanctions if necessary. Indeed, we also need to look at the European Union funds because, unfortunately, some governments use them to implement their personal pet projects, to favour certain people or to ensure favourable reporting. But the EU funds also do a lot of good. You’ve mentioned the Cohesion Funds, which are very important for many citizens. We have many Citizens’ Initiative projects going on. EU funds are important all over Europe. So we need to find a smart way to deal with that situation without cutting the support to our European citizens when we’re actually trying to hit the government and a specific action of the government. So for that we are suggesting that we ask the Commission to take over the distributing element of that whole so that the money still arrives with the citizens and for the benefit of the citizens without being used at the discretion of national government. This is certainly not the easiest answer – maybe cutting funds might be easier – but it’s one where we ensure that there remains a link between the EU institutions and citizens without allowing the governments to do whatever they want with that. Mr Prime Minister, you made a very interesting and comprehensive speech about all sorts of aspects, but you also underlined the issue of unity and understanding. I think that is very important indeed and we count on you to promote those ideas, also in the Council, which is being difficult and blocking a lot of initiatives that also come from this House.  We also count on you to implement all of those issues and promote democracy and the rule of law in Slovakia. The issue of press freedom has been mentioned. This is very important. Addressing fraud and corruption is not an easy task anywhere, but it needs to be done. There have been examples in Slovakia of how urgent that matter is. All of those issues are also very important for a well—functioning state that could put forward all of these reforms that you’ve been advocating, and of course especially also to continue the investigation into the murder of  Ján Kuciak and Martina Kušnírová will be extremely important until the masterminds have been found. I think the help of Europol will be important in that.

I believe that today's speech by the Prime Minister showed us that the attempt to demonise the countries of the Visegrad Four is simply not entirely based on the truth, and that these countries also have a lot to offer the European Union and want to present their vision for the future of Europe.  As the Prime Minister certainly knows, after the murder of Jan Kuciak and his partner, the European Parliament mourned with the Slovak people and strongly appealed for this case to be resolved as quickly as possible and justice to be served. It is certain that this case has significantly affected the functioning of the Slovak State and, unfortunately, its position externally. However, it must be seen that we have a representative of a sovereign state that is concerned with the situation and continues to take further steps to ensure that Slovakia's development fulfils the democratic values on which Slovakia was founded. The current Slovak government has prepared free lunches for primary school pupils, prepared a balanced budget for the first time in the country's history and radically increased salaries in public and state administration. Slovakia's economy is growing, unemployment is falling, and wages are rising relatively quickly. A record increase in the minimum wage is planned, which I consider to be a demonstration that Slovakia has not suffered and is dedicated to improving the quality of life on its territory at several levels. This, too, must therefore be taken into account if we want to see Slovakia, dear colleagues, in a comprehensive way.  Prime Minister, a year ago, I appealed from this place to my colleagues in the European Parliament to respect democratic control and the indivisibility of power and to let the Slovak authorities facing an extremely difficult situation act. I called for the debate on the death of Ján Kuciak to be conducted with respect to Slovakia and its democratic and independent institutions. I have also expressed my conviction that Slovakia deserves a helping hand if it asks for it and not a conviction. Your speech today assured me that this view was correct and Slovakia was, is and will be aware of the demands placed on it, and can deal with them with dignity.  However, we are now in a situation where the whole of the European Union needs a helping hand. So you, too, did not hesitate to come among us with your visions of helping Europe in a difficult hour. The debate on the future of the European Union must continue, which we should be aware of on the very day that another important Brexit vote is taking place in London. I believe that the biggest problems of the moment could be summed up in three points: the European Commission is too strong and, moreover, it is disconnected from the people, the European Parliament does not have a legislative initiative and the European Union is not democratic and social enough. In this we face the danger of climate change, which is manifested not only by extreme weather fluctuations, but also by shifting the natural strips that make previously fertile areas arid deserts. There is a loss of drinking water, animal species, melting glaciers changing the direction of ocean currents, which again affects the climate. The European Union itself simply needs to return its attention to European citizens. Now we are at the end of a five-year parliamentary term, with the European Union, or the new Commission, looking around for six months, talking for two years about nothing but migration, then another two years on Brexit, and the last six months commuting the agenda and preparing for elections. Citizens will be able to cancel the time change at the last minute and hope that it will take a few percent of the vote away from the nationalists. This is simply no longer the way to do politics for citizens. And let us face it, citizens are in the dark about the European Union and its work. European citizens' initiatives can also be proof of this. Since this instrument, many of us have promised to bridge the gap between the citizen and the European Union, but there has been bitter disappointment and calls for reform. However, even this did not work out here, as it seems that only a new restriction has been created that would allow people to participate in European democracy instead of eliminating existing problems. Prime Minister, thank you for meeting us, I wish you good luck and I firmly believe that this debate will not be about what Slovakia should do, but what we should do together as the whole of the European Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "cs", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "GUE/NGL", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 51, "date": "2019-03-12.json", "name": "Rolandas PAKSAS", "mepid": "96694", "text": "  on behalf of the EFDD Group. – Mr President, Mr Prime Minister, today and here the main question to which we have to find an answer and we do not have much time for that work is why? Finding why the reality of the European Union is fundamentally different from that of the parents of the European Community is probably the only way to find an answer to the constantly plaguing question of what is happening to us and what is being done with us. Mr Prime Minister, the idea of a Europe of nations from which it began is being destroyed by the hands of irresponsible politicians by the European Union itself. So far, it has lost only Britain, the first and last warning to those who want to replace the Union of European States with a global Europe. There is no such and cannot be. As there is no global view of Lithuania, as is the absence of today's global Slovakia, mr. Peter Pellegrini, our guest, the Slovak, who today chairs the Visegrád group of countries, which offers a much more promising model for the future of the European Union than that proposed by the federalists. Globalism imposed on society is a capital hydrant that makes a profit for every land patch and profits at all costs, degrading states and burdening people. It is a policy that is designed to turn society into a workforce without a homeland, without conviction, and states without their loyal citizens. Mr. Prime Minister, I was, I am a citizen of Lithuania. I do not want and will never be a citizen of the European Union. I believe that poles, French, Germans or Catalans who have tried their leaders in Spain would also not want to renounce their nationality and citizenship. The current European Union, plagued by uncharted identity complexes, is a severe sick person – a sick person whose talk of democracy, solidarity, deeper integration will not be cured by any goldsmith. We need a good surgeon who, for health reasons, will detract from the festering arguments of genderism, multiculturalism and globalism. Politicians must stop oppressing people under the guise of democracy and the free market, must abandon their dogmas, supposedly the only right imposes on society, must stop lying, stop scaring.

Mr President, I warmly welcome the Prime Minister of Slovakia, Mr Pellegrini, to this Parliament. I certainly do not agree with his vision of the EU , as I would like to say in advance. His political color is not mine either. But still.  I greatly appreciate the fight against corruption that the Prime Minister is leading in his country. This is a very important step in slovakia's future. Slovakia is a member of the Visegrad Group, and even president at the moment. I would like to say that the visegrad countries' policy on migration can count on my support. It is the Visegrad Group that holds up a mirror to the EU, which shows the EU how it should be done. The EU is failing hopelessly in its approach to illegal migration. Instead of ensuring watertight borders, the EU is coming up with the loser's solution, which is to legalise illegal migration.  The EU says it stands for European values, but welcomes migrants who hate these values, welcomes migrants who despise these values and would prefer to introduce Sharia law into the EU as soon as possible. It is the Visegrad countries that are genuinely defending European values, standing for a Europe that defends its freedoms, its human rights. That is why I would like to express my support for Mr Pellegrini and the Slovak Government in their rejection of the UN migration pact.  In Slovakia, people are all too aware of the horrors of totalitarian domination based on a totalitarian ideology. Until 1989, the communist regime was under the suffering of the communist regime. They, the Slovaks, know what it's like to live in fear, to have to keep quiet about what you actually think and feel. Such totalitarian ideologies must not gain a foothold in Europe. That is why it is quite right that the Central European Member States should oppose the Islamisation of their country. A religion that at the same time claims absolute control over the political domain is thus a totalitarian ideology that is incompatible with everything the EU stands for, with all European values, with all European human rights, with all European freedoms.  I would add that there has often been talk here of fake news, including by Mr Pellegrini and also by various speakers. It is freedom of expression that is at the heart of our democracy. It is precisely by constantly calling for the treatment of fake news, but at the same time to cast itself as the one who decides on it and thereby smoling any criticism of policy, that is worthy of a dictatorship. That is why I am also warning Mr Pellegrini not to support the EU that is so dangerous to freedom of expression.  I call on the Commission to take an example to Slovakia to tackle corruption in its own ranks. To remove Mr Selmayr from office. To stop funneling billions to corrupt countries like Ukraine and to half of Africa, where corruption is the most common thing in the world. I call on the Commission to take an example of the resilience of the Visegrad countries to illegal migrants that are in no way adaptable to our societies. Let the EU close its borders, both between member states and with third countries, and let the EU reject the UN migration pact. That is why I call on the Commission to give the Member States' own identity the highest priority so that internal security can be put in order.

I would like to thank the Prime Minister very warmly for his speech and start by thanking him for his unequivocal declaration and determination to investigate the murder of a Slovak journalist.

Firstly, the concern – expressed in the Prime Minister's speech – not to divide Europe into western and eastern europe, not to multiply mistrust. All the more so because a great many of the problems facing Europe stem not from the experience of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, but also from the threat to the stability of the euro area. Secondly, seeing regional integration as a component of wider integration. It is great that the Prime Minister mentioned the name of the forerunner of European integration, Milan Hodza.

I would like to begin by thanking you very much for the words of support that you have addressed to the Slovak Republic. Also for the words of appreciation in those areas where the Slovak Republic has done a great deal of work and moved very forward. I want to assure you all that the government under my leadership will not in any way change our clear pro-European, our clear proseveroatlantic course. Although there may be opinions or some other views within the governing coalition on the matter, I want to guarantee that the government responsible for the foreign policy of the Slovak Republic will continue to act as I said. Slovakia belongs to the European Union, Slovakia has no room for its existence other than the European Union, and Slovakia is aware that, even in the field of security and defence, it will never be able to defend itself and always wants and will always be a responsible member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. And I would like to remind you that, thanks also to the excellent economic results of my country, as my colleague from the Czech Republic mentioned here, even though we are trying to raise people's quality of life and invest a huge amount of money in social measures, we are still able to find the resources to meet our commitment and meet 2% of gross domestic product expenditure on our defence and security as soon as possible, unlike many NATO member countries. This is also not the norm in other larger countries that are NATO member countries, let alone the quality and combat capabilities of their armies, which we can read about in the media. I want to assure you that nothing changes on this, and if my colleague from the Netherlands asked me which party I would choose, then I want to reassure her that I will choose the right one and I will always stand on the side of those ideas that I also raised in my speech, because I believe that they are the only right solution for my country. We touched several – and I expected it, because it is very fresh – and the tragic event concerning the murder of a journalist. I would like to remind you that, before this happened, Slovakia belonged to forgive me if I made a mischug, but we were 17th in the world in terms of freedom of speech and the press. I repeat the 17th, that is, if we have 28 Member States, you can imagine how many of them – and often many older democracies – have not reached and are below the level of freedom of speech and the press as recognised in the Slovak Republic. I want to emphasise this, because maybe little is known about it, and maybe you don't always know everything about it either. We are very sorry for the tragedy that has occurred, I want to assure you that we will do everything we can to send out a clear signal that we will never tolerate such things in Slovakia and that we will do everything we can to ensure that such crimes do not happen again, not only in Slovakia, but nowhere in the world, anywhere in Europe. And, colleague, I don't think you're going to comment on the resignation of the Prime Minister and the departure of some ministers in the way you did, that you said, \"Well, the Prime Minister just resigned.\" The prime minister's resignation is a major political gesture and probably the highest the leader in the country can make. I want to assure you that we are doing everything we can to punish the culprits, and the perpetrators of the murder, along with the orderer, are most likely already in prison and will await a fair trial. Let us wish together that nowhere on European soil would such things happen any more. If we are talking about the fight against corruption, against the misuse of certain subsidy schemes and EU funds, I would like to assure you that here too, the Slovak Republic is taking many measures and things that may have happened in Slovakia, perhaps sometime in 2016, 2016, can no longer happen in 2018 or 2019, because we have already responded to the findings and measures. And I always appreciate very constructive discussions with the committee that comes or comes to Slovakia, where we can exchange information with each other and where we can say what we have already managed and identify areas where we still have work to do.  And Slovakia is a democratic country in which our parliamentary system is fully respected, where the power of government comes from parliament, where the government is accountable to the National Council and the coalition majority. I would remind you that, in the area of agro-subsidies, even if mistakes are made, Slovakia is the second eu-wide country after Estonia, with the lowest error rate of 0.5% of all agri-subsidies. Of course, they are very visible , but that does not mean that the whole system is dysfunctional, so I would ask you not to resort to flat-rate and from some partial problems the country as a whole every time you talk about the Slovak Republic. I will never allow myself to do that, and I have not allowed myself to say to your country, based on any specific events in one of your countries, that it looks like it everywhere and that those countries work that way. That wouldn't be fair, and that's why, as I he said, we must respect each other – and thank you for saying this to many – we must stop sharing west and east, we must stop sharing into large and small, we must stop sharing north and south, we must stop sharing with the rich and the poor. I am very pleased that my colleague, who was the first to speak, said at the end of the election and used the expression when the demands of both large and small will be heard. And I fully agree with you, colleague, because only then will the Union be able to function with one voice when both the big and the small listen to each other, because that unity in diversity is the key and the foundation on which the EU is built. Finally, let me say one more thing, because you have all mentioned that we need to move from words to deeds, and I fully agree with you, because unless the citizens of the European Union, Europeans feel that we are not only talking, but also really solving their daily problems, that we are not really dealing with pseudothemes that do not plague our citizens on a daily basis, but that we are dealing with precisely that. , which angers them every day and what they would need to solve, only then will we be able to maintain support, broad support for Europeans in the European Union project. Finally, Perhaps I would use an expression or phrase: the citizens of the European Union must first of all be able to rely on the European Union. The citizens of the European Union must first rely on the European Union, on being able to ensure their protection, their prosperity, their democratic values. First of all, the citizens of the European Union must rely on the European Union, only then must we do everything we can to ensure that everyone around us can rely on the European Union. First of all, the European Union and the whole project must be trusted by those who live in it, and only then can we deal with whether we are good enough to be able to rely on us and the whole world.

Segregation in education, housing, access to the labour market and health care are commonplace, for example in the village of Rankovce, where about 300 Slovak Roma live and have to get their water from two wells with hand pumps. According to the European Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA), 43% of schoolchildren with a Romno background in Slovakia have been subjected to anti-Gypsy insults in the last 12 months. More than half of the respondents feel discriminated against in the profession because of their membership of the minority. Unfortunately, we also have similar figures in Germany. It is sad – physical violence due to anti-Gypsy hatred is experienced in Slovakia by one in nine People in Rome or Romni. The proportion of young people from the minority without a job or training has risen sharply, while the figures for the majority population are stable. In addition, the attendance of children with a Romno background has increased in percentage terms in recent years, but is lagging behind that of the majority population in the order of magnitude. I attended a Roma high school in Kosice, where 90% of the pupils were Roma and the rest were difficult to educate from the majority population.

I'll touch the agri-food. I fully agree with what the Member has said with regard to the control of these funds and, of course, the prevention of any defrauding. But I would like to ask all of you HERE - MEPs - what kind of system this is if, under the Brussels regulation, we distribute subsidies on the basis of managed hectares, regardless of whether someone is doing something about it or mowing grass only twice a year. How is it possible that we are forced to pay everyone a certain amount of European money across the board, without the possibility of cutting this money to those who do nothing on that land, do not employ anyone, produce nothing, do nothing, do nothing, ensure nothing or have no contribution to the self-sufficiency of Slovakia or Europe. How is this possible? Then it becomes not a real system for supporting agriculture, but it is a fight over subsidies, that is, a war, who will have on paper how many hectares, cut twice a year, sit at home and receive subsidies. This is flawed, and we need to change this so that we do not support from European money those who do nothing on European soil and only mow twice. They can do this without needing the resources of the European Union to do so. Secondly, my fellow Member from Romania: Slovakia has always clearly supported and will support that, if a country fulfils any conditions, that is to say, in this case, the conditions for joining Schengen, it is important that it is given a clear answer so that Romania and Bulgaria do not play a political game, but if they are technically ready then we should, of course, be absolutely clear about when and by what date Bulgaria and Romania will join Schengen. , already in view of the situation we are facing when the European Union's external borders need to be protected. I don't know what we're hesitant about and what the political games are. Likewise, the Union, somewhat by turning, should also treat the countries of the Western Balkans fairly, because we cannot endlessly tell them: 'do such a reform, change that, open such a chapter, I do not know what spros...'. Painful things have to be done by those countries. And by the time those countries tolerate this and by when the citizens will be able and willing to make such reforms, when they do not see the light at the end of the tunnel, and we are unable to answer them when they can become part of this, as we call it, an elite club. These are precisely the things where the Union makes a mistake and where it does not send out fundamental ideas around where necessary.

I personally don’t support Mrs May’s hard Brexit deal as it recognises her regrettable red lines to leave the EU single market and customs union, so it can never really deliver UK—EU frictionless trade.  Nevertheless, there is one part of the Withdrawal Agreement I do strongly agree with, which is its aspiration to keep the United Kingdom closely linked to the EU’s internal and external security arrangements. On internal security, I particularly fear now a security cliff edge if there’s a no-deal scenario, excluding the United Kingdom’s access to key EU databases and instruments such as the Schengen Information System (SIS) and the Anti-Counterfeiting Rapid Intelligence System (ACRIS) database.

Because I will not tolerate, although I am in the European Parliament, for a Member of the European Parliament to tell such false truths and lies. If you mentioned Mr. Fisher and you want to give the impression that he was murdered for plots and so on, then I will bring to your attention the statements of his own son, who said that Mr. Fisher is being abused by those who organize protests, that these people did not know him in his life, never met him, that his father was in trouble a long time ago and has been worried about some other things for months. and that he does not want anyone to associate his death, which is properly investigated and which shows that it was completely different from what you said, that he does not want his father to be drawn into such political games. So I would ask you, Member, not to draw conclusions and to talk about the Slovak Republic, something that is not at all true, because I will never allow myself to do so, and I have never allowed myself to do so in relation to the Czech Republic, even though you also have your own problems there. So I'm going to ask you for correctness, because only then will we be able to have a responsible debate. Yes. If you are talking about agro-subsidies, I have just spoken. Change is needed so that we do not support those who just have land on paper, do nothing on it, contribute to the self-sufficiency of the European Union and receive the same share of European money as those who loo and work there from morning to evening. And if Mrs Smolková asked me about Nord Stream 2: yes, here too, there has been a huge amount of talk about how we must and should help Ukraine. But this is an excellent case of how we can hurt her. The Slovak Republic has fulfilled its task and made technical changes in order to reverse the flow – and to this day, even this winter, we supply Ukraine through our transit pipeline towards Ukraine in order to guarantee their energy security. But there are countries that are also able to sell off this idea that we should take care of Ukraine and are willing to tolerate a bypass that, once they have arrived, it will be possible to bypass the whole of Ukraine. And I am very sorry that, even with the recent allocation of agencies, which you, Commissioner, referred to – there were two – and which everyone has made clear are to end up in one of the new countries of the European Union and should end up in one where there is no agency yet, they have both ended up in the old country, the Member State of the Union, and ended up in those countries where there are already agencies. And then it is difficult to talk about the fact that let us stop sharing the old and the new, the west and east, and the rich and the poor, when even such manifestations give a clear signal as it really is.

What is the role of the V4 countries, but what should be the role of all the leaders, all 28 and 27 countries of the European Union? The main task, both mine and my colleagues, must be one thing: for people in our countries to live well. That is the only and clear goal with which we are taking over leadership and mandate, and that is all we have to get up with in the morning and fall asleep in the evening so that our citizens can live well and peacefully. Therefore, I always respect, if we are talking about someone and something, whether we have achieved this goal first, so that we can then engage in take-off and noble debates about some other things. How can you force the citizens of the European Union to discuss some pseudotheses unless they take out a paycheck or have a job, or as seniors who receive their pension here, live in a poverty zone. Let us first sort out these things, and then we can bring to our debates noble and big themes that, of course, belong to modern society, but unless we have the homework done, that Europeans will not be happy and well-lived, let us first do our part. And I am pleased that people are starting to live better in our region than they used to, that our region is thriving economically, both socially and culturally and socially, and I am reasonably proud of that.  And thank you for the words of support to all those who supported us and who also supported the Slovak Republic in some comments that already go beyond the powers of a particular Member, sometimes standards of decent behaviour. Finally, Mr President, colleagues, let me state that the European Union will remain a pillar of stability, freedom and prosperity for Slovakia, for us. Yes, I am aware of both our weaknesses and our mistakes and those of the European Union, but we want to tackle them together as part of the further construction of the European project. We have common challenges economically, socially, environmentally, here in these areas, let us please seek unity together. I reiterate technological developments, which are extremely important and where we must not stand behind other parts of the world.  If we are talking about cohesion, please let us not bring politics into it and whether or not someone wants to continue cohesion. Cohesion was created to help us close the major regional disparities not only between Member States, but also within the Member States. Cohesion is not supposed to be a hostage to political games. If we have to say with regret that the process of reducing regional disparities in the European Union has stalled, that is the appalling news that it has stalled, so to have a debate on what the future of cohesion should be is perverse. Ladies and gentlemen, cohesion must be there as long as the regional differences here are as pronounced as they are.

They bear the brunt of the crisis, from rescuing banks to balancing state budgets. Taxes have risen, public services have increased, there has been less access to education, health care, unemployment benefits, support for the most vulnerable. Millions lost their jobs, and when they found a new employer, they often had to accept extremely unfaithful employment contracts. It's a mass scene that working people live below the living wage. Mass child poverty, vulnerability. Desperation is a breeding ground for extremists who are now conspiring to destroy the entire EU. Neither the state nor the economy reciprocated the sacrifice of taxpayers. In the long term, the information revolution threatens to bring down labour. We need a fundamental turnaround. The social market economy must be restored, incomes redistrebuted – for the benefit of workers. In addition to creating jobs, we must use the strength of the European Union to guarantee a minimum level of humane wages and pensions, support for families with children. We must eradicate child poverty throughout the EU. A European multi-tax should be levied on large companies to finance this. We must put an end to tax evasion, to the robbery of workers.

Sadly, across the world, up to half of all timber still comes from illegal sources. Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) is a good thing, but the voluntary approach alone is not going to defeat the illegal timber trade. My view is that the UK and the EU need to go further with legislation banning all imports of illegal and destructively logged timber, coupled with more support to improve governance and stamp out corruption in timber producing countries.

This report, like UN Resolution 1325, rightly accepts that women experience conflicts differently from men. Take Kashmir, where 8 000 men are unaccounted for since 1989, leaving thousands of half-widows living in poverty, lacking property rights and unable to remarry, pellet guns blinding and maiming and the use of rape as a weapon of war.

A major challenge for us is always to focus even more on the day—to—day implementation of our extensive toolbox and convince partners to deliver on existing commitments and obligations.  Our current EU human rights toolbox is already quite comprehensive, encompassing a strong multilateral and bilateral dimension. The Union will continue to denounce human rights violations and abuses wherever they are committed, to call on state and non-state actors to prevent them, and to seek justice and accountability. There is no doubt about that. It’s true that the global landscape is rapidly evolving and we need to ensure that the European Union is adequately equipped to remain a leader in the field of human rights. In this context, a targeted assessment is ongoing as to how a European Union horizontal human rights sanction regime might bring added value in our collective efforts to further realise human rights and prevent gross violations or abuses of human rights. Here the issue of the scope of a possible future regime will be particularly important and the need to define which type of violations would fall under such a regime. Should such a regime, for example, focus on gross and systematic human rights violations? Should it cover violations of international humanitarian law? Should it address corruption cases? Another important question is the interplay between such a potential regime and other existing EU sanctions regimes, but also regimes established at UN and national level. Human rights violations are already addressed in a number of geographical sanction regimes, for example, in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Iran and Myanmar. Here we should consider whether the potential of integrating human rights into geographical regimes has been fully exploited. Obviously, there are some existing gaps, since geographical sanction regimes by definition are limited in focus. Could a horizontal human rights sanction regime usefully fill such a gap and offer a more flexible approach? Last but not least, sanctions listings must be underpinned by robust, open—source evidence in order to be upheld in court. Listings are reviewed regularly and listed persons have the right to have their delisting requests considered. Respecting due process is an overarching principle underpinning all sanction regimes, but even more so in the context of a potential human rights regime. Given these multiple important issues, I am therefore pleased that expert discussions are taking place in the Council to look in detail at all these elements. Once the experts have finalised their discussions, more political discussions can take place. The creation of any new regime is a matter for the 28 Member States to agree by unanimity, as is the imposition of concrete sanctions. Thank you for your attention and your interest. I am looking forward to our discussion.

To name a European human rights violations sanctions regime after Sergei Magnitsky would send an unambiguous message to the human rights abusers in our closest neighbourhood that Europe is going to create serious consequences for them and around the world. Magnitsky stood up to the corruption of the Putin regime. The way in which the Russian Government tried to cover up his murder and exonerate the people involved became a symbol of impunity worldwide. That is why Magnitsky’s name speaks to people everywhere.

Given that the UN Security Council and the UN generally is often paralysed and blocked by vetoes, the EU should show leadership and join the coalition of the willing – if you want to look at it that way – between the USA, the UK, Canada and the Baltic states, which already have ‘Magnitsky’ laws. Targeted human rights sanctions, including asset freezes, entry bans and also the calling out by name of perpetrators of the worst human rights violations, whether they be state or non-state actors, can make a huge difference, including in terms of differentiating between the punishment of individuals versus hitting entire populations. It is the elites who often participate in these human rights violations who enjoy buying real estate in Europe, sending their children to our top universities or going shopping in our wonderful capitals. We cannot allow such ‘business as usual’ to continue for the murderers of journalists or the rapists of women. When we talk about sanctions regimes, let us also look at ourselves critically because, despite sanctions being in place, Ali Mamlouk from Syria, on our blacklist, visited Italy, companies from the EU built the Kerch Strait Bridge, chemicals were exported from Belgium to Syria – and the list goes on. Clearly we’re only as credible as the weakest link in our own behaviour.

Osman Kavala, a leading figure in Turkey’s civil society, and one of the many victims of President Erdoğan’s witch-hunt against his critics, was arrested in October 2017. Osman and 15 others heard the charges against them last week. They are being held responsible for an attempt to overthrow the government and are facing life imprisonment without parole if found guilty. The 657-page indictment talks of the spontaneous wave of anti-government Gezi protests in 2013, which have now been reframed as an outcome of an international conspiracy to unseat the government. The evidence against Kavala: in some intercepted calls, he is offering to lend a plastic folding table and in another call, he agrees to send some packages of fruit juice and milk. The indictment includes no evidence of Osman or any of the others planning the protest, let alone an uprising. One could have a good laugh about this if it wasn’t so serious. This is the level to which Turkey’s democracy has sunk.  And now, what is the answer of the EU to all of this? What is the answer to blatant human rights violations in our neighbouring country? During the last five years, the European Parliament has taken the lead in not only speaking out, but also asking the Commission and the Council to use all available tools to send a firm signal to President Erdoğan and prevent further backsliding and, on the other hand, to show Turkey’s citizens who adhere to values of freedom, human rights and the rule of law that the EU stands by their side. But so far, our European leaders have bitterly failed in doing so. Turkey has disappeared from our attention. It is no longer in the news, except when EU nationals are concerned. It seems that our government leaders have accepted that the situation in Turkey is as it is. Our calls for respect of fundamental rights have not only fallen on deaf ears in Ankara, but also in EU capitals. The red lines of this House have all been crossed. Severe human rights violations continue. The rule of law has been dismantled. Turkey is the record holder of jailed journalists and on top of that, the new constitution consolidates Erdoğan’s authoritarianism. That is why we asked the Council to formally suspend the accession talks with Turkey. Not that anyone was seriously considering accession under the current circumstances, but continuing talks on EU integration with President Erdoğan is a charade.  We want to hear what the EU will do for Osman Kavala. What will the EU do for Selahattin Demirtaş, the opposition leader who was imprisoned for two and a half years, for the other members of parliament in jail, for the tens of thousands of people who have been jailed without a fair trial, for the LGBTI activists, for the Saturday mothers who are no longer allowed to protest, for the brave Turkish women who, on 8 March, went out on the streets and were met with rubber bullets fired at them by the police? The silence of the Council is fuelling Erdoğan’s authoritarianism. It is also fuelling the disappointment of Turkey’s democrats. It is time to come up with a strategy. You can start on one this Friday, when you will have a meeting with Turkey’s Foreign Minister.  President, allow me also after these five years, to thank my colleague shadow rapporteurs who have been working on this file for the last five years in good cooperation.

We take note of the clear messages and concerns referred to in your resolution. We are continuing to follow domestic developments in Turkey very closely, in particular the implementation of the constitutional amendments. Particularly worrying in this respect, as you have also rightly noted on many occasions, is the continuing backsliding in the areas of rule of law and respect for fundamental rights, also highlighted in the Commissionʼs 2018 communication on enlargement policy. These concerns were clearly reflected in last June’s Council conclusions, as well as in Parliament’s report on the table today. In its conclusions of 18 July 2016, the Council strongly condemned the 15 July coup attempt and expressed solidarity with the Turkish people and full support for the democratic institutions of Turkey. The EU recognises the serious security threats that Turkey has faced. However, the disproportionate scale and scope of measures taken in the aftermath of the failed coup attempt also continue to raise serious concern. Turkey has been moving further away from the EU, and we are not currently in a ‘business as usual’ situation. While noting your call for a formal suspension of accession negotiations with Turkey, let me remind you that the Council noted in its June 2018 conclusions that Turkey’s accession negotiations have effectively come to a standstill, due to the issues just outlined. At the same time, we agree with you that it is important not to close the door to Turkey, but to keep the channels of communication open; the Council maintains that continued engagement and an open and frank dialogue with Turkey, as a candidate country and a key partner of the EU in many areas, remains important and is in the best interests of both sides. I refer in particular to the common challenges that we face and the need to cooperate in essential areas of joint interest such as migration, counterterrorism, energy, transport, economy and trade. The EU-Turkey Joint Action Plan for refugees and migration management and the March 2016 EU-Turkey statement are continuing to be implemented in the interest of both parties. This successful cooperation has led to a drastic decrease in deaths at sea, a substantial reduction in irregular migrant arrivals from Turkey, and a better future for the Syrian migrants in Turkey, to which the EU-funded Facility for refugees in Turkey is continuing to contribute. The Council fully subscribes to Parliament’s acknowledgement of the important role played by Turkey in responding to the migration crisis, as confirmed in its conclusions commending Turkey for its renewed efforts and constructive cooperation. At the same time, Turkey needs to commit to a normalisation of relations with Cyprus and fully implement the provisions of the Additional Protocol to the Association Agreement. Let me use this opportunity to assure you that we, as the Presidency, will therefore continue to raise these important matters with our Turkish interlocutors at every level and on every occasion, and do our utmost to persuade Turkey to do its part and live up to its promises of reform.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": null}, {"id": 163, "date": "2019-03-12.json", "name": "Kati PIRI", "mepid": "37229", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, let me start by congratulating the rapporteur, Kati Piri, and all the shadow rapporteurs, not only for this year but also in previous years, for all their excellent work on Turkey – a candidate country and, of course, a partner of strategic importance to the European Union. In relation to the rule of law and human rights, the negative developments that the Commission identified in its last – 2018 – report have continued. They have caused further serious concerns about the direction that the Turkish leadership is taking. The recent indictment against Osman Kavala, and 15 other highly respected civil society actors, exemplifies the increasing pressure that civil society is facing. It also casts doubt as to whether the judicial process in Turkey respects the principles of the presumption of innocence and the right to a fair trial. Honourable Members, Turkey says it remains committed to its goal of EU accession. It should not then be surprised that we are following developments in Turkey very closely and that we raise our strong concerns when the values and principles on which the European Union is founded – and to which Turkey too has officially committed as a member of the Council of Europe – are being ignored. On the contrary, one would expect Turkey to carry out the necessary reforms. But Turkey is also, and will remain, our neighbour and a partner of strategic importance for the European Union, with whom we work closely on areas such as energy, counterterrorism, trade and migration. Turkey is a key player in regions that are of strategic interest for the European Union. It also hosts the largest refugee population in the world, and our cooperation under the Facility for Refugees is an example of successful cooperation. A series of high-level sectoral dialogues on political issues, transport and the economy has taken place recently and an Association Council will be convened later this week. These meetings provide useful platforms not only to further our cooperation but also to share our grave concerns. Our engagement is not unconditional: open dialogue is not uncritical dialogue. Most recently, at our high-level political dialogue on 22 November in Ankara, the High Representative and I made it clear to our Turkish counterparts that there is an urgent need for Turkey to reverse its policy stance if it seriously wants EU-Turkey relations to improve. And during the recent high-level economic dialogue, Vice-President Katainen specifically raised our concerns about press freedom, in particular the accreditation of foreign journalists. We also continue to call on Turkey to improve its relations with all our Member States bilaterally, especially with Cyprus. We have emphasised that the Turkish Government should refrain from provocative and illegal actions, notably in the eastern Mediterranean and in the Aegean. At the same time, we must not lose sight of the long term and, perhaps even more importantly, of the many people in Turkey who are directly affected by the current downward trend on fundamental freedoms. We must keep our hands stretched out towards them, especially, and help them to defend our shared European values.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": null}, {"id": 164, "date": "2019-03-12.json", "name": "Renate SOMMER", "mepid": "4282", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Kati Piri, and also the shadow rapporteurs from the other groups for their very good cooperation over the years.  In the end, we were able to agree on a good text, which only needs to be improved on a point-by-point basis. And on one point, I think, he needs to be improved, which is that he is only calling for the accession negotiations to be suspended, and this demand is not new. We raised it in case a presidential system is established, thereby abolishing democracy in Turkey. But that, of course, did not impress the Erdogan regime in any way. The Constitution has been amended, democracy and the rule of law have been abolished. Even if the accession negotiations were suspended, Turkey would still be entitled to payment of the pre-accession funds. With this money, however, we are de facto supporting the Turkish Government, which tramples on human rights and civil liberties, persecutes critics and opponents abroad, arrests them and sentences them to heavy prison sentences. A veritable witch-hunt hits the Gülen supporters. Can we want that? Do we help the critics of the regime in this way?  My group wants to end the accession negotiations once and for all, and I support that. We could then reallocate the pre-accession funds to support Turkish civil society. Let us be honest – everyone knows that it is impossible to take in Turkey and that the European Union itself is in no way capable of enlargement for a long time.

I remain convinced that Turkey is an important partner of the EU. The enlargement process has allowed us to significantly influence Turkey’s path towards democracy in the last decades – maybe for too long. With regret I can only note the shredding of some of the democratic achievements since 2016. I trust nevertheless that a European Turkey is for the benefit of all: the EU, NATO and each of our Member States. Europe should be vigilant and firm when it comes to condemning the violations of human rights, freedom and the rule of law in Turkey, while always keeping up a strong, regular and constructive dialogue with this important country. Both are imperatives. This also includes an intensive dialogue on alignment of foreign policy, defence and security issues, with a strong focus on counterterrorism and matters of military and strategic importance, as Turkey is a very important member of the military alliance, NATO. Finally, while Turkey is the EU’s fifth largest trading partner and Europe is by far Turkey’s largest economic partner, with Germany in the lead, the customs union is still the world one.

It is now a report on regress. A lot has happened over the past year and, while it’s absolutely legitimate to hold the perpetrators of the failed coup and the attack on the Grand National Assembly to account, nothing justifies the overreaction that continues to haunt Turkey: hundreds of thousands fired from their jobs or arrested; abuse of the state of emergency and counterterrorism measures; limitations to press and internet freedom; and trumped-up charges to accuse civil society leaders, such as Osman Kavala. All in all, core principles are at stake: the independence of the judiciary, the separation of powers and the rule of law. These developments impact disproportionately on the opposition and on women, LGBTI people, journalists, religious minorities, human rights defenders and other minorities. But everybody in Turkey, whether openly or quietly in their hearts, knows what is going on and fears what may yet come. A fear of what could get worse still seems to paralyse the Commission and the Council too. Or is it the cynical outsourcing of the sheltering of refugees – for which Turkey deserves our support – that risks overshadowing everything else? I believe that our credibility is at stake and I insist that our words and principles must have meaning. As we warned in previous years, with the adoption of the constitutional reform package, a presidential system is now in place, one that lacks checks and balances, not so much according to us but according to the Venice Commission.

It started with the invasion of Afrin back in January 2018. I visited Turkey twice last year. Last summer I made a visit to Diyarbakir. I interviewed politicians, networks, organisations and citizens in general about the situation there. I visited the sur district, or rather looked in over what was left of Sur from above the World Heritage walls. I also attended a full day of the trial in Ankara against, among others, the Turkish Green spokesmen, who are accused of having signed a petition against the invasion of Afrin. I met academics, the EU representation and others. I asked everyone the same question about how they saw the further accession negotiations. And I got the same answer: \"Be very tough on the regime, but don't close the door completely to membership.\"  During my second visit in December, I met, in addition to organisations and politicians, representatives of the armed forces and a number of Syrian rebel groups. On the agenda was one, as they put it, \"imminent purging of terrorists in northern Syria\". Several of them referred to our joint work on combating terrorism and asked for our support for their planned operation in Syria. The aim of the operation is to weed out virtually all the Kurdish groups that have so successfully fought Daesh, and to which we should instead be eternally grateful.  To be a candidate country obliges. EU membership is based on respect for human rights, including minority rights, freedom of the press, freedom of expression, independence of the courts. In this House, we are tired of seeing President Erdoğan's rule take leaps and bounds away from our common values. They cannot be explained away by the failed coup attempt in 2016, and there are no acceptable excuses for invasions by other countries. But we have different views on the accession negotiations. From us Greens – we choose to listen to the democrats and minorities. We want to be tough on the regime, but we do not want to suspend the negotiations.

Mr President, dear Mr Hahn, Mrs Piri, ladies and gentlemen, perhaps this is my last substantive intervention before the European Parliament, a very ambitious experiment undertaken by humanity. But speaking of Turkey, I have to tell you – and this is not just about Turkey – we lack solidarity, ladies and gentlemen, between the Member States and, unfortunately, sometimes also between the peoples. Cyprus is not – I come from Cyprus and I have to say a few words – Cyprus is not an occupied country in this debate, it is not a necessary depth of the debate that is taking place here today.

Mr Çavuşoğlu, recently, but also many other officials – give me a few seconds, Mr President – often-densely refer to the phrase 'we are ready for any solution in Cyprus'. This includes the certain position that they are looking for a two-state solution. There can be no Cypriot who will lift the pen to sign a two-state solution. That is why my message to Turkish officials, but also to any Cypriot, is that any discussion of a two-state solution must be immediately suspended. Only the Federation can be a way out of solving this great problem.

In short, erdogan's purge shows no sign of subsiders and now seems to be fighting particularly in the media, which are accused of putting the sultan-president in a bad light.

Let me first come back to what the Council, as the presidency, has said – because you say that all channels of communication must be open with Turkey. We all agree. But the channel of accession – that’s the one that we should close – because it has become a ridiculous channel. Minister, you said, ‘we take note and we continue to follow’, and I am very happy to hear from you in your conclusion that on Friday’s meeting with the Turkish President, you will put human rights at the top of the agenda. I’m very happy to have that commitment. But also, I want to hear from the Council, how are you going to help Turkey’s democrats? Will you provide extra funds for human rights defenders? Will you put respecting fundamental rights as a key conditionality, including in the trade relationship? I really hope that the Council will come up with a more sophisticated strategy than we have seen so far in how to deal with Turkey.  I didn’t hear more than five colleagues in this room who agree with the strategy of not having any consequences to the accession process. We have a big majority in this House to call for the formal suspension of the accession talks – to stop talks – I want to make it clear – to stop talks with President Erdoğan about accession. It doesn’t make sense. They have become totally ridiculous and incredible. But I also heard some colleagues from the far right and some members from the EPP Group who want to go one step further – not only stopping the talks, but also taking away the candidate status of Turkey. Now, I’m surprised to hear this. For 10 years, we had a Turkey rapporteur from the EPP who never made this call. If it’s really about human rights violations then stick with the majority in this House calling for the suspension of the accession talks.  Perhaps I’m still hopeful that in the years to come, in the decades to come, things in Turkey will improve. I hope we all share that things can change inside Turkey and that means we shouldn’t put a final stop forever on talks with Turkey on EU integration.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": null}, {"id": 220, "date": "2019-03-12.json", "name": "Pavel TELIČKA", "mepid": "124706", "text": "  The debate is closed.

It is important to use all the tools we have to encourage a peaceful and democratic solution, to be achieved through free and credible presidential elections. Since our last debate on Venezuela in this plenary at the end of January, tension and polarisation have further escalated and living conditions have been worsening. The number of Venezuelans leaving their country continues to grow. According to the UNHCR, some 2.7 million Venezuelans have left the country since 2015 and the number could rise to 5 million by the end of the year if the crisis continues to worsen. The recent nationwide blackout that is still affecting certain states is contributing to a further deterioration in health services and in the supply of food and water. As we all know, this crisis has at its origin a political and institutional problem. The current situation has built up over years of attacks against democracy, the constitution and fundamental human rights. The solution to the crisis needs to be political as well as democratic, peaceful and Venezuelan owned. Political prisoners need to be released and the powers of the National Assembly have to be restored as the National Assembly is currently the only democratically elected body in the country. We have also called a number of times for the constitutionally mandated immunity of all National Assembly members, and of Assembly President Juan Guaidó, to be respected. They need to be able to exercise their political mandate without fear of reprisals or intimidation. We firmly reject the use of force to resolve this situation. Any military option would only cause more human rights violations and more suffering for the people of Venezuela. At the same time, it is essential to avoid an escalation of violence within the country. We have called for a halt to attacks and intimidation against civilians and lawmakers, from both security forces and irregular armed groups. The only way to end this crisis is to let the people of Venezuela express their will through a democratic presidential election that must be free, fair, inclusive and transparent. With this goal, the European Union has promoted the creation of an international contact group on Venezuela. The purpose of this group is to help create the conditions for a political process that should lead to free and fair presidential elections. The contact group has set a clear timeframe to verify whether we can encourage some guarantees to give credibility to the electoral process. The electoral supervisory bodies need to be reformed, starting with the National Electoral Council. The electoral register needs to be updated. All political parties and leaders need to be able to compete on equal terms, and political prisoners should be released. Independent electoral observation should also be ensured. Our proposal does not aim to buy time. We are convinced that an international initiative can help build these minimum conditions, which would eventually lead to relaunching a meaningful political process and to new presidential elections. Meanwhile, it is urgent to address the pressing needs of the population. This cannot wait for a political settlement of the crisis. Lives are at risk. Humanitarian assistance needs to enter the country unimpeded and reach those in need. In the past two years, the European Union has committed more than EUR 67 million of humanitarian and development assistance and we are ready to scale up this assistance. The contact group is exploring the possibility of establishing an international mechanism for coordination and delivery of humanitarian assistance inside Venezuela in close cooperation with the United Nations and our international and local partners. The aid must be delivered impartially on the basis of the population’s real needs and not that of a political agenda. It must be distributed by independent actors under the leadership of the United Nations. Aid should never be politicised and it should serve only humanitarian purposes. The international contact group is now working on these two main areas: elections and humanitarian assistance. The group sent a technical mission to Venezuela in February to discuss with all sides the conditions and guarantees for holding credible presidential elections, and also the delivery of humanitarian assistance. A senior officials’ meeting discussed the results of the technical mission and a new ministerial meeting will be held at the end of March in Latin America. We Europeans are not neutral. More than one million Venezuelans have either a European passport or a family in Europe. We care about Venezuela and its people, and the people of Venezuela are asking for change. At the same time, we believe that change cannot be imposed from the outside. A sustainable solution can only come from the people of Venezuela. We are ready to do all in our power so that Venezuelans can be the masters of their own destiny.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": null}, {"id": 223, "date": "2019-03-12.json", "name": "Esteban GONZÁLEZ PONS", "mepid": "125027", "text": "  PPE Group. – Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if we were to run out of electricity right now, in an hour all patients who are in intensive care would die; in fifteen hours we would run out of insulin; in twenty hours, water would no longer come out of the tap; in one day the food that is in the fridges would be ruined; in two days babies in newborn units would die; within three days, the water we had stored would cease to be drinkable and, from the fifth day, patients who need dialysis would die.

The exact causes of the problem are still difficult to ascertain, given the secrecy and the ludicrous claim circulating that this was an act of sabotage by the USA. Much more likely, it seems, it was the result of underinvestment, attributable to the many years of corruption and mismanagement under the Chavez regime – a pattern we now see continuing under Maduro.

I served as the EP rapporteur for the other report as well. The first report, adopted in November 2016, was divided into two parts. It indicated major actors in this work against the EU in the presentation of hostile propaganda. It was a state actor, namely the Russian Federation, and non-state actors, predominantly radicalised Islamic organisations like Isis. This time we decided to structure the report’s recommendations differently, thanks to the contribution of representatives of major political groups in the Parliament. We divided the recommendations into parts, indicating the state of play in 2018 and targeting the hybrid warfare methods of this. We stress there the necessity to avoid censorship while countering the hostile propaganda, disinformation and misinformation that is presented to the EU and its Member States. We stress the importance of quality journalism sustaining freedom of speech and freedom of the media. We also indicate the notion of possible legislative regulatory activity, at both EU and international level. There parties indicated the necessity to even introduce humanitarian law to deal with cyber—warfare or information warfare. We stress the changing patterns of a variety of actors. In terms of radicalised organisation, we mentioned that, instead of very popular websites that increased the level of radicalisation of young people, there are methods of encrypted messaging services that are very popular. Much has been done, both within the EU institutions, EU-based institutions and organisations, and by civil society during those two years. We mention all of these activities in citations. I would like to stress the importance of the Code of Practice on Disinformation, the activity of the European Endowment for Democracy (EDD), as well as the transatlantic cooperation, and cooperation with like-minded countries and institutions like the Transatlantic Commission on Election Integrity on this. In the second part of this report, we focus on indicating types of misinformation, disinformation and hostile propaganda. The third part is dedicated to methods for safeguarding our elections. The current year, 2019, is the year of over 29 elections in EU Member States, including the European elections that are to take place at the same time. After the experience of interference by the Russian Federation in elections and referendums in the EU and elsewhere, we have to strengthen our resilience to this kind of activity. We indicate the role of East StratCom and complement its activity, also indicating two other task forces for the Western Balkans, the Middle East and the North African Gulf area.

Thanks to all who contributed and in particular to the rapporteur, Anna Elżbieta Fotyga, for delivering such a timely and helpful recommendation. It closely matches the logic and actions set out in the action plan against disinformation which the High Representative and the Commission submitted to the European Council. The response against hybrid threats should be a joint enterprise. We are doing, and will continue to do, our part, but Member States need to step up efforts collectively too, as the European Council indicated in its conclusions. The recommendation underlines the centrality of freedom of speech and expression, as well as media pluralism, to resilient democratic societies. Indeed, our fundamental values must be at the heart of our response to the challenge of disinformation. This is precisely the spirit in which we have drafted, and now are implementing, the action plan against disinformation. The report calls on the EU institutions to ensure that EU strategic communication becomes a matter of high priority on the European agenda and that the EU institutions and Member States work hand in hand in fighting against disinformation. I can assure you that all of this is already happening. However, this is a long—term endeavour which goes beyond this year’s European elections, so we are counting on the European Parliament’s continued support, not least in budgetary terms. With the action plan against disinformation, we are increasing the staffing of our three strategic communication task forces to better enable them to detect, analyse and expose disinformation, and raise awareness of its negative impact, as well as – crucially – to improve the way in which we communicate about our values and policies. Next week we launch the Rapid Alert System, as set out in the action plan. The system will make it easier for Member States to share assessments, data and best practices in tackling disinformation. This will, ahead of the European elections, bring better situational awareness, make it easier to determine responsibility for attacks and promote joint response, if and when needed, including in terms of awareness raising and increasing our society’s resilience. I appreciate your acknowledgment of the work done so far by the East StratCom Task Force, both in terms of positive communications and in addressing disinformation. I would also like to praise the other two task forces, for the Western Balkans and the South. The East StratCom Task Force had a pioneering function. To date, it has catalogued, and raised awareness of, more than 5 000 cases of disinformation coming from Russian sources. Unfortunately, the number is likely to rise further, as the problem will not go away anytime soon. It is our collective duty to keep the European elections clean from foreign interference. One way to do it is to raise awareness about the challenge, closely cooperating with the media, civil society organisations and online social media platforms. The European External Action Service is working on this in full concert with Parliament’s and the Commission’s services. Obviously, the action plan will fully respect the different national approaches, with freedom of expression and freedom of the media as guiding principles of our action. In parallel, we are building better cooperation in tackling foreign interference and hybrid threats with our international partners, such as NATO and G7. To give an example, our cooperation with NATO already involves sharing assessment reports on the information environment and conducting parallel and coordinated exercises involving hybrid threat scenarios, such as the base exercise. In addition, we should partner more with our neighbours to promote a positive European agenda. Investing in the EU’s positive communications and public diplomacy in our neighbourhood is crucial in addressing disinformation and promoting European values and interests. Cultural and economic diplomacy and close cooperation between EU Member Statesʼ missions and the European Union delegations on the ground are powerful tools for projecting a positive image of the EU in the world. The best antidote against disinformation is, on the one hand, to promote a healthy media environment and, on the other, to spread the word about the positive impact of EU policies. Our citizens, as well as the citizens of our region, have the right to make decisions based on correct information, not on fake news. They have the right to a pluralist media environment and to high—quality information. This is about the quality of our democracies and about the quality of our Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": null}, {"id": 252, "date": "2019-03-12.json", "name": "Ramona Nicole MĂNESCU", "mepid": "39717", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, I would first like to congratulate Mrs Fotyga on an excellent report, which came at the right time.

In my opinion, this has to do with the fact that our experience of organised misinformation, propaganda and incitement in our countries has now gone much deeper. The country we have to deal with the most on this issue is Russia. Not only has Ukraine become a battlefield, but Russia is now directing more and more efforts, with ever-increasing resources, to incite citizens of European countries against their governments – most recently seen during the yellow vest protests. Citizens are being incited against migrants, but also against the EU, for example during the Brexit vote. In my opinion, the Department of Strategic Communication for the Detection and Prevention of Organised Disinformation needs to be substantially strengthened. More experts need to come in, there needs to be more money in. And it is very important that this department can also cooperate with Member State authorities in the future.

It was upon a Council decision that the agreement remains a mixed one, meaning that both the EU and Member States are engaged in the process of ratification. The security situation in Afghanistan remains difficult, yet over 56% of the territory is under the control of the Afghan Government. That means that more than 65% of the population is also under the control of the Government. Since 2002, when the EU engaged in financing, more than EUR 3.66 billion of humanitarian aid has been delivered in Afghanistan. For the decade of transformation starting in 2015 we intend to deliver a further EUR 1.4 billion to stabilise this country. Efforts by the NATO International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) operation and current resolute support with the participation of many countries, including my own, has brought development to the security situation, although, after the emergence of Islamic State Khorasan (ISK), the Daesh cells and groups that emerged following operations in Iraq make this situation still vulnerable and fragile. The CAPD focuses on areas of relevance to the rule of the law, good governance, human rights, economic stabilisation and social stabilisation. We have to acknowledge and compliment the good achievements reflected in the statistics. Access to health care has increased, due to European assistance, from 9% to 57%, a huge development. Life expectancy has increased from 45 to 60. The level of education – schooling, access to schools – is much higher. Voting patterns, in terms of participation in elections and the empowerment of women, also represent achievements in this country. The agreement was signed by Vice—President / High Representative Federica Mogherini and by the Minister of Finance of Afghanistan, in the presence of the country’s President. We parliamentarians consider it regrettable that information about proceedings in the negotiation of the agreement came to this Chamber considerably late, after the signing of the agreement.

After decades of war, Afghanistan stands at a crossroads. Last year was the deadliest ever for civilians since the start of the war in 2001. Yet 2019 could be the year of peace. In recent years, the European Union has engaged even more closely with the Government of Afghanistan to accompany the country in this delicate moment of its history.  This is the goal that we set both in the Afghanistan strategy of 2017 and in our latest Council conclusions. This agreement represents the first legal framework governing EU-Afghanistan relations and is the result of a long negotiation process.  The agreement is now being applied provisionally and we already had a promising start to our structured dialogue and cooperation. Two bilateral meetings took place in 2018 where we discussed a number of key issues that we have agreed together with our Afghan friends. These include human rights, gender issues and good governance, development cooperation, trade, regional cooperation and migration. On all of these files, Afghanistan wants to make substantial progress for the benefit of its citizens and we Europeans have offered assistance and support. We paid special attention to the situation of Afghan refugees in the region. The European Union remains committed to working towards finding a comprehensive and durable regional solution by supporting the predictable, safe, orderly and dignified return of Afghan nationals residing in neighbouring countries and to continuing to implement the EU’s regional programmes on migration and forced displacement. In your report, you draw a realistic picture of the situation in Afghanistan. I would like to elaborate a little more on the current developments related to peace. The situation on the ground remains worrying. Innocent Afghan men, women and children continue to suffer from this conflict. Yet there are good reasons to hope that this year could finally bring good news for the country. President Ghani’s peace offer for the Taliban in February 2018, just a little over a year ago, has created an unprecedented opportunity for peace, and since September last year, the US and the Taliban have been negotiating international troop withdrawals and counter-terrorism commitments. We know that lasting peace will take time. A quick agreement is not necessarily a lasting one. This is why the European Union is committed to supporting Afghanistan before, during and after a peace agreement to ensure that this will be sustainable.  Last November, at the Geneva Ministerial Conference on Afghanistan, hosted by the United Nations, High Representative Mogherini made a concrete five-point offer to Afghanistan about how the European Union could support a peace deal. First, we can help make the peace process more inclusive. Second, we can assist with reforms, including in the security sector. Third, we can help with the reintegration of former fighters and their families. Fourth, we can act as a guarantor of a possible peace agreement, and fifth, we can promote regional trade and connectivity. Since then, we have been working closely with our Afghan partners to better define our assistance. We are launching a dedicated peace mechanism to help repair and build capacities for inclusive negotiations. As the High Representative said in Geneva, the Afghan people are asking to move forward and there is no going back. During the coming months, we will continue to work together with the international community to support a better electoral process for this year's presidential elections in Afghanistan. As you rightly pointed out in your report, the EU committed a large amount of funding in terms of development aid. At a Brussels conference on Afghanistan in October 2016, the EU and its Member States pledged EUR 5 billion, and this pledge is currently being operationalised. Let me also mention the fact that the EU development support for Afghanistan has a strong focus on peace and state building and supports Afghanistan in its regional contacts. With other development partners, we are exploring how to adapt the existing development programmes to a peace scenario. This would include supporting post-conflict reforms, social cohesion at community level, cross-border trade and regional connectivity. Afghanistan has a unique chance for peace. We Europeans will do everything in our power to help the people of Afghanistan turn this opportunity into a truly sustainable and lasting peace.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": null}, {"id": 288, "date": "2019-03-12.json", "name": "Bernd LANGE", "mepid": "1909", "text": "  Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on International Trade.

We are to approve an agreement which has been in force for the time being for more than a year and which has not been transparent at all in the process of trade-off. In fact, if it were not for Afghanistan, I would say: this is not the way to deal with the European Parliament! That is why I am once again making a clear statement to the Council, but also to the Commission: it is not acceptable for an agreement to be applied provisionally without this democratically elected House giving its consent.

The EU-Afghanistan Cooperation Agreement on Partnership and Development brings the EU’s relationship with Afghanistan to a new qualitative level of mutually beneficial cooperation. Undeniably, Afghanistan has made very significant progress in many fields, as rightly mentioned by Anna before. However, security concerns, corruption, human rights issues and other problems still persist, endangering the current achievements.  Afghanistan is at a crucial point in its history, as in the absence of further efforts, all of the progress and sacrifices hitherto could be wasted. Withdrawing the coalition forces prematurely could have negative consequences and should be decided by all consulting allies.  The European Union is committed to a long-term partnership with Afghanistan. Therefore, following the November 2018 Geneva Conference on Afghanistan, the European Union announced a financial package worth EUR 474 million to support state-building and public sector reforms, health, justice and elections, as well as to address migration and displacement challenges in Afghanistan.  I hope that this Agreement embedded in a regional approach which includes the Afghanistan neighbourhood, the global powers and the international community, can pave the way for a better future for the country. The first step to the path of stability is peace. Achieving a peace agreement between warring parties in Afghanistan is a priority at the moment, and I hope very much that the Qatar process of negotiations will include the Afghanistan Government in the very essence of this meaning.

However, it is not as if we have no experience with the strategy of neoliberal, so-called reforms that guide the new cooperation agreement that we are discussing here today.  As early as 2003, the West began a neo-liberal, radical market transformation of the economic system with the IMF in Afghanistan. Numerous studies and the experience of the years show that such a concept of pacification is inappropriate to improve the social situation of the population and to contribute to stabilisation. The current situation in Afghanistan is a disaster, but I fear that the agreement promoting foreign direct investment, the private sector and the exploitation of natural resources will not help this tormented country, but will, above all, increase the profits of European companies.

It is hypocritical and irresponsible for our Member States to be sending these people back to a land where they will inevitably face persecution, especially those who came to seek shelter in Europe after being targeted for their cooperation with Western forces.

Secondly, the reforms of the military and security forces in Afghanistan need to be more strongly supported. These forces should be supported, but not used.

On 22 December 2014 the Council authorized the European Commission, on behalf of the Member States, to negotiate an association agreement between the three European micro-states and the European Union.  The European Commission had already established this will in 2012, but this is the first time that the European Parliament has had the opportunity to discuss this proposal for a Recommendation in which the European Parliament sets its position, before the end of this parliamentary term, on this ongoing negotiation agreement which, not ignored, will not be able to enter into force without the final consent of the European Parliament , because that is the rule of the Treaty of Lisbon, which strengthens, like never before, this European Parliament as the last word in international agreements negotiated on behalf of the European Union.  Well, there we have them: Principality of Andorra, Principality of Monaco, Republic of San Marino, sovereign states that have a long history that has interested me – I must say - as a lawyer specialized in constitutional law compared, with peculiarities that must be observed and respected throughout the negotiation of the ongoing Association Agreement and its conclusion.  But I have also seen the interest it is in not only its border states – France, Italy and Spain – but also in the European Union as a whole. They are important partners for the future of the Union, despite being micro-states, despite their small size and small population.  But in accordance with the Declaration on Article 8 of the Treaty on European Union, it makes perfect sense to exercise flexibility, an exercise in realism in incorporating the acquis communautaire – the four freedoms in terms of legal certainty – but, at the same time, respect for the singularities and specificities and the ability of these three micro-states to absorb the European acquis.  Because it is clear that, in relation to the implementation of the four freedoms in small territories with very small populations, temporary exceptions will have to be established in the course of time, in accordance with the circumstances and the evolution of their adaptation in each of the three States involved in this negotiation, to ensure an adequate implementation of it. The budgetary capacity of these three small States is also limited, so a dispute resolution mechanism and even a consultation forum should be established. Because we are not talking about joining the Union, we are talking about an association agreement without membership and accession to the European Union, which is a very different thing.  But I must finally influence a point that is interesting. Fiscal issues have been left out of the negotiating mandate – we all know this – and yet the efforts made by these three small States on transparency and cooperation in tax matters, the willingness to cooperate in the fight against money laundering and the financing of terrorism in particular must be acknowledged. I think it is important to call on these three States to continue on the right path of cooperation with the OECD and with all international bodies.  It should be noted that these three States are members of the Council of Europe, which are incorporated into the Greco Anti-Corruption Group, and it is important to recognise efforts in these structures.  The Recommendation draws attention to the importance of emphasizing the relationship with the border States – this is the case in Spain, France and Italy – and of better cooperation in areas of mutual interest and horizontal policies. And finally, I just want to point out three points.  In the case of Andorra, I believe that it is necessary to recognise the efforts made in the field of financial regulation, particularly in relation to tobacco, an area in which an agreement has been signed not only with the European Union, but with the border State that demanded it, Spain.  It is also important to recognise San Marino's difficulties in exporting to Member States due to VAT documentation known as T2.  And finally, with Monaco it must be acknowledged that it is a very small population in which, moreover, the Monegasca population is a minority relative to the population that lives in the town of Monaco.  So it will be very important to do this active exercise in flexibility, intelligence, so that this negotiation can be conducted successfully.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 305, "date": "2019-03-12.json", "name": "Juan Fernando LÓPEZ AGUILAR", "mepid": "96812", "text": "   on behalf of the Vice-President of the Commission / High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. – Mr President, over the past year the negotiations on the Association Agreement with Andorra, Monaco and San Marino have intensified. We aim to finalise discussions on the framework of the agreement by June. Then it might take an additional two years for negotiations on the very high volume of EU legislation to be adopted by our partners. As rightly pointed out in the report by Mr López Aguilar, we enjoy excellent relations with these three small—sized states. The three countries are proud of their history and independence, yet we also have much in common. We are part of the same European family and it is only natural to seek an even closer partnership with them. We appreciate their desire to seek full integration into the internal market. Andorra, Monaco and San Marino have made considerable efforts in the past years towards financial and economic recovery and towards preparations for the future Association Agreement. For example, they have already transposed, or are transposing, certain EU internal market rules. In line with Parliament’s draft recommendations, we continue to encourage our partners to seek support from Member States for the acquis takeover and implementation process. This will require strong administrative capacity, and cooperation with the EU countries can be of great help. We welcome the fact that the draft recommendations emphasise the importance of preserving the overall integrity and homogeneity of the internal market and of respect for the fundamental freedoms. We fully share Parliament’s view and the Union will not compromise on the main principles of the internal market. This is also our guideline in the negotiations with the United Kingdom and Switzerland. Any agreement will fall within the limits set by these principles and rules, but within these limits there is certainly room for mediation that takes full account of the specific situation of our small—sized partners. In this respect, Parliament’s recommendations are particularly welcome and timely. The European Union seeks a comprehensive agreement with full access to the EU internal market, therefore covering all the four freedoms: movement of goods, services, persons and capital. The overall principles are always the same: same market, same rules. There is no such thing as partial integration. The four freedoms cannot be cherry-picked and separated from one another. For the same reason, the EU Court of Justice should have exclusive competence for the uniform interpretation and application of the agreement, including for last-resort dispute settlement. The Commission, as guardian of the EU treaties, should be given competence to monitor the overall implementation of the agreement, including in the area of state aid. In line with Parliament’s recommendations and with the EU Treaties, we will look carefully into Andorran, Monegasque and San Marinese requests for transitional arrangements on issues such as the right of establishment, the free movement of workers and the free provision of services. These requests should be duly justified and proportional. An association agreement would be a clear win—win situation and a further step towards a more united European continent.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": null}, {"id": 306, "date": "2019-03-12.json", "name": "Željana ZOVKO", "mepid": "185341", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, it was a pleasure to be a shadow rapporteur on this report.

There exists already, though, a good degree of political and practical cooperation between them and the EU. All three of them use the euro as their currency, whilst Andorra and San Marino are members of the EU Customs Union. The three states combined have a population of around just 150 000 people – three times smaller than the EU’s smallest Member State, Malta. Therefore, the Association Agreement will recognise this important imbalance between the two negotiating sides, and I’m pleased to note that the López Aguilar report repeatedly calls for its implications to be taken into account, so as to recognise the difficulties facing the micro-states in concluding an association agreement. They range from the practical difficulties of the disproportionate burden of implementing the EU’s ‘acquis communautaire’, given the small size of their civil services, to more divisive debates around freedom of movement. Given the intense debates in my own country around Brexit, I’m only too familiar with the importance of the indivisibility of the four freedoms of the Single Market. Clearly, for any state the size of the United Kingdom, freedom of movement opt-outs, whether within or outside the EU, would be problematic but, in the case of the three micro-states, permanent derogations must surely be considered reasonable.

I’m thinking specifically in terms of the banking regimes of these countries – just how long they’ll be tolerated once they get closer to the EU, the Single Market and all of the other rules that go with it.

Mr President! Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen. This is, of course, an important moment for us in this House and for some 80 million European citizens. We are faced with having to confirm legislation that will lift and ensure the availability of various products and services. So that in future, no matter what disability or disability you have, you can expect your phone, your computer, your TV to be accessible to you and that you can use these everyday tools on an equal footing with all other consumers. In an emergency, you can call 112 for help, you can find information about a train journey – either digitally or at the station – you can withdraw money at any vending machine located on your way. Things that the rest of us take for granted in everyday life, but which you cannot necessarily do in the same way as the disability. Finally, this legislation delivers the harmonisation that has been expected for many years, thus confirming the ambitions that we find in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. I'm personally really, really proud of that. It has been a long and hard move to lead these negotiations, but I am proud of the changes that we are bringing forward now. What will actually happen? Yes, as I said, the emergency services 112 are included in the agreement, we have check-in machines, payment terminals and other terminals among the self-service terminals that now need to be made available. Thanks to the House, all terminals of urban transport such as metro, bus and tram are also included. Parliament has managed to include public procurement in the agreement, although it was a problem for the Council from the outset. We have also created the necessary balance for businesses by excluding micro-enterprises that provide services. And for the micro-enterprises that supply products, there will be support from the Member States and more lenient requirements. The accessibility requirements are functional, they are not technical – there was a great deal of debate about this – which means that companies can continue to innovate and work to improve their products. We're not going to tell them how to do it. So perfect – no, of course it is not, even if compromises have to be made in all negotiations. And I know that there is disappointment that, for example, mandatory requirements for the built environment are not part of the legislation. I am aware that there was a desire and hope for more. Then I tried to deliver this, but I had to realize that to get all the good stuff through, we had to compromise. After all, I am not prepared to throw the whole thing on the floor, thereby depriving so many citizens of the opportunity to make progress in other important areas. I am pleased, however, that the built environment was included, albeit at a voluntary level, and that the Commission should assess how far the Member States have come in this area some years after the law came into force.

Unfortunately, this was not possible in the previous cycle. In 2015, however, the Commission put this on the table, and after more than three years of hard work, it can be said that a balanced text has been adopted, the result of which is good for both social and economic development, and it would have been good to make greater progress in certain areas. The conclusion of the negotiations was urgent and did not tolerate delays due to the entry into force of the legislation.  I am moved and proud to stand before them today and I would like to thank them on behalf of people with disabilities, and I would also ask that we continue down this path together, which we may not have achieved today, and I am sure we will succeed tomorrow.

It means that the European Union and all its Member States are now committed to carrying out the following message: it is not about adapting people to the environment, but it is about adapting the environment to people.  This is precisely what the European Accessibility Act will do. After three hard years of negotiating, after some tough give and take, you have reached an agreement with the Council on this important piece of legislation. I want to warmly congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Løkkegaard, and his co—rapporteurs, Mr Kósa and Mr Taylor. What is on the table is a solid package which will make Europe a more accessible place to live and work for persons with disabilities. The European Accessibility Act is a key initiative of this Commission’s social agenda. Back in December 2015, we tabled an ambitious proposal. It offered a coordinated EU—wide approach to implement the UN Convention’s obligations on accessibility. It relied on the full strength of our internal market. With the European Accessibility Act, we established the world’s largest market for accessible products and services. The level playing field we have created is good for European business. It will increase the availability and affordability of accessible products and services. This will allow more than 80 million people with disabilities, including many older people, to participate in society and the labour market on an equal basis with others.  The European Accessibility Act will cover a wide array of products and services, such as phones; computers; payment terminals or self—service terminals; banking services; electronic communications, including the 112 emergency number; access to audio—visual media services; e—books; e—commerce, and some elements of transport services. These are key products and services for everyday life and they are increasingly affected by digitalisation. That is why the European Accessibility Act will also contribute to implementing the European Pillar of Social Rights and its principle on the inclusion of persons with disabilities. We are adapting our rules to make them future proof, to make sure that the digital revolution can be a catalyst for social inclusion and that nobody is left behind. The European Accessibility Act needs to be seen in synergy with other important EU instruments, for example, the public procurement directives or the Electronic Communications Code, where accessibility is an obligation. The European Accessibility Act will facilitate its implementation. To conclude, let me stress that the impact of the European Accessibility Act goes beyond its scope.

A few things have been done, and I would like to thank a number of colleagues here in the European Parliament for that. In particular in the digital field, the act will make available selected services and goods in the telecommunications, payment services or computer use sectors.  However, full participation in society means, in particular, accessible mobility. Possibility to move without restrictions, travel by public transport, go to the bank or to the store. And here, in my opinion, the European Accessibility Act has remained far beyond expectations. The European Parliament is sometimes criticised by citizens for making decisions that are disconnected from reality. Unfortunately, it was the Member States that, unfortunately, approached the act in cold blood from the outset in the sense of 'Just so it doesn't cost much', and completely contrary to the commitments they had previously signed up to in the area of accessibility.

Mr President! Thank you to all colleagues for taking part in the debate here, to which I have listened intently. It is clear that when you have been through an intense process with all of you and have been through tough negotiations, it is nice to know how you assess the outcome. I can only say that in politics the glass is always half empty or half full, and in this case I have to say that I belong to that part of the human race that thinks the glass is half full. Like the Commissioner, Mr Mimica, I believe that we have a very good result. Sometimes the best can be the worst enemy of the good, I totally agree with that. It has been my starting point for the whole debate that we secured the best possible result, because in reality we are now in a situation where we are breaking with three or four decades of standstill in this area, as my MEP colleague said just now. In fact, twenty years ago, there was no way of giving people with disabilities a place in society at all. I think we should be concerned about that, and this is really a major breakthrough for the idea that disabled people should be equal. That is what I am concerned about, I think is historic, and I think we should be pleased that we are in the situation that we can actually now offer 80 million people or more a dignified everyday life in terms of services and products. So I am pleased with this –I note that many speakers could have thought for something more, I could also personally – but I have to say that I am still quite proud that we achieved as much as we achieved. I myself did not expect that we would have achieved so much, and that tells me that there is also sensitivity in the Member States, and of course there is also in the Commission from the outset.

Let me start by very clearly stating that the Council is strongly committed to the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing. There can be no doubt about that. The Presidency and the Council as a whole fully share the sense of urgency and the commitment of the Parliament and the Commission in addressing this issue. Together we – the Parliament, Council and Commission – have worked closely over recent years in our common endeavour to establish an effective regime to counter money laundering and the financing of terrorism. We have in particular strengthened EU rules with the adoption in 2019 of the latest amendments to the Anti-Money Laundering Directive, which stands as a very good example of this good cooperation. Of course, further progress is needed in our joint fight. So, coming straight to the issue at hand, the Council has objected to the Commission’s delegated act identifying high-risk third countries with strategic deficiencies. This decision to object does not mean that the listing is not an important element of the ongoing work. On the contrary. But to achieve the full impact of this instrument and to ensure its quality, we need to introduce the list in an orderly process. This is effectively what we wrote in our Council statement.  We believe that in order to establish a strong and effective instrument, the Commission proposal needs to be established in a transparent manner and one that incentivises affected countries to take decisive action. This is why the Council calls for an EU listing in line, of course, with the 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive, which will effectively strengthen anti-money laundering and combat terrorist financing. We are united and fully committed to maintaining and promoting the existing cooperation between the institutions. We are in fact advancing on other fronts as well in this fight against money laundering and terrorist financing. Hopefully, we will be finalising negotiations in the coming days on an important piece of legislation on anti-money laundering, which is contained in the European System of Financial Supervision package. Member States, but also the European Parliament, attribute a huge importance to this file. The Council also agreed last December on a dedicated anti-money laundering action plan with a view to further improving the current system, and we are monitoring developments on that front.

After each terrorist attack, we hear passionate speeches about how we have to efficiently fight against terrorists. After each banking scandal, we hear a lot of other speeches about how we have to make our financial sector more healthy. This is what we try to do, including by means of high—risk third countries, and this is what we did. We did it according to the methodology on which consultations were held and which was adopted in a transparent manner. That’s why I have to start by expressing my deep regret that the Council rejected this list – because being equipped with such a list, we would be able to start with this efficient fight immediately.  As you know, the Juncker Commission and I personally have made the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing a top priority during this mandate, and I always felt very strong support from this House, from the Members of Parliament who are also sitting here today. In recent years, we have witnessed a series of terrorist attacks in Europe and we have seen major money laundering scandals that unveil how organised criminals misuse our financial system. Together with you, we have worked relentlessly to make our rules and systems stronger against financial crime that causes harm to our society and our citizens. We have twice updated the Anti-Money Laundering Directive. You have adopted a new directive on criminalisation of money laundering and we have provisionally agreed on a new directive on the use of financial information by law enforcement authorities. This week, we are in the final stage of negotiating a reform of the European Banking Authority that would give it a stronger role in anti—money laundering supervision of the financial sector, thereby helping to ensure that our strong rules are properly enforced across Europe. The delegated regulation the Commission adopted on 13 February to identify third countries with strategic deficiencies in their anti—money laundering and counter—terrorist—financing frameworks is part of all these efforts to better protect the EU financial system from the risk of money laundering and terrorist financing. Unfortunately, this measure will not enter into force for the reason I mentioned at the beginning: using its scrutiny rights, the Council objected on 7 March to this delegated act. As I said, I am disappointed by the decision of the Council and I regret that this issue has not been discussed at political level in the Council. Neither by the Justice and Interior Ministers last week, nor by the Finance Ministers meeting at the Economic and Financial Affairs Council (ECOFIN) in Brussels today. In the fifth Anti—Money Laundering Directive, this Parliament and the Council decided together to strengthen the rules with regard to third countries, complementing the legal criteria of the Financial Action Task Force. The Commission attaches great importance to multilateralism and the work the Financial Action Task Force is doing. We are an active founding member of this task force and we must take its important work into full account. At the same time, it is necessary that we take further steps to protect the integrity of the EU financial system on the basis of the criteria set out in our anti—money laundering rules so that due diligence measures are applied. In light of experience, including the lessons from the Panama Papers scandal, we, the European Parliament and the Council decided together to add transparency rules on beneficial ownership structures. This goes beyond the Financial Action Task Force rules. We, therefore, can no longer simply replicate this Action Task Force list. We have a legal obligation under the current anti—money laundering rules to carry out our own autonomous assessment. In order to prepare our first autonomous list, the Commission carried out a careful assessment, based on a solid methodology, together with Member States’ experts. Member States were also consulted on the methodology itself, which follows the criteria set out in the directive. The Commission also engaged with the third countries concerned immediately after the College of Commissioners endorsed the preliminary findings on 23 January 2019 in full of respect of the third countries’ right to be heard. The Commission stands by its assessment. Therefore, we will continue to engage with the third countries concerned and encourage them to address their deficiencies in the areas of preventing money laundering and terrorist financing. We do not list third countries for the sake of listing them, but in order to address the risks to the EU financial system. In terms of the next steps, I stand ready to engage with you and with the Council at political level to discuss the way forward. Our aim remains to fulfil our legal obligation under the Anti—Money Laundering Directive. It is a joint responsibility of the EU institutions to protect citizens and the EU financial system against threats of money laundering and terrorist financing. As for the timing, I asked the College to give me a chance to finalise the next list still in this mandate.

I believe that we all agree that, in the fight against money laundering, we need a blacklist that has bite, which encourages third countries to step in and which is credible. Because we had doubts that this was the case with earlier drafts of the blacklist, we in the European Parliament ourselves have already rejected delegated acts. I almost feel sorry for the Commission now, because we have always said that it is not enough just to copy the list of the Financial Action Task Force, but we have to make our own analyses. That was exactly what we always asked for. The list is certainly not perfect. One can also ask why a country like Russia is not yet on this list. And, of course, the Council has also mentioned a few procedural points – how do you get down on them, how to get back down – that we can talk about. Nevertheless, I have the feeling that the reason for the Council's rejection of the list was not a formal one, but that a number of irrelevant considerations also played a role here. In recent weeks, we have heard the argument more often that this or that third country should not be put on the list because they are important allies. If we get involved in this argument, the list loses all credibility. Because then it is clear that a third country only has to lobby intensively with the Member States, then it is off the list again. And once that's been talked about, this list is a toothless tiger. We cannot want that, because at the end of the day it is also a question of ensuring that the European financial sector is not misused for money laundering, terrorist financing or for organised crime purposes. It is not fitting to give European banking supervision new anti-money laundering powers on the one hand, but to leave a gateway open on the other, because we cannot agree on a list. I can only encourage the Commission to make a proposal again as soon as possible.

The interest was due to the fact that we have been doing this thing for quite some time. Next to me in this chamber I have Sargentini, and it is about six years since we tried to get these lists in order, without really getting them right.  When I read through the arguments about which countries have been put on this list, I am even more surprised by the simple reason that in all the banking scandals we have seen in recent times there is a recurring pattern. That pattern is called Russia. It may be that those who write this list have relatively little experience of how the Russian system works. I've actually lived in the country for six years. I have to say that I am deeply surprised that this is not taken more seriously. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, we have seen the systematic theft of state and other property, which is then turned through various channels into property in Europe or in tax havens.

Furthermore, there is still much to be done to ensure that all lobbying in some countries does not affect the ability of the European institutions to act independently and independently.

In all of the debates that I sit through here, and I’ve sat through a lot today, often one of the things that gets mentioned is that you’re really quite frustrated that you can’t get to grips with banks and bankers and finances and that you can’t really peek into bank accounts as much as you’d like. I’ve heard this for five years now. Isn’t it really convenient to put up Russia, terrorists and all sorts of baddies and say ‘Oh, we must get to them.

We knew when we were planning this and discussing the methodology, the rationale and the criteria which will be used for the assessment that it would be difficult, that it would demand expertise and that it would be sensitive – because we work in the context of the geopolitical and external ties and contacts of each Member State – and that it might be unpopular, but we knew absolutely, clearly and for sure that it was necessary. These high-risk third countries are a very important element of everything we do against money laundering and terrorist financing. This is the most important element of the whole system. I will repeat again that this is what we do in the field of the fight against organised crime, where we need to be much better on the side of systematic prevention.  This is about prevention. We must be aware of how the financial sector is interconnected and that, if we want to have a safe financial sector, we must not leave any weak points or easy entry points into the system from outside. Whenever I discuss these matters with law enforcement authorities, with practitioners and experts, they always have a very clear goal for us: cut the influx of illicit money into Europe because this is the money which is financing organised crime and terrorism. So this is what we are doing, and I remain convinced that the countries we listed belong to the list. At the same time, we see that we have to work with the Member States on procedural matters because they were at the centre of the criticism which we heard from the Member States. So I agree that maybe we need more transparency. I also heard in this House and in the two days of debate that you would like to see a more detailed assessment. We need more clarity and we need stronger – I would even say full – ownership from the side of the Member States. We need to check again whether the Member States are ready to cooperate and whether that readiness is driven by a genuine interest from the side of the Member States to fight against organised crime and terrorism. I hope – and I do believe – that we will find this readiness from the side of the Member States because the Member States must be aware that in a system where the financial institutions and the whole financial system has no borders in the EU, individual Member States cannot efficiently fight against these dangerous phenomena. It has to be a common task and this is what we are doing. The Commission is going to work on two parallel strands. On one side, we will work with the Member States and with Parliament on procedural matters. We will look into the methodology and the criteria we use. I am convinced the criteria are pretty precise and we use them in full. It was a very objective assessment, based on the criteria known, but we will work on this with the stakeholders. The second strand will be our parallel work with the listed countries, with those who are willing to eliminate the risks on their side. I have had discussions with several of those listed and who don’t want to be listed, so this is the invitation: let’s work on the elimination of risks on your side. We need to see the partners where there are no deficiencies anymore. I think that we are very clear about this. This will be one strand of work with the listed countries. The second strand will be working on the assessment of the countries which are in group two, where indeed we also have Russia and other countries which you mentioned in this debate. My message is also for the Member States. I am not giving up. The machine is working. We are working on it. We are continuing to fulfil our obligations, which we have in legislation.

But this freedom of movement requires measures to ensure the security of our common borders and cooperation between the police within our territory. It also requires a common visa policy, i.e. a European approach for those who legally cross our borders, whether to visit, study or work.  The visa information system, the VIS, is the most visible example of this policy. Currently this system is limited to the entry of tourists, so-called short-stay visas. In 2017 alone, around 16 million visas were registered. Of course, it is not just tourists entering Schengen. In 2017 one million workers entered the European Union, more than 800,000 people came to join family members and more than half a million came to study. These people, although they also benefit from free movement, are not registered in any European database. More worryingly, each Member State decides which security checks they are subject to. There is also one last category of people, the big investors, the so-called Gold visas, which are already issued by 20 Member States. They too are currently outside the VIS and are not subject to any kind of security checks against other Union information systems, such as the Schengen Information System. With this vis reform we intend to change that. Moreover, this reform will only make sense if long-stay visas and residence permits, including Gold visas, are registered with the VIS. That's why I see with surprise and concern that the S&amp;D group has changed its mind in the last month. When we voted on this report in committee supported the measure, they now seem to want to follow the Greens and the GUE. Ladies and gentlemen, let us be clear, the current distinction between short-stay visas and long-stay documents makes no sense. Anyone seeking a visa to enter the European Union should be subject to the same security checks across Europe. Tourists who visit us and who normally stay on our territory for a period of well under 90 days are subject to European security checks. But people who decide to settle more permanently from our territory or acquire residence through investments, I am talking about Gold visas, are not subject to even remotely similar controls. That is why, with this reform, we want, first of all, to ensure that all visas, whatever their duration, are automatically preceded by adequate security checks, in full respect of fundamental rights, the principles of necessity and proportionality, but by ensuring that a Russian investor, the subject of a European arrest warrant, does not end the Gold visa in Romania. These checks will be carried out systematically and completely before the issuance of visas. Any third-country national will be subject to 15 security checks against seven EU information systems before it even reaches European soil. It is precisely for security reasons that parliament's Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs considered that fingerprints should be collected from the age of six. Only then can we better protect our children, whether it's against identity fraud, kidnapping or trafficking. Every year 15,000 people are trafficked in Europe, of which at least 3,000 are children. We have a duty to fight this scourge and through this reform we are doing so. Mr President, with this enhanced VIS we will facilitate the issuance of visas, prevent so-called visa shopping, visa fraud and illegal immigration, we will increase the scrutiny of Gold visas and better protect our children. Finally, we take another important step towards an area of free movement with justice and security. We take another step towards a true Europe of citizens.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 375, "date": "2019-03-12.json", "name": "Carlos COELHO", "mepid": "1892", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, allow me to start by expressing my thanks to our rapporteur, Mr Coelho, and the shadow rapporteurs for the work done in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs on the proposal we are discussing tonight. We all know that every year, millions of non-EU nationals enter the European Union with a visa, be it for a short stay or for a longer period. Most of them are legitimate travellers who fulfil the entry and stay conditions on the territory of the Member States. The current Visa Information System (VIS) allows us to check at the external borders, and in the consulates around the world, that these conditions are fulfilled. There are, however, still some gaps that we need to close. With the new Visa Information System, we will remove blind spots in our systems and give visa authorities and border guards the information they need to do their jobs properly. We cannot allow criminals and potential terrorists to enter Europe undetected. Europe, I have repeatedly said, is not a fortress, and will never become one but, at the same time, we need to know who is crossing our borders. The Commission welcomes Parliament’s support on the key objectives of our proposal. Let me mention the most important ones. Firstly, the interlinking of the VIS to the Entry/Exit System, ETIAS (European Travel Information and Authorisation System), the Schengen Information System and ECRIS (European Criminal Records Information System). This will help us to detect the use of multiple identities and to identify anyone posing a security risk. Secondly, the closing of the information gap on long-stay visas and residence permits – which currently is information not shared at EU level – will allow guards and immigration authorities quickly to determine whether the documents presented to them are valid, and whether they are in the hands of persons entitled to have them. It will also allow national authorities not to legalise the presence of third-country nationals who do not fulfil basic security conditions for entry and stay in the European Union, such as persons with links to known terrorists or organised crime networks. This will close an important security gap. Finally, the inclusion of copies of the visa applicant’s travel document in the VIS database is a measure which, together with authorisation for European Border and Coast Guard Agency staff to have access to the VIS, will facilitate the identification and readmission of undocumented irregular migrants. This will increase the efficiency of the European Union returns policy, notably in relation to third countries refusing to give us their cooperation. In addition to this, to strengthen our capacity to prosecute and prevent crime, law-enforcement authorities and Europol will have better access to the Visa Information System for prevention, detection or investigation of terrorist offences or other serious crimes. Access to the VIS will also be opened to law-enforcement authorities for the purpose of searching or identifying missing or abducted persons and victims of trafficking. This access will always be subject to full respect for the European Union’s data protection rules. The VIS upgrade is part of the Smart Borders package and also part of interoperability. For that reason, the rationale and foundations of this proposal should be preserved throughout the legislative process. That is why I would like to refer to some changes proposed in the report. Firstly, the inclusion of information on residence permits in the VIS is linked also to the issue of golden visas. While registering all permits issued by Member States in a single EU information system might not resolve the question of possible abuse in granting such permits, it provides greater transparency among Member States. I understand that Parliament wants to take this measure one step further and enable the storage and verification of these documents in the VIS from the moment of application, in order to ensure better control over the issuing process. We are looking positively at this proposal. Secondly, regarding multiple queries for security and irregular migration checks, the benefits of interoperability should not be watered down by excluding some databases from searches. We managed to agree that ECRIS and the travel documents associated with notices are relevant in ETIAS, and that should be the relevant standard for the VIS as well. It is a matter of coherence and consistency. The standards of verification of third-country nationals who can enter the EU visa free should not be tougher than those applied to third-country nationals under visa obligations. Thirdly, the Commission proposed to update the existing law-enforcement access rules for the VIS. But it is important to ensure that law-enforcement access remains balanced and is not detrimental to the efficiency of the procedure. For instance, adding the obligation to consult Prüm databases first will make access more burdensome. Fourthly, regarding the finger-printing of children, we have to be consistent. We have proposed lowering the age for finger-printing because we want to fight child trafficking more effectively. I am sure this is an objective that we all share. I understand that you are concerned about the fundamental rights of children and so are we. Trafficking of children, abduction or smuggling is an abuse of fundamental rights. Statistics show that, annually, between 1 500 and 2 000 third-country national children under the age of 12 are victims of trafficking in the Schengen area, and between 3 200 and 4 250 aged between 12 and 17. Most of these children come from countries that are under visa obligation. We need to make all possible efforts to tackle this issue. The lowering of the age of finger-printing provides us with a key tool for achieving concrete results. I want to close with the most important point for our citizens. Fundamental rights will be, as always, at the heart of all our policies, including in the design of our information systems. All reports on the performance of the VIS indicate that its implementation has never led to fundamental-rights or data-protection concerns. Not a single complaint has been registered against the VIS in its first five years of functioning. We have taken the relevant provisions one step further following the ‘data protection by design’ principle. We stand ready to work with the co-legislators, during the trilogies, to improve those standards further, but we need to remain effective and not depart from our key objectives.

I therefore welcome the reform proposed by the European Commission last year, which will keep information on long-stay visas and residence permits within the European Union.

The reform of the Visa Information System is also an important element of the interconnection of security information systems in the European Union. It is high time that the security authorities were able to take advantage of the information available in the various systems, of course without compromising the security of citizens' personal information and data.

The visa system, I think, is a very important element of the common European asylum policy. Joint action in this area is particularly important, as millions of visas to the European Union are issued every year. The primary objective of the reform now proposed is to improve the exchange and sharing of relevant data on visa issuing between the different EU information systems. All this is necessary because, in the face of today's security challenges, we need to operate much more efficiently than before and to strengthen the protection of the European Union's external borders through this system.  During the reform of the system, the opinion of the Union Agency for Fundamental Rights and the European Data Protection Commissioner was of particular importance to my group, in particular with regard to long-term visas, on which both reports stressed the need and proportionality principles. As the bill is closely linked to the interoperability of EU information systems, changes in any database also have an impact on the processing of data of third-country nationals. This, in turn, once again raises the question of necessity and proportionality mentioned above and the necessary exclusion of the possibility of discrimination.

In such a way as to welcom this initiative which responds to security challenges in the European Union and, in particular, enables interconnection through new technologies and the interoperability of data relating to visa applicants and threats to the security of Member States.  From the Socialist Group we have provided guarantees of respect for the principles of the Lisbon Treaty of proportionality and necessity while guaranteeing and respecting the rights enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the General Data Protection Regulation.

The connection of the Visa Information System with other databases, through interoperability architecture, poses a risk of unlawful data transfer and data leaks. Yes, by making information on visas more complete we can achieve better risk assessment but, at the same time, we are exposing sensitive data to major risks.

The VIS proposal will close the information gap on long-stay document holders, as well as a number of security gaps on both short and long-stay travellers.

It provides visa-issuing authorities with key information on applicants for short-stay Schengen visas.  However, in 2016, the Commission outlined the need for the EU to strengthen and improve its IT systems, data architecture and information exchange in the area of border management, law enforcement and counter-terrorism and emphasised the need to improve the interoperability of IT systems. It also identified the need to address information gaps on third-country nationals holding a long-stay visa. Nevertheless, I would also like to express my concern that we should firstly focus on strengthening the current Schengen area and its external borders.

U f'din il-kamra kemm-il darba sħaqna fuq il-ħtieġa li bħala rappreżentanti ta-ittadini Ewropej, il-prijorità tagħna tkun dik li nissalvagwardjaw l-interessi tagħhom, li nkunu lesti li nieħdu deħiżjonijiet li forsi mhumiex daqstant popolari. Għal żmien twil, il-kwistjoni tal-immigrazzjoni tħalliet taħt taħt ta-tapit, forsi bit-tama li tissolva waħedha. I kienx il-każ dakinhar u mhuwiex il-każ illum. Minflok, din l-attitudni wasslet biex aktar nies iħossuhom 'il bogħod mill-Unjoni Ewropea u sfortunatament jintilfu aktar ħajjiet. U qed inħallsu għaliha billi l-istituzzjonijiet Ewropej qed ikollhom jaqdfu ħafna biex jerġgħu jirbħu lura l-fiduħja ta大-ħittadini. Huwa fatt li l-Unjoni Ewropea bdiet u kompliet tieħu passi u miżuri differenti biex tindirizza l-immigrazzjoni minn diversi aspetti, iżda filwaqt li l-Parlament Ewropew kompla miexi 'l quddiem biex nilħqu Sistema Komuni Ewropea għall-Asil li tqassam il-piż bejn l-Istati Membri, hemm proposti kruħli li jinsabu mwaħħla-Kunsill Ewewrop-millxxejja he' wħud-Istati Membri. Li jġibni għall-fond li għandna quddiemna llum. Fond ta' aktar minn 10 biljun euro biex l-Unjoni Ewropea tkun tista' tuża dawn il-flus mal-Istati Membri stess. Issa hawn min jargumenta, u se jkun hawn min jargumenta llejla, li l-kwistjoni tal-immigrazzjoni għandha tiġi indirizzata 'l barra mill-fruntieri tal-Unjoni Ewropea. Ir-realtà llum il-ġurnata, iżda, hi li għandna ħafna pajjiżi tal-Unjoni Ewropea li għandhom bżonn is-sostenn finanzjarju biex jindirizzaw il-problemi li qed jiffa大大jaw illum stess. U nagħmlu dan jekk verament nemmnu li rridu nimplimentaw politika li effettivament twassal għall-ġarr tar-responsabilità u s-solidarjetà. Jiena ġejja minn Malta, pajjiż fejn i大-大ittadini tagħna jafu u jifhmu xi jfisser li tkun fuq il-fruntiera. Bħala pajjiż salvajna l-ħajjiet, ilqajna l-persuni, ġarrejna r-responsabilità u wettaqna s-solidarjetà bil-fatti. U bħalna hemm pajjiżi oħra tal-Unjoni Ewropea li qegħdin fuq il-fruntiera u ma jdawrux wi大大hom in-naħa l-oħra. It's a great time to be able to do that. Għalhekk kien ta' sodisfazzjoni għalija li l-Kumitat approva u għamel mill-prin大ipju tas-solidarjetà, prin大ipju fundamentali li jirregola dan il-fond.

Għalhekk ukoll l-importanza li t-titlu tal-fond jirreferi għall-integrazzjoni bl-għan li nirrikonoxxu u nsostnu l-importanza ta' so大jetajiet u komunitajiet aktar magħquda. Għandna 10,4 biljun euro li l-għan prinħipali tagħhom huwa li nagħtu l-għajnuna meħtieġa lill-pajjiżi tal-Unjoni Ewropea, spe大jalment dawk l-aktar affettwati. U biex nagħmlu dan irridu nimplimentaw il-politika Ewropea fuq l-asil u l-immigrazzjoni. Ifisser ukoll li għandna nagħmlu l-aħjar użu possibbli minn dawn il-fondi. Wara kollox dan huwa l-uniku strument intern li għandna biex jindirizza l-kwistjoni tal-immigrazzjoni fost il-pajjiżi tal-Unjoni Ewropea. U biex nindirizzaw il-kwistjoni tal-immigrazzjoni irregolari hemm bżonn ħidma li hija ffukata kemm fi ħdan il-pajjiżi iżda wkoll f'pajjiżi terzi. Imma dan l-istrument finanzjarju għandu jkun komplementat ma' strumenti diġà eżistenti li jindirizzaw pajjiżi terzi u mhux nippretendu li dan l-istrument finanzjarju se jagħmel tajjeb għal dak li ma jsirx b'fondi oħra. Dan il-fond huwa mibni fuq numru ta' pilastri fosthom is-CEAS, l-immigrazzjoni legali, l-integrazzjoni u s-solidarjetà. Għalhekk li fir-rapport hemm inkluż persentaġġi minimi għal hawk wieħed minn dawn l-għanijiet. Dawn huma persentaġi minimi li assolutament i jnaqqrux mill-flessibilità imma jenfasizzaw il-fatt li kull objettiv għandu rwol importanti biex l-ebda pajjiż ma jitalla għal rieħu.

Many of the issues I will underline are of a horizontal nature and concern all three funds. I would like to stress that I hope the Council will also soon adopt its negotiating mandate.  Migration and security continue to be among the main concerns of our citizens today. We need enough resources to support our actions in these areas in line with our political priorities and in complementarity with all EU funds. In the current period assistance has been provided to approximately one million asylum applicants. Furthermore, integration support has been provided to 3.4 million third—country nationals. None of this could have been achieved without the support of the Union’s budget.  Things can change and evolve and our funding has to be flexible, simplified and adaptable. Therefore, we propose a reinforcement of the overall budget for migration, border management and security of more than EUR 36 billion for the period 2021—2027, out of which EUR 10.4 billion for the Asylum and Migration Fund. This reflects the political importance that the Commission attaches to better managing migration, borders and security challenges. I know that this view is also shared by Parliament.  The Asylum and Migration Fund specifically will provide support for strengthening the Common European Asylum System, legal migration to the Member States and provide integration support for third-country nationals. Within these objectives it will provide incentives for integration measures at local and regional level, such as language courses and civic orientation courses, and it will support resettlement and solidarity with Member States. The Fund will also help to counter irregular migration through returns of persons that do not, or no longer, have the right to stay in the Union.  However, in order to succeed, in addition to more budget we also need to ensure flexibility for our funds. We need financing instruments that will be able to support EU policies and priorities as they develop until 2027, Financing instruments that will be able to support our Member States when they are in need. I cannot emphasise flexibility enough. This is why flexibility is built into all three funds that we will be discussing tonight through the thematic facility and the mid—term review, allowing us to allocate 50% of the funding, based on evolving needs and EU priorities at the point in time. At the same time, there will be enough upfront funding – 50% – to Member States to support actions quickly and allow them to plan long—term investment.  We have also proposed to simplify the implementation. The management of the funds will be simplified by using a single rulebook for the implementation of shared management funds. We have also built in synergies. We have worked to deliver a coherent and complementary approach to the migration and security objectives of the Union in different EU funds: areas such as integration of third-country nationals, anti—radicalisation measures, cooperation with the partner countries, to name a few. While the Commission at this stage reserves its position, we must underline that Parliament proposes a number of important obstacles to the flexible use of the future funds that the Commission cannot accept. Minimum spending percentages are an obstacle to flexibility. Member States have different needs and experience different levels of pressure. They should be able to channel EU funding where it is most needed.  In addition, this proposal would make the funds even less flexible than in the current period and would add an administrative and monetary burden. By the same token, building strong partnerships with countries of origin and transit has been a key feature of the European Union’s migration policy from day one. Close cooperation with our partners is key to be able to respond to these challenges. I want to explicitly stress the following: setting a maximum limit for external actions and allowing cooperation only in exceptional cases will not only impact the flexibility of the Fund, but also the achievement of the migration and security objectives of the Union. Moreover, we have proposed a very high conditionality of 30% of absorption for Member States to benefit from additional funding at the mid—term and we have introduced rigidities in the thematic facility, including to implement it through delegated acts that is not legally possible. It is more important than ever that we get it right and design our instruments to withstand the test of time.

I thank Commissioner Avramopoulos for proposing that this fund be tripled. It is something the EPP has asked for and I’m very happy that the Commission delivered. However, to deliver real results, we don’t only need sufficient resources; we also need flexibility to adjust to the challenges in front of us and we need balance between the objectives served by this fund. I understand a little bit the frustration of the Commissioner in his speech because the flexibility and the balance that was there in the original proposal seems to have become a bit lost along the way in this House. The text in front of us focuses on legal migration and integration while minimising any attention on returns and fighting illegal migration, for instance, by introducing mandatory spending requirements for all the fund objectives, except for fighting illegal migration and ensuring returns. Moreover – and the Commissioner said this – if we want to have a real, effective and holistic approach to migration, we need to cooperate with countries outside the EU: countries of origin and countries of transit. That is absolutely crucial. Yet, the amendments in front of us in the European Parliament will make it nearly impossible to cooperate with third countries on these issues. I am disappointed that a majority in this House seems to think that fighting illegal migration, ensuring the return of illegally staying third-country nationals and cooperating with other countries is not important.

We in Sweden have spent for decades spending enormous sums of taxpayers' money on ineffective projects to try to integrate the huge number of migrants who have arrived in my country. Some integration projects that have been invested in new arrivals are priority in the labour and housing market, special diets, separate bathing times for women and men and that some schools have stopped with some Swedish traditions because it can be perceived as negative.  As I proposed in the LIBE Committee, the fund's money should be halved, and 85% will be spent on creating measures that drastically reduce migration to the EU and also ensure that those who stay within the EU's borders illegally are taken into account and return to their home countries as soon as possible.

This is backed up by UN statistics that show an 89% reduction in Mediterranean crossings from 2015 to 2018. Good news, eh! And then, all of a sudden, here we are with a EUR 10 billion package to deal with asylum and migration – asylum and migration that the great Mr Timmermans says is no longer a big deal. And what’s the money going to be spent on, then? Well, it includes bribe payments to third countries to set up camps to keep people in. It includes money to pay countries within the EU to settle migrants in their countries, and it includes a generally vague amount which I think is just generally for political use and which isn’t particularly specified, but – hey ho! – it’s only EUR 10 billion of taxpayers’ money.

As a representative of a country on the frontline of the migration wave of recent years, it is extremely important to me that part of the fund's funds are used to bring illegal migrants back to their countries of origin. It is unacceptable that less than 40% of people who do not have the right to reside in the European Union should be sent back. This percentage should be significantly increased. The European Union cannot and should not be a salvation for all who want to live here for purely economic reasons.  Anyone who is not a refugee or a legal migrant should be sent back to the country from which they came and the Fund should support return activities.", "language": "en", "original_language": "bg", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 405, "date": "2019-03-12.json", "name": "Péter NIEDERMÜLLER", "mepid": "124723", "text": "   - Mr President, I would like to thank you for your support.

The Commissioner is right in insisting that this is a fund that should help Member States when they are most in need, and this is precisely the position of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE). Allow me to say that a minimum percentage of spending on the main objectives of the EU’s migration policy is not an obstacle at all. It channels funding to the objectives that this Commission has until now put forward as priorities. Supporting flexibility does not exclude ensuring a minimum level of funding for the objectives of the Fund. On another point, putting a cap on external funding simply ensures that this funding instrument is used for what it was originally aimed for, that is, an internal funding instrument for migration. We need to support frontline Member States. Actions in third countries are funded by other external funding instruments and no one should expect this Fund to compensate for other funds that might not deliver.  Let me turn finally to the PPE statement about returns. Member States currently spend 42% of the Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund (AMIF) on returns and this without any minimum percentage requirement. Returns remain an objective of the Fund. It has not been removed and Member States will certainly find it. We need to ensure it is not the only objective of this Fund; not to mention the statement that this Fund is not against fighting abuse. I’m still trying to find out where this emanates from.

The European Union has faced a number of challenges in recent years, which have greatly raised citizens' confidence in European policies. The rise of populism and nationalism is the result of European governments being unable to agree on an effective European migration policy. The pneuding of migrants and refugees, the lack of European solidarity and common solutions, the far-right policy is increasingly being used by lies and intimidation to pick political points. This is increasingly bringing discord and mistrust between citizens and states, and puts the future of Schengen and the Union in general at stake. It is enough to look at neighbouring Austria and the other 5 other schengen areas. These, despite a number of additional measures to protect the external borders and the significant reduction in the number of fugitives on European soil, have been unjustified and illegally prolonging internal border controls for more than three years. Today, it is difficult for Slovenians to explain why they are being examined by the authorities in the Karavanka or on the border between Austria and Germany. Whether we will succeed in preserving Schengen as a place of freedom of movement and without borders within the Union, which is a symbol of European integration, depends, above all, on the political wisdom and responsibility of our leaders today. But it seems to me that this wisdom and responsibility is not enough. Of course, we also need sufficient and effective financial resources for the Union's secure external borders, which are a prerequisite. I am pleased that we are debating today a proposal to spend more than €9 billion on borders and visas in the next seven years for borders and visas. That's five times more than it's ever been. That's a lot of money if we use it sensibly. Such financial instruments are extremely important for European citizens, as They translate European policies into concrete measures. And so even the most direct Europeans feel Europe. In this context, I particularly welcome the fact that at least €70 million for various measures will also be available to my country, Slovenia, which manages one of the busiest land borders, especially in the summer months. The financial instrument will provide support for Member States' actions and has two key pillars. The first is integrated border management, including land, air and sea border control, including human search and rescue at sea; preventing illegal crossings; combating cross-border crime and developing and implementing border information systems for the control of passengers and goods. On the other hand, the financial instrument will support Member States in implementing the common visa policy. Of the total financial envelope, 60 % of the funding will go to national programmes to Member States and 40 % for actions directly financed by the Union. The instrument thus provides financial support for the implementation of policies based on solidarity and fair sharing of responsibilities between Member States and for strengthening mutual trust. We have also managed to ensure in the negotiations, which I am particularly pleased that at least 20% of the funds will go to visa policy and to facilitate the crossing of borders to well-intentioned travellers who pose no threat to the Union or to the Member States. Schengen, or travelling without border checks and long waiting times, is one of the Union's greatest successes and most tangible achievements for both citizens and businesses. Schengen is also one of the most important means by which European citizens can exercise their fundamental freedoms of free movement, and the internal market can thrive and evolve. We have also managed to greatly strengthen the provisions on respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. For example, the implementation of an increasing number of smart information technologies and systems at borders has greatly increased the risk of privacy violations and the need for integrated protection and protection of personal data has been increased. And we did it. Similarly, we have strengthened the provisions which always oblige Member States to respect international and European law when implementing measures, in particular the principle of non-return. However, with regard to border management, including in so-called hotspots or hot spots, we have managed to improve the provision on respect for the right to international protection and, in particular, the right to the protection of vulnerable groups, such as children. The Border and Visa Fund, which we are talking about this evening, is one of the key instruments aimed at supporting the implementation of policies within the Union. We in parliament therefore insist, as rapporteur, that the allocations will not be used to finance programmes in third countries over the next seven years. European border management is in no way linked to the establishment of detention centres or disembarkation of migrants in third countries or to the transfer of european border management to third countries. And finally, this. In order to increase transparency, we propose greater involvement of civil society and local and regional authorities in the preparation of national programmes. For greater democratic control, however, the european Parliament's role in spending money is greater.

EU funding is paramount for creating and sustaining strong external borders. Already, four years into the current Multiannual Financial Framework, EU funding has helped train almost 9 000 border guards. Funding from the EU budget has, furthermore, supported frontline Member States managing major migratory pressure at the EU external borders. Such efforts need to be sustained and strengthened with a view to increased migratory challenges and unforeseen events at the Union’s borders. Synergies with Union action in other fields also need to be reinforced in order to maximise impact on the ground. The Commission’s response to the future challenges has been clear. We have proposed establishing a new, separate fund for integrated border management and further strengthening the European Border and Coastguard Agency with a standing corps. The new border fund will, on the one hand, help Member States to carry out customs controls by financing necessary equipment. On the other hand, through the Border Management and Visa Instrument, more than EUR 8 billion will be devoted to strengthening the EU external borders, supporting the common visa policy and helping Member States to develop new large-scale IT systems and upgrade existing ones in line with the new requirements. This represents a nearly three-fold increase, compared with the current borders instrument. Furthermore, the Commission has proposed to improve its response capacity by allowing funds to be deployed swiftly where there are major synergies. The increased flexibility of the instrument will help adapt the allocation of funding to developments on the ground, such as disproportionate pressure at the European Union’s external borders. A robust and coherent approach to border management can be achieved by improving cooperation with customs authorities, and this funding instrument will help realise that. Cooperation with third countries is another important pillar of strong border management. Allowing our border guards to work together with their counterparts in third countries, in a close and interoperable manner, will help reduce irregular migration and the loss of lives at sea. To achieve that, the Border Management and Visa Instrument has a strengthened external dimension while ensuring complementarity with action supported through external funding instruments. As I said before, capping funding for external action and allowing cooperation with third countries only in exceptional cases will hamper the Union’s ability to act when it is most needed.

That is why, planning the next decade, this fund could not fail to mirror what we have learned from the most recent past.  Firstly, more money: in managing borders, Member States remain the main actors, which is why, together with the strengthening of the European Border and Coastal Agency, we multiply by five available funds; there are about ten billion that will help protect our borders while promoting legal entry into the territory. Secondly, more flexibility: the recent past has shown that we need greater solidarity and faster in emergency situations; the Union cannot be held hostage by agreements at the moment to assist embattled Member States; that is why we propose greater flexibility in the management of the fund, in exceptional and urgent cases. Thirdly, greater justice: on our own initiative, so-called cohesion countries, such as Portugal, will have funding of 85 % instead of 75 %; but also more justice in the allocation, as a clear incentive is introduced to those projects aimed at giving consequence to the problems found by the Schengen evaluation mechanism.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, now that we have reached the last item on the agenda to deal with internal security and the new fund just before midnight, I would like to thank my shadow rapporteurs, all of whom have stayed in this Chamber with me, including the Commissioner, and who are showing good perseverance in dealing with the ISF here too.  I believe that the ISF is becoming increasingly important, given that we and the Member States are increasingly coming to the conclusion, both because of the threat of international terrorism and because of the issues of combating serious international and organised crime, that we need to work more together, that we need to cooperate more effectively, that we need to exchange information as best we can, that we need to coordinate with each other and that, accordingly, we must also be prepared for all requirements in a technically modernised manner.  In order to meet all the challenges here, the Commission has presented the new regulation accordingly, and I consider it to be a very good basis for discussion with the Member States. As a Parliament, we have tried, by a large majority, to focus on the priorities, in particular the intensification of the exchange of information between and within law enforcement authorities, as well as with third countries and international organisations. In particular, we have also focused on cross-border actions between EU law enforcement authorities on serious and organised crime with a cross-border dimension, strengthening the capacity to combat and prevent crime, including terrorism and cybercrime, in particular in cooperation between the authorities, civil society partners and private partners in the Member States, and have also set certain thresholds for this.  We note with some dismay that it always takes quite a while for the Member States to start using the funds and to deal with the respective programmes first. I believe that the citizens of Europe expect us, given the scale of the challenge, to devote ourselves intensively and collectively to the security wishes and the need for security that people feel, and not to keep failing at national borders, that certain information does not flow, that certain data are not entered or that we are not always up to date with the information.  That is why we have also ventured a little into something that may seem unusual, namely that we also want the information to be exchanged with the intelligence services, because we see that, in the field of serious international crime and terrorism, it is necessary to obtain adequate information from the intelligence services and with our European competent agencies. , in this case Europol in particular, to be able to network and analyse information in a meaningful way. And if, for example, we also want to develop Europol, then it is also necessary for the Member States to be prepared to actually exchange information.

But a replacement for public tasks or the performance of public tasks should not be provided by appropriate private organizations, but still by public security authorities.

Thank you for your introduction, Ms Hohlmeier. I have already underlined, in the debate we have just had, certain issues that concern all three funds, such as the need for flexibility and synergies with all the other funds. As I said, I hope too that the Council will soon adopt its negotiating mandate. I will now set out some issues that more specifically concern the Internal Security Fund. Over recent years, security threats have intensified and diversified. They are increasingly cross—border in nature, meaning that Member States can no longer act alone. While protecting citizens is a national competence, the European Union plays a vital role in supporting Member States’ efforts. Security will remain a defining issue for the European Union in the years to come and Europe’s citizens rightly expect their Union and national governments to deliver security in a fast-changing and uncertain world. We need sufficient resources to support our actions in the area of internal security, in line with our political priorities and in complementarity with other EU funds. Therefore, we propose to reinforce the budget for security, increasing it from EUR 1 billion in the current period to EUR 2.5 billion in the next period. This reflects the political importance the Commission attaches to addressing security challenges more effectively. However, things can change and evolve. Therefore – and I believe this view is shared by Parliament – it is of the utmost importance that our funding is flexible, simplified and adaptable to changing needs. How will the ISF better support new and emerging challenges? It will focus on three new objectives: increasing the exchange of information, intensifying cross—border joint operations and strengthening capabilities to combat and prevent crime. It will be more flexible, through the thematic facility and the mid—term review, allowing us to allocate funds on the basis on evolving needs and EU priorities at that point in time. Last but not least, security is a cross-cutting issue, touching upon several policy areas and involving a number of different EU funds. It is more important than ever that we get it right and design our fund to withstand the test of time.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": null}, {"id": 430, "date": "2019-03-12.json", "name": "Cécile Kashetu KYENGE", "mepid": "124801", "text": "  Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by thanking the rapporteur, Monika Hohlmeier, for the work she has done with us.

On the contrary, we need a strong and coordinated response at Union level and adequate resources to prevent and combat this constantly evolving sector.  But how do you ensure an adequate level of security? Certainly through law enforcement measures, especially aimed at preventing and combating terrorism, serious and organised crime crimes and cybercrime, as well as providing assistance and protection to victims of crime. But law enforcement measures are not enough. A high level of security is also ensured through preventive, coordination and cooperation measures. Thanks to the contributions of this Fund, Member States will be able to combat violent extremism, including radicalisation, intolerance and discrimination, in particular through increased cooperation between public authorities and civil society in all Member States.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. Today, women have the last word, again. In other words, I can, so to speak, say the final word at midnight. Very brief reply to colleagues: first of all, I would like to thank my shadow rapporteurs once again. Because there were really a lot of good and also creative ideas, and I think we also had a very good atmosphere in the conversations with each other, where we tried to understand each other and together to deliver a good concept here. Firstly, with regard to the intelligence services, it would be a clear mistake to believe that we are promoting intelligence services per se – that is not even permissible under the Treaty. Rather, we want cooperation with the European agency Europol. In the field of terrorism, we see very clearly that information from the field of intelligence must first be analysed and evaluated precisely and then checked to what extent it is useful and usable for the relevant investigations within the police competence. And that they are, we have seen in Germany, for example, in the so-called ricin case, which would not have been uncovered without intelligence activities. This is just one example among many. So we do not want to monitor and control the secret services – whatever, that is Member State competence, that is not our responsibility – but we want to promote an orderly and transparent form of cooperation, and I think that is sensible and effective. Secondly, military operations in the EU are specifically limited to the tasks. This means that if, for example, in France or Belgium, military units – in France, for example, after the Bataclan – have also helped to ensure internal security, then this is eligible. Military operations of a different kind do not belong to the isF's range of tasks. The tasks are very clearly defined, and they cannot be extended anywhere outside of competence. We have excluded these questions from home in the catalogue of exceptions. Finally, if we in this House – Madam President, forgive me, I have to say the sentence – ask us to reconsider the issue of the death penalty, then I must honestly say that it turns my stomach. We have the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and we will not respond with the same methods by which the terrorists and the serious criminals are trying to fight us, but we want to respond to the rule of law and respond with the rule of law and with our laws, and accordingly leave it to the courts to issue the penalties and then also deal with these people under the rule of law.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 438, "date": "2019-03-12.json", "name": "Heidi HAUTALA", "mepid": "2054", "text": "  The debate is closed.

With this in mind, increasing the budget of the Internal Security Fund (FSI) is an important financial means through which the EU can support cooperation and coordination between member states' law enforcement authorities. As the Report of the Special Committee on Terrorism has shown, the exchange of information must be strengthened through greater use of joint law enforcement operations between Member States (I am thinking of joint investigation teams) but also by investing in the appropriate training of staff and facilitating the exchange of best practices. With a view to a long-term counter to the phenomenon of terrorism, it is also essential to extend the scope of the Fund to measures aimed at preventing violent extremism, for example through interventions in prisons and in the digital sphere.

The Internal Security Fund was set up with the aim of facilitating cross-border cooperation and exchanges of information between law enforcement officials in the Member States and other relevant authorities. The Fund aims to enhance cross-border operational cooperation in the prevention, detection and investigation of cross-border crime acts and to support efforts to strengthen the capacities needed to prevent these forms of crime, including terrorism, in particular through increased cooperation between public authorities, civil society and private partners in all Member States. The proposal includes restrictions on funding of third countries and eliminates military funding and the possibility of purchasing weapons with EU funds in emergency situations.", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}]
