Thanks for the good cooperation to my co-rapporteur Gerben-Jan Gerbrandy and all shadow rapporteurs. Twelve months of work, 27 meetings and a total of 47 hearings are behind us. We have already adopted the final report in the committee and achieved great success. We have succeeded in presenting a balanced report and we are now about to vote in plenary. What conclusions can we draw from the work of the past twelve months? The result of the report is clear: nobody actually assumed that there was willful fraud. In addition, unfortunately, no law in the world can completely protect against willful fraud. But it is also clear that the current regulations on exhaust gas regulation offer too much room for interpretation. The Commission and the Member States should have enforced clearer rules and acted earlier. That is why I ask: Firstly: We now urgently need the implementation of the emissions tests in real road operation. By the way, using the latest technologies there are already clean diesel engines that comply with the limit values ​​on the road. Second, we need better market surveillance. The aim here is to eliminate deficits between member states and the EU Commission. The cooperation between the Member States and the Commission did not work. Neither the Commission nor the Member States have considered defeat devices as a possible cause of the discrepancies between the NOx emissions measured in the laboratory and those measured on the road. The scope and the provisions of the prohibition of defeat devices have never been objected to by either side, nobody has asked for clarification here. Emission reduction strategies - that sounds very technical; it is too. However, if these so-called strategies mean that within of a certain thermal window - that is, only at a certain temperature - the emission reduction is fully switched on, this is very difficult to justify on the grounds that this serves to protect the motor. The same applies to a certain time window if this time window roughly corresponds to the test duration on the roller stand. Here the engine protection was designed very broadly, also at the expense of environmental protection and air quality. That is not acceptable. In addition, the provisions of EU law for exceptions to defeat devices are not applied uniformly in Europe. That is why we need uniform legal implementation in the EU more than ever. In the event of discrepancies, the European Union must be given powers to make legally binding decisions. Otherwise the law will continue to be applied differently. The Commission did not monitor the enforcement of the defeat device ban, although it was obliged to do so. Most Member States have not put in place an effective, proportionate and dissuasive system of penalties to prevent unlawful use of defeat devices. Neither the Commission nor the Member States can give a good report in this regard. But now it is important to look ahead. As far as better market surveillance and uniform implementation of the law are concerned, some colleagues keep bringing an EU agency into play, based on the motto: if there is a problem, I simply invent a new agency. I ask myself why. There are already 34 decentralized agencies, plus other executive agencies. These are associated with high administrative costs, too much bureaucracy and additional costs for the taxpayer. We do not need another bureaucratic agency to monitor the market and ensure uniform legislation. Much more efficient and The task could be taken up by the EU Commission in a more cost-saving manner. I am surprised, Commissioner Bieńkowska, that the Commission does not seem capable of this task. So, we as the EPP definitely trust you as the Commission and you as Commissioner to do this. You have our support. In addition, some colleagues are calling for consumer compensation. Firstly, we have to state that there is no uniform legal basis in Europe, as there is, for example, in the USA. In Europe we have a high level of protection for consumers in a global comparison. This protection is defined at the level of the Member States - and that is a good thing - and ultimately judged by the courts. In this context, I find some amendments for today's plenary vote remarkable. On the one hand, comprehensive compensation is required, on the other hand, no employee should be negatively affected by such compensation. If you make such a request, then you should also be honest that you are putting hundreds of thousands of jobs in the automotive industry at risk. A policy of \"wash my fur but don't get me wet\" will not work. Furthermore, European vehicles could be retrofitted so that they comply with the limit values. This was not possible in America. And finally, this type of compensation does not solve the real problem. That is the last and most important point I want to bring to the end: the real problem is poor air quality. As the EPP, we have now tabled an amendment to the plenary, in which we are setting up an environmental fund so that ultimately those who are really injured are also compensated, namely cyclists and pedestrians. Not only the consumer as the buyer of a vehicle is affected, but above all pedestrians and cyclists. I believe that we as the EPP are innovative and progressive here are.I assume that this will find the support of the Greens - Bas Eickhout is there, he is already laughing, he will certainly support us on this issue because it is an innovative approach.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 2, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 2, "date": "2017-04-04.json", "name": "Gerben-Jan GERBRANDY", "mepid": "96940", "text": "Reporter. - I too would like to thank my fellow rapporteur, not only Jens Gieseke, but also his predecessor Pablo Zalba for the pleasant cooperation. Obviously the shadow rapporteurs, the coordinators, the chairman of our committee, but especially the secretariat of the committee, which in the end worked much harder than all of us put together. Madam President, I think that this committee of inquiry has done a very good job. Shocking facts have surfaced and we have become more critical and unified as the work has progressed, including those who were not initially in favor of the creation of this committee of inquiry. I think that we can all be very proud of the final report. We got a lot of facts out and came to very strong, firm conclusions. Nevertheless, I think it could have been even better. Better cooperation from both the European Commission and the Member States could really have resulted in even better work, but also our internal functioning. Why did we start hearings so quickly and not take much more time for the preliminary investigation? Madam President, the final report reads like a train and I really advise anyone who has not yet done so to just read it. Take that half hour, because it provides a unique insight into the failure of the European Union. It presents a shocking picture of European and national failure to get cleaner cars on European roads and it is truly outrageous how the interests of our European citizens have been haggled on such a large scale. The growing discrepancies between lab testing and actual emissions had been known for ten to twelve years! Shockingly little has been done to improve the situation. In fact, the Committee of Inquiry has shown that both within the European Commission and in many Member States, better control, stricter enforcement and the development of a new, better auto test are simply thwarted. Most shockingly, even after the outbreak of the diesel scandal, very little has been done to improve the situation. And the conformance factor of 2.1 is really a travesty. The system was and possibly is - let's face it - rotten. Member states did not want to tackle the car industry more harshly and consciously turned a blind eye. And the quarrel now between Germany and Italy about Fiat is a sign of this: not tackling their own industry, but being very critical of the industry in another Member State. Within the European Commission, fierce battles had been going on for years between the environmental departments and the industry department up to and including the commissioners. Not the interests of 500 million Europeans were leading, nor the simple application of European law. No, unfortunately, the short-term interests of the auto industry prevailed. Our research focused mainly on public actors, but our hearings with the industry and many media reports around them have provided a shocking picture of the industry's lack of sense of responsibility. That is really close to zero! No public apologies, no gesture to car owners, no hands in their bosom, and certainly no sign of responsibility to the millions of Europeans forced to breathe dirty air. On the contrary, stern denials from individual car manufacturers and certainly from ACEA. For me, one of the most shocking moments was when the ACEA representative confirmed to my question that it was also in the spirit of the law to get clean cars in a lab and not on the road. Shocking! Madam President, our investigation is over, but there is still a lot to do. I really expect the European Commission to take our conclusions and recommendations seriously and act quickly, for example by taking responsibility for air quality and to place legislation, such as that on car emissions, in the hand of one Commissioner and not turn it into a debate between two Commissioners. But especially the Member States should read our report carefully and I would advise all national parliaments to also put this report on the agenda in their own parliaments. Not implementing the law should not be acceptable to national parliaments either. But the Member States will also have to look at a much more transparent and open operation of the technical working groups, the technical expert groups, a very big problem. Incidentally, Member States and a Council that is now again shining through absence. And finally, I really sincerely hope that those same Member States, when they deal with the new type-approval legislation, will now really realize that we need to move to a different system with much stronger European supervision. That we really have to get away from that national intention to keep national industry under control and not to think about all 500 million Europeans at all.", "language": "en", "original_language": "nl", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Liberals and centrists"}, {"id": 3, "date": "2017-04-04.json", "name": "Gerben-Jan GERBRANDY", "mepid": "96940", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, first I want to thank both rapporteurs, I want to thank the Chair of the committee, Mrs Van Brempt, all of the members of the committee who really devoted a lot of time and effort to this important topic. I welcome the report. I welcome the conclusions achieved by the Committee of Inquiry into Emission Measurements in the Automotive Sector (EMIS) and I am glad that I have again the possibility to discuss it with you.  At the beginning I want to very much stress that we have to remember one thing: the emissions scandal should keep all of us still alerted, for the sake of the consumers who bought cars based on false promises, because of the arrogance in disregarding the rules and, importantly, because of the loss of the time which should have been spent making progress on the topics of the future: driverless and zero emissions cars.  I am sure that today the report will give our citizens too – not only ourselves, but especially our citizens – clarity and transparency about what has happened and what needs to change. Today is really a very symbolic day, on which we can we can start looking into the future, planning and acting. We want the industry to play by the rules and to truly respect and compensate consumers in Europe, not just to say they do so. From today, I want Member States to carry out proper market surveillance and enforce the law. Most importantly, I also want the Commissioners – myself, ourselves – and co-legislators to agree on an effective legal framework for type approval because such abuse should not take place again in Europe. Again, I appreciate the extremely hard work of the EMIS Committee. This was a massive report. Both I and my colleagues welcome your report and the resolution on which you are about to vote.  We have a very common interest, I kept repeating this, to rebuild the trust in our regulatory system, to regain the credibility of our automotive industry and most importantly, to protect our consumers and our citizens. The Commission has made big efforts so far. We have achieved a lot already. Most notably, I have tabled a revision of the type approval framework, but of course there is still a lot more to be done. We will not let up the pressure on Member States to provide us with concrete information and all of the evidence we need from them. The situation on this is still not very good.  I welcome the conclusion of the EMIS report and the European Parliament recommendations. They show me that the Commission is really on the right track. I will ensure a solid follow-up together with my colleagues, with Karmenu Vella, with Věra Jourová, and with Miguel Arias Cañete.  This follow-up will include the allegation of maladministration, because there are some issues to which we can already respond, and this is because we have acted to remedy this situation as quickly as possible. We have done it, as you know, in three areas: better enforcement, better market surveillance and better rules. The work of your committee has been really key in helping us and helping me progress on all three points. Thank you very much for this. Firstly, I am taking a very strong approach to enforcement and I am again grateful for your support on this. We have launched infringement procedures against seven Member States so far, but I am sure we have not finished our work yet and I will launch many more procedures if necessary.  Secondly, as your draft resolution quite rightly says, we need to improve market surveillance. You propose the creation of the European Vehicle Surveillance Agency, and as you will have noticed in the White Paper on the future of Europe that this document refers to a possible enforcement agency, I think we have to really discuss it further in this context. But in the meantime, let us make quick progress on our legislative proposal on type approval.  Thirdly, we definitely need better rules, not just on market surveillance, but overall. I agree with the views in the EMIS report on this point. I believe that our proposals meet your recommendations in this area as well. We delivered on laboratory testing: CO2 emissions, fuel consumption will become really more realistic with the so-called WLTP test. We delivered on the new robust procedure to test CO2 emissions, in real driving conditions, the RDE packages. And we delivered the guidance for the Member States to enforce the ban on defeat devices. Most importantly of all, as I said we have proposed a much stronger type approval system. I welcome the progress that you have made on this proposal and the vote today.  This takes me to my final point. The Commission has taken first corrective actions but of course we cannot be the only ones. At the source of the scandals was the corrupt behaviour of a number of car manufacturers. But, as was also said by the rapporteurs, the industry’s attitude has not changed fundamentally. I hear very often: OK, this case was unacceptable but this is an isolated case. That is not true. There is also the failure of Member States’ authorities to spot this and to react appropriately. Some Member States have taken serious efforts to improve but others are still in denial.  The work of the committee and the work of the Commission will not be done until attitudes change. Let us use this this political momentum to change. This scandal should be followed by a massive work towards zero emissions cars. We are responsible as policy makers because industry needs a clear regulatory signal. Zero emissions cars are the future of this industry. I hope that we can work together to maintain this pressure even after today’s voting and after the report is concluded.

In Europe, we have two big goals for years. We have climate goals - to reduce CO2 emissions, we have environmental goals - to ensure good air quality. In the transport sector, this culminated in years of policies to support the deployment of diesel engines in Europe. In Europe, among passenger cars, or in contrast to the rest of the world's major economies, we have almost half - as in any country - of diesel cars, other countries do not. This is because it has been found that the diesel engine is not only beneficial in terms of CO2 emissions, but that, if properly regulated, harmful emissions (which are harmful to the environment, say the human respiratory tract, so-called soot) can also be regulated. And so we also wrote in the law that the development of diesel engines must ensure that NOx emissions are low. What actually happened? In fact, it happened that diesels were developed, but for years, virtually all car manufacturers that sell diesel engines have been deceiving us for years as legislators, deceiving us as consumers with their emissions to the air or NOx. The result is this commission. The result is now the scandal that is. But how is this possible? This is possible because laws are adopted at European level but applied or complied with at Member State level. And there is a big, big gap in Europe here - there is too big a gap between the legislator and the law enforcer. Of course, we are changing the law. Of course, there will now be a new testing methodology that will involve not only laboratory tests, but also the emissions they actually have on the road. But here we all have the lesson that, when pursuing one goal, in this case the climate goal, we must be very careful about the possible side effects, such as the impact on air quality.", "language": "en", "original_language": "lv", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 5, "date": "2017-04-04.json", "name": "Kathleen VAN BREMPT", "mepid": "5729", "text": "on behalf of the S & amp; D Group. - In front of you stands an incredibly proud, proud chairman of the first commission of inquiry for ten years.

We have all had the openness to look at the facts.

That we ensure that we can introduce remote sensing and, for example - a very important thing - start measuring NOx, also during the vehicle inspection.

The large differences between car emissions in the lab and those on the road were known and there were indications of possible fraud. Nevertheless, no action was taken to vigorously address the structural problem. On the contrary, the implementation of effective field testing has been significantly delayed. The conclusion cannot be misunderstood: irresponsible member states and a negligent European Commission pushed public health aside. Especially vulnerable road users and children are affected. Poor air quality makes citizens gasp for breath and makes them critically ill. In the EU, 75,000 people die prematurely every year from nitrogen dioxide alone, mainly from polluting diesel cars. However, the technology is available to achieve the set standards today, even in real driving conditions and without a negative impact on CO2 emissions. It is incomprehensible, it is unacceptable that even now some Member States and the automotive sector are still on the brakes. Their deceleration maneuvers must stop. After all, the protection of public health and the environment is a shared social responsibility. Today we have the unique opportunity to show our citizens that we are not going to let them down and that we are getting rid of the structural failure that “dieselgate” has exposed.

It has been a very intensive work this year and I want to give recognition to both the chairman, rapporteurs and colleagues in the committee. I think it has been the most labor-intensive committee this year; a compliment for the time and commitment you have put into the issue. A lot has also emerged that has been important to us. It is clear that the European car industry has standards and opportunities to act in ways that are not possible for other industries. I know what it looks like every time a scandal is revealed in the production of clothes in a clothing company, what it looks like when food producers are exposed in cheating and scandals. It is being fought hard, there are new controls, there is new legislation and we are acting very clearly. There has been cheating going on here that we have been aware of directly and indirectly for a very, very long time. In addition, there has been a failure, both by Member States and by the Commission, to actually act. This makes this industry very, very unique, and here we will need to do even more in the future. I also think it is very good that we have received a clarification. It is also a matter of course that during the time the committee was working, new scandals were revealed in other brands than what perhaps primarily made us start this committee of inquiry. Brand after brand with different methods of cheating. So this is something that we have to say permeates the industry and where the Member States and the controls do not work. It also points out very clearly that the legislation that we often adopt at European level is too seldom properly implemented and controlled, and that it is too bad fines and penalties if they are broken. Here we have a core task for all the legislation that we adopt in this House: to ensure that it is actually complied with and that it has consequences.

After a year of research and many hours of listening, it is now clear that there are serious political responsibilities. Both the Commission and the Member States have been well aware, since 2013, when the Joint Research Center's report was published, that it was possible to use emission distortion systems. But they did not take any action. The lack of action, however, is not due to a lack of information or insufficient resources, as the resolution of the recommendations wrongly argues. Unfortunately, it was confirmed that the excessive delays were due to the influence of the lobbies and the pressures exerted by the car industry. Despite calls for environmental protection, the Commission has shown that it did not have the political will to act on the seriousness of the issue of high emissions and to give priority to the protection of endangered public health. We therefore denounce the serious political responsibilities and omissions of both the Commission and the Member States in the application of EU law, but also in the imposition of sanctions. Their responsibilities constitute mismanagement to the detriment of the interests of the peoples. Those responsible for the loopholes in the legislation and the safety net they gave to the multinationals in order to be illegal, they will have to pay.

I think the conclusions of the committee of inquiry are very clear: the Dieselgate scandal could have been prevented if the national authorities and the Commission had done their work. It could have been prevented. It was not. For all those people who thought we were helping the car industry with that: they are the ones being punished the most, because internationally there is a big lack of trust in European car manufacturers. There you see that politicians who were relaxed towards the car industry are worse for them than those who tried to be tough and fair from the start. Let that be a lesson for all our legislators. If you look at the conclusions, there are six counts of maladministration on Member States. There are five contraventions of European law identified in this report, but there are also seven counts of maladministration done by the Commission cited in our conclusions. So those who say we have full trust in the Commission should maybe read their own reports. Seven counts of maladministration show that something needs to happen and needs to change within the Commission as well. I think that is important too. But my most important point is that the upshot is that a lot of polluting cars remain on the streets. We know that a lot of these car manufacturers produced defeat devices and are using defeat devices. I say to the Commission: if you apply your own guidelines, you will identify that a lot of car manufacturers are applying defeat devices. That is forbidden by law.

The final report of the committee of inquiry, which I believe to be a good document, clearly denounces Europe's complete failure to guarantee truly clean cars on the road in our cities, as they are presented to us in the pounding commercials on television. But the news is only half as good. The final report lacks a clear reference to European consumer compensation treated in a discriminatory way compared to US consumers. As a 5 Star Movement, we ask that adequate compensation be introduced also by means of class action, a tool that unfortunately has not yet been introduced at European level in a uniform and harmonized way. We also believe that to prevent these scandals from happening again in the future, it is necessary to set up an independent European agency, which is the only way to avoid conflicts of interest, in which the controller is the controlled and where each Member State serves the interests of the flag car industry. Yet the 2007 regulation was precisely meant to improve air quality, and instead the European Commission and Member States have guaranteed decades of impunity and a profusion of funds to an auto industry that has been selling lies and disease to European consumers. The final report recognizes many of the mistakes made and identifies clear responsibilities. First, the timing: ten years since the NEDC test was known to be dated and unrepresentative, more than ten years since the environmental agency reports warning of discrepancies between laboratory and real emissions, four years from the report of the Joint Center of research in which the possible use of illegal software was mentioned, and seven years to design the PEMS, which among other things give a further gift to the auto industry thanks to very generous compliance factors, or the famous multipliers for limitsNOx - again a number that has all the flavor of a political choice, without any technical-scientific basis.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 1, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 11, "date": "2017-04-04.json", "name": "Marie-Christine ARNAUTU", "mepid": "124748", "text": "on behalf of the ENF group. - Mr President, the Commission of Inquiry assumed that the standards set by the Commission for diesel vehicles were correctly calibrated.

This is to forget that they have already made significant technical efforts to reduce polluting emissions over the past fifteen years, which should be emphasized. In an exacerbated competitive environment and in the midst of an economic recession from 2008, the European Union has undoubtedly erred by excess of optimism by overestimating the technological developments that can be made by manufacturers. So how can we be surprised that car manufacturers are using illegal software, with the consent of the Commission itself? Another aspect would also have deserved to be addressed by the Commission of Inquiry, an aspect that can be summed up by the formula: \"Who benefits from the crime?\" Last week, the Volkswagen group agreed to compensate ten US states to the tune of $ 157.45 million, an amount in addition to the $ 23 billion already disbursed by the German manufacturer to settle the various complaints across the Atlantic .

Some would have liked to make this commission a political tribunal or a diesel tribunal, but that is not the point. Indeed, everyone has their share of responsibility in this matter. The slow pace of decisions at all levels as well as the complex development of a new test procedure have weighed on the rapid improvement in the quality of vehicle emissions. On the other hand, automakers have been, for some, too reluctant to comply with new and sometimes very strict standards. The tests carried out so far in the laboratory also lacked transparency, which will finally be corrected. We now have a duty to look to the future. The new rules must be acted upon. While major shortcomings have been detected in the approval procedures put in place by national authorities, the European Commission must be able to exercise better oversight by checking the Member States, and it is of course important to ensure the application of sanctions. As for diesel, long favored for its CO2 emissions, it is undergoing major changes to reduce its NOx emissions which are very harmful to health. A better balance between petrol and diesel is inevitable in Europe, but new diesel technologies will only have a future if they comply with environmental standards.

The findings of our investigation were widely adopted on February 28, and I welcome that.

Our conclusions are clear and precise. We must now draw the practical consequences. This is the purpose of the resolution voted on today. The European and national institutions have failed, but the opportunity is now given to them to restore the situation in the interest of all, for less polluted air and cities where people breathe better thanks to cleaner cars and more controlled. The legislation has been poorly applied. We must therefore find the means to apply it correctly throughout Europe and strengthen a posteriori controls, which remain the best way to fight against fraud. What better tool than a specialized European agency to apply the law uniformly, in a manner impervious to national interests, with the help of technically qualified experts? The other modes of transport in Europe, such as air, sea and rail transport are regulated by agencies. Why not road transport? This would be the logical conclusion of our work. Moreover, the committee of inquiry voted in this direction last February and Jean-Claude Juncker declared himself in favor. I hear the sadly budgetary arguments that a new agency is too expensive. I will respond by saying that public health should not be seen as a cost but as an investment, especially when we see the exorbitant price that Europeans pay each year because of air pollution, the thousands of deaths. but also diseases chronic, sometimes long-lasting, and the consequences for our health systems.Also, an agency does not cost that much when it is smartly set up.For example, it is possible to broaden the skills of an existing agency for economies of scale.By relying on the work of national authorities but supervising them, such an agency would also save lengthy and costly litigation between two Member States.Our goal with the creation of this agency is more of Europe and, above all, a Europe that protects.What we need today is a robust system that ensures that the rules are followed.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 2, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 23, "date": "2017-04-04.json", "name": "Kosma ZŁOTOWSKI", "mepid": "124884", "text": "- Mr Chairman!

There is no doubt that there is a major scandal here, and it is also unquestionable that car manufacturers have cheated and deceived on a large scale here.

If we start with the European Commission, we have to state that the deviations between emissions in test operation and emissions in normal road traffic operation have been known for more than ten years. It has been known for more than 20 years that there are defeat devices that can be responsible for such deviations, and yet the Commission has turned a blind eye to it and has not adequately checked whether the manufacturers are possibly being cheated. This is a clear case of policy failure. There is also a second case of policy failure with regard to the European Parliament. Because the European Parliament passed legislation that was so soft and so imprecise that it was an invitation to deceive. It has allowed defeat devices or emission reduction strategies - whatever you like to call them - to be used when damage to the engine can be averted. That is a completely soft and inadequate formulation, and here the European Parliament has to take a hard look at what mistakes it actually made.

On the one hand, it is correct that gray areas were created in the law back then, in which there was no conformity factor. On the other hand, it is above all the case that the Commission, the Member States and the industry clearly did not care whether there were limit values ​​or not. They were exceeded up to three times. Incidentally, in the last period, Mr Lucke, Parliament has already paid attention and called for real driving emission tests because we knew that the tests were not truthful. That was pretty much ignored back then, and unfortunately it is only now being introduced.

Isn't this act worthy of punishment or compensation? However, European carmakers refuse to pay European consumers what they are morally entitled to. I find it absurd to consider that Europeans are treated in this way. They are not secondary customers and deserve the same treatment.

One year emissions test committee - what are the most important points and recommendations for me? On the one hand, one thing is clear: Diesel is not doomed to die; it will remain one of several drive technologies in the automotive industry for the next few years, perhaps decades. The second thing for me is: we need clear and unambiguous legislation, otherwise we would not have had a debate as to whether switching off the engine control is legal component protection or illegal fraud. Third: exhaust gas measurements must be more precisely traceable, because results from the laboratory that cannot be reproduced on the road and cannot be achieved neither help the consumer, nor do they help the environment, nor do they help the manufacturer. That is why we will have real driving emissions in the future and have also created a solution at European level. Regarding the type approval agency: I also take a really critical view of this, because we are building double structures here. We already have corresponding type approval offices in Europe, we don't need anything new. If we do that, we will have a new authority. We need three to five years to build it up. Not much would change in the meantime and we should rather strengthen existing structures.

A new type-approval system and new limits for vehicle emissions are an absolute priority now assumed by the European Commission and the Member States. The bet on electric mobility is essential.

What can they learn from the report? First of all, it is clear that we have made no mistakes in setting limits for cars. We have collected enough clear evidence that there is – and was – technology available that could make car engines compliant with the regulation, regardless of the petrol or diesel technology used. That technology is – and was – available at reasonable cost. Secondly, we learned that some manufacturers decided to save money and produce cars that could seriously harm the health of our citizens. That is what we know for certain. But there was also some reaction, which was late but quite clear. We have put together a new laboratory test. More importantly, we have introduced the real driving testing that is a key fundamental of a new and better system, and we will also be discussing and voting on the type-approval system. I therefore believe that we will end up with a much better system which will make it more difficult and more costly for people to cheat. But, at the same time, there is still some disappointing information. First of all, the reaction of both national governments and the Commission on Dieselgate is not sufficient and not clear enough. Here I do not mean compensation for car owners. It is not mainly car owners who are affected by the scandal, but the people living in cities, walking on the pavements and waiting at crossroads who have to breathe the air that has been polluted by non-compliant cars. This is quite disappointing and, as a consequence, I would propose to put together a fund that will ensure that we will fight for programmes in air quality and achieve an improvement. Secondly it is quite important that cars that still emitting more than ten times the limits in real driving are still on sale and causing air quality to be worse. It will take time before we improve the air quality that that was devastated by non—compliant cars, but I call on the Commission and Governments to act much more quickly to improve the confidence of our citizens in their actions.

I would like to make three comments. My first comment goes to the rapporteurs and also to the chairmen of the committee: thank you very much for presenting the report. The committee has done a really good job. There have been 47 hearings. At the hearings I was able to attend - there weren't many - there was a very intense, detailed discussion with critical questions. It was really good. The second point I want to make is the question: what lesson are we drawing from the Dieselgate scandal? For me the most important thing is that we have testing on the road in the future, that we have testing under real driving conditions. For myself, I have to admit frankly, it is a bit inexplicable and really incomprehensible that we will only achieve this in 2017. It has been mentioned: The subject of “testing in the laboratory with incorrect values ​​compared to testing under real driving conditions” is an ancient topic. I can still remember: That was also an issue with the climate protection package that we discussed in Parliament in 2007/2008. So it's a failure on all channels. I do not know whether we in Parliament are primarily to blame. I don't think so, because we are legislators and we don't have to ensure that it is enforced. But that it takes so long is actually completely incomprehensible and incomprehensible. All those politically responsible should touch their own noses. My third comment is also very important to me: We have Euro 5 and Euro 6 standards, we have strict values, strict CO2 requirements and want our cars to be low-polluting and low-emission. If you look at today's diesels - technologically it is absolutely no problem to meet Euro 5, Euro 6 standards. The same applies to the strict upper limits. I say this because I think it would be completely wrong to take the diesel out of circulation now.No, we will need diesel technology for many, many years to come.And, as I said, the new cars can meet these strict limits.Therefore, please do not generally declare war on diesel.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 52, "date": "2017-04-04.json", "name": "José BLANCO LÓPEZ", "mepid": "125044", "text": "- Mr President, it has already become clear that the European Parliament has done its job.

I can comment on this, but I also seek your strong support, which I have had so far. We need to be engaged not only on the follow-up of the recommendation but, I think, most importantly on ensuring that the legislation changes. We need to see early and effective adoption of the new type-approval reform, because this will be a game-changer. We must continue to hold car manufacturers and Member State authorities accountable. It is increasingly important that our consumers have confidence in the industry and in the national authorities overseeing it. Many of you mentioned compensation, and some of you mentioned that we have to protect our car manufacturers. As you noticed, I have not yet succeeded in getting a response from the car manufacturers on compensation to Europeans, but this not a matter of my personal success or otherwise. It is just the failure of the European car manufacturers to find a proper and fair response to Europeans, comparable to the Americans’ response. We just need an initial public gesture and a change of attitude, which has not happened so far. This would be the best protection and the best shield for our car manufacturers and for our automotive industry in the future. They have not done it so far. We must ensure that the law is monitored and enforced on the ground, and we have to work together on the future of the automotive sector. We know that diesel will not disappear overnight, but after this year of work and exchange of views with you, I am quite sure that they will disappear much faster than we think and we can imagine. We have to be prepared for this. We will come forward with a mobility package in May to address these issues. We will be prepared for the future with zero-emission cars, with the focus on batteries, on battery-charging infrastructure and regulatory incentives. We will prepare the future to ensure similar cross-border mobility and, finally, together with my colleagues the other Commissioners, we will prepare for the future of new demand models where public and private transport models are integrated. I urge you to work with me in the future and the longer term, because we need both the Member States and industry on board to get these changes right. I am sure that 2017 will be a decisive year for this. Thank you very much for everything achieved so far, especially by the committee. I am looking to working with you because I will need your strong support, as before. Lastly, I want to thank you for your high flexibility on arranging our work. Unfortunately – and I would like to apologise for this – I will not be able to stay with you throughout the debate on Mr Dalton’s report. The Commission will be represented on this by Commissioner Vella, who is also partly responsible for the file.

We got to know each other very well during the many hours of discussions we had on this report. We had some disagreements, as is expected on a file of this importance, but I believe that we have come to a very good compromise in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection in the end. Let us be clear: the Volkswagen scandal – and it was not just Volkswagen, but we have called it the Volkswagen scandal – was the tip of the iceberg. Consumers have been treated with contempt for a long, long time. They long ago gave up any trust in the fuel consumption claims that are made by manufacturers, and now they know that the emissions claims are wrong as well. This was a scandal that was waiting to happen. But what we have here in front of us now is a fundamental change from the current system and a very good compromise. It is far from the status quo. Firstly, we have new tests. The RDE testing means cars that will be tested on the roads, not just in the labs. That is a fundamental change from the system that existed before. Secondly, we have a new market-surveillance system. Member States have an obligation under this proposal to test 20% of types every year. They have to have their plans approved by the Commission, and the Commission is also empowered to do whatever tests it wants to do in addition. Thirdly, we have a new forum, which the Commission will direct and with independent peer review. So the Commission will get all the information it needs from Member States, stakeholders, NGOs and civil society in order to know the problems much, much earlier and have the tools to deal with them. Every Member State has to apply the same rules. There are fewer opportunities now for forum shopping and independent auditors will check on a periodic basis that rules are applied fairly and clearly. Fees cannot be paid directly by manufacturers to testing centres, which deals with the concerns that many had about manufacturers’ influence. And we have a proposal on consumer redress. The fines will go into a fund that will help consumers and the environment. This is a big, broad and ambitious package which got huge support in the Internal Market Committee. No one change in the system will prevent fraud, but together all these changes will guard against, firstly, cars incorrectly being put on the market, and, secondly, cars being on the market for a long time before a fault is found. We cannot stop all non-compliant products getting on the market. If someone wants to cheat the system, they are going to try and cheat the system, but we need to make sure that we have a system that is as strong as possible to catch them when they do it. I would also remind everyone that type-approval is not just about emissions. It is primarily about safety standards for cars on our roads. I also want to touch on the agency because we have had a big debate about the agency, which is still raging today. I am not against an agency if it can be proven that there is a benefit from the agency, but so far I have not seen a benefit. I have yet to see a consumer who wants an agency that is remote from the market and hidden from the consumer. The justification also seems to be weak. Agencies are just as susceptible to political pressure as the Commission or Member States, and this gives an excuse for national Member States not to act when they should be acting. It has not been costed, there is no detailed impact assessment and there is no idea how it is going to manage the market surveillance system. Let us be clear: this will cost a lot of money and we need to be right, sure and confident that it is going to do the job before we propose it. I also have a bit of concern with one of the amendments from the Greens: Amendment 343, on what I would call a ‘victim’s levy’. This will effectively be a fine on people who want to buy new cars. This is a little bit like you getting mugged, the police coming to you and saying ‘we’re terribly sorry we didn’t stop you getting mugged, but we’ll take a bit more money out your pocket to try and stop it happening again’. This is not the right way to deal with the issue. It is not the right way to fund an agency or any of these measures. So I do not think we should be going down that line. As I said before, we have got a good agreement in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection that was supported by most Members. It is robust, good for consumers, good for the environment and fair for industry. I do not think we should confuse that issue with an agency. But now I am looking forward to hearing all your remarks.

I thank Mr Dalton, as the rapporteur on this file, and also his shadow rapporteurs. We welcome the opportunity it gives us to reiterate the importance that we attach to this proposal. It is the most important measure to restore confidence in our system and the credibility of the industry.  It is very timely to hold this debate just after the debate on the report and recommendations of the Committee of Inquiry into Emission Measurements in the Automotive Sector (EMIS). If there is a clear lesson to learn from the car industry’s emission manipulations it is that our system was not fit for purpose. Yes, we knew that emissions were higher on the road than in the laboratories, so already way back in 2012 we started a review of the EU type approval framework for motor vehicles, but the events of September 2015 really opened our eyes. The Volkswagen case showed that there is a massive problem and further revelations have underlined that. They have shown that this is not only about Volkswagen. There has been a systematic failure of the type approval system right across Europe – a system that could not prevent one of the biggest ever industrial scandals in Europe.  So maintaining the status quo is not even an option; we need real change, we need a 180° shift to our regulatory system. We have to show that Europe can make a difference to people’s lives. Air quality in many of our cities is unacceptably poor and it causes premature deaths, and citizens have been cheated. It is time for citizens to see that we are all pulling in the same direction and that we are all putting their interests, their health and their environmental concerns first.  So the Commission very much welcomes the good progress made by Parliament. We commend the hard work of the rapporteur and shadow rapporteurs. This was a huge effort and we know it has not been an easy process. You are sending a strong and a clear message to our citizens and to our industry. Type approval must put safety, environmental protection and the well-being of citizens first. When they buy a car, consumers must be able to trust the promises on emission limits, fuel consumption, safety rules and so on.  This is the aim of our proposal and we are very pleased that the Internal Market Committee report supports the main pillars of our proposal, namely reinforcing the independence and quality of the car testing system, introducing a system to control cars on the road, and reinforcing the type approval system with greater European oversight. These pillars are fundamental to ensure that industry will comply with the rules, and that there will be high quality, high transparency and a level playing field between manufacturers.  It is not only manufacturers who need to change. Everyone involved will have to follow the rules strictly and to apply the requirements in a harmonised manner, whether they be importers, testing bodies and laboratories, or type approval and market surveillance authorities. No exceptions, no gaps.  You push us for even stronger actions, for instance mandatory targets for national market surveillance or reinforcing the Commission’s powers. These proposals go in the right direction and we are ready to consider them constructively. I believe that we should concentrate our efforts on these main pillars, so that we can make swift and effective progress. Other issues such as the provision of repair and maintenance information can be better addressed through parallel strands of work.  Let me tackle now the main open issue, which is the creation of an EU agency for vehicle market surveillance. I know that you discussed this at length and that you will continue discussing this today. In fact we already assessed the possibility of creating an EU agency as part of our type approval proposal. We discarded the idea at the time, mainly in the interest of speed, efficiency and budgetary resource implications.  In the meantime, we have seen how difficult it is to ensure proper enforcement in a system of 28 different national authorities. So far, only a handful of them have taken action against emissions cheating and only one Member State seems truly decisive, so effectively the remaining Member States are making the case for an agency by not acting. You will have noticed that the White Paper on the Future of Europe refers to a possible enforcement agency. Let us take the discussion further in that context. We are eager to listen to your opinions and concrete proposals today.  Mr President, honourable Members, whichever option we finally choose we need to make certain that it delivers a real 180° change. We have a duty to our citizens. They have been badly let down and they need to see that there has been real change. This is not just important for their health and their safety, it is also important for the environment and the future of the planet. By the way, it is important also for the future competitiveness of our car industry.

These are vehicles which do not meet the standards voted in this chamber ten years ago and which exceed them ten times, or even fifteen times for some. In other words, during these famous episodes of air pollution, it is the health of our citizens that is directly affected. Admittedly, these exceedances of standards are directly caused by the fraud of the manufacturers during the homologation tests. But it is also because of a complacent system between manufacturers and authorities that a vehicle does not meet the standards on the road and, coincidentally, does meet them in laboratory tests. With this report, Mr Dalton, you have the opportunity to bring order to a failing European certification system by establishing more independent and transparent tests and, above all, by allocating the means of monitoring the markets throughout. the life of vehicles. For me, there is only one thing left to do: reassure our citizens and show them that the European Parliament can say that there will never be Dieselgate again.

I am glad that we in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection have really succeeded in finding these solutions. It is clear to everyone that we need new legislation for the approval of new vehicles. It is clear to everyone that the 'diesel gate' cannot be repeated and our citizens cannot be deceived. At the same time, we need to better protect our environment, but also to think about the development of new technologies and employment in the European Union. We have been debating this final form of the new legislation in our committee for more than a year. The result is a change in methodology, new competencies, but also synergies between the European level and nation states. Full-scale testing is being introduced, the Commission's competences are being strengthened and a uniform procedure and interpretation of the rules is ensured throughout the Union. Last year's events have shown that this is really, very much needed. I am sure that we do not need new institutions, but we need a rapid substantial change that will work. We do not need new costs, but we need clear and enforceable rules. We do not need quarrelsome Member States, but we need the same rules for our entire European common market. I am pleased that the European Commission itself is not proposing new institutions, but is proposing a change in the current way, as is our committee.

Chairman! Volkswagen cheating with diesel emissions is a scandal. Unfortunately, it has turned out that it was not just Volkswagen that did not care about our European rules. Large parts of the automotive industry have put economic considerations over the environment and health. For us Social Democrats, it is therefore absolutely crucial to ensure new and tighter EU legislation that can prevent similar scandals in the future. Greater independence is required in type approval. Those who check that the cars comply with the rules must not be dependent on money from the car industry. Furthermore, Member States need to be made far more responsible for ensuring better type approval and control of cars when driving on the road. In addition, the European Commission must have more competences so that it is obliged to intervene and not sit idly by if it suspects failure and fraud. All this is part of and ensured by the Dalton report. All levels are committed to making work better, faster, more comprehensive and independent of the automotive industry. But we Social Democrats want to go one step further. We want the control of the cars to be concentrated in an EU agency. We know from experience in other areas that Member States often do not have the money, manpower or political will to control cars adequately. That is why we are proposing the creation of an EU agency to assemble and ensure that control of the cars takes place. It is both the cheapest and best way to ensure equal and real enforcement. We Social Democrats also want consumers to be compensated when damage occurs. In the US, Volkswagen's diesel cars have already been removed from the roads, faults have been rectified and consumers have been compensated. In the EU, consumers are still completely without compensation. We want this to change, and we believe that the extra penalty for companies to pay compensation can have a preventive effect. Overall, however, we Social Democrats are really happy about it result that has come, and we hope that this report can help ensure that a new diesel scandal is avoided in the future.", "language": "en", "original_language": "da", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 73, "date": "2017-04-04.json", "name": "Vicky FORD", "mepid": "96949", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Group. – Mr President, the mutual recognition of product standards is a cornerstone of trade within Europe and the type approval process for new cars is a prime example. Once a vehicle has passed its safety and emission tests in one country it can then be put on the market across all other countries without having to undergo further tests. It saves manufacturers millions in costs which would otherwise be spent on duplicative bureaucracy.  Buying a new car is the single largest purchase most individuals make and it is important that consumers trust the system and therefore the test process must be thorough and robust in every country. This new report tightens the tests of vehicles on and off the road, it introduces new tests for the testers and regular re-testing of existing models. Penalties are introduced for those who try to cheat the tests.  This is a fundamental review of the approval process for cars in Europe and I would like to thank my British Conservative colleague Dan Dalton for leading this piece of work and my colleagues from all across Europe who have worked with him. In a post-Brexit world it is in no one’s interest to re-introduce unnecessary red tape and I hope both sides will continue to cooperate on regulatory matters to enable mutual recognition to continue and work together for strong standards not only in the UK and Europe, but also across the rest of the world.

I think that the outcome is well balanced. It provides the EU with more efficient and stronger mechanisms for type approval of cars before they enter European markets and for their actual monitoring when they are already present on the market.  Over a year ago, when this House discussed the car emissions inquiry committee, our Group called for an EU-level surveillance system which would contribute to better enforcement of EU legislation. Today that proposal is here and it means that we will not continue business as usual. Not only has it restated the obligations for Member States to actively engage in market surveillance, but it also provides the Commission with a new set of competences to act on its own behalf or as a safeguard when the Member States fail to do so. This is a major contribution to the legislation, which aims to restore consumers’ trust in our control mechanisms and in the European car industry. It is in the interest of us all to provide Europeans with the right to reliable and transparent information about their vehicles.  Some of our colleagues have been talking about the need to establish an EU market surveillance agency, which would take over all the tasks in this field. Our Group does not believe this to be a good idea. The agency definitely does not meet the need to respond quickly to scandal. It would only create a supplementary layer of administration at high cost with little added value.  And finally, there is no competence that an agency could have which could not be given to the Commission directly. Our Group believes that the Commission is the right institution to assume oversight powers at EU level and that the new system introduced in this report should prevent Member States from interfering with those new powers.

We have an internal market. So if a new type of car is approved in one Member State, it applies to the entire EU. So far so good. As a manufacturer you can go to any test institute in the EU and then to any supervisor for approval. This is useful for the manufacturer, because if you cannot get it done at one supervisor, you just go to the next. And then it goes wrong. Car manufacturers are introducing fraudulent software for diesel cars, but no Member State detects it. Regulators fail. Could that have something to do with competition between regulators? The European Commission is also not doing anything. Commissioner Verheugen was too concerned with promoting the auto industry through his CARS 21 Group and Commissioner Tajani knowingly ignored all indications about cheating software. Turning to the Dalton report: competition between regulators is simply maintained. We could also have chosen to refer manufacturers to the regulator in the country of the manufacturer's headquarters. But we don't. Although Member States and the Commission have all failed, Parliament is putting all the cards on the Commission through this report. He may carry out inspections himself. What a mess! How will citizens react when European inspectors come to check your car? Hopefully in the garage, but it is also allowed on the road. European diesel police, can it get any crazier? Inspections and enforcement in general are powers of the state and the EU is not a state. This report does not really solve the problem of cheating. But it does give the extreme right yet another trump card to say that the citizens are bit by bit torn into a superstate of Europe. And that of a British Conservative rapporteur.

Then it touches on particulate matter emissions, NOx emissions as well as fraud on these emissions and, therefore, directly to health.

Today we have a great opportunity to change this system. We have the opportunity to offer citizens legislation that can overcome national conflicts of interest. I ask my colleagues to be ambitious in this. In the report that we are going to vote on today on the supervision of motor vehicles, we have the possibility to introduce improvements, to make this proposal more ambitious, first of all by asking that 20% of the new models placed on the market be checked for each Member State. In this way, for example, a vehicle launched by Fiat would be controlled throughout Europe, and this would make manipulations much less frequent, if not impossible. Then, we all talked about an independent third party, able to control what the national authorities approve, and we focused on the agency, which on average is perceived as a bandwagon. So we want to be proactive: we propose an authority, not an agency, an authority that is in charge of the Commission and that can use existing structures. In particular, we have identified the laboratory of the Joint Research Center of Ispra, which is already equipped from an instrumental point of view with many instruments. And to those who say that there is no funding to support this type of approach, we point out that, without asking the citizens for anything, but simply with a small charge for the manufacturers, we would have these resources. We are talking about ten euros per vehicle. And finally, we ask that the tests made on the road, which represent a very positive thing, are not made on prototypes, but on vehicles that are already ready for the market.So I reiterate that today we have this opportunity to be ambitious and I ask my colleagues to be ambitious, and I hope you will welcome this invitation.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 80, "date": "2017-04-04.json", "name": "Marcus PRETZELL", "mepid": "124830", "text": "on behalf of the ENF Group. - Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen! The automobile is a European invention, but the European Union has no part in it. The major European car brands are the result of French ingenuity, German engineering and Italian daring and Italian design. The European Commission did not invent anything. It merely regulates, and if it had existed 150 years ago, we might not have had any major European automobile groups today. The Commission is putting forward a draft in which a whole network of authorities is spun, the strings of which ultimately come together in the hands of the Commission, and the rapporteur contributes those passages which, as a German, one would almost have missed in the Commission text.

Car manufacturers, who make customers around the world happy and to whom we owe a large part of Germany's prosperity, appear as environmentally damaging sexual offenders, as felons, whom the Commission and its thousands of authorities have to find out about with increasingly sophisticated investigative methods if the continent is not in the catastrophe should end.

Have you forgotten that the Commission had been aware of the different emission values ​​since 2010 at the latest and closed its eyes?

The fact that you are now trying again shortly before Brexit to enforce this also for continental Europe has one special note.But the Committee on the Environment, which asked for an opinion, tops it all off.He calls for a new monster authority, a vehicle market surveillance agency of the EU, which should still control all the pseudo-national authorities and should be financed by an administration fee on new vehicles.And in the aisles of Parliament there are advertising stands for the vehicle market surveillance agency with huge purple pillows that look like the vagina costumes of the Trump opponents in the USA.Ladies and gentlemen, we have no lack of control.We had unrealistic rules that were not based on real driving conditions, and we had a commission that closed its eyes.That is the cause of the scandal.You will not change that with this report, Mr Dalton.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 81, "date": "2017-04-04.json", "name": "Andreas SCHWAB", "mepid": "28223", "text": "- Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen! Daniel Dalton's draft report gives a very clear answer to the central question, namely the question of whether in Europe - with Italy, Germany and France, as just mentioned - there are ultimately uniform answers to uniform problems. We sorely missed that in the whole discussion about vehicle registrations. It simply cannot be that the type approval authority in one country of the European Union comes to the conclusion that a car can be approved while the authority in another country comes to a different view for exactly the same car. If we allow such conditions in Europe, we will in fact run into a catastrophe because the internal market will then lose its acceptance and its basis. That is why the most important step that we are taking now is to ensure that an authorization is ultimately an authorization for the entire internal market. And if there are misunderstandings between different authorities, then and only then does the European Commission have the responsibility to scientifically unambiguously determine which elements must be taken into account in the approval and which not. This is progress for all of us. And that’s why I’m totally happy that the Greens and Pascal Durand, the Social Democrats, the Liberals, that we are all pulling together, that above all we are trying to get things on the right track with a focus on results. This European agency, which is always floating around in the debate, is, of course, to a certain extent a favorite project for some, which is also politically okay.

I therefore consider it important to thank the rapporteur and the other shadow rapporteurs, in particular our shadow rapporteur, my colleague Mrs. Schaldemose, for the important work they have done and which we will approve here today. This text contains some important points, and therefore I would like to highlight them. The first: the absolute prohibition of the possibility of installing manipulation software on motor vehicles, and the fact that from now on there will be an approval and surveillance system, which will be constant throughout the life of the vehicle, as well as greater powers of control and monitoring by the European Commission, which will certainly tend to harmonize the European supervisory system. There will ultimately be greater consumer power. I believe this is really a strong disincentive against fraudulent actions. They were, I said, very important results, but we would have liked even more ambitious ones to break once and for all the links that exist between car manufacturers, their technical services and national approval authorities, which in many cases are even private. Therefore it would be necessary to define a single and independent vehicle surveillance system at European level.

More people die from transport emissions than from road accidents, and yet there has been silence from both a human and an economic point of view. The most frightening idea, after all the research and studies, is that at the moment, no one can reliably estimate the actual emissions from transport. Although the European Commission is currently developing tests to measure actual emissions while driving, Vastamäki is still steep in terms of combating climate change. There was no desire to impose any kind of sanctions when dealing with type-approval legislation, which is special because when a citizen commits an offense, he is punished.

The information was not communicated to the outside world. Reports that went out were anonymous on purpose. This means that what you saw was that the Commission was part of the problem.  What we are suggesting is an agency that is doing the surveillance, that is doing the testing.

This new supervision means more competences for the European Commission to jointly manage the automotive market, as already mentioned by Andreas Schwab. And thanks to this, I hope that it will finally be possible to rebuild consumer confidence in the automotive sector, because it has been severely strained recently. In addition, it is important that this automotive market supports innovation: the use of the Internet, \"big data\" - all this gives great innovation opportunities in the automotive sector. And we must make sure that Europe is a leader in this field. Consumers want to take advantage of the revolution taking place in telematics, and we must ensure that they have the right to choose whether they want to use manufacturer's workshops or other small workshops not authorized by sellers.

There is a need to improve the institutional framework for market surveillance and control of type-approval, but also for consumer compensation.

This is a regulation that is so important to our citizens, not only in terms of consumer confidence and information, but also to prevent the damaging effects of emissions on public health and on climate change. In this regard we must do everything we can to prevent cheating by car manufacturers aiming to manipulate emissions and fuel consumption tests and produce false results for financial gain. We must do our utmost to ensure that consumers are protected at all times and that the quality of goods is as described at the point of sale.  A number of measures here are worthy of support. Random market surveillance to be carried out by Member States on at least 20% of new models on the market is a very good idea. Unfortunately, given the proven dishonesty of certain players in the market, this is a necessary step to prevent manipulation of testing. I am pleased also that the Commission will be given responsibility for insisting on the recalling of vehicles, for example in order to bring non-compliant vehicles into conformity.  Above all, I welcome the penalties. A fine of EUR 30 000 per vehicle in breach of regulations might seem a lot, but in actual fact it is nothing.

This fundamental reform is vital to ensure sufficient EU oversight and it aims at preventing any future misconduct. It will be key in restoring public confidence and I would like to make some comments.  The independence of approval authorities was raised. Yes, the Commission insists on independence of approval authorities and technical services. Some type-approval authorities and technical services appear to apply lighter interpretations of type-approval requirements than others, and this has to change, undisputedly. We need a level playing field, and fairness and clarity for consumers.  Some Members mentioned that they supported the Commission’s proposal on a fee structure. Under the current system, the technical services that carry out certification testing for manufacturers are, in fact, directly paid by these manufacturers. This undermines the notion of ‘independent’ and that is why we proposed a pooled fee structure on a national basis, which would cover the costs for testing and inspections carried out by the designated technical services, as well as covering the costs for the type-approval certification, market surveillance activities and conformity of production review assessments.  There were some comments that I could not understand. Honestly, I could not understand the question to Mr Dalton along the lines of ‘What is it that you have against Volkswagen?’ and words concerning hatred against the German industry. I think this is total nonsense. This is not about hating the automotive industry, it is all about respecting our citizens’ right not to be cheated and it is all about respecting our citizens’ right to clean, unpolluted air.  The issue of the Agency seems to be the main topic of this debate. I was listening carefully and with interest to the arguments in favour of, and also against, a European Agency and I will watch carefully the results of the vote later today.  One Member also suggested that this will destroy, or words to that effect, the UK car industry. This is not supported by any facts. In fact, the UK car industry has a higher turnover than any other Member State, helped obviously by its access to the EU market. Here, I think I would agree with the comment made by another Member that no-one is against positive economic performance, but no one wants this to be at the expense of citizens’ health.  In Europe, 28 national authorities are responsible for checking car manufacturers’ compliance and most checks occur before the product is put on the market. That is what our type-approval proposal is all about: more checks on the market, better coordination of recalls at EU level, and EU harmonised sanctions. Following the adoption of the real driving emissions act, Europe will be the only region in the world that will measure real driving emissions. Everyone agreed, and I think there were a lot of comments about the fact that we need more market surveillance.  Today’s plenary debate shows the political importance of this proposal as a key response to what has happened regarding exhaust emissions. The European Parliament is sending a strong and clear message to Member States, and to the other players in the sector, that they will no longer get away with not taking safety, environmental protection and the wellbeing of our citizens seriously. I fully agree with this approach and the Commission counts on your further support in the upcoming negotiations with the Council. The Commission’s proposal to strengthen type approval and market surveillance are part of a series of other measures, including the real driving emissions testing, which will mean that the Volkswagen scandal can, and will, never happen again.  More than a year has passed since the Commission tabled this proposal but to the outside world we still have little progress to show, so I would encourage you to start trilogue meetings with the Council as soon as possible. For our part, we are determined to do all it takes to ensure quick progress. We never again want to see a scandal such as the one which has tarnished the reputation of the industry for almost 18 months and this proposal is a key tool to ensure that it will never be repeated. I am certain, and the Commission is certain, that we can get it right by working together. We owe this to our citizens. Thank you very much for contributing and I would like to thank the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs.

The general view, I think, is that the proposal by the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection (IMCO) is a good one. It is a compromise. Everyone has had to move from their original positions, everyone has had to give things up, and I think we need to recognise that. I just wanted to make it clear what type approval is, because I think that there is some confusion, especially on my right, as to what exactly the system is. We have a national system of type approval with mutual recognition across Europe and, as Mr Schwab said, one type approval for the whole of the EU. That is good for consumers, it is good for jobs, it is good for industry, but it is in everyone’s interests to know that the system works in other EU countries because this affects everyone. People in Germany, for example, need to be confident that the system in Italy, say, works, as cars approved in Italy will be driven in Germany. So we need an umpire. We need a role for the Commission, as the report recognises. Now most speakers wanted more independence, transparency, obligations on Member States, compensation, a stronger system: all of that is in this IMCO report.  On the agency – this is the last time I talk about the agency, I promise! – that is not actually the key thing in this report. The details are much more important. I think that the Commissioner is sitting on the fence a little bit, clearly not convinced about the agency; but Bas Eickhout’s answer was, I think, actually the most instructive: the cost and bureaucracy of setting up the agency just to send the results to the same people in the Commission who will deal with the info under the system that we are proposing. It will always come back to the Commission to act, but it is clear that as a Parliament we are split down the middle on this issue. We have to sort it out in a vote and I will support the outcome whichever way it goes. No system will stop people who want to cheat the system, but I think that we have got a stronger system now. The key is to make sure that we get them once they have cheated the system. I think that we can do that. It has been 18 months since the Volkswagen scandal. It has been 15 months since the Commission came forward with its proposal. It is time now for us to get on with it, so I effectively commend this report to the vote later today and I look forward to starting negotiations with the Commission and Council as soon as possible.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 114, "date": "2017-04-04.json", "name": "Ioan Mircea PAŞCU", "mepid": "33984", "text": "The debate was closed.The vote will take place tomorrow, 4 April 2017.

French manufacturers are subject to strong competition within the European Union, but especially from Asian countries or the United States. However, the report we are talking about praises the respect by American manufacturers of anti-pollution standards which it claims to be comparable to European standards.

The EMIS Committee also noted that there was strong evidence that the use of disconnectors was widespread.

It is a real pleasure and honor for me to be with you today - in this place of free speech and open debate! But dear friends, my joy is not unclouded. It is bitter to address this plenary for the first time shortly after a Member State has initiated its exit from the European Union. I know you will be giving your position on this in this House tomorrow. I find that bitter - not just as a politician, but first and foremost as a citizen of Europe. You must know: I am about the same age as the European Union. When I was born, in 1956, the wounds left in our cities by the war unleashed by Hitler's Germany could still be seen across Europe. The wounds in the hearts of our neighbors were even bigger. And yet - at that time - they reached out to my country for peace, and together - in Rome 60 years ago - they laid the foundation for the “new Europe”! When I got to school, young people were already symbolically sawing the barriers at European borders to show at the time: We want more Europe! What we have achieved is not enough for us! In 1968 the customs barriers fell within Europe, the long truck lines in front of the barriers were history and the queues for cars were at least shorter. When I came to university, the pull of Europe was already so great that the people in the south of Europe - in Greece, in Spain, in Portugal - not only swept dictatorships aside, but paved the way for freedom and democracy in a common Europe. In 1989, when I was finishing my doctoral thesis, the Berlin Wall fell - brought down by the brave in Eastern Europe who had peacefully achieved freedom and democracy. you it was they who made not only the unity of my country possible, but the reunification of Europe. All this and much more is what is meant when the Rome Declaration says: “We are united for our happiness!” All this is the great legacy that the mothers and fathers of Europe have entrusted to us and on which our children build. We must not divulge this precious legacy and leave it to Europe's opponents. We have to preserve, maintain and improve it - that is our common historical mission! (Loud applause) When I look back on a good 60 years of my life and the same period of time in the European Union, then my view is shaped by the growth, development and success of the new Europe - the path then from the organization of the shortage economy in post-war Europe to one Hope for a more just and peaceful world. To some it seemed - and I do not exclude myself - that what has been achieved is guaranteed forever. But in my biography I have also seen the troubles of Europe: the crises, the contradictions, the setbacks. I had to learn that my belief and that of many in my generation that the path of Europe, the path of European unification, was irreversible, that was a mistake. No, Europe's future is not a certainty - it never was, and we haven't only known since Brexit. I remember 2005. I had just become foreign minister for my country when the dream of a European constitution had just burst. I remember exactly how many of us were disappointed back then. But I know just as well how we - and I suspect many of you here in this Chamber - got together again and did what Europe is particularly good at: get up and carry on. We picked up the telephone receiver, listened to each other, sat all night at the negotiating table - and forged, piece by piece, the Treaty of Lisbon. What I want to say: Europe was never one Walk! Europe is a complicated, yes, an exhausting project. But it's worth the effort! We can and must counter Europe's bad-talkers: cooperation, growing prosperity and, above all, 70 years of peace - that is Europe's promise to its citizens. But never in its history has this promise been fulfilled by itself. It has only been fulfilled when it is not national small spirit but European reason that determines the actions of the actors. That is the yardstick against which we have to stand! (Loud applause) That is exactly why I came to you today. I do not want to give my first speech, which I am giving as Federal President outside of Germany, anywhere else than here - in this Parliament. (Loud applause) Right now, in times of growing centrifugal forces, of noisy prophets of doom, I want to take sides with Europe. As a citizen, I confess, just as many citizens have recently confessed: Yes, I want Europe! And as Federal President I can say: Yes, the vast majority of Germans want Europe! We do not want the way back to an unpleasant past, but the common way to a better European future! That is the perspective! (Applause) If we say yes to Europe, then we don't have to gloss over it, and we don't have to shy away from objections. Anyone who says yes to Europe also says yes to the complicated, exhausting and unfinished of Europe! How complicated political solutions are, how laborious the process - who would know that better than you here in the European Parliament? Not only do conflicting interests meet here, but also different cultures, languages ​​and traditions. Europe's diversity is an adventure, but it is also exhausting. I think I just heard Antonio and the leaders of the political groups sigh about it. But that is precisely what is needed in this Europe today: that we do not entrench ourselves in opinion circles, that we Not only complain about the rifts that have opened up in Europe or withdraw into the national pout, but that we are seriously looking for ways on all sides to build bridges over these rifts. This includes - and it has always been part of Europe - the assumption that the other could be right too. Europe was founded on the assumption that others might be right. Europe's successes have always been compromises. Europe's successes were the laborious but peaceful balancing of interests. This is what this Parliament stands for, what you stand for in 28 nations. Who would become a parliamentarian at all without the will to convince and at the same time the willingness to be convinced, without the passion for the complicated, for the efforts of democracy! Everyone in this hall who has this passion - especially now, in these difficult times - has my great respect and certainly also my support. (Applause) Support because I know that there are others too. There are plenty of other forces who are always there with the very simple answers - answers from the strong hand, answers with clear images of the enemy. A new fascination with the authoritarian is spreading - not only far to the west and east of the European borders, but unfortunately also here with us, in the middle of Europe. Populists paint the world in black and white and turn fears into political capital. Anyone who knows me knows: I am not prone to alarmism. This Parliament can stand the argument - it even needs it. But I also say: Anyone who dismisses democratic institutions and parliaments as a waste of time, who declares willingness to compromise a weakness and, above all, who no longer adheres to the difference between fact and lies, touches the basic structure of democracy, and who becomes, must our decided, ours hear common contradiction as democrats! (Loud applause) The world we live in is more insecure and become more confusing. Many people worry about the future; Fear of losing control. They become receptive to the calls of those who say, “Come back behind the familiar slug of the nation! Borders closed, bulkheads closed - this is the only way we can regain our sovereignty! ”But it is not only naive, it is irresponsible to fool people into thinking that dangers such as terrorism or climate change that do not know any borders can be banished with walls and barriers. It is irresponsible to pretend that in a world that is getting more complicated, the answers get easier. And I am convinced that it is wrong to say that in this world a European country alone and without the EU can make its voice more audible or better assert its economic interests. (Applause) On the contrary: if we do not make Europe a fully fledged player on the world stage, then we will all individually become the plaything of other powers. This is probably exactly what Michael Heseltine, of all people, had in mind when he recently said in an interview that Brexit might be “the greatest loss of British sovereignty”. And he could be right with this prediction. (Applause) “Take back control” - that's how we hear it everywhere - that's a strong slogan, yes. But I predict: nationalists will not be able to redeem it! If at all, then we can make the sentence come true together: - if we don't make things too easy for ourselves; - if we do not shift responsibility to Brussels, but exercise it together; - if we strengthen the internal market and at the same time protect and support those who have been particularly hard hit by the hardships of globalization in recent years; - if we strengthen our innovative strength and creativity in such a way that Europe itself is the creator of change and does not just have to suffer it passively. Only then can we remove the breeding ground from the populists and say: We do not lose sovereignty to Europe, on the contrary. Only together do we gain strength and weight in this changing world! (Applause) The crisis gives us the chance to see Europe as it really is - without illusions, without false optimism, with all of its strengths and also with its weaknesses. And the crisis forces us to answer the question: what and how much European unity do we want? The Commission's White Paper has set out options for this. That is not the solution yet, only one thing seems to be clear to me: permanent self-blockade in the European Union is the worst possible option, it is not! If we want to move forward together, not everyone can ultimately prevail one hundred percent. The problems are too complex and the expectations too different for that: - Yes, we want a stronger Europe and more European solutions, but we also have to leave room for those members who cannot or do not yet want to take further steps towards integration. - Yes, we want to show solidarity with states that are suffering from the consequences of the financial and economic crisis and that have or had to initiate tough reforms. But European solidarity can only support national efforts, not replace them. - Yes, we want to help people who are fleeing war and persecution. But because our common possibilities are finite, we have to decide how and how much responsibility everyone has to bear. - Yes, we want to keep the European Union together internally. But we also know that Europe is bigger than the European Union, and without the involvement of our neighbors in the east and south there will be no lasting peace order on this continent. (Applause) I already know, ladies and gentlemen: none of these problems are easy and, in particular, we must not ignore people's concerns in all of this. But those who built Europe have certainly had tougher problems. You have replaced the battlefield with the negotiating table, the confrontation with a peaceful balance of interests. You have been clever; they have shown common sense. Today's world - a world full of new uncertainties - does not allow us to be any less clever than our predecessors. There is no lack of clarity about the questions that need to be resolved - they are on the table. What is missing is the courage - and sometimes the willingness to solve them on a European basis. And we have to change that! (Applause) The argument is part of balancing interests. We argue in Europe and from my point of view that is not a sign of decay. I, too, have argued in European politics over the past 25 years - not just occasionally, also more often - and I also met one or the other of you here in this room during the argument. But when we argue in Europe, we do so on a firm normative foundation. Many questions are complicated, but that must not cloud our view of the elementary, of the most important things: freedom and democracy, the rule of law and human rights are not up for discussion. It is enshrined in Article 2 of the Treaty on Union, and all Member States are obliged to do so. That is the essence of Europe, so to speak, that is what Europe is in the eyes of the world and what many people even envy us for. If we stand by it, if we want to be a beacon for the rule of law and human rights in the world, then we shouldn't be indifferent when this foundation shakes inside Europe. And then Europe must not be silent when civil society, even science - as is now the case at the Central European University in Budapest - is being deprived of its breath. Then Europe must not be silent! (Loud applause) But the role of my country is also discussed controversially. Some ask of Germany more leadership in Europe. Others warn of German dominance. And the newly elected President of our most important ally recently said that the European Union was nothing more than “a means to an end for Germany”. I want to say: That is at least a misunderstanding! Europe's strength cannot be based on the leadership of individuals, but only on the responsibility of all. As the largest and most populous state, Germany naturally bears a special responsibility. But we know about our possibilities, also about their limits. And we will not forget that others in Europe might be right when we argue about solutions. We know what we owe to this Europe. I say: The united Europe is the successful answer to our history and our geography - for ourselves and for our neighbors. And we feel that a strong Europe is not only in our own interest, but that it has become part of our identity. You should therefore know that we Germans want to hold the European Union together. We want to build on the common future in Europe, together with our partners, large and small, with equal rights and obligations. In the end, however, there is something completely different and perhaps something much more important beyond all state reasons: Europe is a matter close to the heart not for everyone, but for most of the people in Germany. That is why I told you my own story of Europe. And that's why a lot of people, especially young people in Germany, have told me their stories about Europe in the past few weeks. The young - I've learned that - are fed up with only those who talk badly about Europe. They don't want their hopes and their future to be stolen from them by populists or lost through lethargy. That's why they went out and are now showing on the streets that the The pulse of Europe still beats on the streets and squares in almost all European capitals and larger cities! (Applause) Even if we in my generation don't call it that yet - for many of our children and grandchildren Europe has long become a second fatherland! These boys have long known that loving your own country and being a good European at the same time is not a contradiction in terms. And I think the boys are right about that! (Applause) Last year I went to Wroclaw privately with my family. I wanted to explore the hometown of my mother, which I knew mainly from her dark memories. She told me about her experiences of war and devastation, of fleeing to the West with her mother, aunt, sisters and their children - seven women in total. The unleashed nationalism and its consequences had overshadowed her young life and in this way also shaped my image of this city, of Breslau. But last year, 2016, I came to a completely different city: a city that shone as the European Capital of Culture, with lively and intelligent discussions everywhere, with music on the streets and squares, where young people from Vilnius, Wuppertal and Verona share their Europe have celebrated. There was nothing faint-hearted! There he lived again, the dream of the European future! Honorable Members, it is now up to us to ensure that the European dream is not over for the next generation either. That is the message that I bring from my country. Yes, we want Europe, we want to build a better Europe, and we want to be a European Germany.

It is essential to codify all regulations from 1986 to today, with the aim of simplifying this rule and making it more understandable and accessible to operators in the fishing sector and citizens of the European Union.

Let's start with the situation of the Greek economy, which has shown resilience in the face of the turbulence of 2015 and 2016 as well as the effects of capital controls. As early as 2016, positive trends emerged, including the return, which surprised us, of positive growth faster than expected for some quarters and the fall in unemployment, which was at an absolutely unacceptable level and which remains much too high. Today, however, this positive development - it must be admitted - is starting to slip. Why exactly do we observe this hesitation? Because we are closing the review late. What I have observed from my own responsibility is that there is a very close link between the return of growth in Greece and success in the negotiations. When negotiations advance, growth and confidence pick up. When trading is slow, then growth waits, as do investors. All of Greece's partners must therefore now come together to put an end to this harmful uncertainty and to finally create a lasting cycle of virtuous recovery. Greece deserves it. Its authorities, government and parliament have made considerable progress since the launch of the current program. The progress which has been made over the past eighteen months must be sustained and consolidated to ensure what the country and the euro area need, namely a sustainable recovery. We remain convinced that following substantial reforms and forthcoming implementation efforts, the Greek economy, which is very flexible, very creative and very responsive, is able to move on. But it must be helped and must not be hampered further by uncertainty. For its part, as the Minister recalled, the Commission is doing everything in its power and falls within its role, in a way, of honest broker to achieve a fair and balanced agreement, which we want quickly. Why is this agreement possible? First, because the budgetary targets have largely been achieved. I repeat here that the 2016 primary surplus target, which was 0.5% under the program, was significantly exceeded. Eurostat will release the result at the end of April, but we expect the primary surplus to be simply over 3%. Greece is also on track to meet its target of 1.75% of GDP in 2017 and 3.5% in 2018. These results are not surprising. They are the product of a series of extremely tough fiscal consolidations that include high-quality parametric measures adopted in 2015 and 2016, with a cumulative fiscal return of 4.5 percent of GDP, a hefty figure. Which European country has experienced such an adjustment? Whatever political preferences - and the Commission has no political preferences - such efforts must not be forgotten or ignored, but they must be anchored, deepened and continued. Regarding the reform program, the authorities have already implemented much of what was required. I will cite a few examples that do not always receive the attention they deserve: Greece has for the first time equipped itself with a national social security net that will guarantee a subsistence or basic income as well as strengthen education and vocational training in these times of high unemployment. Finally, an independent authority for public revenue has been created. Greece needed it with, among other things, the objective of improving revenue collection. Legislation to reduce non-performing loans has been passed and we are now moving to implementation. A new privatization and investment fund, the HCAP, is now operational and its supervisory and management boards have already begun to discharge their responsibilities. It follows, of course, that significant progress has already been made in major privatization projects. I encourage the Greek authorities to maintain this momentum which is essential to attract the investment and private investors that Greece needs. Finally, I will mention the various measures adopted in the areas of product markets, the business environment or the legal system. All of these examples are, in fact, only a small part of the roughly 200 steps that have been taken since the program began in the summer of 2015. The first months of this year have been spent negotiating two critical elements. The first concerns the measures necessary to terminate the second review. In this regard, the main outstanding issues are known. The first is labor market reform, an issue of great importance for many of you and also of great importance for the Commission. It is essential that the Greek labor market takes into account the difficulties on the employment front, but also the current economic challenges specific to the country, so that the reforms can support the recovery as well as the creation of jobs. I would like to say that the Commission, attached to the European social model, continues to support collective bargaining systems which are fair and efficient. For its part, Greece should respect European best practices in areas such as collective dismissals and trade union action. In this regard, we take into account the work of the group of independent experts tasked with formulating recommendations in the light of European and international best practices. We also know that not all of them had support unanimous. From experience, I believe that what matters most is not necessarily how the system works on paper, but how it works in life, i.e. how the social partners take ownership and engage. jointly, autonomously and in collaboration with public authorities. The second major topic of negotiation relates to the energy market. In this sector, it is important to increase competition taking into account European rules and also, of course, recent court decisions. A more competitive and efficient market is in the interests of all consumers. I believe that with some technical adjustments we should be able to quickly agree on the necessary reform elements which are good for all and, first and foremost, for the Greek economy. In recent weeks, another element of discussion has focused on a budget arrangement that would allow the International Monetary Fund to participate with its own agenda. I know that for many of you, for the Commission and for the Member States, the participation of the International Monetary Fund is really a major guarantee of security. This is an essential condition. What is unprecedented is that this device would take effect in the years immediately following the end of the program. So we are thinking not about what will happen by the end of 2018, but in the years immediately after 2018, without asking for a primary effort for too long, because it is neither viable nor democratic. The aim must be to achieve a balanced package, which will ensure that Greece meets this primary surplus target in the medium term. This concept was repeated at Eurogroup meetings in February and March. It has served and still serves as a basis for the discussions of the last few weeks which must be concluded very soon because we have another Eurogroup meeting in Valletta in three days. Discussions are continuing. You will excuse me for leaving this chamber before the end of our debate to reach Brussels, where important meetings with the Greek authorities and the European institutions will take place this evening. However, I wanted to be in Strasbourg for your debate and then return to Brussels, which is never very easy. I would like to stress that this arrangement includes measures aimed at further rationalizing expenditure. The Commission and I welcome the progress made so far, including on issues which are necessary preconditions for the involvement of the IMF. We have already come a long way since the mandate given to the Eurogroup at the end of February. We will have the opportunity to measure it this week with ministers in Valletta. I hope that the meeting there will be a good one that will show that we are really heading towards a satisfactory conclusion. I continue to believe that a technical agreement at the level of institutions preceding and following a political agreement is not only possible, but also imperative to limit the risks of delay and avoid compromising last year's positive budget performance. . But that requires real commitment and a willingness to conclude on everyone's part, and I stress the word \"all\". To reach a comprehensive agreement, difficult political choices have to be made. We are aware of this. This is especially true for Greece. We are therefore counting on the constructive attitude of the other institutions concerned and I would like to say in this forum, without joking, that this also includes the International Monetary Fund, which has actively participated in all aspects of the negotiations since the creation of the MES program in 2015 and which must also do its part to understand Greece's specific difficulties. The Commission will therefore continue to support constructive discussions among all partners and promote a rapid conclusion of the review. Finally, the Commission will also continue to encourage all efforts which go in the direction of a more sustainable Greek debt. We have been signaling for some time that a more realistic primary surplus path is needed after the program ends. It is not possible to ask for years and years for levels of primary surpluses that are too high if we are to restart growth in the country and return employment. Without it, the markets will not be willing to lend at reasonable rates and Greece will continue to depend on the support of its European partners. At the end of the day, I think it's a matter of burden sharing between Greece and the Eurogroup. In short, the Commission wishes to underline the progress already made. She knows that there is still some effort to be made for the discussion to be successful. I repeat how much it is for us, and for me personally, really something which is not only desirable but possible and necessary for our economic and monetary union, for the euro area, for Greece and for the Greek people, which has suffered greatly from the crisis, which must see the light at the end of this long austerity tunnel and find its way back to growth and employment.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PSE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "PSE"}, {"id": 166, "date": "2017-04-04.json", "name": "Manolis KEFALOGIANNIS", "mepid": "125068", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, Mr Dijsselbloem is absent to hear all parties ’comments.

They deserve a swift and positive conclusion to the second review. We think that a positive conclusion is at hand. The implementation of structural reform, a balanced solution for the labour market which would safeguard the right of collective bargaining, and additional fiscal safeguards – and also the possibility of expansionary measures if Greece outperforms its targets, as it is currently doing – could be the basis for an agreement to put Greece on the path towards sustainable growth.  This is why the Greek Government is right to negotiate constructively in order to get an agreement: prolonging the uncertainty would have negative consequences for the economy, and it would be a terrible mistake to throw away the positive results that have been achieved so far. But the IMF and some Member States should not abuse this situation and should also do their part in order to achieve a positive result. In particular they should not play with fire. I want to be very clear: given the sense of responsibility shown by the Greek Government and given the significant concessions agreed in order to have the IMF on board, to insist on asking for an unsustainable additional fiscal effort to be concentrated in a single year after the end of the programme would be irresponsible and unacceptable. I would even say that it would be shameful. Finally, creditors should recognise that the primary surplus of 3.5% is achievable, but it is sustainable only for a very short time. This clear recognition is necessary in order to give credibility to the commitment made by the Eurogroup in May 2016 to implementing medium—term debt relief measures. Those measures are necessary in order to meet the agreed benchmarks for growth financing needs in a context of social cohesion, as well as financial, economic and political stability, and should be further specified. A positive solution to the Greek crisis would be a major success for the Greek people and for the entire European Union in these difficult times.

I will address some basic structural issues concerning Greece. The first structural problem concerns the budget structure. Every country that has its pension policy embedded in the state budget orders a problem. You can check with the Russian state budget, where they have made the same, in itself short-term, solution. You think that there is always money in the treasury and then you think that you can pay the pensions from that budget. When you take a look at the population pyramid for Greece, we see that soon a majority of the population will be retired, and a minority of the population will earn the money for the treasury. If people paid their taxes in Greece, this could possibly be an affordable problem. As you now pay tax in that country, this problem is not solvable. That is the first problem. The second problem concerns a mismatch between the right decisions and the lack of administration. We know that the Greek Government has made the right decisions and we know that the Greek Parliament, with some reluctance, has made the right decisions, but we still do not see, to this day, that these decisions are being realized in real life.

Again and again it looks like there might not actually be real progress on the Greek programme and the Eurogroup, as we know, is led by a man who told us very clearly what he thinks about women and what he thinks about southern Member States. By his absence today he shows us also what he thinks about the European Parliament.  While he is a very big problem, he is not our only problem in that matter. The whole Eurozone, and hence also the whole future of the European Union, is being held hostage by the dogma of austerity. To believe growth will come if households are shrinking, if they have to be cut and also the state expenditure is being cut – well, that is not going to happen. That is just economic nonsense.  Extreme poverty has increased by almost seven times in the last years in Greece while state spending has been cut by more than 30%, which is the biggest reduction per capita in the whole Eurozone. While all of that is happening the IMF and also some Member States are demanding more and more cuts. They ask for further reductions in pensions, saying that the Greek pension system is too generous, but actually the truth is that Greek pensioners are much worse off than pensioners anywhere else in Europe. In Greece 43% of pensioners live on less than EUR 660 per month, making those who worked hard for their whole life extremely vulnerable to poverty and to social exclusion. The whole future of Europe is also being held hostage by some Member States who think they can win elections by causing hardship elsewhere, and that should not happen. Labour rights, social rights and EU law are applicable everywhere in the European Union and by telling Greece that it should not apply collective bargaining we are imposing an arbitrary deviation from that European social model. While we are saying the whole time that Greece should follow European rules, what we are actually telling them to do is abandon those very rules and that is just schizophrenic. If we truly want recovery in Greece, if we truly want to work together for a common future we cannot allow Greece to be made into an experimental ground for zero labour rights. And sure, to overcome the dogma of austerity, to invest in a sustainable economy, to carry out intelligent reforms and to get real on debt relief, that might not be popular in every single Member State. It actually takes courage to argue that we are all going to benefit from this in the long term, that we should invest in our common good rather than cutting the ground from under our feet, to show solidarity instead of contempt.

We are here to take stock of the results of these memorandums and let's make the point. Greek industrial production fell by 30% over the period, real GDP fell by 25%, a quarter of the Greek population lives below the poverty line and the Greek population is facing one of the biggest crises ever - hardly ever lived - in its history. In 2013 the same International Monetary Fund had declared the failure of austerity policies, had declared that it had underestimated the destructive effects of austerity. But not only did none of those responsible at the time pay, neither Dijsselbloem nor Juncker resigned - indeed, some have been promoted - but the third program approach is even more austere. You made us believe that Greece's problem was the high level of public debt to GDP, and therefore that austerity was necessary. Instead it is false. From 1993 to 2007, Greece's public debt / GDP ratio was around 100%, completely constant and lower than that of countries such as Belgium and Italy, which are considered more virtuous. What was the problem? Vítor Constâncio tells us this in a speech on May 23, 2013, in which he says that the problem was not the public debt but the foreign private debt. Why what happened to the Greek citizens with the euro? With the currency risk eliminated, banks in the North poured credit into these countries by speculating on higher interest rates. Your goal was clear from the start: it was not to save Greek citizens with these programs, but to allow these banks that had speculated to recover their credits and transfer debts from private bank balance sheets to public balance sheets.This is the purpose of the bailout funds.Italy, through bilateral contributions and contributions to the two bailout funds, has contributed more than 60 billion euros of public money to save the northern banks.You have forced the Italian citizens to do this.The euro will collapse under its lies and you will be held accountable for this disaster you have caused.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 174, "date": "2017-04-04.json", "name": "Lampros FOUNTOULIS", "mepid": "125070", "text": "- Mr President, do you have the audacity to talk about evaluation, new pension cuts and new austerity measures that will bring the Greek people to their knees again?

It has now been almost exactly seven years since the then Greek Prime Minister Papandreou addressed the Europeans that the country was on the verge of insolvency. Seven years! - and yet we still have to have such debates here. That shows the real problem: In these seven years we have succeeded in taking other countries under the rescue package in order to release them back to the capital markets, and one country has not succeeded. If I have heard all the speeches so far that say: “It's everyone else's fault and the country itself isn't,” then I just don't understand, because others have managed to implement adjustment programs in less time. I am already asking myself a few questions: Why is Greece one of the few countries where shipowners are not taxed at all? Even under a communist, Mr Tsipras, that has not changed. Why is Greece a country that fails to tax its own citizens' foreign assets? All countries in the European Union can do it, the Greeks can't. Why is Greece in this position, even though it is supposedly so desperately poor that it can invest over two percent of its economic power in defense and is therefore highly regarded by Mr Trump? I ask myself the question: is it right to look better with Mr Trump than with those from whom solidarity is demanded? And that's why I say very clearly: homework has to be done here and not always just appealing to others.

The name of Mr. Dijsselbloem is sometimes mentioned in this Chamber, but we no doubt forget to quote Mr. Schäuble or their accomplices, these gentlemen and this lady from the IMF.

But I don't think the eurozone economy can be held hostage by someone playing the sorcerer's apprentice or implementing a strategy of self-fulfilling prophecy. Because how can one reproach Mr. Tsipras for reminding his partners that they have made commitments on the subject of the debt when the latter, in view of the results which are up to what was expected of his country, ask him to double setting and further aggravate the situation of retirees?

According to expert estimates, the slow evaluation of the second adjustment program is already costing the Greek economy two billion euros, against the backdrop of unemployment of over 27% and capital outflows like at the beginning of the crisis. Greece is currently experiencing a creeping bank run. In March of this year alone, 1.5 billion euros flowed abroad, in addition to the 4 billion that has flowed abroad since the beginning of the year. So, in my view, there can be no talk of a robust economy, as you said, Commissioner, and neither is the economic program and the economic data for 2017 being revised downwards. The President of the Greek central bank, Mr Stournaras, has already warned of further delays in the negotiations. He sees severe setbacks for the Greek economy and especially for the Greek banks, and he calls for structural reforms - much to the displeasure of the Greek government. And there will be no agreement on Friday at Ecofin either, Mr Dijsselbloem let us know in an interview. And the reason for this is that the Tsipras government is delaying the reform steps that were promised when the third aid package was concluded in summer 2015. According to Tsipras, all implementation commitments to the donors should be postponed until after the 2019 elections, and all internal critics such as the central bank chief should no longer express themselves politically if possible.

Everyone agrees: new 15th cut in pensions and salaries, taxation of the poorest to exempt the richest, mass redundancies, strike strike, privatizations. All for the recovery not of the people, but of capital. These are the best practices and the acquis of the European Union: when everyone is worried about the delay of the fourth memorandum, the workers are worried about their lives.

Almost everything depends on the negotiation of the Tsipras government with the ruling party, SYRIZA, which at least we do not influence. Two typical examples: the Tsipras government has signed the privatization of all public companies, including the partial privatization of the Public Electricity Company. However, he tries to delay it, because the party executives and the trade unionists who are close to SYRIZA do not accept it. Second example: the Tsipras government has accepted new large reductions in pensions, bigger than the ones it imposed in 2015 and 2016. However, it wants them not to be implemented this four years, but at the beginning of the next, when SYRIZA will be in opposition, in an attempt to create trouble for the future Mitsotakis government. I believe that the Tsipras government will ultimately contribute to closing the second evaluation. She would rather deal with a large part of SYRIZA than anger the majority of the Greek people, returning the national economy to the crisis of 2015.

First big difference: respect workers' social rights, their wages, and use that as a lever to increase domestic demand, while promoting exports; second: to ensure that reforms focus not only on the labor market but, above all, on education, on innovation, on better services provided to the population; third: to be able to put investment at the top of the priorities by leveraging a future for the country for a new energy and digital transition and, fourth, not to subordinate growth to fiscal consolidation, on the contrary, more growth facilitates the process of fiscal consolidation.

I was looking forward to hearing the opinion of the head of the Eurogroup, and it is a little unfortunate that he is not here. Still, there is a very interesting debate that is raising some concerns. When I look at the data, I can see the enormous effort made by the Greek Government and the high cost paid by the Greek people to stabilise the fiscal situation. This has been reached. Unfortunately, data on economic growth are much gloomier. After some very bad times we saw some signs of recovery that have now been replaced by much weaker data. This is really the key concern. First of all, in this situation the Greek Government should not give up on fiscal improvement and the vast effort and money it has taken to maintain the fiscal situation. It would be good if the government could explain to people that this is unfortunately the cost of the bad governance of Greece before the crisis. At the same time we should better understand what is going on in Greece and, as partners, work out the measures that will get Greece back on its feet. I am not talking about revisiting the agreements or resetting the targets, because I do not believe that the country can get out of trouble through fiscal expansion, but find a good combination of reforms and involvement of EU policy like the cohesion funds or EFSE to help Greece to recover. I guess it is feasible. We are still missing one component, and this is trust. Unfortunately the debate is supporting that.

I am also investigating this specific question as Parliament's special rapporteur on aid to Greece in the area of ​​regional policy. Due to its really tight financial situation, Greece could no longer guarantee the necessary co-financing shares at the end of the last funding period. That is why the EU has allowed the country, as an exception, to forego its own co-financing share, which is otherwise required, and to use the existing EU funds for specific local projects. In addition, the EU granted Greece an advance of one billion euros for the new funding period. I have always emphasized, including on my committee, that this aid cannot of course be a blank check. These structural funds must be used sensibly and not disappear into any financial holes. This also means that Greece has to grow economically in order to combat high unemployment and create prospects for the people. As far as the control work for my committee is concerned, I am waiting for the report from the Commission, which will contain an evaluation of these projects which are exempt from co-financing - also in order to be able to assess whether this extraordinary measure has had the desired success.

Emotions, difficulties and anger all of course show that we have a really very challenging situation and that it is not easy to reach agreement. The state of play on the Greek stability support programme is an important discussion to have and I think it is a discussion that we must have openly. Greece is now at an important juncture. It is one and a half years into its European Stability Mechanism support programme. This is a time to engrain the progress made to date in Greece, support the economic recovery which began to emerge in 2016, and thus secure a successful exit from the programme in 2018, as planned. Therefore, as Commissioner Moscovici outlined in his opening intervention, swift progress must now be quickly made in closing this second programme review. These elements of the post-programme package should be fair and balanced in order to avoid further uncertainty and come to an agreement on the elements that could help bring the IMF on board.

My thanks to the Commission and the Council, and I would also like to thank the Luxembourg – and, in particular – Dutch Presidencies for their determination to get the Council agreement that we have today.  We have put in place strong, clear rules for the whole life—cycle of devices, from design and manufacture through clinical testing and authorisation to vigilance and market surveillance, giving manufacturers legal certainty about what they have to do.  Protecting patients is at the heart of this legislation. We all remember the scandals of the past. I have heard from women whose lives have been turned upside down after having a pelvic mesh implant, women who are now living in constant pain. I have heard from women who are still not sure which breast implants they have had and whether they need to be worried about their future health.  It just is not right that people have not got sufficient information about devices that have been used in their medical procedures. So in future all devices will be traceable with a unique device identification number and patients will receive an implant card with this number, so we will all know which device has been implanted in which patient. If there is a problem with the device, patients deserve to be compensated, so it is clear that manufacturers must have sufficient financial coverage to deal with their potential liability.  We know that in the case of metal—on—metal hips there was little clarity for patients as to whether the problems were caused by the device or by the medical professionals treating them. When there is reason to believe a device has caused harm to a patient, information on that device must be made available to the patient and their doctor.  To ensure patient safety in the future we must make sure devices are safe before they reach the market. All devices will undergo a thorough clinical evaluation before marketing, and Parliament insisted that there should be additional scrutiny for the highest—risk devices. Things such as implants, insulin pumps and pacemakers will be referred to an expert panel for additional assessment.  Parliament also argued for restrictions on hazardous substances used in medical devices. Wherever possible, manufacturers will have to substitute materials that are carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction, and justify where this is not possible. Notified bodies will still have responsibility for awarding a CE mark, but it is clear that these have to be up to the job. We have introduced strict new requirements for notified bodies, and they will be regularly inspected by Member States. Notified bodies will also have greater powers to carry out unannounced inspections and must inspect samples of all devices regularly. Any problem should be picked up early and action taken straight away.  While it is vital that we ensure devices are safe before they are placed on the market, it is also essential that they are carefully monitored afterwards. The new law will significantly strengthen requirements for post-market surveillance, including introducing periodic safety update reports similar to those that are now produced for medicines.  Finally, on reprocessing of single—use devices, this was one of the most difficult issues to get agreement on. For the Member States it is a very sensitive issue. Some wanted reprocessing to be banned entirely; others wanted no legislation at EU level. Therefore, reprocessing will only be allowed if it is permitted under national law. Those Member States that want to ban it can do so. For those that allow it, there are EU-wide standards that must be complied with, including reprocessors assuming all the obligations of the manufacturers. Colleagues, it has taken a long time and a lot of work to get to this point, so I hope you will support the final agreement as one which gives patients much more protection, while ensuring continued innovation.

It is really high time we got better medical device legislation. Numerous scandals have shaken patient confidence, and reputable companies have also fallen into disrepute because some have cheated on a massive scale. A few weeks ago the European Court of Justice dealt with the PIP scandal again, and the ECJ unfortunately found that there is currently no obligation under our law to inspect the products on site without prior notification. That's why we urgently need to change something. If we adopt the two reports tomorrow, we will introduce unannounced on-the-spot checks. Not only must the paper be checked, but what is really going on must also be checked. This will allow us to discover black sheep, and this will surely lead to a different spirit in companies too, if you know that you can be checked at any time without prior notice. There were scandals not only with breast implants, but also with hip implants, with stents that are implanted, for example, in the vessels that supply the brain, and with diagnostic tests such as genetic tests, DNA tests or HIV tests. There has been an HIV test on the market for years that has given false negative results significantly more often than others. That is, there was an HIV virus, but the test said there was no HIV virus. One can imagine the problems that would arise if someone donated blood or had unprotected sex because of such a false statement. That is why we have to control unannounced. That is why we also have to introduce other things with this legislation: a stronger review of the notified bodies. For high-risk products, the tests not only use the Scrutiny procedure, which is also used for other medical products There is a network of reference laboratories that monitor compliance with the standards, and we have also prescribed clinical evidence for the tests. The test must really say what it says it says. On the other hand, ladies and gentlemen - that was particularly important for my group: we do not want to adopt any rules that would only lead to unnecessary bureaucracy. The only thing that is of no use to the patient is paperwork, which is why we refused, for example, that the Council for Class A Medical Devices - such as simple things like a urine cup - stipulated that you have to fill out new papers on a regular basis the periodic safety update report. We need a balance of control, but also the opportunity for innovation and companies to develop, and we managed to do that quite well. Another aspect was very important for Parliament and for me personally: we not only wanted to better control the quality of the tests with the sensitive DNA tests, but also to lay down rules for their application. DNA testing can have a big impact, so people need to know what to expect and be free to decline a test. Unfortunately, the Council of Ministers was not prepared to accept literally the amendment, which this Parliament approved by a huge majority, but we have reached a compromise: there is an obligation to provide information on genetic tests and a detailed obligation to provide genetic advice in the case of diseases that occur after State of the art are not to be treated. And this also applies to most cases of prenatal diagnostics, so that a consultation must also take place here. We will pay close attention to the implementation of this point. Overall, I believe we have reached a good compromise, and I would also like to thank everyone who contributed: the Commission, the Council Presidency, with Mrs Glenis Willmott, as co-rapporteur, with all shadow rapporteurs, above all Mairead McGuinness for the EPP, and - ladies and gentlemen, allow me to finish with our staff.You cannot imagine how many hours, even in the evening and on weekends, that we invested so that we could achieve this good result.So once again, thank you very much, and I ask for your approval in plenary tomorrow.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 240, "date": "2017-04-04.json", "name": "Peter LIESE", "mepid": "1927", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President,   I would like to warmly thank your House and you, the Members of the European Parliament, for the determination that you have constantly shown. Over the past five years, you have striven for a successful outcome on such a technical and complex file. I know that many of you have worked on this issue. I would like to thank, in particular, the rapporteurs on the two regulations, Ms Willmott and Mr Liese, for their outstanding competence and dedication to this file. Thank you once again. I would also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs, and I have not forgotten the rapporteur on medical devices under the previous legislative term, Ms Dagmar Roth-Behrendt. As you know, the EU is world leader in the medical device field. In the EU the sector employs over half a million people in about 25 000 companies, of which around 90% are SMEs. Annual sales amount to EUR 100 billion, of which a significant part is invested annually in research. The availability of safe and innovative medical devices is a key factor in guaranteeing effective and affordable treatments for European patients. Designing a new regulatory framework for this sensitive and crucial sector is the joint responsibility of all the EU institutions. The Commission wholeheartedly welcomes the final compromise, which contains a series of crucial improvements to the current system. Let me mention some of them: first, strict market control for high—risk devices; second, reinforced criteria for the designation and oversight of notified bodies; third, the inclusion of certain aesthetic devices in the new legislation; fourth, the introduction of a new risk classification system for diagnostic in vitro medical devices; fifth, improved transparency via the establishment of an EU database on medical devices; sixth, a stability system based on unique device identification; seventh, the introduction of an implant card for patients; eighth, stricter and more detailed rules on clinical evidence and clinical investigation; and, ninth, an improved coordination mechanism between Member States for vigilance and market surveillance. The new European legislation will ensure a higher level of patient safety, provide legal certainty for economic operators and promote innovation and competitiveness in the sector. It consolidates the role of the EU as global leader in the field, while establishing a world-class reference for medical device regulation. Thank you once again.

And Commissioner, thanks go to your colleagues as well, and to the Council, because this was not just technical; it was political.  I am also glad that the Chamber is full with visitors, because what we are talking about today will affect each and every one of us, now and in the future. Also, Commissioner, thank you for acknowledging the importance of this industry in terms of both jobs and its output. This industry makes our lives better and extends our lives, and for that we should be grateful. Yes, we are talking about when things go wrong, and that spurs us to do more things, and to do them better. We should acknowledge that the industry is a very good industry that Europe should be proud of. What we are doing today is making it more certain for that industry to continue, so that when we get slightly older and may need things that are improved upon, we may live better and longer lives.  May I, at this point, say that Glenis Willmott has gone through the technical details, so there is no need for me to repeat that. What I think is most important is that we implement, and that the Member States who have signed up to this, and the Commission who are with us on this journey, realise that this Parliament will keep a watching brief and will make sure that resources are put in place so that we do put action on the words. Lastly, can I say that our staff – as has already been mentioned – are hugely important. I think it is very important that we say this openly, because on the technical side they were incredible – both our Group staff and our individual staff. If I may say so, I very carelessly lost two staff members during the course of this regulation, and both to the medical devices industry, because they are excellent workers on behalf of citizens: Mark Taylor and Sinead Duggan, who I know is watching this debate. I think that is the good thing about what we have done. We will make our industry more certain. We will make safer the lives of citizens, and we can grow jobs and grow our economy.

The main goal we want to achieve with these regulations is better patient protection while encouraging innovation in the industry. Europe has the best doctors in the world, but both they and patients need to know that they have equipment that is high quality and safe. Confidence in the industry is capitalized through better product placement and sales, so the new rules will actually benefit everyone. The Commission published the initial proposal back in 2012, which means that European patients have been waiting for 5 years to close the loopholes in the regulations that caused the scandals with artificial hips, implants and HIV tests. When a scandal occurs in this sector, people unfortunately die. That is why we insisted that new and innovative in vitro medical devices of the highest risk class for which there are no references and common specifications be covered by an additional monitoring procedure. The new rules strengthen the capacities and structures of the designated bodies that play the most important role in placing devices on the market. Their responsibilities and obligations are increasing, and one of the novelties is unannounced inspections of producers. When scandals occur and patients suffer, the issue of fair and timely compensation becomes imperative. The new regulations oblige manufacturers of medical devices to have an appropriate system and resources for patient compensation in the event of an incident. Furthermore, manufacturers will have to provide victims and competent services with adequate access to information and documentation related to their case. As for the Committee on Ethics and Issues, such as clinical trials of devices on minors, from day one we insisted that the regulations be aligned with the regulations on drug trials. I think we have managed to reach a good compromise that raises the level of patient and user safety. New procedures and security mechanisms will not be an obstacle to the innovation and competitiveness of the European medical device industry.I therefore call on all of you to support this compromise, because it is in the interest of both patients and medical device manufacturers.In conclusion, I would like to thank my colleague Glenis Willmott, my colleague Peter Liese and all the other shadow rapporteurs I have worked with on this document.It was a really hard and arduous job, but the results will be to the delight of all of us, and especially the patients.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hr", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 244, "date": "2017-04-04.json", "name": "Bolesław G.

In the work on the reports, I have always tried to place great emphasis on ensuring the right balance between the priority of patient safety and technological progress, the competences of the Member States and the competences of the European Union institutions. The very fact that there were ten trilogue meetings where a fairly satisfactory inter-institutional agreement was reached shows how difficult the process was - but a possible process. On the one hand, the priority, i.e. patient safety, is described in the report by appointing special notified bodies, which are now obliged to carry out unannounced inspections at production plants, which means that in the case of devices, especially high-risk devices, it is not enough just to check the relevant documentation, but what's more - the product's manufacturing site should also be inspected and properly inspected. On the other hand, the report promotes new medical technologies as it opens the way to encourage manufacturers to look for - and where necessary also look for substitutes - substances that may be carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic. In addition, the improvement in the quality of patient safety has been ensured by the inclusion of dedicated expert teams for independent evaluation. I think this text is good. It will improve the legal framework applicable to medical devices and in vitro diagnostic medical devices so that they become safer, and at the same time the framework will not hinder qualitative progress in the process of medical technology development.

First of all, I would also like to thank the two rapporteurs, Glenis Willmott and Peter Liese. At Glenis a little more, because their dossier was a little bigger. But they both fought tremendously and it was really a very difficult process. In this case, it is about medical products from adhesive plasters to walking aids to pacemakers. So it really is everything that people really need when they get sick. Expressed in hours, for example, we had 30 hours of trialogue, more than 200 hours of technical meeting, the dossier was 700 pages long and we had to work on it. I have never had such a complicated legal process before. It was blocked for a long time in the Council until an agreement was reached there. And in the end, we in Parliament were actually very united on a lot and were happy that we got it right. Indeed, as has already been said, we now have more patient safety. This is good after the breast implant scandal - that was what triggered it - but we still do not have a central approval, which is also good, because otherwise it would have made innovation and patient access to certain drugs more difficult. So it's good that we managed to do that too. What is it now? I would like to say a few things about it. First about risk classes. I also learned a lot, I have to say: Risk class 1 is, for example, a care bed, 2a are hearing aids, 2b are dental implants, and risk class 3 is cardiac catheters. And depending on which risk class that is, special approval procedures are required, and you then have more compensation obligations or liability with the producers. These are all things that we discussed. Reconditioning was a big problem. Up until then I had also thought that single-use products should not be reprocessed. Under However, under certain conditions, Member States may allow this, and we have also noticed that it is possible.Well, we've really dealt with such things down to the last detail.Even with tests - by the way, I disagree with Peter Liese.I think it's good that we have kept access to tests relatively low-threshold because I think that patients need it.Finally, an urgent request to the Commission: there are a large number of implementing acts and delegated acts that have to come now, in some cases before the notified bodies have even been designated.My warm request to the Commission: make sure that you have enough resources to do everything the way patients need in Europe.That would be great", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Liberals and centrists"}, {"id": 246, "date": "2017-04-04.json", "name": "Kateřina KONEČNÁ", "mepid": "23699", "text": "on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group. - Mr President, we have been negotiating these two regulations here for more than four and a half years.

These texts are always due to a scandal, for example the scandal of PIP breast prostheses in France, among others, but I believe that there has been significant progress. Among the strengths, I note the compensation insurance system for patients who suffer damage, which is very important. I note the progress on transparency and identification, in particular of medical devices, the creation of a public database - in this regard, we have written to Mr Juncker for financial means to be made available so that this Eudamed database can be functional - just like the publication of the declaration of interest of all the experts who will participate and, finally, the elimination as far as possible of carcinogens, mutagens and reprotoxic substances. I have a caveat to a few things: we did not get the centralized marketing authorization. We are therefore going to have several notified bodies, which entails the need for unannounced assessment and checks, as has been said, in order to ensure their expertise capacity. Indeed, the new scandal over Essure, a tubal sterilization implant, shows that the presence of nickel causes a huge number of side effects that are impacted by women.

Sadly, these two contentious cases are said to be in part the consequence of a lack of vigilance by a national health agency. But that in no way justifies the total loss of the prerogatives of the States due to the establishment of the two regulations studied today. These new regulations will place unrealistic constraints on notified bodies which are, by virtue of their compulsory accreditation, the keystone of the value chain since they transfer the competences of the national authorities to these same notified bodies by transforming them into a real health police. The consequences are then twofold: the privatization of the health system when medical devices are placed on the market and, moreover, a considerable increase in certification costs in return for the responsibility that will weigh on these organizations and therefore on their premium. insurance in anticipation of future trials. While certain provisions are useful, such as improved traceability, the end result risks paralyzing quite quickly the European medical device sector, especially the French sector, unable to date to rely on a notified body that is essential. In so doing, these regulations violate our health sovereignty without precedent. Unable to supply their customers, due to the lack of mandatory CE marking, French SMEs are forced out of hospitals and pharmacies on the recommendation of the French National Medicines Safety Agency, itself, for the benefit of foreign companies, or even external to it. 'European Union, yet for products of lower quality.Of course, these foreign companies must also obtain the CE mark, but their profitability and their prevalence in their national market allow them to resist better, even if, in the long term, the potential lack of auditors will make the European market dependent on imports from countries.third.Recall that in France, the medical device industry concerns around 65,000 jobs out of a thousand companies which are more than 90% of very small companies (TPE), for a turnover of 20 billion euros..Ultimately, if this discussion was necessary and expected by the players in the sector, this revision entails a very significant modification of the regulatory requirements extending the certification deadlines.Conversely, the deadlines for the application of these regulations are desired in the very short term, almost by force.For all these reasons, we will oppose these texts.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 4, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 250, "date": "2017-04-04.json", "name": "Françoise GROSSETÊTE", "mepid": "2025", "text": "- Mr President, Commissioner, it will have taken almost five years for us to be able to revise this legislation which is more than 20 years old and to close the loopholes which have unfortunately resulted in scandals like the scandal. global health of PIP breast prostheses.

The medical devices industry is hugely important in the EU, with over 25 000 companies employing almost 600 000 people. That is a lot of people. Throughout our work on this legislation, we had in mind that we needed stronger rules to improve device safety and protect patients without stifling the innovation that is a key feature of the industry in Europe. I believe the agreement that we have reached strikes the right balance. This will strengthen requirements for medical devices, and require high-risk devices to undergo additional pre-market assessment. Stricter rules on post-market surveillance will also ensure a faster response if there is a problem with a device and a new ID system will improve traceability. It is clear that Member States will have to cooperate and share information, and the new EU-wide database EUDAMED will help them do that. And importantly, patients will have more information on the devices they use or are treated with.

Ms. Reid is unfortunately no longer there, that's why she can no longer hear it; but perhaps it can be brought to her. She said that it would be good if the Member States looked into the matter. I think we have to see clearly that if these products are traded in the internal market, then we will also have common standards of control. It is not that we have an open free market and that consumer health is not protected by common standards, and I believe UKIP and its allies will see the huge problems the people of Britain face if they do the internal market is no longer there at some point. Products are becoming more expensive, innovations from the rest of Europe may not come to the island so quickly, and you will still see what kind of crazy policy it is that the UKIP has again represented in the European Parliament today. We need these rules and we need the single market with high rules to protect human health.

This is a very important debate because we talk about our external response to the phenomenon of migration and refugees, but in reality it is a debate that speaks a lot about us, about what we want the European Union to be, about what we believe the European Union should be. European Union. The truth is that I believe that this is no longer the time for rhetoric. A lot has happened. Today President Steinmeier spoke of courage. You probably have to give up rhetoric and instead deal with courage. The European Union is at a critical moment, without a doubt, and runs the risk of becoming even more self-contained. With the phenomenon of migration and refugees it has been completely overwhelmed. Overwhelmed by something we call a crisis. But it is not a crisis, because it will not end anytime soon. We must stop calling the movement of people fleeing the most absolute horror and who have only one thing, which is their right to be protected, a refugee crisis. We must stop calling the arrival of thousands of people a migratory crisis who do not choose on a whim to leave their home, country and family, but flee because they have no other choice. On the other hand, we can talk about another crisis. The crisis of European solidarity. That is a crisis. A lack of solidarity with those who come from outside and a lack of solidarity within with the partners themselves, between partners. We can also speak of an institutional crisis, because the European Council has been unable to fulfill its own commitments, which were already minimal commitments in hosting refugees. And we can also speak of a moral crisis, because we are more busy blocking the access of these people to our borders, even with spurious agreements, such as the agreement adopted with Turkey, or more interested in promoting returns than in alleviating the dramatic situation that all these people live inside and outside our borders. What reaches Europe is a small proportion of the harsh reality of displacement in the world, from countries much poorer than ours that host, multiplied by five and ten, this crisis that we call refugee. Our reaction has been irresponsible to say the least. Especially that of national governments. It has been short-term, myopic, they do not want to see that this phenomenon has come to stay. The report that we present is an own-initiative report and therefore does not require action by the Council and the Commission. But it is a voice, the voice of the European Parliament, the voice of the representatives of the citizens in the European Union. And this voice affirms that migratory phenomena cannot be understood as a threat, that we need a change of paradigm, of narrative, to make them something beneficial, as it has been throughout history. This is a battle that Democrats cannot lose and that we must fight without complexes in the face of a rising extreme right and a populism of the left and right that is clearly expanding. To do this we must overcome, says the report, an approach focused only on security to deal with human rights, to deal with integration, to ensure that these people have legal avenues of access to our countries. And so as not to always transfer responsibility to third parties. We are demanding that many countries that have much greater difficulties than us to take charge of something that we are not prepared to take charge of, and this Parliament cannot be ignored in this whole new strategy of agreements with third countries. We face a very serious credibility problem with our citizens and we have to respond to them to the extent that our values ​​require us to respond. I believe that it is a great step that the external action of the European Union will also deal with the phenomenon of migration and refugees.

I want to start by approaching the report question correctly: we refer to the challenges posed by the flows of migrants and refugees and the external role of the Union. It is not, therefore, a report that focuses primarily on the inner dimension. An external dimension, Mr President, is of the utmost importance in tackling irregular migration and tackling its root causes, as was underlined at the Valletta Summit and at the last European Councils. Migration is a powerful development tool and, therefore, can contribute to socio-economic progress, as has historically been the case. Furthermore, it must be approached as a unique opportunity to transform migration into a key factor for sustainable and inclusive development. Therefore, I consider it essential that a positive narrative is used that promotes an authentic and objective understanding of the issue and the associated common benefits. That is why I very sincerely support the \"Together\" campaign launched by the United Nations to reduce negative perception and attitudes towards refugees and migrants. I call on the Union institutions to cooperate fully with the United Nations in support of this campaign. I would like to underline that the Union must respect its values ​​and principles in all common policies and promote them in its external relations, as established in Article 21 of the Treaty on the Union, which I am expressly going to cite, since I consider it of utmost importance for our purpose: «The Union's action on the international scene will be based on the principles that have inspired its creation, development and enlargement and which it intends to promote in the rest of the world: democracy, the rule of law, the universality and indivisibility of the human rights and freedoms fundamental principles, respect for human dignity, the principles of equality and solidarity and respect for the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and international law ”. Well yes, what is in crisis is management and what is in crisis is solidarity, nothing more. I specifically wanted to mention the solidarity of the Union and all its policies to emphasize that the Union's aid and cooperation must be unconditional and designed to achieve development and growth in third countries, thereby also promoting growth in the within the European Union itself, and all the more so since the Union is the world's largest donor. It is true that the humanitarian aid system is absolutely overwhelmed and therefore we need a comprehensive and more enduring approach to migration that includes promoting closer links between humanitarian and development fields to address this challenge, not forgetting that the primary objective of humanitarian aid is the eradication of poverty. I also want to emphasize the empowerment of the role of women and their greater participation in decision-making processes at all migration stages. In addition, I ask for greater protection for the most vulnerable, such as the aforementioned women, minors, people with disabilities, the elderly and LGBTI people, and, in particular, that they all be granted unique help and greater protection humanitarian aid and that they are facilitated access to resident status and basic services, including health care and education. Following the doctrine of the United Nations at the high-level Summit in September, I consider it essential to achieve safe, orderly and regular migration. For this, we must intensify our cooperation with the United Nations, giving a fundamental role to UNHCR, the new resettlement program of the European Union. We also need to fight against smugglers who profit from the vulnerability of migrants, and greater protection of the Union's external borders is important.I would like to condemn and denounce the terrible numbers of deaths at sea, and I want to express my concern for the missing children and demand that the Union and the States assume their responsibility to achieve a global and multilateral response based on international cooperation and synergiesto respond to these present and future challenges.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 281, "date": "2017-04-04.json", "name": "Agustín DÍAZ DE MERA GARCÍA CONSUEGRA", "mepid": "28397", "text": "   Member of the Commission, on behalf of the Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. – Mr President, honourable Members, allow me to stand in for the High Representative, Vice-President of the Commission, Ms Mogherini, in this very important debate. First of all let me thank you for this report, as well as for your strong support for our work and in particular for the partnership framework approach. The partnership framework approach and your report are based on the same idea: isolation cannot solve the challenges of our time. We need to engage with our partners, build new channels for cooperation with them. And this is particularly true on the issue of migration. I cannot but subscribe to all relevant recommendations in your report. Never forget that this is about human beings, so respect for human beings and human rights must come first. Work on both short-term fixes and long-term solutions is important. Tackle the root causes of irregular migration and forced displacement and work for political and diplomatic solutions to conflicts. Engage not only bilaterally but also at the global, regional and local level. This is the cornerstone of our work with third countries on migration. Following our debate in February, let me first of all debrief you on our work on the central Mediterranean. All services involved, namely the EEAS, Commission services and Council, are working hand in hand together with the Presidency and Member States on the implementation of the Malta Summit declaration.  It goes without saying that our overall primary objective remains the stabilisation of Libya. The terrible situation of migrants trapped in the hands of militias is only one, albeit important, part of the broader difficulties the country is facing. An effective and sustainable long-term response to the migration challenge in the central Mediterranean cannot be found without a lasting solution to Libya’s governance and security challenges. At the same time we cannot wait for the crisis in Libya to be over: too many people risk their lives every day to cross the Mediterranean, too many live in terrible conditions inside the country. Work is being intensified on all levels as regards more immediate and medium-term migration-related actions. Firstly we are stepping up our support for implementing partners, in particular the International Organisation for Migration and the UNHCR. We aim at improving the situation at disembarkation points and inside detention centres. But our cooperation can achieve much also on assisted voluntary returns; according to IOM’s analysis, 80% of migrants present in Libya are willing to return back to their countries of origin if they are given a safe and dignified opportunity to do so. Secondly we have started to facilitate a common approach between Libya, Chad and Niger to better manage Libya’s southern borders. The objective is to disrupt the smugglers’ business and provide assistance to migrants who are stranded, vulnerable or willing to return back home, before they embark on hazardous journeys through the desert. Thirdly we continue our support to the Libyan coastguard through Operation Sophia and through our Seahorse programme in terms of training, to put Libya in a condition to manage its territorial waters. Last but not least community stabilisation, providing support to Libyans as well as migrants, is also an important element under the EU support package for Libya. Let me in this context highlight the interconnection between our work on various fronts and in particular between our work in Libya, the partnership framework approach and the Valletta process. As clearly shown in our third progress report on the partnership framework adopted on 2 March, the approach is the right one and needs to be further consolidated. As part of this partnership we are engaging strongly with countries of transit like Niger. In parallel we are working with the countries of origin of irregular migration, aiming also at developing cooperation on return and readmission. This is, however, indispensable to address the root causes of the irregular migration flows reaching the European Union, and to discourage further migrants from embarking on dangerous journeys through the desert or at sea at the mercy of smugglers and traffickers. In this context it is paramount to ensure the political engagement of our partners to support our work with their own political strategic choices, and with reforms for the prosperity of their countries. In that regard the European External Investment Plan will be fundamental not only for the major impact that private investments might have for economic development, job creation and growth; the plan also offers the necessary technical assistance to identify and implement reforms for good governance, security and transparency. I do count on this House to continue working speedily towards the final adoption of the investment plan. Let me now come back to the partnership framework and share with you the progress achieved with the five priority countries. Niger represents a prominent example of successful cooperation on migration. The authorities are engaging proactively in the fight against human smuggling, in particular in the Agadez hub. This is crucial as Niger is a transit country of migratory flows towards Libya. Results are there, with a considerable decline of flows through Agadez. We need now to stabilise this positive result by enhancing our support to the local communities which are accepting to abandon the smuggling business and expand Niger’s model of the fight against migrant smuggling to other countries of transit in the Sahel region. This is key also to addressing the possible deviation of the smuggling routes, an issue that we are closely monitoring, including by putting in place a better system of information sharing. Our dialogue with Mali is on track. We will soon meet with Malian authorities to discuss possible areas of cooperation to stem the business of traffickers and smugglers of migrants. These include enhancing Mali’s cooperation with neighbouring countries such as Niger, which the Malian Minister for Malians Abroad visited recently. Furthermore the projects we have approved under the EU trust fund for Africa will allow IOM to deploy activities in several parts of Mali to facilitate the voluntary return of migrants transiting Mali to their countries and the cooperation with border posts. Senegal remains a trusted partner and we see positive developments. The Senegalese side has recently taken further steps in the right direction and we expect some concrete results very soon. Ethiopia has also adopted a constructive approach in regional and continental dialogues with the European Union on migration as current Chair of the Khartoum process. Its contribution, together with Mali, was important to the successful outcome of the Valletta senior official meeting last February. Finally, dialogue and political cooperation with Nigeria has been stepped up significantly, although work is still needed with this country which represents the main origin of the irregular migration flows reaching the Mediterranean. This challenge we can only manage together and I am glad that our approach, based on migration compacts, has also become the international approach at the last United Nations General Assembly. The cooperation and experience acquired with the partnership frameworks is something we intend to bring as an EU input in the follow-up to the General Assembly during the six informal consultations that are to be held in New York, Geneva and Vienna.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "PPE", "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 282, "date": "2017-04-04.json", "name": "Marie-Christine VERGIAT", "mepid": "96858", "text": "rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs. - Madam President, this new report on migration follows on from previous ones, in particular the one for which I was rapporteur, namely the report on human rights and migration in third countries, adopted in October latest.

As rapporteur for the opinion, I welcome the fact that many of the concerns of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) have been taken into account. However, we could have gone further in the holistic approach, in an approach based on internal policies by which the Member States would set an example in terms of respect for the rights of migrants, whatever their status. The absolute urgency is legal channels, including economic and labor immigration, regardless of the country of origin. In 2015, 500,000 new visas were issued in the European Union to Ukrainians.

So why, at the same time, are we closing the door to those who come from the South, Syria, the Horn of Africa? Why do we obsess over sending them home, preventing them from leaving? Two weights, two measures. Only objective criteria will allow the European Union to have a coherent policy based on facts and not on fantasies which fuel fear and rejection of the other.

Faced with this migratory phenomenon, unprecedented in its scale and complexity, Europe must provide adequate responses and act with clarity, efficiency and consistency. This report emphasizes several points of the Union's external action which I consider essential. First of all, the European Union and the Member States must confirm their political commitment to tackle the root causes of migration and forced displacement. We must strengthen the commitments made with our partners, for example on the Emergency Trust Fund, and focus our action, inter alia, on economic resilience, poverty reduction and security in third countries. Then, with regard to the Union's international partnerships, we must on the one hand step up our support to the countries of first reception which play a key role in responding to migratory pressures, like the Western Balkans or the Lebanon and Jordan. Socio-economic and judicial cooperation with countries of origin and transit must also be encouraged, within the framework of a balanced dialogue. In this spirit, monitoring the operational implementation of the Rabat and Khartoum processes is essential. On the other hand, we must continue our work of collaboration with multilateral bodies and NGOs which provide their expertise and support European action on a global scale. It is essential to continue to mobilize all stakeholders in the management of this phenomenon. Finally, I welcome the fact that this report gives an important place to the fight against human tragedies. faced by refugees and migrants.Human trafficking, violence and abuse are too many when we talk about all these victims forced to move.It is necessary to oppose a reaction on our part.(The speaker agrees to answer a 'blue card' question (Rule 162 (8) of the Rules))", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 284, "date": "2017-04-04.json", "name": "Tibor SZANYI", "mepid": "124703", "text": "Blue card question.- Ms. President!Special thanks to Mrs Representative for her intention to respond.I would ask two questions, both very simple.One is how much do you believe in the credibility of the European Union in negotiating with partner countries, when the position on the refugee issue is extremely diverse within the European Union?For example, in my country, Hungary, the Fidesz government, the Orbán government, which is sitting in your ranks, is specifically imprisoning refugees.How do you experience this in the People's Party?", "language": "en", "original_language": "hu", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 285, "date": "2017-04-04.json", "name": "Mariya GABRIEL", "mepid": "96848", "text": "answer \"blue card\".- First of all, in the interpretation, there was only one question: is the European Union credible when dealing with migrants?I would like to say one thing: Credibility means making commitments in Brussels and then implementing them at national level, taking united and common actions for all Member States, and speaking with one voice on the international stage.If we have more concrete and adequate instruments to be able to meet this challenge, then we will gain credibility.Yes, the European Union has everything to gain if this credibility is accompanied by the elements I have just outlined.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 286, "date": "2017-04-04.json", "name": "Enrique GUERRERO SALOM", "mepid": "96768", "text": "on behalf of the S & amp; D Group. - Madam President, first of all I want to thank the two rapporteurs, Mrs Valenciano and Mr Díaz de Mera, not only for the report, but for their intervention here this afternoon. To assess the report I think it is good to put some data in context. Last week we learned that there have been around five million Syrian refugees, a very important part of the population of this country. But in the world there are sixty million refugees as a cause of conflict. If the war in Syria is resolved - and hopefully soon - we will continue to have tens of millions of refugees in the world. 1,200,000 people came to the European Union and had to be taken over by 28 countries and 500 million inhabitants. Lebanon, whose area is equivalent to the Alsace region in which we meet today, has 1.5 million refugees. Therefore, the crisis is not the number of refugees that have arrived. The crisis is the management of hatred, of the indifference with which we have treated those migrants or refugees fleeing war or hunger. The report has medium and short-term responses. And the first is to change the narrative: migration or the refugee is not a risk. It is a risk to mismanage it. And managing it badly is responding exclusively with walls, with barbed wire, with repression, with neglect of human rights. Managing it well is contributing to the development of those countries that force them to emigrate due to lack of opportunities and not as an option to improve their lives. Managing it well is offering legal avenues and humanitarian visas.

These people have fled war, famine, repressive dictatorships, economic hardship or a mixture of all of those combined. Their arrival has clearly sparked a huge debate in our societies as to where it is right to draw the line between compassion to those seeking a better life versus our actual political and financial capabilities to provide such relief. I am convinced personally that, in many respects, the Geneva Convention is ill—suited to the modern globalised world, and that reform is vital if we are to maintain support for its key tenets of providing temporary safe haven to those most in need. Rather than seeking to offer opportunities to the few that reach Europe, the majority is better served by support for economic and political developments in the countries that they are leaving.  The Valletta Action Plan recognises this and I welcome the EEAS’s efforts to support state—building and development goals. Furthermore, its efforts to secure readmission agreements with third countries like Turkey, and support for the CSDP naval Operation Sophia Mediterranean against people smugglers, are also very welcome, to stop illegal migration to Europe. Europe’s neighbours are seeing a rapid population increase, a lack of job creation and, in Africa in particular, are increasingly troubled by future effects of climate change. Clearly more needs to be done to defend Europe’s external borders, but we cannot ignore, nor insulate ourselves from, the reasons that are pushing people to leave their homes in the first place.

That is what European citizens rightly ask of us. That is also what we should do. In 2017 we can no longer tolerate that people have and give their whole lives to people smugglers to go to sea in rickety boats, and that children, women and men drown daily, weekly. This is unworthy of Europe. That is why we in the ALDE Group are very happy with this report. It contains crucial things: strengthen external borders. Work on a genuine European asylum and migration application. Rethink the Dublin system. Make a real division, in solidarity with Europe. Tackle the people smugglers, but also: work on economic migration. Work on that blue card so that we can admit the people we need. Tackle the people smugglers hard and inexorably. We also discussed it here in plenary yesterday. That is one point that I will definitely keep stressing on behalf of the ALDE Group. We must also focus on ending the conflicts, on the fight against extreme poverty. Make sure that people do not have to flee their home front. To be honest, Commissioner, if I had been born in Syria today, I would also be on one of those rickety dinghies on the way to a better life. And I think you are with me in that rickety dinghy. So we have to work on that. You said it, end those conflicts, that's what we have to do. Finally, very important: focus on the protection of unaccompanied children.

In this report, which is not legislative and does not mark European policy, they ask for legal and safe routes and humanitarian visas; but later, in the same report, they support deportations, the militarization of the Mediterranean, the intervention of NATO and the externalization of borders. And, what is worse: in the reports that are legislative, in the European Commission and in the Council, which is where it is really decided, their parties do not support the opening of legal channels and do not support humanitarian visas, but everything contrary.

The reform of the Instrument for Stability and Peace, which is currently being discussed in Parliament's committees, will contribute to this. Migration can and must be curbed by eradicating poverty and promoting economically, socially and environmentally sustainable development. In this, the Foreign Service has a key role to play both in implementing long-term development policy and in channeling humanitarian aid.

Now it also seems that the Migration Cooperation Agreement with Libya must be justified, where there are systematic human rights violations, police brutality and degrading conditions for migrants. A model of externalization of borders that is imposed in Europe, but that the Governments of the Socialist Party and the Popular Party inaugurated precisely with Morocco, selling to our Sahrawi brothers. Likewise, it justifies and is committed to NATO interventions in migration matters, justifying a strong Europe, which, by the way, is the political fuel for the rise of the extreme right in Europe. While thousands of people continue to die in the Mediterranean, the humanitarian aid of many NGOs dedicated to search and rescue in the Mediterranean is now criminalized, reaching where the European institutions do not and do not want to.

There are 65 million refugees in the world, very few are in Europe, most are in third countries or in neighboring countries. Yet in this continent of ours, which should be the cradle of freedom and rights, a conflict is open around migrants and refugees, a wrong and dangerous conflict, but which has two fundamental reasons. The first: there are political forces that have exploited the different, and this political use of refugees has been lethal for reception. Let's take family reunification, which is a fundamental ethical principle, yet in Europe it is now very difficult to have legislation in this sense. The second reason: it is precisely the disorganization, the lack of cooperation and solidarity between the various countries of the Member States that have made migration a non-governed phenomenon and therefore preparatory to the spread of fears that run through public opinion.

The migration and refugee crisis presents our continent with a huge challenge. It is a challenge that we can ultimately only master together in Europe. I would like to mention two points on which the success of this European migration policy will largely depend: Firstly, we will only be successful in the long term if we succeed in resolutely addressing the root causes of migration. As the European Union, we should make our contribution to peace in our southern neighborhood and promote economic development, especially in Africa, by investing in jobs, vocational training and entrepreneurship, especially in the agricultural sector. Second: the external borders of our Member States are the external borders of the European Union in the 21st century. That is why the Schengen system must be preserved, deepened and expanded. The Schengen area must be able to maintain and protect its external borders. Separate European monitoring instruments are just as necessary as a common asylum and migration policy in order to strike a balance between the fulfillment of humanitarian obligations on the one hand and the absorption capacity of the member states on the other.

Achieving a fair sharing of responsibilities on reception is not only a European but a global issue. But how will the European Union do its part if every effort by the Council, and ultimately also by the Commission, seems to be aimed at externalizing our borders? We see this in the proposed reform of the common asylum system, with the inadmissibility checks based on the discretionary concept of safe third countries; we see this in the agreements with Turkey, whose success is measured in the inhumane conditions of 15 000 migrants stranded on the Greek islands, and now with Libya, which has not even signed up to the Geneva Convention; we see it in the new partnership frameworks, which would like to condition cooperation on development, on the control of migratory flows and on repatriation. This not only violates the very essence of development cooperation, which according to article 208 must eliminate poverty, but also risks directing aid only to countries on migratory routes, forgetting the least developed ones and jeopardizing the relations of the Union with third countries.

The only solution will be through a multilateral development policy that will benefit all the places, which have unfortunately become far too numerous, where people are fleeing.

The crisis experienced in the last two years at the European borders has shown us some of the shortcomings of the Union's migration policy. Important efforts are being made - for example, the creation of the European Coast and Border Guard or the asylum and visa initiatives - but we all know that the Union's migration policy requires a comprehensive approach that reinforces its external dimension. Arrivals have fallen substantially on the eastern Mediterranean route, but in the central Mediterranean they are increasing year by year. The stabilization of Libya, the main country of departure, is of vital importance. So is the realization of long-term cooperation with other of our African neighbors, where a significant 'youth bubble' is developing. A solid association and comprehensive collaboration with the countries of origin and transit are essential to channel migration flows, tackling, as far as possible, the problems at their origin — poverty, insecurity, lack of horizons, etc.—. That is why I welcome the Valletta Action Plan and the launch of the partnership frameworks - Senegal, Mali, Ethiopia, Niger, Nigeria - as well as the proposal for the foreign investment plan, formulated by the Commission. Massive flows of people are a challenge that affects us all: there is no individual solution.

We have been calling for this for a long time, and right now we are currently seeing it again in numerical examples that are mentioned in other draft reports by the Commission - it is now assumed that if you do not want to accept an asylum seeker or refugee you do not want to one would have an admission quota in the EU for which non admission should pay 250,000 euros. These sums alone show that something is going completely wrong. With this money we could help an incredible number of people locally, and here we are talking about a single migrant who comes to Europe. We finally need an honest definition of what the EU can and wants to achieve. And, in my opinion, this joint asylum work must be based on voluntary action, because otherwise the integration of the people will not succeed, and that must be our goal.

However, the European Union cannot tackle the migration crisis alone because it is a global problem that requires close cooperation with other countries. It is therefore necessary for the European Union to negotiate and sign more readmission agreements to return irregular migrants quickly. Cooperation with countries of origin and transit also needs to be stepped up so that human trafficking networks, with which thousands of people reach Europe, are broken. However, the most successful way to work with countries of origin is to strengthen economic ties and provide more aid so as to create a long-term perspective for economic growth and jobs in poorer countries.

The European Parliament has therefore carried out a review of the state of implementation of the 2014-2020 multiannual financial perspective and, following this review, concluded that changes were necessary. He proposed a range of these changes, which were then discussed in the Council and, of course, very carefully analyzed by the Commission. After the first doubts that arose, we were very pleased to hear that the Commission supported the revision proposal and the Council, after long debates and doubts of some Member States, also agreed that the multiannual financial perspectives must be changed. It should also be remembered that such changes have a major impact on the debate on the future financial perspective post-2020. If we have decided to revise and change the perspective, it means that we will also be ready for more flexibility and revision in the next financial perspective. I would like to point out that what we have discussed does not only concern purely budgetary issues. An element of the revision is also a proposal for greater simplification. Please note that parallel to the budget debate, work is underway to amend the financial regulation, the so-called by omnibus. These matters should not be separated because revision means a change of approach, change of treatment. What we are going to vote on tomorrow, as is well known, concerns various issues. Firstly, it concerns the greater elements of flexibility that will allow us to implement also in the coming years new tasks that were not envisaged at the very beginning of the preparation of the financial perspective. Greater flexibility will also allow amounts that have not been used appropriately in recent years, in other words, to use them before the end of the financial perspective, which is not the case at present. At the moment, this money is being returned to the Member States. We hope to make greater use of this in recent years. Therefore, increasing flexibility is the first result of the work that has taken place between the European institutions. Besides - the proposals that appeared in the declarations: both in the joint declaration of the Council and Parliament, but also in the position of Parliament, which was voted on tomorrow, which is a declaration. In other words, earmarking greater amounts for tasks related in particular to the new challenges related to the immigration crisis and also to employment of young people. The European Parliament raised its doubts about the re-use of amounts within the budget, but we will probably discuss this matter in the upcoming work on annual budgets. Therefore, I would like to emphasize that the so-called the package of changes, which includes both the revision of the regulation and the additional elements that we will vote on, creates a completely new situation in the debate on the financial perspective, and I think it will be a good starting point for discussions on the next financial perspective after 2020 .", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 386, "date": "2017-04-04.json", "name": "Isabelle THOMAS", "mepid": "114279", "text": "rapporteur. - Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we meet again on the eve of the vote on the revision of the 2014-2020 multiannual financial framework. We encountered headwinds, avoided a few shoals, suffered flat calm for months of standing still, suffered a few squalls, and we resisted the sirens singing to us that we would never get there. However, we stayed on course and are touching the wharf. The trip could have been more peaceful and we could have brought more fish back to our holds, but we achieved the goal: the revision of the financial framework. Indeed, if the budgetary programming extended over seven years allows everyone, region, State, research laboratory, etc., to access European programs with serenity, and also with visibility and efficiency, this exercise becomes more and more difficult. . First, because in 2013, we implemented an undersized financial framework for the years 2014-2020, then because the duration implies that the last invoices arrive in 2023, but above all because in the unstable period when we are, it has become impossible to project seven years in advance and respond to unforeseen events and profound changes. MEPs had this lucidity, since in 2013 they had obtained the possibility of a mid-term review. It was not a whim, as we can see, but simply a realistic vision and analysis on the undersizing of the budget and on the evolution of a world that is increasingly quickly. In 2013, the migration phenomenon, Brexit, the terrorist attacks, the imperialist aims of Vladimir Putin and the election of Donald Trump were not on the agenda. The truth is, our framework is obsolete today. To begin to respond to these challenges, a review of the financial framework was needed. Obviously, what is offered to us will not answer all problems and questions. This is only a small step, but in the right direction, and I would like to thank the Commission for it. This step forward is the one which makes it possible to release up to six billion euros for Europeans, up to three billion for flexibility, with 516 million additional euros for the flexibility instrument, 80 million for the emergency aid reserve and up to EUR 2.4 billion of re-use of unallocated funds which will be added to the flexibility instrument. Budget increases are planned - you know them - for the fight against youth unemployment, the reception of refugees, and 2.5 billion euros are planned for the security of Europeans. But contrary to our expectations, this revision does not provide for either raising the expenditure ceilings or sufficient solutions to avoid a new payments crisis and, finally, it does not unfortunately mention the subject of own resources, which are nevertheless essential if we want to. stop the infernal circle of budget shortage. However, we are satisfied. This text inscribes in stone the principle of a mid-term review of the multiannual financial framework, thus demonstrating its usefulness and setting a precedent, a necessary step for the future. We wanted with my colleague, Mr Olbrycht, co-rapporteur, to add a statement so that there is no ambiguity on our interpretation of the statements proposed by the Council. Clearly, Parliament will never give up the slightest bit of its power, nor of its budgetary authority defined by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Of course, the Commission will remain the guarantor of full respect for everyone's budgetary prerogatives. Thus, we approach the next budgets taking into account the issues and priorities. Parliament has always been and will remain clear on its interpretation of the financial framework: “por límite el cielo ”, I am not very good at Spanish but, as Cervantes wrote,“ the sky is limit ”, that is to say the ceilings and only the ceilings of the financial framework as a whole, it goes without saying.self.This review is an important step, but let's not kid ourselves.While this is indeed a breath of fresh air, a moment of respite, it is not the hoped-for solution to all the budgetary difficulties that beset us.We pointed out, during the review examination, the gap between the new priorities and the actual state of the Union's means.This is not an end to budgetary questions until 2020.

I have noticed also that some Members would have liked the Presidency to be here during the preceding debate but we had no invitation. I would have liked to join your Members in that particular debate. With regard to this file, this file has kept the Council and Parliament busy since the start of September and this hard work is now coming to fruition. Before going into the substance I want to make a point on the process. The result we have on the table today could not have been achieved without the help of the European Parliament, particularly Mr Arthuis as Chair of the Committee on Budgets, but also Ms Thomas and Mr Olbrycht as co-rapporteurs have worked very constructively with the Council. They conveyed the messages coming from the European Parliament at all stages to feed into the discussion of the Council as well. We saw that many of the concerns expressed by this Chamber were shared also by the delegations. I can also say, in another way, that you helped us to be more ambitious with this review and making it also a proper revision of the EU budget that goes beyond words and also turns into action. Now a point on the substance of the deal that you all have in front of you. This is the result of the dialogue and cooperation between the European Parliament and the Council, and it is a package of new rules and new amounts which found unanimous support within the Council on 7 March. I highlighted the word ‘package’ because of course you know what it means having unanimity in the Council, and we had to make every element count. The balance of the deal is delicate and also cannot be picked apart. Now we have created room for manoeuvre allowing additional funding to respond to the new priorities we all share: migration and security but also growth and youth. They will benefit from more than EUR 5 billion in extra funding over the next four years. Second, our budget will be more agile and also more flexible to respond to future crises. This will also allow us to meet unforeseen needs and move swiftly in their regards. We will increase the capacities of the flexibility instrument and the emergency aid reserve by a total of almost EUR 700 million over the next four years, and in addition the flexibility instrument will be increased further by unused amounts from the Solidarity Fund and Globalisation Adjustment Fund. The global margin for commitments will be extended in both time and scope whilst the caps of the global margin for payments will also be increased.  We all want to move ahead with this deal because we are convinced that it will also allow us to strengthen our tools and better respond to the priorities that have emerged in the last two years. Let me use this occasion, Mr President, to underline the work achieved also by our Slovak friends in the autumn. We started last September with heavy groundwork, we planted seeds we hoped would grow. They needed a little time but they are now about to bloom. I use this metaphor also to convey a simple message that the time is ripe to secure the agreement on the revision of the MFF regulation and its accompanying package. But this flower is also fragile and the season is short. I hope that we will have a green light from this Chamber and conclude this file without any further delays. I look forward to Commissioner Oettinger’s delivery and those of your Members in the debate.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "S&D", "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 388, "date": "2017-04-04.json", "name": "Isabelle THOMAS", "mepid": "114279", "text": "Member of the Commission. - Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, honorable colleague Borg, ladies and gentlemen! Tonight we are debating an important package to improve our common European budgetary policy. Even more than at the national level, two goals have to be brought together at the European level: the goal of planning security on the one hand and the principle of flexible, efficient ability to act on the other. Planning security: Regardless of whether it is rural areas or our farmers, no matter whether structural programs, regional programs, social programs, whether connecting Europe and thus the construction of expensive infrastructure or our research policy - if we could only commit ourselves for one year, they would Medium-term, important and large programs and projects would hardly be feasible, and the planning security that our partners - the people, the economy, the farmers, the regions, the Member States - need would not exist. This is why a budget framework lasting several years - in this case seven years - makes sense. And vice versa: who could, when the Commission made its MFF proposal in June 2011, and who could foresee the political, economic and social development in 2016 in Parliament and Council when it was deliberated and decided on in the second half of 2013 / 2017/2018 brings new tasks, focal points and problems for us? And therefore: planning security on the one hand and flexibility to act quickly on the other. If the present package, which was indeed moderated very aggressively by your predecessors - the Slovak Presidency - and by you, which was then approved by our Italian government, which was discussed constructively in the Committee on Budgets, is adopted in Parliament and the Council at the end of April, this would be a great success for the ability of European politics to act and a particular success for the European Houses of Parliament. It was you, the honorable Members, who then proposed the mid-term review and mid-term update of the MFF package. I openly admit - at that time not yet jointly responsible for the budget -: I would not have believed that Parliament's request - your request - could now become a reality. It is true that the proposal that is on the table, which the Council made you unanimously, is not one hundred percent identical to the proposal of the Commission, but it is a considerable step in the right direction. And if that is decided, it will be your - the honorable Member - success. On the one hand, it is a question of being able to effectively support important priorities of our people and Parliament with more money for the second half - because the seven-year budget framework will have its mid-term on 30 June this year: the fight against youth unemployment, the issue of security within Europe , the financing of migration efforts, which includes border protection and border control, or increased development aid in neighboring countries, where this can reduce the reasons for fleeing, and the revitalization of Horizon 2020, COSME, Erasmus, Connecting Europe, or the extension and continuation of our European Fund for Strategic Investments - all requests by a large majority here in Parliament, supported by the Commission and ultimately in agreement with the Member States, which are also affected and benefit from it. But there is more to it. With this package, the Commission's proposal for the 2018 budget can be much closer to the needs of the present, the 2019 budget much closer to the needs of the next two years and the 2020 budget too. We will thus create a considerably better ability to act for the next three budget years. The Commission is currently preparing the next multiannual budgetary framework. We are in first Considerations for the period after 2020 and in due course - this year or next year - we will present you with our five- or seven-year budget proposal for the next decade. I can tell you: if this package is adopted, we will create for the next Parliament, for the next Commission, for the Council in the next decade better ability to act, more accuracy, more flexibility. That's why we're happy about this progress. Many thanks to the president. Many thanks also to the colleagues in the Committee on Budgets. We are campaigning for the acceptance of this package out of conviction, and we want to announce that we and our Maltese friends want to advance the omnibus regulation in the remaining weeks. Your offensive moderation here impresses me very much. That would be the counterpart, that would be the supplement to a then largely existing flexible budget policy based on the tasks that change, that change and that could thus be better solved at European level than with the old law.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "S&D", "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 389, "date": "2017-04-04.json", "name": "José Manuel FERNANDES", "mepid": "96899", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, I would also like to salute the Presidency of the Council, the Commissioner and all and all colleagues. The multiannual financial framework must respond to new challenges, needs, urgencies and contingencies. So, in good time - and here I pay tribute to all those who were in that negotiation - we, Parliament, have fought in the last negotiations on the financial framework and we have achieved more flexibility in the European Union budget and the possibility of having a review of the framework multiannual financial framework. It was worth it, as it is recognized today, albeit belatedly, by the Council. This year, for the first time in history, we have the possibility, therefore, of approving the revision of the 2014-2020 multiannual financial framework. We have an obligation to increase employment and, in particular, youth employment, tackle terrorism, support those who need it most. For this purpose, we have increased the initial amounts with approximately € 5,000 million - new money that was not foreseen. The “Youth Employment” Initiative takes the largest share with 1,200 million euros. The research and innovation program “Horizon 2020”, the Cosme for SMEs program, the “Connecting Europe” mechanism, Erasmus +, are other reinforced programs, even if they are reallocated. Thus, we will have more means to face the current challenges and we will also reinforce, to face the issues of migration, the amounts allocated to it. This review introduces flexibility, allows financing additional needs, enhances employment, promotes solidarity. Conclusion: it is a good review and everyone who agrees with these objectives should support it and the amounts are not for the European Parliament, the amounts are for the European Union, the institutions, the Member States to face the challenges I mentioned . It was also important to eliminate constraints, limitations, the global authorization margin, increase global margin of payments, increasing the reserve for emergencies and an instrument of flexibility. I am talking about special instruments and here I turn to the Council and tell them that they should also have good interpretation - and the good interpretation is that these special instruments, as the name implies, are special - and that means they are above the limits, outside the limits of the multiannual financial framework. A word to regret that the Council has once again tried to provoke and condition Parliament. As it is more than evident, a political declaration does not remove any prerogative from us, much less prerogatives that are enshrined in the Treaties and are, yes, mandatory in terms of respect and our competences, the competences in the annual budgetary process, these we will maintain them.

During the negotiation of this financial framework, we already warned of the terrible consequences of the reduction of resources compared to the previous framework, and we opposed it. And thanks to this opposition, we were at least able to achieve some achievements: greater flexibility, a mandatory mid-term review, a roadmap for reform of the Union's revenue system, and even some new priorities such as, for example, the European Youth Guarantee. And thank goodness we achieved those improvements, because to the multiple crises that the Union is facing today, we should have also added the budgetary crisis. In these first years we have squeezed one hundred percent all the margins of action that we had to finance new needs such as, for example, launching the European investment plan, care for refugees, humanitarian aid or the fight against youth unemployment. But make no mistake: this has had significant budgetary consequences, especially in areas such as competitiveness, research or transport. That is why this review is so important, because we have no room for action; We cannot continue cutting programs to finance new needs, because these needs are still there. And that is why we also value this review positively: it represents a potential increase of EUR 6 billion between now and 2020, and this will allow us to reinforce key programs for the future of the Union in research, transport or education. It will also allow us to give greater support to SMEs, duplicate the European investment plan and re-finance in a once the Youth Employment Initiative. And furthermore, this will also give us the possibility of launching new investment and development plans for neighboring countries, providing resources to the European Asylum Support Office or developing a true European policy for managing our borders. . But regrettably, once again, the Council - I believe - has not been ambitious or courageous enough to dare to make a real review based on a rigorous analysis of needs and priorities, and putting all the necessary means. But we in this Parliament do not lose hope. As soon as we approve this review, we are going to get to work - the Commission is going to do that too - without wasting a single minute on a new proposal for the future. We know very well that changing the dynamics - as the Council reminded us - and decisions in the Council is a task that requires a great deal of patience.

We always talk about the fact that we want to fight unemployment, that we want to increase competitiveness - absolutely undisputed. But the question is: are we going to increase competitiveness in such a way that we redistribute as much money as possible through subsidies? Nobody seriously believes that. We can certainly increase competitiveness. But then we have to ensure that the excessive bureaucracy is ended, that we leave the forces of the market free within the framework of social ties, but otherwise free, but not through an ever-growing budget with more and more money that we pay out.

This is the word I want to use as our Assembly gives its consent to the proposed revision of the multiannual financial framework. The road has been long and strewn with pitfalls. First there was - I want to emphasize this - the ambitious report by our colleagues Jan Olbrycht and Isabelle Thomas, whom I would like to congratulate once again. Then there was the Commission proposal which, even if it fell short of our expectations, represented a good basis for discussion. There was also the good performance of the Slovak Presidency, which surprised many and which I had unfairly criticized. Finally, there was the hesitation of the Italian government, which added a little suspense, making this file a mini political thriller. So relief, because there will be - Mr Olbrycht reminded us - a first. Satisfaction is certainly not total, but partial and with measured enthusiasm. Of course, there is indisputable progress: the overall margin for payments increased by some five billion, the increase in the means of the flexibility instrument and the reserve for emergency aid, the partial removal of the limitations which affect the scope of the global margin for commitments, 1,200,000,000 euros intended for the youth employment initiative, 875 million reserved for programs that are close to our hearts (Erasmus +, Horizon 2020, Cosme, etc.).

The aim of one of his statements is to get the consent of the European Parliament to the limitation increases in funds allocated to programs that we consider strategic.This somewhat pitiful maneuver prompted a unilateral declaration on our part which reminds us of the inalienable nature of our prerogatives in budgetary matters.Clearly, a declaration cannot change treaties.In conclusion, Distinguished Presidents, dear colleagues, I am sure that this revision will not be sufficient to face the challenges that we will have to face by 2020, but it is a small step forward, even if it remains measured.And a little progress is always better than a big failure.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Liberals and centrists"}, {"id": 393, "date": "2017-04-04.json", "name": "Liadh NÍ RIADA", "mepid": "124987", "text": "  thar ceann an Ghrúpa GUE/NGL. – A Uachtaráin, cé go bhfuil céimeanna beaga tógtha – agus cuirim fáilte roimh an tsolúbthacht sin, i ndáiríre cad is féidir linn a rá faoin Creat Airgeadais Ilbhliantúil seachas: Plus ça change?

I am pleased that we have succeeded in getting the revision of the multiannual financial framework through and that the European Parliament has succeeded in achieving this mid-term review for the first time. Because even then the European Parliament was right in making this request. It was already apparent in 2013 that the tasks for the EU would increase, and it is not the case that more and more political tasks could be done with less and less money. Nor is that true because some finance ministers occasionally claim so. If we want to stimulate growth and employment, then we need more investment in research and innovation - that has been achieved. If we want to give the unemployed and young people a perspective, especially in the south of the European Union, then we must continue the European Youth Initiative. We pushed through additional money - if not enough in my opinion. If we want to get the problems of migration under control, then we have to eliminate the causes of flight. Now peace in Syria is not in our hands, but we can make a contribution to providing aid in the neighboring states of Syria. Help is not only needed there. I am thinking of UNRWA, the UN relief agency for the Palestinians. I am thinking of West Africa, where security and economic prospects need to be developed. And here, too, more should be done, and the additional funds that have been decided are at least a start. Finally, the dimension of the refugee movement to Europe has made it necessary to increase the domestic policy efforts considerably. Joint border protection and additional means for integration were such overwhelming challenges that even the narrowest of finance ministers could not ignore these needs. These are just some of the challenges we face today. The European The Bratislava Council decided on a new agenda in the common security and defense policy.Does anyone in this room, who understands anything about this matter, believe that this agenda can be realized in the corset of today's, current financial framework?No, it is clear: the current medium-term financial framework is the cause of the chronic underfunding, so the new medium-term financial framework must change this from 2021 at the latest.It is about new tasks that must mean additional resources - either this or the Member States must find the strength to agree on what the EU should no longer do in the future.And this can be more successful if the Member States start a constructive discussion on the Monti Group's own resources report and finally give Parliament and the European Union what we need.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 398, "date": "2017-04-04.json", "name": "Zbigniew KUŹMIUK", "mepid": "28389", "text": "- Mr Chairman!

First: the EU budget obviously has billions that can be reallocated. That means the EU has too much money. We should change that. Second: The crisis has become very expensive because some EU states have not protected their external borders. If all the illegal migrants hadn't come, it would have been a lot cheaper.

As our world gets smaller, our challenges get larger. It is essential that we work together to find ways to protect and enhance citizens’ lives. The budget funds research into rare diseases, into cancers, into new energy sources – our future world will be shaped by this funding.

I mean by that: investment in job creation; proactive youth policies; instruments designed to reduce the development gap between regions; digital skills programmes; and the list may continue.  I am not referring here only to numbers, I am referring here to the political message that the Council and the Commission are sending to European citizens by this revision. The message is that the EU does not have any new solutions. We seem blocked in the austerity mentality. We take money from one pocket to put in another pocket, hoping we will not need them any more, like the EUR 2 billion ‘possible’ unused funds from the Solidarity Fund and the Globalisation Fund we hope to reshuffle. I am a former entrepreneur but also a Social Democrat and I can tell you for a fact that if you want fresh money you need to invest more in the things that can help your business grow. In this sense we, the Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, want to help, therefore we support the plan to reinforce with almost EUR 1 billion the growth and jobs programmes, like Horizon 2020, Connecting Europe Facility, Erasmus+, COSME, Wifi4EU and even EFSI, but we need fresh money. We need to think ahead especially for the next MFF. If we want to plan for the future I do not understand why we are only allocating EUR 700 million to the Youth Employment Initiative for the next few years. This represents a lot less than what we are spending as European institutions on IT and digital services. Two million young people, true pro-Europeans, have benefited from the Youth Employment Initiative since its creation. People do not have maybe the time to focus so much on numbers but they are surely focusing on the political message, and the political message that I want to send today as a true pro-European is that the European Parliament is thinking about them.

For us, the most important thing - and it came with great difficulty - was to convince the Council (I think a big thank you to the Slovak Presidency, but also to the Maltese Presidency) with very much help from the European Commission that the financial perspective is not something that is rigid. It was crucial for us to show that if there are new challenges and tasks, there is a chance or even a need for change. I think this is crucial in the whole matter. On the one hand, of course, there are additional financial resources, but above all, it is important that the European Union budget is flexible, so that it can react to external actions. On the other hand, it seems to me that in the debate on the revision, we made it clear what can be done within the European budget. Unfortunately, it is impossible to do everything within the framework of the European budget, and it makes no sense to lie to the inhabitants of the European Union to the contrary. This revision clearly showed what we can and cannot do, how we can do it more efficiently, effectively, wisely, and to what extent we are ready for change.

This must be close to a record: money market funds (MMFs) have been held up for more than three years and four Council presidencies, because it is one of the most contentious and complex pieces of legislation we have ever dealt with. It has been a long journey, but I am delighted we have reached the right destination, an overall agreement between Parliament and the Council. I believe this is a win-win, both for the European money market fund sector and for the European taxpayer, who will be better protected. With assets under management of around EUR 1 trillion, MMFs are an important source of short-term financing for financial institutions, corporations and governments. In Europe, around 22% of short-term debt securities issued by governments or by the corporate sector are held by MMFs. Money market funds hold 38% of the short debt issued by the banking sector.  Because of the systemic inter-connectedness between MMFs, the banking sector and corporate and government finance, their operation has been at the core of international work on shadow banking. As a result, MMFs have been scrutinised by various regulators and supervisors. Indeed, the financial crisis of 2007-2008 showed that MMFs can be vulnerable to shocks and may even spread or amplify risks. This can fuel an investor run and liquidity crisis, foreign MMFs potentially triggering negative effects on other parts of the financial system. The agreement we have reached under the Slovak Presidency that we will vote on tomorrow addresses these systemic concerns, in particular through the following measures: liquidity and diversification requirements are strengthened, with strict daily and weekly liquidity requirements to fulfil potential redemption requests, and furthermore, the MMF portfolio will be more diversified, with stringent concentration requirements to reduce risks; assets in which MMFs can invest, including government debt, have been more strictly regulated; sponsored support to these funds is forbidden, to avoid any contagion risk; we have addressed provisions for transparency in more detail; a review clause for government CNAVs has been introduced; after five years, the Commission will report on the feasibility of establishing an 80% EU public debt quota; the report will look at the availability of short—term EU public debt instruments... I could go on – a stringent regime of fees and gates in the case of shortfalls in liquidity will address the question of run risk, and we will limit the use of the amortised accounting method for the valuation of assets. I am particularly pleased that, apart from existing MMF models, a viable operation model for LVNAV MMFs has been introduced at Parliament’s initiative, and I believe that the run risk compared to the CNAV is significantly lower. The LVNAV cannot deviate by more than 20 points from the NAV and is far stricter than 50 basis points. This is a compromise, and I prefer a compromise which regulates the sector over no agreement and leaving an unregulated MMF sector, and it is in line with the international commitments we have made. Colleagues, politics is a team sport, and you cannot make agreements in isolation. Let me therefore say a word of thanks to the shadow rapporteurs, Brian Hayes, Petr Ježek, Syed Kamall, Eva Joly and Fabio De Masi, and to the President of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, Roberto Gualtieri, for his political support and to Kamil Sasko, who led the negotiations on behalf of the Council. I would also like to thank the ECON secretariat and the S&amp;D secretariat and the policy advisers. I believe this agreement is an important step forward in ensuring the long—term stability of our financial markets. The EU has been lagging behind, as I have said, on international commitments that we have, which the US already implemented 18 months ago. I hope, colleagues, I can rely on your overwhelming support tomorrow and that would send a clear signal and a welcome political signal that we are capable of adopting a strong, harmonised, regulatory framework ensuring financial stability and that investors get well protected all over the EU.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PSE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "PSE"}, {"id": 424, "date": "2017-04-04.json", "name": "Valdis DOMBROVSKIS", "mepid": "28618", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission. – Mr President, honourable Members, money market funds have been at the core of international work on shadow banking due to their vulnerability to investor runs on redemptions and the interconnectedness to their issuers and sponsor banks. So your vote tomorrow will be an important in finalising one of the last dossiers relating to the post-crisis reform agenda.  It is an important achievement that took more than three years of very difficult and contentious negotiations. I would therefore like to thank the European Parliament, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and in particular rapporteur Neena Gill on their ongoing commitment to achieving these results. In our view the compromise reached on most of the contentious issues is well balanced. I am talking about the removal of the sunset clause on low volatility net asset value (LVNAV) MMFs, the inclusion of the public debt in the liquidity buckets, and the non-automaticity of the review of the feasibility of the EU debt quota for public debt constant net asset value (CNAV) MMFs which will be taking place in five years. We think that the proposed framework strikes an appropriate balance between addressing the vulnerabilities of money market funds while maintaining them as a viable product. Money market funds can therefore continue to play their important role of on the one hand providing short-term funding to companies, in particular SMEs, and on the other hand diversifying portfolios for investors. We also welcome the co-legislators’ decision to further strengthen the Commission’s proposal by banning sponsor support entirely, therefore further reducing the contagion risk between money market funds and the banking sector.

I am glad that we have achieved what I regard as a balanced agreement, on the one hand recognising the potential systemic risk and threat that can in a worst-case scenario come from money market funds, while at the same time, recognising the intrinsic value of these short-term financial instruments to businesses up and down the European Union. I think we have come along way from the original Commission proposal which essentially proposed a 3% buffer, which could at one glance have knocked out, in my own country, EUR 400 billion worth of domiciled funds as a consequence of that very harsh proposal.  We have all compromised in this proposal. We recognise the importance of money market funds for businesses in terms of short-term financing needs, and we also recognise that we are behind the United States, who have already put in place a regulation to deal with this issue. But I should say, as I said in the course of the trilogues, the problem was not in Europe, it was in the United States of America.  I think great political skill was shown by the rapporteur and her team, with my own team, and indeed the team from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON) in devising this particular solution. We have a framework that allows CNAVs, VNAVs and LVNAVs to coexist together. We have liquidity buffers in place, we have diversification, we have escalated procedures in place, improved transparency, the sunset clause is gone which I am delighted about, and we also have a very strong review when it comes to the question of government CNAVs, but the government CNAVs remain in place.

This is the reason why in 2012 and 2013, the Financial Stability Board and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) indicated that we had to legislate in this area on the subject of constant value money market funds (CNAV), which played a systemic role in the contribution of parallel finance to the crisis.

We will ensure that CNAV funds in particular are more closely linked to the variations in market value of their assets, through conversion into low volatility NAV funds. This will increase investor protection and reduce the risk of a systemic impact in the event of another crisis. At the same time LVNAVs will maintain those characteristics which make the currency most attractive to certain types of investors, such as same-day settlement and simplicity of tax treatment. There are many further measure us in the text which will help ensure that money market funds continue to serve their purpose in markets while being subject to a strong regulatory regime.

We are talking about EUR 1 trillion of money market funds investment in Europe. These funds have become a vital cash management tool for many types of businesses, local authorities, NGOs and universities. Therefore they benefit all of us. Unfortunately, the financial crisis revealed that this short-term investment instrument can pose some systemic risks. Therefore, I welcome the fact that the European Parliament and the Council, after very long and difficult negotiations, have created for the first time a European regulatory framework for money market funds. In congratulating Neena Gill and the shadow rapporteurs on their work, I want to underline that this highly important piece of legislation that we will now have will make money market funds more resilient to crisis and more transparent, money market funds which can contribute to bridging the investment gap in Europe which is something we, together with the Commission, are striving to achieve. Moreover, stable money market funds will be helpful in creating the Capital Market Union.  To name only a few of the various positive aspects of this document, I do appreciate that this regulation ensures that in the future there will be no run risk. Thanks to the uniform rules on the portfolio of money market funds, we will be protected from the situations when investors would withdraw their money simultaneously. Money market funds will be obliged to invest in higher quality assets and will not be able to rely on external support. It is crucial for money market funds to avoid over-reliance on external ratings and introduce the internal risk credit assessment by managers.

The only way forward was to go back and suggest that we stick with a proposal that could not actually get any kind of agreement in Parliament itself. I think it is important that we recognise that the way we could move forward was to find some kind of compromise, and compromises are difficult, they do not tick all the boxes, but they do mean that we find a solution that basically works for most parts of the sector.

The Commission’s proposal aimed to modernise the Prospectus Directive by making it less costly for businesses to raise funds publicly, review regulatory barriers to small firms listing on equity and debt markets, and support the listing activities of small firms. In the European Parliament, we took these objectives seriously and came forward with a number of innovations to make the Prospectus Regulation more fitting to the current environment. These included increasing the thresholds under which issuers would benefit from exemptions from the regulations, as well as the concept of an EU growth prospectus, a lighter regime which will help facilitate cross-border issuances for smaller companies. During the trilogue negotiations under the Slovak Presidency, we were able to fine-tune our positions and come to an agreement on a text which, I believe, will be of benefit to all issuers who want to raise funding on the markets.  In particular, we increase to EUR 1 million the amount under which issuers would be exempted from the requirements of the Regulation. This will benefit growth funding ventures in Europe, in particular helping them to raise capital without red tape standing in their way. We agreed on the EU growth prospectus, a bold new concept which will reduce costs for SMEs wishing to raise funds on a cross-border basis. The EU growth prospectus will facilitate access to capital for small issuers and encourage them to seek funding from capital markets, rather than a continued over-reliance on bank funding. We supported a shorter prospectus and summary. Under the new regime, we will reduce costs for issuers and increase readability and relevance of information for investors, leading to increased investor protection. We made it simple for companies to carry out secondary issuances with a streamlined procedure. We minimise national exemptions and discretion, which will increase harmonisation and competition within the internal market. In my view, this is what capital market union should be about. We need to have harmonised measures across the EU, reduce red tape for companies, ensure investor protection, and, most of all, stimulate the growth of capital markets in Europe. Unlocking finances for SMEs and making it easier for them to access capital markets will benefit the European economy as a whole and help it to grow, which is something we desperately need in these uncertain times across the globe.  May I conclude by thanking the shadow rapporteurs, the Commission and the Slovak Presidency for their hard work and dedication to completing an ambitious reform of the prospectus regime.

The reform of the prospectus rules delivers on a key element of the Capital Markets Union Action Plan.  After 12 years of a harmonised set of prospectus rules, it was time to make the EU prospectus fit for the Capital Markets Union. In preparing the 2016 prospectus reform we have listened to issuers, investors and market operators and decided to go much further than the last reform that took place in 2010. The new rules that you will hopefully agree to will introduce an entirely new EU growth prospectus, a higher threshold while Member States can rely on local listing rules only, a new registration document for frequent issuers and enormous simplification for secondary issuances. Let me briefly present the key achievements introduced by the new Prospectus Regulation. The EU Growth prospectus is designed as a key ingredient for developing the SME growth markets introduced by MiFID II. Both SMEs and mid-caps can use this simple prospectus to raise capital on SME Growth Markets. Many well-functioning ‘junior’ markets of today can become the SME Growth Markets of the future.  The new prospectus threshold will be almost doubled to EUR 8 million, compared to the previous EUR 5 million. For offerings below that threshold, Member States can rely on local listing rules issued by the operators of junior growth markets, which can support the development of local or regional stock exchanges for small companies. Issuers already admitted to the regulated markets and SME growth markets will benefit from a lighter prospectus for their ‘follow-up’ – or secondary – issuances. The alleviations for follow-up issuances reflect the fact that these companies are well-known in the market. About 70% of all equity prospectuses approved annually concern follow-up, so-called ‘secondary issuances’. Our impact assessment estimates potential savings for well—known issuers to amount to no less than EUR 130 million annually. Finally, the introduction of a Universal Registration Document (URD) for frequent issuers will trigger a ‘fast track’ approval of five days, instead of the statutory limit of 10 days. The URD, therefore, has the potential to decrease approval times considerably and allow issuers to seize market windows at short notice.

We can react to this with fear, or we can use this wake-up call to move up a gear in setting up a European capital markets union. Europe needs investment. But first of all, the investment climate must improve drastically. The new prospectus legislation is an important piece of this puzzle. European companies today are still too dependent on bank financing. Only 20% of them raise money from investors. That is a significant under-utilization of the growth potential that additional resources provide through the capital markets. Especially for SMEs, the step to the capital market often seems too big. An important barrier to this is the high cost of a prospectus. Under the current rules, prospectuses have become true telephone directories in which the prospective investors can no longer find their way. The new legislation will make drawing up a prospectus a lot easier and cheaper. Issues below 1 million will even be completely exempt. For SMEs, mid-caps on SME growth markets and certain smaller issues of up to 20 million, a lighter EU growth prospectus will be introduced, as already mentioned. With this we help promising companies to climb the financing ladder and raise the capital they need to continue to grow. The prospectus regulation offers a unique opportunity to make it a lot easier for SMEs and growing companies to raise money. But that is far from done our work for a European capital markets union. Likewise, the proposal for more efficient insolvency and restructuring procedures, for which I am responsible in the ECON Committee, must be tackled with the same unity and speed.

For me and my group it fulfils many of our priorities: reducing legal costs and red tape, reducing fragmentation of practices amongst Member States, unlocking liquidity from institutional investors, harmonising investor protection rules and avoiding a race to the bottom across Member States.  A key proposal that my group was instrumental in getting agreed is the proposal of the SME growth prospectus, which means that SMEs in the EU will be able to use one standard harmonised document to raise capital, a major step forward compared to the current system. Based on this simple document, SMEs will be able to follow an easy process to raise funds across the EU. Importantly, this legislation will also allow for crowdfunding and other new forms of financing to develop European capital markets.  Prospectuses are a gateway to the capital markets. However, it is also vital that issuers based in third countries can continue to access EU capital markets. To enable the Capital Markets Union (CMU) to be a success, non—EU Member States should be able to invest. Critically, given the impending departure of the UK, it could be detrimental to availability of capital for SMEs, given that the UK accounts for 60% of the EU capital markets business. This is a serious consequence and CMU is in danger of becoming CMU-lite in terms of delivering jobs and growth in the future of the EU 27. Therefore prospectuses approved by non-EU countries fulfilling equivalence requirements could be used in the future in the EU.

I want to congratulate the rapporteur and all of the shadow rapporteurs for their work on this file and indeed their discussions with the Council and the Commission in the course of the last number of months. Making it easier and cheaper for companies, especially SMEs, to raise capital within the markets and to go public ensures that European companies can grow and prosper in a sustainable way. We do have a real problem in Europe with our over-reliance on banking finance. As I have said repeatedly, 75% of lending in the EU comes from our banks and 25% from the capital markets. In the United States, it is the opposite.  This agreement signals a strengthening and deepening of our capital markets in Europe. For example, the new growth prospectus regime will boost the ability of small and growing companies to raise money across the whole single market, according to one common framework.  There are legacy issues from the previous Prospectus Directive. While it was working relatively well, it did not enable a truly strong functioning single market to exist. It created some legal uncertainty and imposed some burdensome requirements, leading to increased cost and the creation of inefficiencies. The existing regime allows Member States to transpose the directive in their own way, which led to 28 separate regimes, and I am glad the Commission decided to issue the new regime as a regulation. This created proper harmonisation because it was much needed.  I also want to welcome the different regimes that have been created for frequent users and for secondary issuances. This will ensure the entire industry benefits from a lighter prospectus regime.

For companies, the prospectus is a gateway to the capital markets, making them logical and to the point, understandable to potential investors, and by reducing red tape. That is good. This is a step towards a genuine Capital Market Union, but many more steps are needed. This includes, of course, securitisation, which could get stuck in trilogue, unless the Council is willing to discuss the issues that are raised by the European Parliament. I really look forward to that moment.  To conclude, the midterm review needs to come up with more, even bolder, steps to move towards agreeing a genuine Capital Market Union.

I believe, of course, like all colleagues, that the aim of the capital markets union is to find sources of financing, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises. This means transparency and informing the public through the newsletter. Eliminating bureaucracy is also important, especially for public offerings worth less than € 5 million. However, Mr Dombrovskis, I would like to ask you a question, because recital 9 of the report explicitly states that non-equity securities issued by Member States, issued by regional authorities, local authorities, international organizations involving one or more Union States, therefore the ESM, the EFSF and possibly the EFSM are not obliged to comply with this Regulation, as are the European Central Bank and the central banks of the Member States. Why is there such an exception, Mr Dombrovskis? We would like an answer.
